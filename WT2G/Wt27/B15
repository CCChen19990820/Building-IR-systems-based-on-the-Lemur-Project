<H2>INTEL07:  Improve Support to Ground Troops During Combat 
Operations</H2>
<p>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>
Numerous "lessons learned" studies conducted after the Gulf War pointed 
to the need for a framework or process to provide necessary intelligence 
support to combat operations. The problem is that while there are 
numerous service- and agency-unique studies, there is no single 
comprehensive picture of operations/com-bat arms needs and expectations. 
The following partial list illustrates the fragmented nature of the 
approach to this problem to date:
<p>
--- Project Grandslam (National Security Agency)
<p>
--- Project Talon Sword (Air Force Space Command)
<p>
--- Project Fastball (Air Combat Command)
<p>
--- Project Radiant Oak (Navy)
<p>
--- 1991 Scientific Advisory Board Summer Study (Air Force)
<p>
--- Joint Air Defense Operations - Joint Engagement Zone or JADO-JEZ 
(Joint Chiefs)
<p>
--- Intelligence Requirements Survey (Defense Intelligence Agency)
<p>
--- AFIC Pilot Study (Air Force)
<p>
--- Capabilities Analysis Wartime Support Study (National Security 
Agency) 
<p>
--- Intelligence for Targeting Plan (Department of Defense/Director of 
Central Intelligence)
<p>
The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board voiced similar 
concerns in a memorandum to the President in April 1992: "Inadequate 
dissemination of product to tactical users was one of the most serious 
shortcomings of the Gulf crisis. And while we are encouraged by efforts 
throughout the Intelligence Community to rectify this problem, their 
pace, scope, and Ôjointness' have not been altogether reassuring."
<p>
A reinvention lab should be created to produce recommendations for 
ensuring seamless, usable battlefield intelligence    support to ground 
forces for combat applications. This lab would produce prioritized 
recommendations in the areas of policy, procedures, resource 
allocations, data, and products. When adopted by the intelligence and/or 
operations communities, these recommendations will result in increased 
effectiveness and efficiencies in battlefield intelligence support for 
combat applications. Some of the lab's recommendations will identify 
existing and future technologies that could be useful in meeting this 
objective.  
<p>
A reinvention lab addressing the issue of improving the quality and flow 
of intelli-gence to ground forces in combat operations will benefit both 
the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community (IC). Some of 
the lab's recommendations will identify existing and future technologies 
that could be useful in meeting this objective; however, focus should be 
on increasing intelligence efficiencies within existing fiscal 
constraints.
<p>
For the purpose of this lab, an Operations Support Core Group should be 
formed comprising members of the operations/combat arms and intelligence 
communities, representing a cross-section of the parties affected. The 
Director, Central Intelligence, should appoint an individual from 
outside the Intelligence Community to lead the group; the Director, 
Defense Intelligence Agency, should act as Executive Secretary. The 
Operations Support Core Group should not exceed 60 members, and should 
include the following:
<p>
--- National Security Council;
<p>
--- Office of the Secretary of Defense, including the Assistant 
Secretary for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence;
<p>
--- Joint Chiefs of Staff, including the Directors for Intelligence, 
Operations, and Command, Control, Communications and Computers;
<p>
--- Central Intelligence Agency, including the Central Imagery Office;
<p>
--- National Security Agency;
<p>
--- Operational and Intelligence representatives from each of the 
military services (both officer and enlisted);
<p>
--- Other Defense organizations, including the National Reconnaissance 
Office, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense Mapping 
Agency, and the Defense Information Systems Agency;
<p>
--- Other advisers from outside the IC with experience in combat 
operations and intelligence.
<p>
Existing lessons-learned studies and many related test programs and 
high-value demonstrations should serve as input to the lab, as should 
the lessons learned from Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Provide 
Comfort, and Provide Promise (ongoing). The information from these 
efforts should be sufficient foundation for a diverse group of experts 
from the operational military and Intelligence Community to construct a 
comprehensive framework for optimizing intelligence support to ground 
forces in combat. 
<p>
For the purposes of this study, the battlefield users of intelligence 
will be defined as those personnel who have immediate control over 
weapons platforms or whose safety may be jeopardized without real-time 
threat information concerning enemy intentions.
<p>
While there have been many recent success stories regarding improving 
intelligence to the warfighter, the lack of correlation in the process, 
the absence of integration of usable intelligence with information 
already resident on weapons platforms, and the failure to 
institutionalize the process have made these only isolated successes. 
Five criteria need to be met if adequate and appropriate intelligence 
support is to reach the battlefield:
<p>
1. Battlefield intelligence must be a usable product presented in a form 
the warfighter or "shooter" can use. 
<p>
2. The process for making highly classified information available for an 
"event-triggered requirement" must flow smoothly from the highest levels 
in the IC through the theater command to the battlefield itself. 
<p>
3. The intelligence product cycle must be shorter than the operation 
cycle. 
<p>
4. There must be methodologies in place for not only establishing 
operational military requirements and needs but also developing an 
intelligence tasking process. These standing methodologies can then be 
refined in near real-time to meet combat-specific needs. In addition, 
mechanisms to give the IC feedback on how useful its information is must 
be put in place. 
<p>
5. Interoperability of the different information handling systems 
receiving intelligence must be improved.
<p>
Of paramount importance in addressing these criteria is defining who the 
battlefield user of intelligence is in all forms (tank driver to fighter 
pilot). Intelligence needs differ throughout the chain of command. 
Intelligence needs also differ during the various stages of an 
engagement from strategic warning, tactical warning, initial contact 
with the enemy, and heavy engagement.  
<p>
The reinvention lab should: (1) identify minimum essential battlefield 
user's intelligence requirements to support ground combat operations; 
(2) assess the IC's capability to meet those needs, and identify any 
shortfalls; (3) assess the ability of the communications and acquisition 
communities to meet the solutions for changes to policy, procedures, or 
technology to satisfy shortfalls. Fiscal implications should be provided 
whenever possible for each recommendation; and (5) prioritize the 
recommendations.
<p>

<b>Actions</b>
<p>
1. The Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
and the Director of Central Intelligence should establish a reinvention 
lab to address these issues.
<p>
2. The Secretary of Defense and the DCI should appoint a small group of 
neutral monitors to coach the process.
<p>
These monitors should work full-time for the duration of the lab, not to 
exceed 12 months. These monitors should adhere to the methodology 
outlined in the classified version of this report.
<p>
3. The reinvention lab will report its findings to the Secretary of 
Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Director of 
Central Intelligence in September 1994.

<H2>The Intelligence Community</H2>
<p>
<H3>Agency Reinvention Activities</H3>
<p>
<HR><P>
The Intelligence Community (IC) has been implementing substantial change 
in every dimension of its business. Some of these re-  engineering 
efforts are based on IC-wide task force analyses of internal processes; 
others are in response to the recent geo-strategic and technologic 
changes in the national and international environment. Many of the 
examples show the IC to be forward-leaning and willing to take bold 
steps away from the limitations of the past. Agencies have recognized 
the need to change the way they relate to and understand traditional and 
emerging customers as shown in the specific examples below. IC and 
agency-specific process reinvention efforts follow, listed under the 
heading Process Change. The following list of reinvention steps are part 
of the IC's effort to forge a mix of analytical, collection, and support 
resources. These resources will meet the challenges of evolving customer 
needs within severely limited budget constraints. 
<p>

<b>Customer-Focused Change</b>
<p>
The Central Imagery Office (CIO) was established as a joint DOD-IC 
organization in 1992 to provide responsive support to DOD, the IC, other 
federal government departments and agencies, and the civil sector. It is 
charged with transforming the frag-mented imagery pieces into an 
integrated United States Imagery System. To that end, the CIO is 
developing an imagery architecture to help balance capabilities and 
capacities across all elements of the imagery cycle. It will also be 
used to support imagery use at all operational levels. 
<p>
The Classification Review Task Force (CRTF), led by the CIO, is a zero-
based review of security policy for all national imagery and imagery-
derived information. The goal of CRTF is to develop imagery security 
policy that supports maximum use of imagery by customers while 
protecting truly sensitive sources and methods. 
<p>
The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has taken a leadership role in 
using new technologies to support customers. The Joint Worldwide 
Intelligence Communi-cations System (JWICS) and the Joint Deployable 
Intelligence Support System (JDISS) are widely recognized as leading-
edge applications of information technology. These technologies have 
been major catalysts in the expanding customer support relationship with 
the United Nations and its peacekeeping activities. 
<p>
The Department of Energy Office of Intelligence has established a 
process of designating intelligence representatives to each of the 
functional areas in the department. This ensures timely and accurate 
identification of the customers' needs and focused responses. 
<p>
The Treasury's Office of Intelligence Support has substantially expanded 
its customer base without an increase in resources. The office is now 
servicing officials in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and 
the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
<p>
The National Security Agency (NSA) is aggressively pursuing better 
access to its customers through improving reporting formats and the 
integration of senior agency representatives and analysts in customer 
activities. Formats for reporting range from the highly technical report 
(which moves from producer to consumer in a matter of seconds) to the 
very detailed and focused International Trade and Finance Summary. 
<p>
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), using off-the-shelf technology, 
developed a PC-based remote publishing system. This system enabled the 
CIA to support President-elect Clinton and Vice President-elect Gore 
with full scale daily intelligence briefings in Little Rock, Arkansas, 
and at other locations during the transition period. CIA has reduced to 
two the number of hardcover publications sent to consumers. At the same 
time, desktop publishing has allowed offices to tailor products for 
consumers, resulting in better service at no extra cost and in a very 
timely manner. Also, the downgrading and release of agency documents of 
historical interest has been accelerated. Over 200 CIA personnel are 
serving in customer organizations, including National Programs, as 
intelligence representatives, advisers, and staff support personnel. The 
CIA has also established an Associate Deputy Director for Operations for 
Military Affairs to better coordinate support and collaboration with 
military customers. The CIA also has taken steps to either declassify or 
lower the controlling caveats on several sectors of its reporting for 
use by military and regulatory/enforcement customers. 
<p>
As a part of the effort to refocus its activities from Cold War targets 
to the emerging priority issues of the 1990s, the CIA is providing 
increasing support to government organizations. These organizations 
include the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, and Energy and the 
Environmental Protection Agency, as well as to multilateral bodies such 
as the United Nations. That support includes, among other things, 
information on the environment, including hurricanes, volcanic 
eruptions, floods, and oil spills proliferation, and economic and 
competitiveness issues. The private sector also benefits from some of 
that information. For example, the foreign public media information 
collected by CIA provides a growing volume of highly valuable 
information not only to government organizations but to the private 
sector via Commerce's National Technical Information Service as well. 
This includes information on trade policy, economic and technological 
competitive-ness, environmental pollution, and other important issues. 
The CIA produces 25,000 copies of the World Factbook, which has become 
an important source of basic information to other U.S. government 
agencies and private sector businesses. The Government Printing Office 
routinely sells some 5,000 copies of each edition at $25 each. In 
addition, several private firms buy the book and then convert it to CD-
ROM for sale to their customers. Because of their efforts, it is the 
ninth most popular CD in the world. 
<p>
Army intelligence will build and maintain the ARGUS database to further 
the Central MASINT (measurement and signature intelligence) Office 
mission to interconnect all DOD and national intelligence interests into 
a single common and unified MASINT database with various levels of 
access. Community members will have access to MASINT requirements and 
the collections made against them with the option to select specific 
hardcopy or tapes. ARGUS will be available in fiscal 1998. The Army's 
automated intelligence production management system is being expanded by 
DIA into a future Department of Defense intelligence information 
management system that has broader IC application. 
<p>

<b>Process Change-- The Community</b>
<p>
The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) is implementing an improved 
IC resource management system that links needs to resources using a 
four-step process improvement plan. The four major components of this 
plan are:
<p>
--- Implementation of the National Intelligence Needs Process, which 
will provide a more effective basis for assessing customer needs and 
permit a more rational allocation of resources against those needs.
<p>
--- Implementation of a more systematic IC-wide planning process, which 
will start with a clear statement of objectives.
<p>
--- Implementing changes to the Capabilities Programming and Budgeting 
System, which will make National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP) 
programming and budgeting more closely parallel that of the DOD 
Planning, Programming, and Budget System.
<p>
--- Implementation of a rigorous IC performance assessment process. The 
National Intelligence Council (NIC), with assistance from Community 
Management Staff (CMS), will identify shortfalls and gaps in current 
collection, production, and other intelligence support in key areas of 
concern to customers. 
<p>

The following lists some examples of IC initiatives designed to bolster 
an already growing spirit of cooperation within the IC:
<p>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has implemented the National 
Security Threat List (NSTL) concept for prioritizing counterintelligence 
targets. The NSTL, now widely adopted throughout the counterintelligence 
community, reinvented the approach to counterintelligence as a result of 
world changes and in anticipation of the changing needs of the 
Community. The Counterintelligence Representative to the National 
Security Council also was recently revalidated by the President. 
<p>
In addressing the accelerating volume of available information, the 
Army's Project PATHFINDER provides a collection of analytical tools that 
helps the user navigate through voluminous data and accomplish routine 
tasks significantly faster (days vs. weeks) and with greater accuracy. 
To date, Project PATHFINDER is used by over 200 analysts in 18 
government agencies.
<p>
To avoid unnecessary duplication among the IC's scheduled intelligence 
products, the National Intelligence Producers Board (NIPB) has initiated 
joint reviews of annual production agendas. The NIPB will also hold 
quarterly follow-up reviews to accommodate changes in the production 
plans. In addition, the production community is making greater use of 
the "lead agency" concept to reduce duplication and orchestrate current 
intelligence support on selected problems and issues. 
<p>
A DCI Environmental Task Force was created to expose key non-
intelligence elements of the government and 70 prominent environmental 
scientists to intelligence collection capabilities. It was also to test 
the applicability of these capabilities to environmental issues. The 
task force completed its interim report in May 1993. The report states 
that a large number of assets have the potential to contribute 
significantly to our understanding of the environment.
<p>
CIA, DIA, and NSA recently took a major step forward in breaking down a 
significant barrier to Community coordination by establishing a policy 
of employee badge reciprocity. Employees can now work with their 
counterparts and attend confer-ences and training in one another's 
facilities without the hindrance of redundant security processing. CIA, 
DIA, and NSA have also established a Rotational Exchange Program to 
foster career development of intelligence officers by providing 
rotational assignment opportunities within the IC. 
<p>
NSA, DIA, CIA and the Services are now jointly manning the National 
Military Joint Intelligence Center. This promotes better coordination of 
IC-wide support to national contingency and crisis operations and 
eliminates redundant watch operations. 
<p>
The DCI Interagency Balkan Task Force is an excellent example of how the 
IC's resources can be brought together in support of a foreign policy 
crisis. The Task Force has been in existence since June 1992, and 
includes representatives from CIA, DIA, NSA, and the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff (JCS). By bringing together collectors, intelligence analysts, and 
policy analysts, the task force provides the senior policymaker with 
one-stop shopping when requesting IC assessment on various U.S. policy 
initiatives or an enhanced IC collection effort against a particular 
target. 
<p>

<b>Process Change--Agencies</b>
<p>
DIA/GDIP. The Director of DIA, as the program manager of the General 
Defense Intelligence Program (GDIP), is striving to create a functional, 
coherent enterprise that will promote increased integration between 
budgets and organizational jurisdictions. Services and activities within 
the GDIP are realigning and reorganizing activities across the board. 
<p>
In DIA, National Military Centers for collection, production, and 
infrastructure have been created. These organizations will have 
functional issue managers that will span the GDIP and align with the 
services, which will have national centers on ground, maritime, and 
aerospace issues. The reorganization of DIA has been described as a 
cultural change. The most comprehensive reorganization of DIA since the 
end of the Cold War, it deals with the "spiritual aspects" of the 
organization rather than merely shifting office symbols. The overall 
objectives were to reduce the ratio of support positions to substantive 
positions to 25:75, reduce management positions by 30 percent, 
restructure the organization along functional lines, enhance 
responsiveness to military operational requirements, and expand the 
organization's focus on IC management issues. Resources of the Unified 
and Specified Command Joint Intelligence Centers have been realigned to 
make them more responsive to a different world with changing 
requirements. As a result, nearly 500 billets were realigned and some 
300 reduced. 
<p>
CIA. CIA has merged four components in the Directorate of Operations 
into two. The merger of the Directorate of Science and Technology 
Offices of SIGINT Operations and Special Projects is under way. 
Implementation plans are being drawn up to merge the Office of Imagery 
Analysis/ Directorate of Intelligence into the National Photographic 
Interpretation Center. 
<p>
Approximately one-third of CIA's components have undergone major 
restructuring over the past three years. Nine have experienced the loss 
of one or more divisions or groups. Ten others have comprehensively 
reorganized to better align capabilities and services with changing 
demands. Reorganizations, along with a general search for efficiencies 
and flexibility, permitted reduction of management layering. The 
Directorate of Intelligence, for example, has eliminated more than 15 
percent of its management positions since 1991. 
<p>
In another example, a division within the Directorate of Operations 
reorganized itself around six key strategic issues and integrated 
collectors and analysts in a successful effort to improve service to the 
customer. Central to the process was an in-depth interactive dialogue 
with all of its customers and an exhaustive analysis of work flow, 
variances, and quality of work life. The goal was to design an 
organization that is quality oriented and responsive to customer needs, 
and provides a strong focus for job satisfaction and challenge to its 
personnel.
<p>
In the Office of Leadership Analysis in the Directorate of Intelligence, 
the wiring diagram of the organization was symbolically destroyed at an 
all-hands meeting. A task force of employees representing all levels and 
all disciplines developed a process to establish ongoing reinvention as 
customers' needs and demands change, downsizing continues, and resources 
are realigned. 
<p>
In the Office of Information Technology, 99 out of 100 recommendations 
made by 18 Quality Teams were adopted. This resulted in savings and cost 
avoidance of 61 staff labor-years and $3.5 million. 
<p>
The CIA has developed the framework for a commercial credit card program 
designed to simplify small purchase procedures by offering an 
alternative to the use of purchase orders, delivery orders, blanket 
purchase agreements, etc. In addition to reducing the administrative 
costs, the program will result in less paperwork and improve lead times. 
<p>

NSA. NSA has embraced the Total Quality Management (TQM) process since 
the late 1980s. Over 100 teams have yielded the following improvements:
<p>
--- Reduced the time needed to install computers and networks from over 
100 days to just 14 days.
<p>
--- Saved over $2 million annually by streamlining the bill-paying 
process.
<p>
--- Improved in-house manufacturing yields of leading-edge technology 
printed circuit boards by 50 percent.
<p>
--- Reduced stock purchases by $25 million annually.
<p>
--- Increased the in-processing rate for supplies and materials 
deliveries by 20 percent monthly with no increase in staff or budget.
<p>
--- Reduced the average time to award certain classes of contracts by 40 
percent. 
<p>

Army. Army Intelligence has undertaken many system and process 
improvements to enable the Army to make informed decisions; develop 
optimum investment strategies; react to changing requirements, threats, 
and resources; and better meet the needs of the military commanders. 
Such special applications as providing high-volume, time-sensitive 
intelligence products to theater and unit levels, consolidating science 
and technology and general military intelligence at one location, and 
improving the timeliness and accuracy of Army requirements validation, 
tasking, and reporting are but three examples of many system and process 
improvements. 
<p>

Navy. The Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) has taken considerable 
strides in consolidating and streamlining its intelligence processes. 
Since January 1993, the Naval Intelligence Command has been eliminated, 
thus creating a more directly responsive organization. ONI has 
reorganized into eight major directorates, each having direct access to 
the Director of Naval Intelligence. All analytical efforts are now 
contained within one organization. General military intelligence and 
scientific and technical intelligence elements have been merged. By 
1994, ONI will have moved into the new National Maritime Intelligence 
Center in Suitland, Maryland, along with elements from the Coast Guard 
and Marine Corps. 
<p>

DOE. The Department of Energy (DOE) is establishing on-line, secure 
computer-based communications between its headquarters and nine DOE 
national laboratories. This vastly improves the timeliness and 
comprehensiveness of foreign intelligence available at the 
organizations. 
<p>

Department of State. The Bureau of Intelligence and Research's (INR's) 
TIPOFF program uses sensitive intelligence to advise law enforcement and 
intelligence agencies that suspected terrorists have been detected at 
U.S. ports of entry. Since TIPOFF first began providing records to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in June 1991, 50 suspected 
terrorists have been detected arriving at U.S. ports, where INS agents 
were able to take appropriate action.
Intelligence Community Reinvention
<p>
Foreign Language Laboratories. Under sponsorship of the DCI Foreign 
Language Committee, the Community is reinventing foreign language 
training and testing process to share resources and development costs 
across Federal language schools, user intelligence organizations, and 
academia. The Center for Advancement of Language Learning has initiated 
a standardized proficiency testing plan and coordinates development of 
teaching materials for seldom-taught languages such as Arabic, Korean, 
Cantonese and Serno-Croatian. CMS led the quick-reaction development of 
tools for English-only speakers to work with Chinese-only speaking 
aliens in support of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the 
U.S. Coast Guard. The Federal Language Training Laboratory of CIA's 
Office of Training and Education has developed interactive video courses 
in Spanish and Russian and is developing French and Arabic courseware.
<p>
TIPSTER Text Program. This lab is working to better serve the needs of 
its customer--the intelligence analyst. It aims to significantly speed 
the process of finding data (for example, background information on a 
current crisis) from a massive library of multilingual, digitized 
textual material. The tools include software systems for routing 
messages, systems for document retrieval from large archival storage, 
and information extraction systems that automatically scan textual data 
and place specified information into standardized data structures.
<p>
Support to the Combat Operator. This NSA lab examines, documents, and 
improves signals intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities to provide real-time 
information to the combat operator. Working directly with pilots, 
aircrew, and other combat operators, it will develop detailed 
information requirements profiles for different combat missions. This 
will allow the operational military and the IC to determine how to best 
use SIGINT information to enhance overall combat effectiveness.
<p>
Multi-functional Maintenance Teams. This NSA lab is developing programs 
to cross-train maintenance workers so that one worker may now do what 
used to take two (or more). In addition, the lab will test a "building 
manager" approach to provide self-directed teams to each of NSA's six 
buildings. The goal is to respond to customer requests faster, establish 
better customer relations, and provide more personalized service.

<Title>Executive Summary</Title>

<HR>
<p><H2>Department of Interior</H2>
<p> 
<HR>
<p>
<p><H2>Executive Summary</H2>
<p>
<p>
<p>Created in 1849, the Department of the Interior's 
 (DOI) primary mission is to provide stewardship and 
 management of federal lands and natural resources. As 
 the nation's principal conservation agency, DOI has 
 jurisdiction over approximately 450 million acres of 
 public lands which include national parks and 
 monuments, national wildlife refuges, Indian trust 
 territories, and other protected areas.
<p>
<p>To accomplish its current missions, DOI has 
 approximately 77,000 full-time employees located at 
 more than 700 U.S. sites and an operating budget of 
 about $7.58 billion for fiscal year 1994. Prior to 
 1987, DOI collected more in revenue, primarily from 
 offshore oil and gas leases, than it spent.
<p>
<p>Several DOI issues involve stripping away barriers 
 that prevent effective, efficient governance; 
 eliminating federal micromanagement of state and 
 local government; or managing across agency lines 
 through boundary-spanning mechanisms. For example, to 
 address health and safety threats and environmental 
 damage caused by toxic metal and chemical leaching 
 from abandoned mines, the federal government should 
 establish a hard rock mine reclamation fund. 
<p>
<p>Federal oversight of coal mine regulation should be 
 redefined to overcome organizational problems that 
 inhibit an effective state-federal relationship. 
 Using a system of national standards of excellence 
 for regulatory and reclamation programs, establishing 
 goals, performance measures, and an evaluation 
 process, the federal government can improve 
 oversight, develop an appropriate organizational 
 structure, and better evaluate state programs.
<p>
<p>By supporting a cross-agency coordina-ting effort, 
 the federal government can, for example, develop a 
 coherent vision for the national spatial data 
 infrastructure (NSDI), which is essential to critical 
 environmental analysis on endangered species and 
 wetlands. Other cross-agency efforts include the need 
 for the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture 
 and the Director of OMB to modify the process for 
 determining land acquisition priorities and 
 procedures. DOI could then establish a comprehensive 
 pilot program to coordinate the administration of 
 selected federal lands based on principles of 
 ecosystem management.
<p>
<p>The National Park Service (NPS) needs to find new 
 revenues through entrepreneurial management of 
 national parks. By embracing an entrepreneurial 
 management strategy - including reforming the nature, 
 level, and collection of fees; updating concession 
 contracts; and increasing voluntary partnerships - 
 the NPS would enhance the public's enjoyment of the 
 parks and protect them for future generations. 
 Further, reforms are needed to guarantee a fair 
 return for federal resources such as livestock 
 grazing, hard rock mining, and communications sites.
<p>
<p>Better management of DOI's royalty collection program 
 would increase revenues and improve efficiency in 
 DOI's $4.7 million Royalty Management Program (RMP). 
 The RMP should proceed with a vigorous program of 
 compliance verification, develop new computer 
 programs to analyze transactions, and identify and 
 adopt new methods to simplify royalty reporting.
<p>
<p>A change in management philosophy, empowerment of 
 workers, and a cultural transformation is needed to 
 address bureaucratic barriers at DOI. Many of the 
 emerging issues in the department, such as ecosystem 
 management, will require integrated, cross-cutting 
 management approaches. A system of personnel 
 exchanges and in-house contracts across bureau 
 boundaries will help develop cooperative approaches 
 to departmental problems, encourage employee 
 movement, and provide incentives for innovation. In 
 addition, to manage its bureaus effectively, DOI 
 needs to reduce duplicative services. 
<p>
<p>The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) should redefine its 
 mission toward new environmental priorities. As its 
 traditional construction mission ends, BOR must 
 clarify its proper federal role in water management 
 and devolve secondary support functions to state and 
 local authorities. BOR must assist in defining the 
 federal policy for water management in the West and 
 maintain a leadership role in managing completed 
 projects. By the beginning of fiscal year 1995, BOR 
 should develop a new mission which assumes a 
 leadership role in western water policy and focuses 
 on water management functions.
<p>
<p>The federal government also needs to reexamine its 
 role in such programs as the federal helium program. 
 To obtain maximum benefit from helium operations, the 
 federal government should cancel the helium debt, 
 reduce costs and increase efficiencies in helium 
 operations, and increase sales of crude helium as 
 market conditions permit.
<p>
<p>Moreover, the DOI should integrate skills across 
 bureau boundaries in the remediation of its hazardous 
 materials (HAZMAT) sites. The high cost of HAZMAT 
 remediation requires DOI to make maximum use of 
 existing resources. Managerial and scientific 
 expertise should be integrated in cooperative, cross-
 bureau efforts to assess and remediate HAZMAT sites 
 designated as pilot projects. Furthermore, a legal 
 strike force should be established by the end of 1994 
 to address legal barriers to cleanup.
<p>
<p>The most important benefits of implementing the 
 reinvention recommendations cannot be quantified at 
 this time. Improved customer service, greater 
 efficiency, and a better work environment will be the 
 ultimate rewards. Of the benefits that can be 
 quantified, implementing these recommendations would 
 collectively result in $1,605.7 million in new 
 revenues, $277.5 million in new budget authority, and 
 a reduction of 1,471 full-time equivalents over six 
 years.

Redesigning a government that works better and costs less calls for new ideas and creative thinking. 
It also calls for leadership from agency officials; employee empowerment and teamwork; interagency 
cooperation; partnerships with employee unions, state and local governments, and the business community; 
Congressional action; and support from the American people.  We've already done a lot, but our 
achievements are among <A HREF="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/vp-rpt96/index.html">The Best Kept Secrets in Government.</A>
On this page are some of the initiatives and activities that are underway to move us to a customer-friendly, performance-based government for the 21st century.

<BR>
The General Services Administration needs federal workers as volunteers to work with about 30 companies that publish 6,200 phone directories over the nation. 
<P>
Most federal government listings in the telephone directory blue pages read like an agency's organization chart--names of offices, not services. All that is changing. GSA is leading a Reinventing Government effort to improve government blue pages. More than 200 federal employees in 25 federal agencies received the Vice President's Hammer Award on November 15 for their work in phase 1 of the project. All the major phone companies across the country are participating as partners. Within the next few months, 18 million households in 10 cities will see improved blue pages.
<P>
To volunteer, federal workers should contact Jack Finley at (202) 501-3932 or e-mail: <A HREF="mailto:jack.finley@fed.gov"> jack.finley@fed.gov</A> or Bonnie Seybold at (202) 273-3440 or e-mail:<A HREF="mailto:bonnie.seybold@fed.gov"> bonnie.seybold@fed.gov.</A>

In 1993, the year government reinvention began, only three agencies - the Social Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, and the United States Postal Service -- committed to customer service standards.  The number went to 150 agencies in 1994, and 214 in 1995.  Today most agencies are beyond just setting standards, they are putting those standards to work to improve services to the American people, our customers.

<A NAME="TEACH">
<H2>EACH ONE TEACH FIVE: 21ST CENTURY TEACHERS</H2>               
            
  
  Taking a leaf from the NetDay playbook, President Clinton 
  called on the spirit of grassroots volunteerism to support 
  "21st Century Teachers," a national training initiative 
  designed to create a large corps of computer-literate 
  teachers. The plan: enlist 100,000 tech-savvy educators and 
  have each one train five others, creating a cadre of a 
  half-million computer-literate educators. 
  <P>
  The national effort to mobilize educators began last spring, 
  in advance of Congressional approval for the President's 
  proposed Technology Literacy Challenge, a five-year, $2 
  billion plan to bring technology skills into schools. While 
  the 21st Century Teacher initiative is not specifically 
  designated to receive funding under the President's 
  proposal, the effort is still "strategically linked" to the 
  overall plan because it will involve teacher training 
  nationwide, according to Linda Roberts, director of the 
  office of education technology at the U.S. Dept. of 
  Education. 
  <P>
  Enrollment has been underway on the Internet through the 
  summer; training is to begin in October and continue through 
  the school year. Teachers can enroll online through the U.S. 
  Technology Corp's Home Page (<A HREF="http://www.ustc.org">http://www.ustc.org</A>; scroll 
  down to "Sign Up to Become a 21st Century Teacher"), or via 
  e-mail (send a message to <A HREF="mailto:21st@ustc.org">21st@ustc.org</A> requesting 
  information).
  <P>
  A number of major education organizations, including the 
  National PTA, the National Education Association, the 
  American Federation of Teachers, and the National School 
  Boards Association, have signed a letter of support for the 
  program. U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley says of 
  these groups, "They are responding to the President's 
  challenge to the nation that every child must be 
  computer-literate. And to do that we have to have these four 
  pillars in place - the wiring, the computers themselves, the 
  software, and the preparation of teachers."
  <P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="CONTEST">
  <H2>SCHOOL-COMMUNITY TELECOM CONTEST</H2>

  
  If your students used telecommunications to help their 
  community, they could win your school one of 15 $500 prizes 
  in a contest sponsored by the National School Network 
  Testbed, a joint program of The National Science Foundation 
  and Cambridge, Mass.-based BBN. The Testbed helped originate 
  several K-12 sites during the Internet's early years and has 
  continued to support school networking. It's now looking for  
  the 15 best school telecommunications "stories."
  <P>
  Stories qualifying for the contest must describe 
  community/school telecommunications partnerships. 
  Submissions should be no longer than 1,500 words; the 
  deadline is October 31. To aid schools who wish to 
  participate, BBN is offering support through the writing 
  process at <A HREF="rschacht@ copernicus.bbn.com">rschacht@ copernicus.bbn.com</A>. For full 
  contest details, see the Testbed Web site 
  (<A HREF="http://copernicus.bbn.com/testbed2/callstories.html">http://copernicus.bbn.com/testbed2/callstories.html</A>) or 
  call Ron Schachter at (617) 873-5121.
  <P>
<HR><P>
<A NAME="ACCESS">
 <H2>AFFORDABLE ACCESS: THE NEXT STEP</H2>

  
  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 assures schools and rural 
  tele-medicine facilities a price break on phone rates 
  (including using those lines to access the Internet). But 
  now that the act has become law, many questions remain. Who 
  determines the discount rate? How will it be applied? Will 
  there be a single, fixed discount for K-12 schools across 
  the board, despite their means or distance from an Internet 
  gateway?
  <P>
  All these issues are currently being determined by a joint 
  board in Washington, D.C., consisting of three Federal 
  Communications Commission (FCC) members, four state public 
  utilities commissioners, and one state consumer advocate. At 
  press time, after taking in roughly 250 comments and about 
  180 replies, the joint board had sponsored two hearings to 
  further explore the subject. Telephone companies and other 
  private sector concerns have actively voiced their 
  positions, but the board is looking for greater feedback 
  from educators, says Ira Fishman, FCC special counsel and 
  director of the Commissioner's Task Force on Education.
  <P>
  The response so far? "What we have in front of us shows that 
  there's a desire to have a flexible model, perhaps a system 
  that would allow...regional discounts," Fishman says. Such a 
  model might take into account a rural school's distance from 
  the nearest Internet access point, Fishman says.
  Educators are encouraged to send their written opinions to: 
  Reed Hundt, FCC Commis-sioner, 1919 M St. NW, Washington, 
  D.C. 20554, re: Universal Service/Schools. E-mail:
  <A HREF="mailto:learnet@fcc.gov">learnet@fcc.gov</A>.
  <P>
  According to Fishman, the joint board will announce a set of 
  recommendations about the discount on November 8 of this 
  year, with a final ruling expected on May 8, 1997.

<STRONG>Price:</STRONG> $59.95<BR>

<STRONG>Rating:</STRONG> Highly Recommended</CENTER><P> 

This compelling CD-ROM transports us to one of history's most harrowing periods. It combines original film footage, historical audio clips from German archives, and more than 500 photographs with stark descriptions, somber music, and powerful narration. Three major sections (Hitler's Germany, The Holocaust, and The Aftermath) explore the topic in detail. Each is followed by a video summary.
<P>

The sections follow the era chronologically, from the rise of the Nazis, the Third Reich, World War II, and Jewish protests and powerlessness through the Final Solution to Nazis on trial and the rebuilding of Jewish life. Exploration leads you to detailed text, movies, images, and audio of the time. Though the text cannot be printed directly, it can be accessed from a special file on disk, then printed or imported into another application.
<P>

Lest We Forget also features an interactive historical map of Auschwitz II/Birkenau, enabling viewers to investigate the camp. There is a glossary of terms, 65 brief biographies of key individuals, a bibliography, maps, and a timeline charting the rise and fall of Nazi Germany. 
<P>

It's difficult to recommend a CD-ROM that features such horrific sights and sounds, but it is important to recognize <EM>Lest We Forget</EM> for its unparalleled multimedia content and its poignant treatment of a very sensitive subject.

<EM>Decisions, Decisions: Building a Nation</EM> combines critical thinking, cooperative learning, and role playing to teach students how a nation is born, based on the experiences of emerging African countries. It includes a teacher's guide, lesson plans, reproducibles, and student reference books. As with all Tom Snyder products, it works well in a one-computer classroom.<P>

In Building a Nation, students are asked to choose the type of government they want, find ways to stimulate the new nation's economy, and accommodate different ethnic groups. Lively, even heated, exchanges of opinion - coupled with fact gathering and research - are encouraged. Students justify their decisions and review decisions of others using the word processing portion of the program.
<P>

Students quickly learn that, to resolve the difficult dilemmas presented, they must be willing to work cooperatively, investigate, and debate as they  build their nation. This outstanding program is a surefire winner.

<STRONG>Rating:</STRONG> Highly Recommended</CENTER><P>

<EM>In My Own Voice</EM>, the newest CD-ROM from Sunburst, is a pure delight that features 27 poems on the subject of identity, written by 9 contemporary multicultural American poets. While the program is targeted for secondary school - and its resources would be invaluable for middle or high school lit courses - my elementary students found it very engaging. 
<P>

Students visit a variety of storefronts during a visually interactive journey down Ninth Street in New York City's Greenwich Village. Entering Eastside Books, students listen to poetry readings, explore personal insights from the poets, or listen to biographical information.
<P>

Stopping by Sun Gallery, students are greeted by more than 80 pieces of art grouped according to theme: motion, place, solitude, relationship, and so on. While visiting here, students can view artwork and listen to one of 20 music loops (from classical to hip-hop), while enjoying a poetry reading. 
The third "store," aptly named the Writing Space, contains tools for self-expression. To stimulate the writing process, a Word Generator offers word groupings as "poem starters." Helpful balloons illustrate and highlight figures of speech and encourage creativity.  
<P>

The real beauty of this CD-ROM is that it can be used individually, by small groups of students, or by a whole class. Exploration of tone and mood in poetry is the stated goal of this program, and In My Own Voice more than meets that goal. It is a joy.

<EM>Find It! Science</EM> is the answer to "Where do I go for science references?" The software is a compilation, developed with a grant from the National Science Foundation, of more than 3,000 science reference books. Students, teachers, and media specialists will find it an excellent starting point for science research.
<P>

Students may search the program by keyword or subject, readability level, size of book, author, and so on. As they narrow their search, a count of the number of appropriate books is displayed. Once they have a workable number of book "hits," students can activate the Click Here for Books button. Each book's color cover is displayed, along with a summary, a biography of the author, the name of the publisher, Dewey and ISBN numbers, number of pages, copyright, and availability.
<P>

Since many school libraries will have only a fraction of the books displayed, this can be a good starting place for the media specialist to learn what science books to purchase. All the books listed have received excellent book reviews and/or awards. Find It! Science is a comprehensive yet easy-to-use science research tool.

<EM>The Magic Applehouse</EM> is an excellent interactive introduction to computers and integrated software for early learners. Students learn to apply technology across the curriculum by helping Abigail Appleseed run her homemade baked-apple goods business. 
<P>

First, Abigail introduces the parts of the computer and invites students practice using the tab, shift, and arrow keys. Then attention shifts to the operation of Abigail's business. Students help create signs advertising Abigail's wares, put orders into a database, gather items for recipes, use a spreadsheet to calculate ingredients for different order sizes, and use coins for selling the baked goods and making change. 
<P>

While some of these activities may appear too advanced for early elementary students, they are not. Each activity is presented in an easy-to-follow graphical way with a choice of three levels of difficulty. Together, they provide an age-appropriate glimpse of how computers are used in the real world.
The darling graphics, the easy-to-use format, the high level of interactivity, and the content-rich activities make <EM>The Magic Applehouse</EM> a smart choice for introducing computer tools to any early elementary classroom.

<EM>NUMBER MAZE</EM> <BR>

You know how the saying goes...."An oldie, but a goodie!" NumberMaze by Great Wave Software helps children ages 4 to 12 to practice basic math skills. To move through a maze, the child must answer numerical and word problems that involve counting, adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing whole numbers; there are up to 48 levels in each of eight different curricula. Teachers can customize NumberMaze to match a specific curriculum or to meet the special needs of each individual child. Names may be entered to personalize word problems and problem levels may be definded or modified through setting problem parameters and mastery levels. Teachers may specify student options and placement in the program. Students enjoy the certificates and prizes they receive as they succeed.<BR>

<EM>THE LOGICAL JOURNEY OF THE ZOOMBINIS</EM><BR>

I love The Logical Journey of the Zoombinis by Broderbund. There are a lot of terrific activities which really make the kids think, but there's no reading involved, so it is great for all age levels, even non-readers. The kids love it because it is fun.  They don't really realize they're strengthening a lot of math skills (because there's no drill and practice).  My first graders would consistently choose to do this program rather than anything else (recess, art, movie, etc.) during free choice time.<BR>

It happens every time: When people start talking about the Web, they seem to stop
speaking English. With our glossary, you'll discover the meaning of all those
cryptic terms--and be well on your way to mastering the jargon of the Web.

<P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="htmls"></A>
<B>HTML-HyperText Markup Language</B>
<BR>Text is tagged with format information so that the Web browser software will
know how to display text (for example, underlined, bold, or in a different
color). Also allows links to other HTML documents through use of <A
HREF="#URL">Universal Resource Locators (URLs).</A>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>HTTP-HyperText Transport Protocol</B> 
<BR>The basis for World Wide Web communication. Supports graphic rather than text
based communication, so that users can use mouse clicks instead of typing in
commands. Also helps interpret <A HREF="#URL">URL</A> to help find linked <A
HREF="#htmls">HTML</A> documents.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="IP"></A>
<B>IP-Internet Protocol</B>
<BR> The basis for all communication on the Internet. Allows for unique addresses
(called IP numbers) for every computer on the Net. Messages between computers are
divided into multiple packets of data, with the sending and receiving computer's
IP address as part of each packet.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>TCP-Transmission Control Protocol</B> 
<BR>Takes <A HREF="#IP">IP</A> packets and puts data into packets with the size
and packet number (for example, 3 of 6) as part of each packet. Each packet also
has error-checking information that helps determine if the data arrives at the
receiving computer uncorrupted. Packets are reassembled at the receiving computer
into original message.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>ISP-Internet Service Provider</B> 
<BR>A company that has one or more computers connected by high speed (56K or
faster) data links to the Internet. ISPs have one or more modem lines and
possibly one or more digital lines for user access.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>PPP-Point-to-Point Protocol</B> 
<BR>Puts Internet data into packets that include start, end, and error checking
information for the packet. Official Internet standard protocol for modem
connections to the Internet.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>SLIP-Serial Line Internet Protocol</B> 
<BR>Puts Internet data into packets with special characters that signify start
and end of packet. Allows data to be transferred at modem speeds without
disrupting Internet service provider's computer. Does not provide error checking.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="URL"></A>
<B>URL-Universal Resource Locator</B> 
<BR>The method by which the addresses of files can be located on the Internet
using names rather than <A HREF="#IP">IP</A>  numbers.  Names are translated into
their appropriate IP numbers and then the resource is located, all unseen by the
user.

Web browser, Web page, Web links, Webmania--we interrupt this flight into cyberspace to address the amorphous phenomenon known as the World Wide Web, and to answer every educator's plaintive question:  beyond the tangle of sticky techno-jargon, what is the Web stuff, anyway? Here you'll find:

<P>
<A NAME="magnet"></A>
<B>The Great Internet Magnet</B>
<P>
The World Wide Web (or WWW) provides searchable access to multimedia information on the Internet. This includes text, pictures, sounds and movies. The Web is the fastest-growing area of the Internet, and the latest versions of popular tool software such as Claris Corp.'s <I>ClarisWorks 4.0</I> include features that let students design their own Web pages. 
<P>
The attractiveness of multimedia presentations, combined with the near-instantaneous ability to jump from one group of information resources to another, has captivated many educators and convinced them to become Internet users. In Web Basics section, Electronic Learning looks at what it takes to access the Web, with a special focus on <A HREF="#browsers">browsers</A>--the software tools that lets you navigate through the limitless ocean of data and media found on the Web. Since talking about the Web involves a whole new vocabulary, plan to make liberal use of the glossary box we've provided below.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="makesup"></A>
<B>What Makes Up the Web?</B>
<P>
The World Wide Web consists of millions of linked files on thousands of computers around the world, accessed with browser software that works with the same kind of point-and-click mouse controls already familiar to Mac and Windows users. Central to the Web are Web sites, the places where files physically reside: Internet-connected computers that support <A HREF="terms.html">HyperText Transfer Protocol, or HTTP</A>. (Click here for our special <A HREF="terms.html">glossary of Web terms.</A>) A Web site computer contains one or more special files called Web pages. A Web page is a mix of text and commands created with a special document language called <A HREF="terms.html">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</A>.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="cool"></A>
<B>Hot Links to Cool Sites</B>
<P>
Web page authors usually place links in their documents to other Web pages on related subjects. These links, often known as "hot" or "live" links, are represented on screen typically as underlined words of a different color than the regular text. Behind the hot link is the <A HREF="terms.html">Universal Resource Locator (URL)</A> that provides the related page's Internet address. When the user selects the highlighted text with a mouse click, the Web browser program locates and loads the linked document almost immediately,  The user is then looking the new Web page (it could be from a server in Finland or Japan) that he or she called up. In this way a user can "browse the Web" (a term often used interchangeably with "surf the Net").

<P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="connected"></A>
<B>How to Get Connected</B>

<P>
There are two basic ways to get connected to the Web: through an online service such as America Online or an Internet service provider that you access either commercially or via  a local university, your school, or district.   
<P>
<A NAME="online">
Access via online service: By far, the easiest connection to the Web is through an online service such as America Online or Prodigy. Install just one large program, and you're ready to connect via modem. The major online services--America Online, Compuserve, Prodigy, and Microsoft Network--offer Internet connectivity for both Windows PCs and Macintoshes, and most offer full Web access as well. Costs for online service is typically around $10 per month for basic service. Extra time online, the number of e-mail messages, access to certain services (including Internet) may all cost extra. 
<P>

<A NAME="isp">
Direct to the Internet: Internet service providers (ISPs)--whether they're commercial (such as Netcom) and non-commercial (such as your school or district)--are very similar. Typically, you can connect to an Internet service provider either through a direct connection or by modem using a standard telephone voice line. 

<P>
Three national commercial ISPs are HoloNet, Portal Information Network and Netcom. (There are hundreds of other ISPs, many of whom offer connectivity in a single city only.) Unlike online services such as Prodigy or AOL, commercial Internet service providers usually offer very little in the way of non-Internet services (games, news updates, and so on). 

<P>
To make the connection via an ISP, you'll need a TCP/IP protocol and, if you're using a modem, a <A HREF="terms.html">SLIP or PPP connection</A>. If your ISP does not provide this software, there are a number of easy set-up packages, called Internet suites, that will work with any ISP. The most widely used are Internet Works, Internet Chameleon, Internet in a Box, and SuperHighway Access. Costs for Internet suites range from around $50 to $150. TCP/IP is also built into Microsoft's new Windows 95. If you're willing to put in some legwork, you can also find free versions of TCP/IP and SLIP/PPP software for both Mac and PC: most universities have these programs as shareware (and they're willing to share). 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="browsers"></A>
<B>Browsers on Their Own</B>
<P> 
For those who are more adventuresome, or who have good technical support available, there are Internet browsers that assume you already have TCP/IP and SLIP/PPP installed. The foremost Web browser, with approximately 75 percent of the market, is Netscape Navigator. It has become the standard by which all other browsers are judged. Free and commercial versions exist for both Mac and PC. The Navigator commercial version provides written documentation. Other browsers, mainly for PC, include: Air Mosaic (PC), Cello (PC), MacWeb and WinWeb (Mac and PC, respectively), NCSA Mosaic (both), and Quarterdeck Mosaic (PC). Costs for Web Browsers range from free to under $50. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="shopping"></A>
<B>Our Browser Shopping Checklist</B>
<P>
Anyone keeping pace with the latest business news will notice that new browser programs are popping up all over, in anticipation of the time when entertainment, commerce, information and curriculum will be commonly carried on the Web. In the course of examining programs for this article, we've identified a list of important features that should answer the question: What makes a good Web browser? A solid browser should include the following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Ease of installation--Requires little technical knowledge on the part of the user.
<P>
<LI>Good navigation tools--Ease of typing in a Web address or searching for a Web site based on key words.
<P>
<LI>Up to date--Able to interpret the latest version of HTML.
<P>
<LI>Good file transfer--User should be able to print any text or graphics (including single movie frames), and save to disk any or all parts of a Web file, including the HTML code.
<P>
<LI>Download efficient and configurable--At the user's choice, able to selectively load text, graphics and other parts of documents found on the Web. User can see progress of download, and stop a download at any time.  
<P>
<LI>Flexible interface--Allows user to easily switch from Web browsing to other Internet features (e-mail, news groups, and so on). 
<P>
<LI>Good storage resources--Shows list of Web sites previously accessed, saves previous Web page data to disk to allow quick display of previous pages. 
<P>
<LI>Good organizational tools--Has the ability to add user-chosen sites to a permanent "hot list." Can categorize, group and sort hot list entries.
<P>
<LI>Good and extensible file support--Able to recognize and display graphic, sound and movie files of various formats. Able to work with "helper software" such as Adobe Acrobat to decode and display new file types as they come into use. 
</OL>
<P>
Web browsers undergo frequent updates. In the two months I have been working on this article, I have used nine different browsers (three online, two suites and four browsers) extensively. In that time I did at least one and sometimes two updates on each. Anything written on the present state of an individual browser could very well be out of date before it reaches the newsstand. So, what's a user to do? 
<P>
If you are a beginner, an online service is a good place to start. Experienced Web users may find online service browsers limited. If you have a choice, you can't go wrong with any of the Web browsers listed in this feature, although Netscape Navigator remains my preference, for Mac or PC.

<HR>
<P>
<B>Bill came seeking information</B> on the debate over making English the official U.S. language. "Can I find stuff on the Internet?" he asked. There's certainly no shortage of "stuff" on the Net, I told Bill. But finding the right information and determining if it is sound takes more than surfing.  
<P>
I am talking about putting good "habits of mind" into the search process. Growing directly out of the work of John Dewey, these habits help train high school students to do some outstanding critical thinking-but it's hard work. To facilitate the good habits of mind on Internet projects, I've designed a sheet I call "The Oceana High Hot 5 Questions." I gave Bill a copy and we set to work.
<P>
At Oceana, we use a powerful search engine called <A HREF="searchengines.html">Alta Vista</A>. I coached Bill on how to construct an effective search query.  He tried "Official Language+ English."
<P>
Alta Vista responded with about 1,000 hits. As Bill scanned down the first 10, he found<I>LatinoLink: Congress Pushing Ahead with Proposals to Make English Official Language</I><B>(<A HREF="http://www.best.com/~latino/index.html">http://www.best.com/~latino/index.html</A>)</B>. Deciding it sounded good, he called up the full text of the article. Then we turned to our Hot 5.
<P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/latban.gif" WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=115>
<P> 
<B>Hot Question 1:</B>  Do you know the words? "There's no way to do this without a good dictionary,"  I told Bill, handing him one of our trusty Merriam Webster Collegiates.
<P>
<B>Hot Question 2:</B>  What is the source of the item?  Can you identify its mission or agenda? Bill clicked back to the LatinoLink home page, where he found: "Our goal is to address issues--both personal and political--that affect Latinos in the United States..." Looking at all the items offered through LatinoLink convinced Bill that the site covered a lot of different viewpoints. His clue: Of three articles on the Cuban downing of the two small planes from Miami, one called Castro a murderer, while another lamented the setback to U.S.-Cuba relations. 
<P>
<B>Hot Question 3:</B>  Who's quoted in this article? What else do they think? I suggested that Bill do a search on Representative Toby Roth (R-Wisc.), a name he found in the article on English."He's someone in favor of making English official," Bill said. "I wonder if there's anything else about him on the Web." Another search, and Bill found Roth's own home page and an interesting link called Project Vote Smart (<A HREF="http://www.oclc.org/VoteSmart">http://www.oclc.org/VoteSmart</A>), which listed Rep. Roth's ratings by various groups. Bill thought he detected a pattern of very low ratings from civil rights, women's, and student groups, yet high ratings from antiabortion, Christian, and antitax groups. I asked him,"Does this mean anything?"
<P>
<B>Hot Question 4:</B>  What do links from this site tell you? Bill checked LatinoLink's "Links we like" and discovered a huge list of sites with Latino cultural and political themes. After looking at a few of them, Bill turned to me and said: "These just confirm their mission. A lot of stuff; some have opposing viewpoints."
<P>
<B>Hot Question 5:</B> How can you verify things presented as facts? In the English article Bill found, one government official claimed that in Texas, students are being taught in Spanish for all 12 years of schooling. "I wonder if that's true?" Bill mused. "I could do a search..." Bill might be able to find statistics from the Texas Education Department or elsewhere concerning the length of time students remain in bilingual programs. Using the Hot 5 Questions, he was already making good progress.

<STRONG>Kids learn about whales and the Web.</STRONG>
<P>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Inspired by what they had learned</B> on the subject through <I>The Voyage of the Mimi</I> (an integrated science unit from Sunburst, [800] 321-7511), the kids were eager to extend their technology adventures into cyberspace. Their teacher came to me for help in getting started. 
<P>
I told her what I tell every educator interested in telecommunications: A good Internet research project begins by asking students to brainstorm interesting questions. Students in the middle grades should be encouraged to come up with their own questions rather than being assigned specific research topics. For our whale project, students generated questions like" Should whales be kept in captivity?" and "Does water pollution hurt whales?" for their desktop fishing expedition.  Then they divided into research teams, and got started with traditional library resources, as well as CD-ROM software reference tools. 
<P>
Students tapped telecommunications resources like Scholastic Network (<A HREF="http://scholastic.com/network/index.html">http://scholastic.com/network</A>) to study postings by a marine biologist. Students then used the <A HREF="searchengines.html">Webcrawler search engine</A> to find links related to whales and whaling. Soon they focused on specific sites, and gathered images and text resources.
<P>
Using the Web forced students to think about bias: When they found whale information on the Sea World Home Page (see below), they wondered how a different organization (like Greenpeace) would present information about whales in 
captivity. 	
<P>
Students also discussed the reliability of Web information. Since anyone could post information about whales, the students talked about ways to check for accuracy; usually, this meant finding books and cross-checking what they had seen on the Internet. 
<P>
As the class progressed from research into the  multimedia publishing phase of the project, we also tackled the copyright procedures, discussing the legal and ethical concepts involved. Kids contacted software publishers and Web masters for permission to use various images. Then the student teams brought it all together in HyperCard presentations that integrated these graphics with their interpretation of text gathered from online sources. 
<P>
It was a whale of a critical-thinking project!

<HR>
<P>
<B>For a glorious spell this January,</B> the Electronic School House of America Online and a group of supporting Web sites became the Virtual Prairie,where "Buffalo" Bret (Sutterley), "Side Saddle" Shanna (Pickering),"Pistol Packin" Pete (Lindquist), "Calamity" Jane (Coffey), and 91 students from Dutcher Elementary School in Turlock, Calif., headed west on the Oregon TrailÑjoined by over 100 other schools across America. We were all active online members of the Westward HO!  simulation hosted by "Kalamity" Kath (Ferenz) and "Wagon  Mistress" Leni (Donlan) in the Electronic School House. The cross-country collaboration was inspired by MECC's evergreen <I>Oregon Trail</I> software program.
<P>
Every participating "wagon load" of characters (with its own e-mail address) collaborated on projects that ranged from journal keeping to cooking. During the eight weeks of this project, we integrated math, science, physical education, social studies, and geography in an interrelated, interactive way. 
<P>
Used in combination with the WestWard HO! simulation and MECC's <I>Wagon Train 1848</I> interactive software, the Internet was a valuable source of information for our student and teacher travelers. By subscribing to several listservs, such as Best Web and LM_Net, we discovered a variety of terrific Oregon Trail sites (see below). There we were able to view digitized graphics of Oregon Trail landmarks (the Shawnee Mission, Independence Rock, and more), click on a linked map of the trail, and even download a comprehensive teacher's guide. 
<P>
We also discovered that collaborative online projects such as WestWard HO! offer unique opportunities for sharing resources, ideas, and lesson plans. We teachers enthusiastically scoured the bulletin board and mail exchanges for new ideas for teaching and integrating technology. One online participant offered a recipe for hardtack, which then became a math lesson on measurement; a science lesson on the changing property of matter; and a social studies lesson during which the students quickly learned the rigors and blandness of the diet of the trail travelers!
<P>
Next year, trail surfers should be able to log onto an interactive Oregon Trail WWW site built and sponsored by MECC, and join in a six-week national Oregon Trail Online! collaborative wagon train during the 1996-97 school year. For information: call (800) 215-0368 or see <A HREF="http://mecc.com">http://mecc.com</A>.

<STRONG>Looking for dinosaurs and more.</STRONG>
<P>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Last night, my four-year old son found dinosaurs in Hawaii.</B>  "Hey, there's stegosaurus! He must be very small, because look at his picture. Now can I see triceratops?"
<P>
Dylan did see triceratops, and a mini-movie of iguanadon and deinonychus. Then we turned off the computer and read a bedtime story.
<P>
This narrated dinosaur exhibit at Honolulu Community College is just a modem hop away on the Web-and only one of many colorful sites that will appeal to young children. 
<P>
Mary Johnson's kindergartners at Ripley Elementary School in Ripley, Tenn., know the Web can help them learn more about almost any topic. "From animals and outer space, to athletes and the Olympics, they always want to look up something on the Web," says Johnson. Linda Bruschi's students at Riverside School in Princeton, N. J., are regular Web navigators too. "We need to expose children to all the tools that may be useful to them in solving problems," Bruschi says. "The right tool could be a set of blocks-or it might be the Web!"
<P>
While using the Internet with very young children has its obvious limitations-your students may not yet be able to read or be comfortable with a standard keyboard-here are hints from Johnson and Bruschi for easing early learning on  the Web,:
<P>
<B>1.</B>  The attention span of young children may not survive the search for Web sites. Set aside time to preview sites yourself, then use the bookmark feature to save favorite destinations. When students go online, they can go right to the sites you've preselected.
<P>
<B>2.</B>  It takes a while to download some images and sound clips. Plan to start the process when your students have another activity coming up. By the time they return, the Web site will be ready to go. 
<P>
<B>3.</B>  File print-outs of Web sites by subject, noting the URL addresses for each (http://.....). You'll have a handy record of worthwhile sites, and students can easily revisit information.
<P>
<B>4.</B> Keep online costs down-and save time, too-with WebWhacker (ForeFront), software that lets you download entire WWW sites to your desktop, including images, sound files, and related Web pages.

<A NAME="CREATIVITY">
<H3>FOSTERING CREATIVITY, IMAGINATION, AND PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS</H3>
In a suburb outside of Boston, <A HREF="#DUXBURY">students learn mural painting, computer imaging, and calligraphy</A> in popular interdisciplinary art classes. 
<P>
In the technology lab of a New Jersey high school, <A HREF="#NORTHERN VALLEY">students design such prizewinning inventions</A> as a bicycle for the deaf, an automatic teller machine for the blind, and an antidrowning device for toddlers.
<P>
And in inner-city neighborhoods in Los Angeles and Chicago, <A HREF="#LA/CHICAGO/BRONX">students create videos and write and act in skits based on their explorations of environmental issues</A> - and then swap and combine material between sites using interactive video technology.
<P>
More and more, computers and technology are becoming facilitators to creativity that can inspire students to experiment in ways that surprise them even while they are doing it. Technology can accelerate the creative process by allowing mistakes and changes, and freeing students of their inhibitions.
<P>
"A computer is like a virtual chalkboard, but it's better," says Erik Strommen, an interactive technologies research director at the Children's Television Workshop in New York City. "If you're working in paint or physical media and you make a mistake, you've made a mistake. With a computer, nothing is permanent. It's a constant experimental space, an open forum for manipulating images, because it's permanently malleable."
<HR WIDTH=40%>
<A NAME="ROTE LEARNING">
<H3>FROM ROTE LEARNING TO CREATIVITY</H3>
All across the country, educators are striving to bring more of the creative process into the classroom as part of the move away from rote learning. In "constructivist" classrooms-called that or something else-students, guided by teachers, explore and assemble the raw materials of skill and knowledge rather than being saturated with prefabricated information from textbooks. 
<P>
Technology used in the service of the arts and other creative endeavors can promote risk taking, inquisitiveness, and problem solving, say educators. Pushed to really examine their own work and others', students can be helped to develop higher-order thinking skills such as analysis, criticism, and divergent questioning. Those skills are crucial for continued learning and, ultimately, success in the adult world.
<P>
"Creativity is an extremely important component in getting you a job, especially today," says Janeil Englestad, a Chicago design artist and director of <A HREF="#LA/CHICAGO/BRONX">an environmental studies project</A> through the World Stage Network, a nonprofit group that promotes education for at-risk children through theater and technology. "By giving them not only science and business skills but creative skills, you're developing better thinkers who can approach problems in a more creative way." 
<HR WIDTH=40%>
<A NAME="INTERDISCIPLINARY">
<H3>ENHANCING INTERDISCIPLINARY LEARNING </H3>
Combined with artistic media-theater, sculpture, music, photography, and video-technology can enhance an interdisciplinary approach that helps students to make natural links between their knowledge and the real world. <A HREF="#LA/CHICAGO/BRONX">In inner-city Chicago, Los Angeles, and The Bronx, students are learning and using video as part of an urban environmental program</A>, and writing skits together transcontinentally thanks to videoconferencing. 
<P>
<A HREF="#DUXBURY">Art students at Duxbury Junior/Senior High School</A> near Boston are developing skills in imagination, risk taking, self-expression, and experimentation by using computers to paint self-portraits and landscapes, and to alter photographic images. 
<P>
Meanwhile, <A HREF="#NORTHERN VALLEY">students in technology courses at Northern Valley Regional High Schools in Demarest and Old Tappan, N.J.</A>, stretch their imaginations to design and create useful inventions. In a warm-up exercise, they are asked to imagine that they survived a plane wreck on a deserted island and must design a distress signal using a lightbulb, rubber band, tinfoil, and other materials. 
<P>
These are not the only schools where technology is being used as a facilitator to creativity. But a closer look at the programs-and the specific technology they use-provides a sense of the possibilities for educators and students alike.

<A NAME="DUXBURY">
<H3>DUXBURY, MASS: <BR>
TECHNOLOGY MEETS MONET AND MICHELANGELO</H3>
Computers and cameras are two of the many tools in award-winning teacher Virginia Freyermuth's art classes at Duxbury Junior/Senior High. Art itself has become a vehicle to learn about other subjects, and for many students, computers provide a more immediate creative outlet than traditional media on paper. 
<P>
"Whether students pick up a piece of charcoal or a paintbrush or sit down with a mouse and a keyboard at the computer, they can experience the creative process. They're just using different materials," says Freyermuth, one of three visual arts teachers who won a 1995 American Teacher Award sponsored by The Walt Disney Co. and McDonald's. "It's a vehicle for students to be able to express themselves, to create, to problem-solve."
<P>
The integration of art with other disciplines-literature, history, mechanical drawing, and English, for example-has become a signature of Duxbury. Ten years ago, the school art program limped along with a handful of students. Freyermuth joined the staff in 1985 determined to make the arts program flourish. She spent much time garnering community support for arts education and spreading the word among students. Ultimately, student demand led to classes in drawing and painting, sculpture, and other studio classes taught by a staff of four art teachers.
<P>
"We need to preserve the learning of art," says Freyermuth. "[And] learning in other disciplines can be greatly enhanced when students bring creative artistic learning into those areas."
<P>
This year many teachers worked together on interdisciplinary projects-many involving video and related technologies-based on arts research that Freyermuth did in Europe last summer. Freyermuth is also using her studies of the frescoes of Michelangelo and Impressionist paintings of Claude Monet in a series of interactive television broadcasts for students and teachers by the Massachusetts Corporation for Educational Television (MCET).
<HR WIDTH=40%>
<A NAME="FRESCOES">
<H3>FRESCOES IN THE HALLWAYS </H3>
Studying the Italian frescoes has inspired students to decorate the school walls with murals. A painting class has adopted authentic methods of fresco making by mixing plaster and bits of colored pigment from acrylic paint to create a mural in a student lounge that represents the school as a castle from which many roads lead to a successful life.
<P>
"All over my school we have 40-foot murals,'' says Freyermuth. "It transforms the space, and students take more pride in their surroundings when they have ownership."
<P>
Video of Monet's home and garden outside of Paris and prints of his paintings have inspired classroom study of literature, painting, and history, as well as the design and creation of a school art garden by students from mechanical drawing, woodworking, and painting classes.
<P>
In Italy, Freyermuth gathered medieval illuminated manuscripts done by monks and took pictures of Ferrara, a half-medieval, half-Renaissance city between Florence and Rome. Students in a history, literature, and arts class have re-created the intricately decorated and lettered illuminated manuscripts that marked the beginning of book illustration. Using pen and ink on golden parchment paper, they draw similar decorative vines, flowers, and dragons. 
<P>
To simulate the monks' work environment, the students take oaths of silence and listen to Gregorian chants while they are drawing and lettering the manuscripts.
<P>
Projects like these are typical of Freyermuth. "She is just one of the most influential teachers I've ever had," says Kevin Arpe, 17, a senior. He first took art because a cooking class didn't fit into his schedule. Now he majors in art with a focus on computer art.
<HR WIDTH=40%>
<A NAME="PICTURE">
<H3>MAKING TECHNOLOGY PART OF THE PICTURE</H3>
When Freyermuth pushed for the inclusion of computer graphics into the curriculum, she had little knowledge of technology. Now students in a creative imaging class use computers, digital cameras, and photography to create original work such as self-portraits, landscapes, newspaper tabloids, and glossy graphic designs. 
<P>
"Computers for me kind of opened up a new medium," says Chris Plant, 16, a sophomore. "In traditional art there are a lot of times where you try to express an idea and either your school doesn't have the tools or you just don't have the skill or knowledge. The computer is already there. All you have to do is point and click."
<P>
Whether or not students are artistically inclined, the technology helps build skills in experimentation, imagination, and problem solving. Students scan their stilllife paintings into  black-and-white computer images to check the intensity and brightness of their colors. One student scanned his pen-and-ink drawing into the computer to view it in various colors.
<P>
"Once you do something on a piece of paper, it's permanent," Freyermuth says. "This gives students the opportunity to take more risks than they would if they just used paper."
<P>
Soon the school will have a virtual gallery on the World Wide Web, where visitors can look at student artwork. And museums and galleries available on CD-ROM are used by the students to view famous works of art from around the world. Working on self-portraits, they examine how other artists created particular effects.
<P>
"We started flipping through the portraits by various artists," says  Freyermuth. "You can zoom in to look at the way artists have drawn noses, for example.. Having this technology available at the fingertips extends the walls of the classroom."

<H3>LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO/THE BRONX:<BR>
EXPLORING THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT</H3>
Graffiti, crack dealers, and corners where gangs jump passersby: These day-to-day challenges are also major environmental problems for many teens in an inner-city Los Angeles neighborhood with one of the highest murder rates in the country and a lingering legacy of the 1992 riots. And in a similar neighborhood north of Yankee Stadium in the South Bronx, N.Y., young people face similar obstacles in a world of broken windows, burnt-out buildings, and barred-up factories.
<P>
As part of a cross-continental program last year, youths from both neighborhoods swapped stories about their neighborhoods via video teleconferencing in an environmental studies project through World Stage Network, a nonprofit educational organization that emphasizes the arts and technology for children and teens from low-income areas. The teleconferencing is done using computers and ISDN lines, which transmit voice and video data between sites.
<P>
"Some of these kids really don't get out of their neighborhoods-they exist in a two-block radius," says Janeil Englestad. "So videoconferencing lets them see the world in a way that is more valid [to them] than studying in their textbooks. It is real."
<P>
The project began last year between teens from the Heart of Los Angeles Youth (HOLA)-a nonprofit arts, athletics, and job education agency-and the Sacred Heart School in the Bronx. 
<P>
Now called Logos: The Environmental Studies Program, the mission of the project is to teach creative and technological skills to at-risk kids-some of whom may live in homeless shelters and most of whom have never used a camera, a video projector, or a computer keyboard-as well as help them examine their own neighborhood as environmentalists. They exchange theater pieces, collages, videos, and stories about their scientific explorations. 
<P>
This year, the project expanded to include two partnerships between groups in Los Angeles and Chicago, the Bronx and Pittsburgh.
<P>
"Our mission was to give at-risk youth an opportunity to work with technology and art, in fields like video, film, photography, and basic computer arts, because they weren't getting these in school," says Englestad. 
<HR WIDTH=40%>
<A NAME="EXPOSING HAZARDS">
<H3>EXPOSING ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS</H3>
Last year in Los Angeles, kids explored pollution on the shores of a Santa Monica beach; visited a recycling center and companies that manufacture goods using recycled materials; and learned how litter, car exhaust, and spray paint can pollute the water they drink and the air they breathe. And they explored their own neighborhood, nestled between Hispanic and Korean sections two blocks from Western Avenue, a major thoroughfare that was looted in the riots.
<P>
"I learned a lot about science. It brought the things close by and made me see how everything in my very own street or in my house ends up coming back to me, through food or the air I breathe," says Werner Pastran, 21, a young artist who participated in Logos last year and is now working as a student mentor with the environmental studies workshops. 
<P>
"With a textbook you pretty much read it, forget it, and leave the textbook there," Pastran says. "This way there's no ignoring it. And you don't just say it's happening somewhere else; it's happening in your own neighborhood."
In The Bronx, kids created projects for a science fair and explored Central Park. Using video and still photography, they recorded their walks through the neighborhood, visits to museums or recycling centers, and observations about science and the environment. 
<P>
"You record what you see, and you don't have to make it up or make circles around it and try to make it bigger-you pretty much pick it up raw as it is," says Pastran. "It becomes a living document of what is going on. And you're able to reach a lot more people."
<P>
Despite early technical difficulties, the students in The Bronx and Los Angeles eventually connected through video-teleconferencing. They asked each other questions about their neighborhoods. Those in Los Angeles shared a map of the neighborhood, with symbols drawn at dangerous corners where gangs might attack passersby. Kids from The Bronx showed video footage of their museum trip. Other kids shared collages of their photography focusing on such themes as graffiti, garbage, or drinking-water pollution. Some read essays about how they would combat pollution.
<P>
This year, the Los Angeles organization has connected with Urban Gateways, a Chicago nonprofit arts education center that also works with at-risk children from various neighborhoods and is the largest such center in the nation. The project cost of $30,000 has been supported by grants from IBM, the Illinois Humane Society, and Neiman Marcus, Inc. 
<HR WIDTH=40%>
<A NAME="CREATING THEATER">
<H3>CREATING THEATER ONLINE</H3>
During Saturday workshops at each site, the teens will work with artists and actors in workshops on photography, video, playwriting, sound, movement, and music. Then Chicago and Los Angeles will make contact via video-teleconferencing to compare their script writing and do interactive theater. In an exercise called Playback, for example, one teen will tell a personal story through video to the other site, and the teens there will develop a skit to act out the story. And the teens will collaborate on a final play, to be performed jointly involving casts from each site.
<P>
"It's something that they can take ownership of," says Tim Sauers, an Urban Gateways director of program development. "There's nothing like watching kids' faces seeing a [theater] piece that they created. They're just amazed that they actually created a product, not just an assignment for school."
<P>
So far this year, the teens have focused on a variety of topics such as welfare reform, violence and crime, and waste. In their first class, they wrote essays about environmental issues of their choice.
<P>
"It's important for the kids to have input," says Englestad. "I try to approach them as an artist seeking collaboration on a project, not as a teacher in a traditional classroom."

GREAT INVENTIONS</H3>
Creativity isn't just about artistic expression: inventors and scientists need the creative edge as well. In Javier Rabelo's electronics and computer technology courses at Northern Valley Regional High Schools in Demarest and Old Tappan, N.J., students are challenged to create innovative, safe-and useful-inventions.  
<P>
This year, Rabelo's students designed and built products ranging from a bicycle for the deaf, equipped with sound, motion, and light detectors that make an accompanying helmet vibrate; a bulletproof vest that alerts fellow police officers if metal from a knife or bullet touches the vest; an ATM machine with Braille keys and voice signals for the blind; and an antidrowning flotation device that sounds an alarm in a parent wristwatch if a child starts sinking.
<P>
"It's very easy to ask somebody to invent some thing," says Rabelo. "Most of the students are very comfortable. My job is to help assist them with resources." Since Rabelo started at the school three years ago, many of his students have won scholarships ranging from $400 to $10,000 in a student inventions contest sponsored by Duracell, Inc. The number of students entering the contest has climbed each year, and for the third year in a row, one of his students won second place.
<P>
Rabelo kicks off the beginning of the course by offering up practical problems for the students to solve. They use materials from home such as clothespins, garbage-bag ties, pennies, hair rollers, and Ping-Pong balls. In one exercise, students create a distress signal with materials salvaged from an imaginary plane wreck: aluminum foil, a small bulb, some wire, a battery, and rubber bands. Another assignment: create a marbleloading device.
<P>
"They start out thinking that someone is going to feed them everything and they find out right away that that's not the case," says Rabelo, who formerly taught math, technology, photography, and bilingual classes at a science and math academy in New York City. "They see that it's an obtainable task, it's been done in the past and all they have to do is really try."
<HR WIDTH=40%>
<A NAME="CRITIQUES">
<H3>CLASSROOM CRITIQUES</H3>
Then the real fun begins. Students dream up ideas for original inventions and write a technical report that summarizes the purpose of the device and how it would work. They also create a multimedia presentation using animation, graphics, and sound to present the invention's function, design, and cost analysis. Before putting the invention together, students display their work for the class.
<P>
"Students get more confidence and their accountability increases when they have to display their work not only to me but for fellow classmates," Rabelo says. "When it's your turn to be in front of the class, they're going to try and grill you. They're more careful."
<P>
Eugene Agresta, 16, a junior, had deaf and hard-of-hearing people in mind as he mulled over ideas for his invention. "I thought it must be hard for them to ride bikes without always watching what's behind them," he said. And so he created a bike that would send signals to a helmet to make it vibrate to alert the rider of light, sound, and motion nearby. The bike has sensors that detect the motion of a vehicle, the headlights of a car, and the sound of a horn.
<HR WIDTH=40%>
<A NAME="SOLUTIONS">
<H3>REAL WORLD SOLUTIONS</H3>
Students say the class helps them to develop their problem-solving skills and creativity. They're forced to come up with as many approaches and solutions as they can, then try and put together a real device. To make the invention functional, they often must summon knowledge of many subjects-from math, to compute electrical resistance, to chemistry, to understand bonds and metallics. 
<P>
Often students are inspired by the real world. James Del Greco, 15, thought of his father, a police officer in a rough part of Passaic, N.J. He designed a bulletproof vest that sends alarm signals if touched by metal such a knife or a bullet.
<P>
"[Mr. Rabelo] dedicates himself to the students, he takes time on weekends, he stays late after school," Del Greco says. "It brought out our creativity. He says you can make it work, and then it works." 
<P>
David Satine, 15, who invented an ATM machine for the blind, agrees. "It really is a confidence builder to know you can build this and help people," he says. "In math, you have to do it a certain way to get the right answer. But with this there are different ways to go. It's basically a hands-on course. It's more of a course that will help you 10 or 15 years from now in business when you are given real problems to solve."
<P>
Students like James and David see the creative link as more than fluff to make classes fun. Similarly, for student David Plant at Duxbury High School, the opportunity to design an advertisement is a stepping-stone to a career as a computer graphics designer. One of his eye-catching ads depicts a futuristic plane flashing into the sky. Wrapped across it is the slogan, The Future is Now.

<A NAME="unprepared"></A>
<H3>UNPLUGGED, UNPREPARED</H3>
Tina Wallace, who will graduate from Grambling State University's teacher-education program in May, has been on the Internet only once, and has little experience with educational software. She'd like to  figure out how to make technology a part of her teaching, but it just wasn't covered in an instructional media course she took at Grambling. "We didn't even work on the computers," she says. "I'm still trying to learn more about the Internet myself. I don't want to go into a  classroom and have the students know more than I do. You have to be prepared."<P>
Wallace is hardly alone among the ranks of beginning and soon-to-be teachers. The idea that teachers should make technology an integral part their teaching is becoming as much of a given as the need to teach writing across the curriculum or the importance of higher-order thinking skills. But, with a few notable <A HREF="exceptions496.html">exceptions</A>, colleges of education have a long way to go in figuring out how to "teach" technology so that their students will be able to integrate it into their own classrooms.<P>
Surveys conducted for the Congress's recently closed Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) have shown that there is a wide disparity in the technologies available within colleges of education and how professors use them with preservice teachers. Jerry Willis, a professor at the University of Houston and part of a research team for OTA's April 95 report <EM>Teachers and Technology: Making the Connection</EM>, says that while there are "islands of excellence" among teacher-education programs, "the average is pretty pitiful."<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="gap"></A>
<H3>THE PREPARATION GAP </H3>
It's not that schools of ed don't recognize the role of technology. Seventy-six percent of the education professors surveyed, for instance, said information technology was now a very important aspect of education; and 82 percent said it would be important in ten years. Yet  when recent graduates of teacher-education schools were surveyed, more than 50 percent reported that they were either not prepared--or poorly prepared--to use information technology in the classroom.<P>
Only 3 percent described themselves as "very well prepared." For those who reported that they were prepared to use technology at all, 73 percent said they were familiar with educational games, 61 percent could use drill-and-practice software, and 50 percent were prepared to use tutorial software. Far fewer felt able to collaborate over networks, use e-mail, or take advantage of distance-education services.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="slack"></A>
<H3>SCHOOLS FORCED TO PICK UP THE SLACK</H3>
The end result is that schools like yours have been forced to pick up the slack for teacher training. As the curriculum specialist for instructional technology for the Bellevue (Wash.) public schools, Chris Held works with both veteran teachers and those who are new to the field. The technology skills of both groups are about the same. "My impression is that there is just not much being done in schools of  education," Held says. "They're giving students Internet accounts and having them do word processing, but in terms of teaching them how to use the Internet and search and create databases, I've not had a teacher who could do that. But I have ten-year-olds who can. That's not the fault of the teachers, but it seems the programs are not adapting to change."<P>
What that means is that districts like Bellevue often have to provide the in-service training. "We're not outfitted to be a university, so it puts a lot of pressure on us," Held says.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="desert"></A>
<H3>ED SCHOOLS--DESERT TO OASIS</H3>
Not every teacher-prep program is a technology wasteland, of course. "It's the same story as with K-12 schools," says David Imig, president of the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education, an  organization that represents about 750 teacher-education programs. "Some schools of education are <A HREF="exceptions496.html">state-of-the-art places</A>. And then there are those like one that I won't name, but I'll describe: The teacher-ed program has three Apple IIe's, one of which was broken when I visited. They were pass-downs from the school district. So the kids going through that program have no more sophistication than what a IIe will do for them. You also have a disparity in commitment. Some faculty are so sophisticated that they're called upon by software companies, and at the same time you've got people who are afraid to turn on the machines."<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="reasons"></A>
<H3>FOUR REASONS FOR THE ED SCHOOL TECHNOLOGY GAP </H3>
Observers cite four main reasons why schools of education are so barren when it comes to preparing new teacher for meaningful technology integration. These are:
<OL><LI><A NAME="overlooked"></A><STRONG>Ill-Equipped and Overlooked</STRONG><BR>
Some say that the nation's software and hardware companies who offer education deals are more likely to target K-12 than schools of education. They "get more PR bang for the buck" by outfitting elementary and secondary schools with high-tech, up-to-date equipment than schools of education, says one education-school dean.<P>
In a lot of places, universities lag behind schools in both hardware and software. "More often than not, a college of education is much less well equipped than the school districts it serves," says James White, professor of instructional technology at the University of South Florida. "It's hard to be a leader when you don't have the equipment."<P>

<LI><A NAME="believers"></A><STRONG>The Need for True Believers</STRONG><BR>
Equipment questions aside, the role that technology plays <A HREF="harvard496.html">within an education school</A> has much to do with how important deans believe it is on the one hand, and how enthusiastic professors are about it on the other. Often only a small core of "true believers" use technology themselves and in their classes. "There's still a strong disdain for technology," White says. "There's the 'What's this newest wrinkle going to change?' attitude, the 'This is another fad' attitude. I think we have to wait for a number of people to retire."<P>

<LI><A NAME="technophobes"></A><STRONG>Technophobe Faculty, Resistant Students</STRONG><BR>
Dennis Hinkle, dean of the College of Education at Towson State University in Maryland, says technology will not be widely available and consistently used in schools of education until there is a change in the overall view of technology among teacher educators. Some people are simply too intimidated to jump on the technology bandwagon. In the OTA survey, 66 percent of the faculty members--most of whom had been teaching in higher education for 15 years--reported some anxiety about working with information technology. And they are likely to communicate that sense of trepidation to their students. In other cases, faculty members don't have the free time--with their obligations for teaching, research, and service--to learn about technology, and there are often few rewards for gaining competence in it.<P>
But it isn't just the faculty who can be less than enthusiastic about technology. Burt Greene, who teaches a computer and education course at Eastern Michigan University, says he sensed boredom among his students last year, even when he showed them how to access an interactive frog dissection. He discovered that his students thought of technology as "just another thing we have to learn. We keep adding things to the program, but we don't take things away," he says. "What they were saying is, 'We want to get this credential and get the heck out of here.'" The students' reactions were different this academic year when he let them know that the people who do the hiring in schools increasingly want teachers who can infuse their teaching with technology.<P>

<LI><A NAME="ghetto"></A><STRONG>Stuck in a Technology Ghetto </STRONG><BR>
It is generally agreed that technology is best learned when it is integrated across the curriculum rather than placed in a "technology ghetto." Yet almost half of the technology in the OTA survey--which included multimedia; simulations; problem solving; drill-and-practice and tutorial software; video cameras; CD-ROM; and word processing--were dealt with in only one course.<P>
Overwhelmingly, the faculty surveyed "viewed information technology as a separate type of content rather than seeing it as something that should be integrated into a content course such as an educational psychology or a methods course," the Willis research team wrote in the 1995 Technology Teacher Education Annual.<P>
Training teachers through these technology-only courses is "a little like having surgeons trained by the people who sharpen the knives," Willis says. "You need sharp knives, but that's not what surgery is all about."</OL><HR><P>

<A NAME="vision"></A>
<H3>THE VISION OF WHAT COULD BE</H3>
If new teachers are to use technology well, faculty must help them to understand not only their subject matter and technology's applications to it, but which technology to use and when to use it--and what to do if  none of the familiar tools are in place.<P>
Eric Williams, who teaches educational technology in the School of Education at Howard University in Washington, D.C., says prospective teachers must know how to cope with whatever they find--whether it's a Commodore 64, a loaded Macintosh, or nothing but a chalkboard and an overhead projector. "In our society, when the computer goes down, everything stops. But you have to be able to go back to the pencil, the hand calculator, or whatever you have," he says. "You have to have a plan A, but also a plan B, C, or D."<P>
And technology alone doesn't make for quality learning, says Marjorie DeWert, director of the Learning and Technology Center for the School of Education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "A teacher I worked with got incredibly enamored of multimedia presentations," she recalls. "But he lost sight of the fact that he is in a school that has a nature trail, a bird-watch station, a stream. The kids never went outside. They spent all their time making multimedia presentations. That's an example of losing sight of learning."<P><HR><P>

So what can be done to assure that colleges of education aren't left idling on the shoulder of the Information Superhighway, that they use technology in ways that are appropriate, and that they aren't merely dropping bytes of technology into their courses to add some "show and glitz"?<P>
Some education faculty advocate partnering with public school districts, which are often comparatively rich in technology. "Some of the best practice is being done in the schools," says Hinkle, the Towson State dean. "That's why it's so important for us to partner."<P>
At <A HREF="training496.html">Otterbein College</A> in Ohio, a project has connected elementary students and education majors via the Internet, sharpening their computer skills and applying them to real, rather than theoretical, tasks.<P>
The Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education, for instance, has established the Teacher Education Internet Server, which provides resources to support preservice and inservice teachers. And on a smaller scale, the University of Houston is collaborating with Cambridge University in England to set up an international center on technology in teacher education to provide workshops for faculty who want to learn how to use technology in their courses.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="standards"></A>
<H3>NEW STANDARDS EMERGING</H3>
Partnering relationships may be pushed along by the stance that some of the teacher-education accrediting bodies have taken. Increasingly, they are adopting standards that require all accredited programs to offer some technology training for preservice teachers. They are minimal, and they are often written as broadly as possible. But they can be a starting point, says Arthur E. Wise, president of the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. The council has created several general standards regarding knowledge and use of technology, including the expectation that teacher-education faculty "have training in and access to education-related electronic information, video resources, computer hardware, and software." Colleges that want to be affiliated with NCATE, which accredits about 500 teacher-education programs, are asked to meet those standards. But not meeting them won't lose schools their NCATE accreditation. And fewer than half of the nearly 1,300 teacher-education programs in the country are affiliated with that organization.<P>
Eighteen states require that all teachers seeking certification be trained in computers or technology--but their definitions vary widely. California, New Jersey, and Texas simply require a one-semester course in technology. In other states, more is required. The University of North Carolina Board of Governors, which oversees the state's public colleges and universities, now mandates that teacher-education faculty incorporate technology into their classes.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="market"></A>
<H3>WILL MARKET FORCES PREVAIL?</H3>
Others say that even the schools of education that are reluctant to test the technology waters will at some point be forced to dive in if they want to remain attractive to students. "It's just going to be good business for some of these schools of education to be seen as at least keeping up with things if not being on the leading edge," says Judy Beck, associate director of the Educational Research Information Center (ERIC) Clearinghouse on Teaching and Teacher Education. "If you've got a student coming out of a high school that has computer labs and its own Web home page, and where the teachers are well versed in instructional technologies, that student won't be looking at schools of ed that don't offer at least the same level of resources and expertise that his or her own high school had." Hinkle, of Towson State, says that teachers' colleges which ignore technology "won't be in business five years from now."<P>
But some observers say the longer view is the only one that makes sense.  "We constantly bemoan how slowly things are changing, and how long it's taking to do meaningful things with technology," says James White of the University of South Florida. "Change doesn't take place that quickly. We're all still pioneers, and it is all still developing."<P><HR><P>

In the vast wasteland of teacher preparation, there are a few programs that are consistently mentioned as leaders in integrating technology into their teacher training programs.<P>

Check out the exceptional programs at:
<UL><LI><A HREF="#vanderbilt">Vanderbilt University</A>

<LI><A HREF="#country">Around the Country</A>
</UL><P><HR><P>

<A NAME="vanderbilt"></A>
<H3>VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY</H3>
At Peabody College at Vanderbilt University, the technology training standard is carried by the Peabody Integrated Media Approach, in which preservice teachers consult CD-ROM "cases" featuring video, text, and graphics, as well as tools like Hypertext Notebook and Floating Clipboard.<P>
Students can access a K-12 teacher's lesson plan and interviews with the teacher as he or she reflects on whether a lesson worked. The CD-ROM allows teacher-education students to follow particular students over time and they can call up summaries and abstracts of related articles.<P>
Practicing teachers were introduced to the CD-ROM in an institute last summer. And a local school district has received the funding to use video cases as the basis for inservice workshops.<P>
In the reading methodology courses at Peabody, preservice students also use cases on literacy instruction captured on videodisc. "The cases are the anchor of the class," says Victoria Risko, professor in the Elementary Education Department and codirector of the Multimedia Case-Based Teacher Preparation Program. "We're using technology as a tool to help them understand the complexities they will encounter in the classroom. This way they can see the decisions that teachers make every  day," says Risko. "We try to help the students develop flexible thinking, to think of alternative approaches."<P>
Peabody has also been on the cutting edge of developing educational software. Its Adventures of Jason Woodbury program was designed for math instruction in middle school and contains real-life problems that require students to use problem-solving and math skills.<P>
But while the OTA report highlighted Peabody's approaches to technology, it also noted that they would be expensive for other ed schools to implement, requiring a large investment in infrastructure and staff.<P>
Barron says that Peabody professors have been very active in getting funding from federal sources--such as the National Science Foundation since 1987--to develop interactive media. "We've been fortunate to have the continued support of the NSF," she says.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="virginia"></A>
<H3>UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA</H3>
At UVA's Curry School, much emphasis has been placed on partnering with school districts. A statewide telecommunications system, the Virginia Public Education Network, also connects Curry students and faculty to schools, and the schools to the Internet. Curry pairs its students with classrooms in other ways as well. An after-school computer club was established to bring together third-year teacher-education students and fourth graders at a local elementary school. The club meets weekly, allowing the elementary students to gain confidence in their computer skills while the preservice teachers get practical experience from working with students.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="country"></A>
<H3>AROUND THE COUNTRY</H3>
The University of Wyoming uses public schools as laboratory schools, where preservice teachers can get hands-on experience using technology in teaching. The university and several public school districts are connected through a telephone network that supports interactive compressed video (ICV), which allows two-way communication between the campus and the school districts. ICV also supports Wyoming's Video Education Interactive Network, through which school and university teams develop workshops to support school restructuring.<P>
Certification standards in California, although minimal, mandate some technology training for preservice teachers. And despite a recession-inspired slowdown in equipping both schools and universities with the newest technology, James Richmond, chairman of the Department of Professional Studies and Education at California State University at Chico's Education School, sees progress. "Five years ago our students would only be assigned to evaluate a piece of software," he says. "Now they are asked to create something like a unit on the ecology of Alaskan waters. There is a use of more sophisticated technology and applications."<P>

<CENTER><H2>Harvard Ed School Gives Itself a D- in Technology</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF="#barksdale">Joye Mercer Barksdale</A></H3></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Harvard University's Graduate School of Education recently cast a critical eye on how it prepares teachers to use technology--and found itself wanting.<P>
"It wasn't as if we were doing a lousy job," says John B. Willett, professor of statistical methods who chaired the committee of experts who studied the school's technology approach. "We just weren't doing the  job." Faculty members will vote on the recommendations this spring.<P>
The committee spent a year studying how the resources in the school's Technology in Education (TIE) concentration could be brought to bear throughout the school. "We approached this not just as a refurbishing of programs for students, but also as a reassessment of the ways in which technology can help all of us," says George Brackett, a lecturer on education who is chairman of the TIE concentration, which prepares students for careers as developers of educational technology.<P>
<STRONG>Recharging teacher education</STRONG><BR>
As it now stands, "it's the adventurous preservice and graduate teachers who are taking courses in educational technology," Willett says. "Now they are elective, and the courses may not have been designed with their needs in mind. What we're proposing is that teacher-education and educational-technology people get together  and customize offerings, so that all teachers will be exposed to technology."<P>
Adds Brackett, "My students, the designers and developers of technology, have rudimentary notions of what a classroom is like. They could benefit from more sophisticated ideas about how a classroom works. And preservice teachers need a better idea of <A HREF="exceptions496.html">how technology works and doesn't work</A>."<P>
<STRONG>Equipping for the future</STRONG><BR>
The committee also said that if technology was to have a bigger role in the teacher-education programs, a massive investment in equipment would be needed. Aside from preparing more classrooms to support full technology use by professors and students, the central piece of the infrastructure plan is a state-of-the-art electronic laboratory. "The lab will serve as the locus for cutting-edge research on the educational end--the application of principles of learning and development to improve educational technology--but also as a place where educators can practice the use of technology in an  educational setting," says Brackett.<P>
<STRONG>Looking at the larger issues</STRONG><BR>
 Beyond improving the technology savvy of educators, the committee recommended that the school offer short,  intensive summer technology courses for state and federal policy makers. The courses could focus on the social impact of technology, including  questions of equity and fairness. "If you need expensive machinery to participate in this new world, it means that people without resources won't be able to participate," Willett says. "Will the rich simply get richer in the schools of the future? How do you disseminate this new technology in a way that's equitable?" <P>

<H3>By <A HREF="#barksdale">Joye Mercer Barksdale</A></H3></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Patti Albaugh, an associate professor of education at Otterbein College in Ohio believes students--whether they're fourth graders or juniors in college--learn technology best when they have an "authentic context" for using it. So a year ago, she and an elementary school teacher devised a collaborative project that connected a fourth-grade class and an elementary education-methods class as they followed the adventures of a little boy inside an enormous peach.<P>
With Roald Dahl's book <EM>James and the Giant Peach</EM> as the backdrop for their connection, 18 preservice teachers at Otterbein and 21 East Knox Elementary School pupils became "keypals" through e-mail. The project was the invention of Albaugh and Ann Gardner, an East Knox teacher, who met over an education listserv. "I'm always looking for links to real kids, teachers, and classrooms," Albaugh says.  "I asked her, 'What if your class adopts mine?' The idea was that the college students would have an audience for the instructional activities they would be planning and get some feedback from the children."<P>

<STRONG>Becoming keypals</STRONG><BR>
After the two groups got acquainted via e-mail, the Otterbein students posed weekly discussion questions focusing on the travails of James, an orphan living with two mean aunts who finds adventure and meets a host of fascinating insects inside a giant peach. They also used the book to generate math and science activities.<P>
Having the fourth graders critique their suggested assignments via e-mail--commenting on what seemed fun as well as interesting--was especially helpful to the Otterbein students. "The student that I worked with didn't always understand the activities I was suggesting, so that made me rethink my teaching explanations," says Brian Zimmerly, a fifth-grade teacher at Lakeville Elementary School who took Albaugh's methods class.<P>
Both classes also spent a month collecting and comparing weather data at the same time every day, to determine whether the 50 miles between them made a difference in what the conditions were. And at the end of the semester, the Otterbein students visited their keypals at East Knox.<P>
A purposeful collaboration. Miriam LaShey, who graduated from Otterbein in January and is a long-term substitute teacher for the Elgin Local School District, says the project gave her enough confidence to imagine how technology, including the Internet, could work in her classroom. "I think it was a real nice way of awakening students to the importance of another tool," she says.<P>
Albaugh plans to continue the linkage between preservice teachers at Otterbein and East Knox fourth graders. The beauty of the keypal project, she notes, is that it doesn't require much in terms of technology resources; one PC on each end will do. The only real requirement is that the collaboration be purposeful.<P>
"Having a common book or purpose seems to be central," she says. "Rather  than just having students log on and look for information, we were trying to model the notion of having real tasks."<P>
<STRONG>Reality hits</STRONG><BR>
 The downside, Albaugh says, is that Otterbein-trained teachers often find themselves in technology-poor classrooms. "Our students go out into the schools, and they often don't see the stuff we're proclaiming," Albaugh says. She says higher education should help bring technology into more K-12 classrooms by working with local schools to write grant proposals that could help them get hardware and software. "If the classrooms aren't there, then we have to help create them," says Albaugh.<P>

<A NAME="present"></A>
<H2>THE POLARIZED PRESENT</H2>
Education reform has so polarized public opinion that the last decade will be remembered as  either one of the great revolutions in American social history or one of its grandest failures.<P>
On one point all sides concur: American schools have not lived up to their potential. In international comparisons, we are a perennial bottom-dweller. Vast numbers of our high school graduates do not have the skills for even entry-level jobs. And every year our schools fail to reach an increasing number of disaffected students.<P>
There's no shortage of blame, either, for how schools got into this shape or why we can't seem to fix them. What is emerging now, though, is a striking lack of consensus about how to proceed. The national standard-setting process (including Goals 2000) that seemed certain to provide a framework for change is foundering. And while education leaders have developed model programs galore, they have not been able to expand beyond promising pilots or even to persuade the majority of citizens that these changes must occur.<P>
With few exceptions, political leaders have behaved like weather vanes in a gust. Pacesetter states such as <A HREF="#kentucky">Kentucky</A> and <A HREF="#oregon">Oregon</A> have stayed on track with broad plans for school change by making midcourse adjustments, but other states, such as <A HREF="backlash296.html">Connecticut</A>, have folded reform initiatives under pressure from conservative coalitions. <P>
The <A HREF="public296.html">public</A>--including many <A HREF="#kentucky">teachers</A>--continues to treat school change with a mixture of disdain and fear. Most are simultaneously impatient with the pace of reform and resistant to it.<P>
Supporters of school change, meanwhile, argue that schools can't afford to stand still or turn back, despite some initial failures with education reform. "We know that what we had and what we have are not good enough," says Robin Willner, director of corporate social policy and programs for IBM Corp. "We cannot accept that. We have to keep going."<P>
About the only thing all sides share is the idea that technology is part of the answer. For example, <A HREF="public296.html">in a survey of Americans' views on education by the Public Agenda Foundation</A>, which otherwise dumped water on key tenets of reform. 80 percent saw computer skills as "absolutely essential" to children's education.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="basics"></A>
<H3>A SWING TOWARD THE BASICS</H3>
We are, in a sense, at a crossroads in 1996, wondering whether it's time to retreat or push on--and in what direction. Although most people agree that schools need to raise academic standards and require students to solve complex problems, they often support opposing strategies for achieving those goals.<P>
While many education reformers are moving ahead with performance assessments and literature-based reading instruction, resisters are rallying behind multiple-choice tests and phonics workbooks. Some of the heat has come from conservative groups like the Christian Coalition, but not all. In an earlier <A HREF="public296.html">Public Agenda</A> survey, researchers found "widespread discomfort with new teaching methods...using calculators to teach math, teaching composition without teaching spelling, and grouping students with different skills together in one class don't make intuitive sense to most Americans," the report stated.<P>
The American Federation of Teachers recently launched a national campaign to push for safety, discipline, and basic instruction in public schools. Seemingly turning his back on education reform, AFT president Albert Shanker said in a recent interview with Education Week that the union is organizing against "an arrogant, small group of people--district by district, state by state, and nationally--who think that no matter what 86 percent of the people want, those are just stupid people....Innovation is one of the things that makes you lose the support of the public."<P>
A far different point of view is expressed by the Cross City Campaign for Urban School Reform, a coalition of reformers working in major cities. They argue that urban students, who typically trail the pack, will never reach their potential as long as central bureaucracies control school budgets and curriculum. In a new publication, Reinventing Central Office: A Primer for Successful Schools, Cross City provides a how-to manual for ceding control to democratically elected school councils.  "We have ample evidence of successful, small, autonomous, and equitable urban schools from which we can learn," the report stated. "The unfortunate truth is that many districts don't seem to trust their school staff and community members to make decisions in the best interest of the children."<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="radical"></A>
<H3>RADICAL DEPARTURES AND ZERO ACTION</H3>
However estranged, reformers and traditionalists have at least one thing in common--both are trying to work within the existing system to improve public schools. A third group has veered off in another direction, urging states to support charter schools, vouchers, and privatization.<P>
Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for Education Reform--a Washington-based organization that promotes charter schools, vouchers, and privatization--says the national debate about how to shape schools provides a strong argument for educational choice. "There are lots of models to choose from," Allen says. "The problem is that most people don't have any choice."<P>
This tug-of-war may one day be viewed as part of a healthy debate. But it has kept most schools stuck at the starting gate, afraid to break from tradition but equally fearful about being left in the dust.<P>
"We haven't changed the nature of schooling yet," says Robin Willner. "There are a lot of good individual projects. But schools look remarkably like they did 100 years ago."<P>
Partly, that's to be expected. Traditionally, the role of a school was to follow society, not lead it, says David Conley, associate professor of education at the University of Oregon and author of <EM>Roadmap to Restructuring</EM> and <EM>Are You Ready to Restructure?</EM> Almost overnight, he says, American business and political leaders decided that schools should focus on training students for the future instead of just passing on the knowledge of the past. The shift in goals led to inevitable conflicts.<P>
Schools and school districts--at least those that were interested in changing--spent years trying to fit new programs into old structures. There were no "fundamental shifts in the way we teach and learn," says Conley.<P>
Technology is a good example. Educators typically viewed it as a gilded add-on instead of a tool of reform. Conley, a former assistant superintendent in Colorado, says his district initially put every computer into labs "and then locked the doors and hired people to run them. Teachers never had to go in and learn how to use them," he says. "There was very low literacy and very low integration."<P>
Such examples are fairly typical. A recent study by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), the recently closed down research arm of Con-gress, found that most school computers were not in classrooms where teachers could use them regularly as instructional tools, regardless of their teaching approach. In addition, the OTA found that of the $2.13 billion that public schools spent on technology in 1993, less than 15 percent was used to train and support teachers, critical to making changes in what goes on in the classroom. <P><HR><P>

<A NAME="change"></A>
<H3>CHANGE, BUT WITHOUT A PLAN</H3>
Deep reflection about school change has not occurred at many levels. Schools and school districts have responded to the call for improvement by jumping from one curriculum idea to the next, treating education reform strategies like flavors in a taste-testing contest.<P>
"People say, 'Let's have a four-period day. Let's have multiage grouping. Let's do portfolios,'" Conley says. "There's a whole conceptual piece that has to come before that, or at least in tandem with it. Why are we doing all this? Otherwise, people don't see the need for fundamental transformation. People will change when they understand what it is and why they have to do it, and have some reasonable probability of being successful."<P>
Recently, businesses, foundations, and government agencies that had invested heavily in school improvements over the past decade have begun seeking more bang for their buck. IBM, for example, has stopped funding a variety of reform projects in favor of a comprehensive strategy called Reinventing Education. In September 1994, IBM earmarked $25 million in equipment, technical aid, and funds for ten school districts and states that were selected from hundreds of applicants. Over the next five years, IBM will use technology to help the ten break down the barriers to reform.<P>
For example, Philadelphia public schools will work with IBM to set up laboratories where successful instructional strategies can be modeled for teachers through distance learning. Vermont, which has spent the last six years developing statewide portfolio-based student assessments, will work with IBM to get all student work and teacher critiques on a computer network. The goal is to improve the consistency of portfolio scoring and enable students, teachers, and parents to quickly recognize excellent work.<P>
The National Science Foundation, a government agency that is charged with supporting basic research in math and science, has taken a similar tack by requiring the school districts it assists to develop comprehensive plans for school change. The foundation targeted the 25 cities with the highest child-poverty rates and gave each a grant to study its own education needs. (Rural districts were added last year.) In 1994, the foundation awarded additional grants of up to $15 million each to nine cities that had completed a competitive review process. Among other reforms, the cities must develop a plan for blending technology throughout the K-12 curriculum. The foundation will require school districts to submit extensive evidence that the funded reforms have produced changes in the classroom.<P>
"While it's true that there have been a number of years of reform, the comprehensiveness of the effort really varies," says Dan Burke, program director of the National Science Foundation's urban systemic initiatives. "You might have a very good professional development program in the summer, but then teachers go back to school and have no support, so it fades. Or they might have support, but there's no serious curriculum changes. Or they might have a serious curriculum, but it's not required of students to take it. . . .To really achieve reform requires dealing with all the components."<P>
In <A HREF="#elpaso">El Paso, Texas</A>, for example, the foundation is working with a collaborative of three school districts that, among other things, are realigning their curricula with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics standards and using mentor teachers to help train colleagues.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="elpaso"></A>
<H3>EL PASO, TEXAS:<BR>THEMES OF RESPONSIBILITY AND LOCAL CONTROL</H3>
Anthony Trujillo, superintendent of El Paso's Ysleta Independent School District, is an education reformer for these times. He agrees that the local schools have ample room for improvement--but he believes that sharing responsibility is the key to change. Administrators have to quit controlling and start supporting, and teachers have to adjust their methods and attitudes to help all children succeed, he says. But students also have to be willing to work harder and parents have to lend a hand. <P>
"We are constantly talking about change for the other guy, but we never look inward," said Trujillo, who came out of retirement three years ago to "prove that good things can happen to poor children" by leading a district of 50,000 students, most of them Hispanic and from low-income families.<P>
Trujillo flattened the bureaucracy and sent everyone from the central office's instructional division out to schools. He encouraged teachers who didn't believe that all children can succeed to find other jobs--and watched about 30 percent of the staff leave. He refused to let the NSF project focus on a few pilots schools and, instead, involved schools districtwide. He eliminated remedial courses in high school, requiring all students to take college-prep math, science, and English.<P>
"Does that mean they all pass?" Trujillo asks rhetorically. "No, but we had better find a way to help  them."<P>
Trujillo also requires parents to attend classes two hours a week if they want their children to attend summer school--last summer about 40,000 parents and 24,000 students showed up. He plans to extend the attendance requirement for parents during the regular school year.<P>
If you accept the idea that it takes a whole village to raise a child, Trujillo says, then you've got to mobilize and educate the village.<P>
The investment is starting to pay dividends. Three years ago, all 54 Ysleta schools scored in the bottom two categories on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TASS). This past school year, mirroring a statewide trend of improvement, none of Ysleta's schools scored in the lowest category, and 15 moved into the "recognized" category, second from the top. Although none of Ysleta's schools have reached the "exemplary," or top level, Trujillo expects them to get there within five years.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="kentucky"></A>
<H3>HENDERSON, KENTUCKY:<BR>REACHING TEACHERS</H3>
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to change in schools is teacher buy-in. Most reform strategies involve a fundamental shift for the teacher from lecturer to coach, from textbook-driven instruction to diverse materials and real-life applications. Some teachers don't want to bother to change their teaching methods late in their careers; others have seen so many education trends come and go that they're not about to embrace change without a lot of convincing. Most just need practice and support.<P>
"Anything you're going to do with education reform starts and stops with professional development," says Johnny Duckworth, principal of Chandler Elementary School in Henderson, Ky.<P>
Under Duckworth's leadership, Chandler's staff has been actively responding to the changes introduced through the 1990 Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA), the first attempt in the nation to rebuild a state school system from scratch.<P>
Joyce Hamilton, a former Chandler teacher now in her first year as principal at Holland Elementary School in Holland, Ind., recalls the start of the 1990-91 school year when Duckworth told teachers they could no longer base their instruction on textbooks. He sent them to countless training sessions--including many on technology--then had them support one another while they tried out new strategies. Computers became part of the daily class routine; staff explored using technology to develop individual education plans for each child. Along the way, Hamilton said, Duckworth supplied teachers with reams of research about why they should change.<P>
 The rapid pace Duckworth put the teachers through produced incredible stress, Hamilton recalls, but it got people working toward a common goal. Last year, Chandler's staff received financial rewards for exceeding expectations on the state's new student assessments.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="oregon"></A>
<H3>EUGENE, OREGON:<BR>REWORKING REFORM</H3>
In Oregon, the 1991 Education Act for the 21st Century--a broad initiative to boost students' academic and vocational skills--has sparked public opposition, fanned by those who twisted it into an ideological debate about outcomes-based education. Last spring the Oregon legislature responded to public pressure and revised the law. Although many features were left intact, including the new certificates of mastery that require high school students to meet academic performance standards, the state made it optional for students to compile portfolios to receive the graduation certificates and said schools could issue traditional diplomas, certificates, or both.<P>
At North Eugene High School in Eugene, Ore., principal Bob Anderson says that in hindsight he would have done more to explain Act-inspired changes to students and their parents. The school's standards for technology, for example, require students to demonstrate their understanding of the computer through writing, research, and multimedia projects.<P>
A university research team worked closely with teachers to support instructional changes such as using writing portfolios instead of multiple-choice tests to assess students. Teachers  had time to try out the strategies in pilot stages.<P>
In surveys, students said they didn't want to return to the old days, but they were still confused about the changes. Some students have turned in weak portfolios because they couldn't juggle multiple-subject assignments. Others haven't wanted to work as hard in class, leading some to drop out of school. <P>
Last spring, Anderson began meeting with small groups of students and teachers to identify some of the snafus. He has had similar meetings with parents. "I have found out that with communications, it takes about eight times to get something over," he says. <P>
Anderson says some of the most encouraging signs are the graduates who return from Ivy League colleges and report that their high school training has put them ahead of their classmates. They say that they while they can easily complete independent projects, many of their fellow students don't know how to research, take on long-term projects, and make their own decisions. <P><HR><P>

<A NAME="common"></A>
<H3>CAN COMMON GROUND BE FOUND?</H3>
In a sense, that example goes to the heart of the debate on American public education, and the questions so many people are asking themselves. How do we get every student prepared for the next level of learning? How do we make sure that some students won't inevitably end up on the losing end? How do we get all schools to provide a consistent level of quality instruction? While even the bitterest of foes in the reform battles would agree on the end goals, the "how" remains an open question--although it's clear that technology has a role to play.<P>
Until we can find common ground on the means to the end--or at least carve out ground large enough for many means to coexist--education reform will remain a tragedy of conflicting ideals.<P><HR><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H2>WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS:<BR>BASICS vs. REFORM</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF="#holland">Holly Holland</A></H3>
Americans are impatient with education reforms that appear to ignore concerns about safe, orderly, and rigorous schools. They want schools to provide a good foundation in the "basics" before they get to a reform agenda.<P>
That's the message of several national opinion studies conducted over the past few years by the Public Agenda Foundation, a nonpartisan research and education organization based in New York.<P>
In the 1994 report <EM>First Things First</EM>, 1,200 randomly selected adults said they want children to learn to read and write English, perform mathematical computations by hand, and have a good grasp of science, history, and geography. Sixty-one percent believe that the standards for these subjects are too low in their local schools.<P>
"People have enormous anxiety about their children learning basics," says Deborah Wadsworth, the foundation's executive director. "There is such an opportunity here for reformers...to make basics the first rung on the ladder to higher-order skills and to find ways to demonstrate in reality that progress is being made."<P>
Others suggest that this is already occurring. Donna Hampton, an elementary music teacher and mother of four from La Grange, Ky., says she was strongly opposed at first to the changes mandated by the <A HREF="ex296.html#kentucky">Kentucky Education Reform Act</A>. But she became a believer in school reform after seeing daily evidence that her children were learning both fundamental and advanced skills.<P>
Hampton's sixth-grade daughter completes complex research papers that include proper grammar, spelling, and math. Her son, who attends a multiage primary class, has learned his multiplication tables and studies spelling words--like metamorphosis and insecticide--related to his lessons.<P>
Because two of her kids attended Kentucky public schools in the "good old days," Hampton knows from experience that her younger children "would never have had the opportunity to work at this high level" if not for reform.<P>
Reformers must do a better job of explaining what they are trying to do, says David Mintz, senior associate of the National Alliance for Restructuring Education. "If a parent or a businessperson walks into the school and asks about spelling tests, he or she needs to be made aware of how spelling is assessed," says Mintz. "And you should spend some time explaining why it's okay for a classroom to be noisy when it wasn't okay 20 years ago."<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H2>RIDING THE BACKLASH:<BR>ADVICE FOR REFORMERS, BY REFORMERS</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF="#holland">Holly Holland</A></H3>
Once heralded for its graduation portfolios and performance outcomes, Littleton, Colo., reversed course in 1993 when a "back-to-basics" majority took over the local school board (spurring one-fourth of the district's teachers and half the administrators to quit). This fall, a group of moderate school board members gained control, pledging to let parents select from a menu of progressive and traditional models.<P>
Marjorie Ledell, an educational consultant who served on the board during its progressive era, wasn't surprised by the zig-zag. "If there's one big, loud message that we're hearing around the country," Ledell says, "it's that people want things to be in addition to what we're doing, not either-or."<P>

Other advice for reformers:<P>

<STRONG>Mix change with choice</STRONG>: The <A HREF="ex296.html#oregon">Eugene, Ore.</A> public school system has stayed ahead of the controversy over the 1991 Oregon Education Act for the 21st Century by giving local school councils the flexibility to meet the state's new standards in their own way. "It's always easier to comply with a state law when you think it's your idea," says Kathryn Dysart, the district's director of public affairs.<P>
<STRONG>Encourage open debate</STRONG>: "The rumor mill and church bulletins and the Internet give people the means to communicate if you don't let them go public," warns Robert Sexton, executive director of the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence, a public advocacy group based in Lexington, Ky. In Kentucky's recent gubernatorial race, the Republican candidate pledged to repeal major portions of the the <A HREF="ex296.html#kentucky">Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA)</A>, a six-year-old plan that completely overhauled the public school system. His Democratic opponent, on the other hand, initiated on ongoing public debate about KERA. In November, the Democrat won by 2 percentage points in a near-record turnout election. Kentuckians apparently want to stay the course of education reform--for now.<P>
<STRONG>Listen and learn</STRONG>: Two years ago, after the Colorado legislature passed a law requiring new academic standards,  Jane Urschel, director of governmental relations for the Colorado Association of School Boards, held a series of brown-bag lunches at major corporations around the state to listen to concerns from a diverse workforce. The feedback led to changes in the standards, she said. It also broadened support, so much so that a recent bill to scuttle the standards never got out of committee. "Educators often ask, "Why do I need permission to do what I know is best?'" Urschel says. "I tell them it's because the public will have the last word"--one way or the other.<P>

<CENTER><H2>Television Catches Its SecondWave</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF="#strommen"> Erik Strommen</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Think that television has been eclipsed as an educational tool? Think again. Here's how classroom TV and video are evolving from passive instruments to interactive tools.<P>

<A NAME="over"></A>
<H3>So You Thought TV Was Over...</H3>
The technology buzz in education these days is all about interactivity, so it is not surprising that computers have come to dominate almost every discussion about the future of teaching and learning. The interactive revolution has made previously established technologies--filmstrips, cassette players, even movie projectors--suddenly seem hopelessly antique. And of all the classroom technologies being swept aside, television would seem to be the least mourned.Television's own educational revolution saw it soar to great heights, only to crash and burn in the souring of America's love affair with the flickering screen coupled with TV's failure to deliver on the promise of educational achievement for all who watched. Blamed for everything from shortened attention spans to the end of literacy, TV at first glance wouldn't seem to even merit a wistful glance in the rearview mirror as we veer into the passing lane on the information superhighway. However, not only may such an attitude be short-sighted, but reports of television's imminent demise as an educational tool are premature as well. In the shadow of CD-ROMs, multimedia, and the Internet, television is undergoing a renaissance as a teaching tool. Instructional television may turnout to have more staying power than anyone ever thought.<P><HR>

<A NAME="passive"></A>
<H3>TV's First Wave: Passive is as PassiveDoes</H3>
The arguments that first brought television into the classroom were economic: A single teacher could be broadcast into many classrooms at once, reaching many more students than just her own. It was a model in perfect sync with 1950s thinking about education. "Early televised instruction was wed to the theory of the master teacher, which was dominant at the time," says Dr. Keith Mielke,senior research fellow emeritus at Children's Television Workshop. "The idea was to take the very best teaching, and make it available to everyone." It was,Mielke recalls, the "syringe theory" of education: "I've got this knowledge here, in this syringe, and--zap!--all I have to do is inject it into you."<P>
Early televised instruction was very primitive in execution. It was, after all, the era of black-and-white TV, and teachers would talk directly to the camera in a studio, while classrooms of students dutifully watched at remote sites. No interaction between teacher and student was possible. Television meshed perfectlywith an education theory that saw learning as a passive process.<P>
But there were practical barriers to the ideal of providing uniform, high quality instruction via television. In the days before cable and the VCR, broadcast TV posed serious logistical problems of timing and scheduling. "There was a big clock on the screen in the classroom," says Mielke, "and at ten minutes to two,say, you had to get your students organized and attentive in front of the television, paying attention, so they could watch." Teachers had little choice but to sit by in darkened rooms while their students focused on the screen--a style of classroom viewing that is prevalent even today.<P><HR>

<A NAME="tube"></A>
<H3>Turning Against the Tube</H3>
The death knell for television as a mass educational medium, at least for awhile, came from research into its effects. Despite its much-vaunted pedagogical potential, the results of extensive research revealed that instructional television featuring master educators was actually no better in improving test scores than face-to-face, teacher-to-student interaction in the typical "live"classroom. <P>
In addition, there was a change in attitude about television itself. The wide-eyed optimism had faded over the years, and by 1963, television was being decried as a "vast wasteland" by Newton Minow of the Federal Communications Commission. TV began to acquire all the unattractive nicknames we give it today:Idiot box, brain drain, plug-in drug, boob tube. With its relentless advertising,and vapid programming, television had gone from being America's wunderkind to being its problem child. In 1985, Neil Postman could publish his polemic,"Amusing Ourselves to Death," and found a receptive audience when he blamed television for everything from the end of literacy to a cultural mindset that values entertainment over serious thought, and immediate gratification overlong-term goals. The idea that television could have value as a tool for learning became more likely to provoke snorts of incredulity than nods of eager approval.<P>

<A NAME="box"></A>
<H3>No Escaping the Box</H3>Despite skepticism over its value as a tool for learning, television was--and is--impossible to ignore, considering its dominant role in our culture. Some psychologists argue that television has changed forever how children learn--that kids today are "visual learners." Others say that, as a medium that touches all Americans, television should be a permanent addition to the palette of classroom pedagogies. "This is the MTV and Nintendo generation," says Ruth Ann Burns, vice president and director of educational resources at WNET in New York says. "You have to reach kids where they're at. But when they enter the classroom, its very gray...a throwback to another generation." <P>
Today's television advocates also argue that there's a place for TV in the array of technology resources every school should have--at least in part because TV is already there. "TV is the most accessible technology for teachers," she says. "Almost every school in American has a TV and VCR." The key to making the second wave successful, these observers say, is changing the way teachers and students use television.<P><HR>

<A NAME="teachers"></A>
<H3>Putting Teachers in Charge</H3>
For its part, WNET has spearheaded the National Teacher Training Institute (NTTI), an ambitious new project that works with scores of teachers each year to modernize classroom television use. NTTI's extensive training program emphasizes viewing as just one aspect of an integrated learning agenda. "You have to use the video as a source of information," says Burns, who serves as executive director for NTTI. "You have to preview it and prime your students to look for specific things. Viewing has to be part of an active learning process." She says teachers and students both are so used to simply sitting back and watching TV that when they experience active viewing, the result is almost an epiphany. <P>
NTTI graduate Valerie Lyle, a fifth-grade teacher at Lincoln Elementary School in rural Marion, Illinois, has been using video in her classroom in just this way for five years now. For Lyle, presenting information in more than just one modality is essential for today's classroom. "Children have different learning styles," she says. "Some students learn better when then hear and see, not just read." <P>
Lyle very often shows several minutes of video footage in the context of a specific lesson. For example, for a recent social studies activity, her students watched a segment about the Mayas from 500 Nations, a television documentary on Native Americans, then broke into groups to discuss what they saw. Later, students went to the library to do further research on the Mayas as well as the Aztecs and the Incas; students then had to write a persuasive paper on which native culture they would like to be part of. Lyle says she uses television even more frequently in her math and science segments, with each segment leading to a hands-on activity. "It takes a lot of thought and prep time to create video-based lessons," says Lyle. "But layering the material, using differing learning styles --hopefully you'll hit everybody."<P>
Christopher Ward, another graduate of the NTTI program, uses video almost every day to teach science in the Mamaroneck High School in Mamaroneck, New York. Before NTTI, Ward says he would evaluate videos on an all or nothing basis-if not all of a tape was relevant, he had no use for it. Now he looks at video resources in a whole new way. "Almost anything is great, as long as it presents information in an interesting way," he says. "If it's a video of a boring guy talking with compelling images of geological formations on-screen, I just turn down the sound and fast-forward to the segments I want." <P><HR>

The new television technologies that give teachers control over what they show their students also allow them to ignore physical barriers to learning. The modern segregation of children into schools and classrooms was born of the best intentions, the idea being that education needs a special, protected environment in which to flourish. Classrooms were conceived as greenhouses for young minds, but they've too often ended up feeling like prison cells, with teachers and their students isolated together and dependent on the printed word for entrees into other worlds. Television can take students to China, to medieval England, to Jupiter or inside an amoebae. As a visual medium, TV can also ease access to complex concepts that print has a hard time conveying. Ken Abbott, a high school science teacher at Mephan High School, in Massapequa, New York believes video is successful because it makes abstract issues more concrete. "Take physics," he says. "I have a tape on electro-magnetism that demonstrates magnetic fields using computer animation. Or planetary motion." <P><HR>

<A NAME="reading"></A>
<H3>Reading, Writing...Viewing?</H3>
If television and video have become tools for active learning, they are not unexamined tools in today's classrooms. Students are being taught to scrutinize television, film, advertising, music videos--all of the media that engulfs them--as part of what is called critical viewing or media literacy. (See <A HREF="resources1295.html">Resources for Media Literacy</A>.)  "Critical viewing is like critical thinking," says Mark Gorulczenko, vice president of education initiatives at the Central Education Network, a regional PBS organization. "It's the ability to sort out the real from the imagined, to identify the intent of the video, to skeptically look at it and ask what it is about." <P>
Ward often uses the fantasy/reality distinction as part of his lessons. After teaching a unit on the rain forest, for example, he followed up with clips from the film The Medicine Man, which is set in a rain forest. "I ask the kids: 'Is this a real rain forest? How do you know?'" says Ward. "When they look at it like scientists, they'll find a mistaken detail and know its not real." Ward integrates critical viewing into literature study as well, having students read a book and then watch the movie version with an eye to how it reflects personal interpretation of the work. "Compare Wuthering Heights, the book versus the movie," he says, "Or the Andromeda Strain. You can ask kids: If you were the director, how would you have done it?"<P>
Many educators see critical viewing as type of literacy that is crucial for informed citizens. "Most children do not realize that what they see on TV has been edited, has a point of view," says Burns. "Just as there are ways that writing is put together, there are ways that video is put together. It's a different way of thinking." Fifth-grade teacher Lyle agrees. "When you are viewing for pleasure, that's different from what you do in the classroom.," she says. "Viewing to gain information is a different kind of viewing. You have to be taught how to do that."<P><HR>

<A NAME="consumers"></A>
<H3>From Consumers to Producers of TV</H3>
The rebirth of television in the classroom was made possible by simple improvements in the technology, including VCRs and remote controls. Technological advances have also made it possible for students to switch roles from being viewers to creators. Camcorders, editing equipment, and other tools for the production and manipulation of video are now inexpensive and readily available. <P>
While certain districts have had television studios for years, most have been used to teach production skills. But in the new wave, video creation has been woven into subject area classes as a tool for student expression and a vehicle for cooperative learning. "Video production gives children a chance to engage in complex, creative activities," says Bill Tally, senior research associate at the Center for Children and Technology/EDC. "It's an excellent activity for a project-based curriculum. It's highly engaging, it's collaborative, and it mobilizes many different skills." <P><HR>

<A NAME="relationship"></A>
<H3>Changing Kids' Relationship to the Tube</H3>
Combining video production with visual literacy and self-expression is the mission of a 10-year-old organization called Rise & Shine productions, a program of the Reedlen Centers for Children and Families in New York City. The organization sends media artists into schools to work with teachers to make video production an integral part of the curriculum. Laura Vural, executive director and producer at the organization, says that while television is a pervasive influence on children's lives, for the most part they don't get to influence television at all. "Student video production changes children's relationship with television," says Vural. "It reflects who they are, and lets them talk back to their television set." <P>
A typical Rise & Shine project has two phases. In the first, children in the classroom tape original poetry readings, interview each other, or write a news show. As they work, students learn the rudiments of video scripting, editing, and camera work necessary to create their own productions.In the second phase, kids create a collaborative video production integrated with their curriculum. Instead of writing a report, the children might produce a documentary or dramatic re-enactment based on what they are studying. "The beauty of video," says Vural, "is that it is by nature interdisciplinary. Writing skills come into play. The children have to learn about the content area, so reading and researching skills are at work. Art, theater, music, and science can all come together as well." <P>
Student video production is also valuable for developing critical viewing skills. "Making their own productions gives kids the groundwork they need to reflect on the media they watch," says Tally. "When you understand how techniques such as close-ups are used to create emotional effects, and how those effects are used in persuasive communication, that's a kind of literacy."	<P>
Student video production can have a profound impact on teachers as well. "It changes the nature of what the teacher does," Vural says. "The teacher needs to be a facilitator, needs to do prep work to make resources available, build in the assessment component right from the start." <P><HR>

<A NAME="distance"></A>
<H3>Distance Learning, 1990s-Style</H3>
Against this background of radical transformation of classroom TV there has been a quiet re-emergence of the televised teacher guiding learning from afar.<P>
But this time around it's distance learning on a larger scale--instead of 20 sites in one district there may be 100 scattered across the country. And thanks to advances in digital media, the TV teacher lecturing at passive students is giving way to interaction. During a live broadcast, for example, there might be a "your time" section in which off-site students and teachers do hands-on activities together; there is likely to be phone or fax communication with the broadcast site as well.<P>
But perhaps the most striking difference between 1950s televised teaching and today's distance learning is in the attitude of teachers. While many teachers in the past felt threatened by the studio teacher who was supposed to replace them, the new model is that the studio teacher is an aide. "The reality is that the lessons can't work without the involvement of the classroom teacher," says Mary Lou Ray, vice president for learning services at the Pacific Mountain Network, a PBS affiliate. "Distance learning is now the collaboration of two professionals helping children learn."<P>
Distance learning can also be a valuable tool for teacher professional development, says Ray. She describes research showing that, over three years, teachers using a studio teacher for science teaching went from working hard to just do the activities required of them to actually emulating the constructivist strategies and methods of the studio teacher. <P>
Another unexpected benefit of distance learning has been the bringing together of children from different classrooms via technology links. Students talking directly with students at faraway locations leads to significant exchanges of ideas, experiences, and information. "It's a new type of learning experience," says Burns, "and there's a real social benefit to having a diverse mix of kids communicating. Burns believes that distance learning will ultimately transform the nature of schooling and learning itself, by removing the need to bring learners to a single place in order to gain access to education. "We haven't even begun to explore what we can do," she says. "We need to look at homes, businesses, and other places we can deliver instruction."<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="blender"></A>
<H3>Into the Technology Blender</H3>
Technological advances and a new understanding of video's strengths as a learning tool have brought TV back into education with a vengeance. But where does TV go from here? Technological improvements continue to abound. And the computer has opened up even more new possibilities for teachers to transform classroom practice than those provided by TV. Given the crooked path that led to today's patterns of technology usage in schools, what further surprises are still to come? <P>
Many educators see a coming convergence of video with interactive technologies and the Internet, allowing materials to be disseminated online for users to preview and download at will; future progress, they say, hinges on making that merged technology available to teachers. "I'd hope to see a classroom version of the ability to access any information you want, through a cable, phone line, or satellite," Gorulczenko says. "The teacher in the classroom could look at 130 programs, search using topics she's most interested in, and get that 10-minute clip right into the classroom ." <P>
Others are doubtful that, in a climate of budget cuts, the interactive revolution will come rolling into the classroom anytime soon. "Access, both from a financial and equipment standpoint, is one of the biggest challenges schools face," Ray says. "If you look at what percentage of schools have enough computers for their students, have Internet access, and so on, it's so small compared to TV access. There will be a totally digital environment, but it's not going to happen tomorrow. We're in a transition time, and television is going to play a strong role in that transition."<P><HR>

<A NAME="freight"></A>
<H3>Who Will Pay the Freight?</H3>
Whether the digital future is slow or fast in coming, though, educators will always be looking for video worth having -- video with appropriate content and an affordable price tag. However, as production costs go up and school budgets go down, educational programming is increasingly being provided by media companies, not education organizations. Whittle Communications' experiment with advertising-supported Channel One is a case in point.<P>
"Historically, Channel One was significant because a private company now decides what current events are worth broadcasting," says Michael Sullivan, executive director of the Agency for Instructional Technology. Increasingly, schools are becoming places where other businesses--cable companies, software manufacturers, broadcasters--make the decisions about educational content because they are the ones producing it. Ironically, just as teachers are mastering video as a teaching tool, he says, "they end up having more control over how learning occurs but less control over what is learned."<P>
The budget squeeze affects classroom TV use in other ways as well. As a teacher who frequently uses video, Ward says "nonliberal recording rights" are a major hurdle. "If you can just record it, you're set," he says. "But if you have to buy it, you'll spend a fortune. Who has that kind of money?" Teachers have been able to rely on PBS and its affiliates--along with organizations such as Cable in the Classroom--to provide quality video at a low cost, as well as on-air broadcasts with generous recording rights. But with the Republican Congress out to gut PBS's public mission, today's teachers may live to see that resource disappear after more than 25 years of reliable service.<P><HR>

<A NAME="crossroads"></A>
<H3>Flickering at the Crossroads</H3>
And so, at the close of the twentieth century, classroom television stands at an extraordinary crossroads. After many years of squandered potential, TV is a tool that educators are finally learning how to use to best effect. And of the many technologies available to teachers, it remains one of the cheapest. <P>
Yet television is running the risk of being transformed from a reasonably priced resource into a luxury item. Its future appears tied to that of more expensive technologies like computers. And with tight school budgets, taxpayer revolts, and federal cutbacks in funding for educational technology, video may have to compete with other critical materials for increasingly scarce education dollars. As affordable as it is, TV could become a resource that only wealthy school districts can afford. The idea that, in the end, money will be the barrier that prevents schools from taking advantage of TV stands as an ironic counterpoint to the vision that first ushered video into the classroom more than 30 years ago as a cost-effective guarantee of quality education for all America's children. At a point in history when mastering media, rather than being mastered by them, is the key to future success, television's strengths as an educational tool makes it far too valuable to consign to such a fate.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To help children cope with our media-engulfed society, educators are beginning to add media literacy to their academic lineup. Indeed, some teachers say media studies plant seeds of thought in fertile ground. "Children are already TVcritics," says Christopher Ward, a teacher at Mamaroneck High School in New York.

<H2>Harnessing TV for Adult Literacy</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF="#babette"> Babette Moeller</A></H3></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While television has long been part of the K-12 education picture, it's only now coming into focus as a way to educate adults, especially the 50 to 70 million who are illiterate.<P>
The adult literacy effort is continually expanding, with classes opening up in high schools, community centers, and the workplace--but less than 10 percent of the adults who need them are participating in such programs. Educators searching for alternative ways to reach adult literacy learners are looking at the potential of television and video.  <P><HR>

<H3>The Ubiquitous Tool</H3>
Many people say it's about time. Nearly every household in the U.S. has at least one television set, and watching television is as integrated into most people's day as brushing their teeth. More importantly, the development of new user-controlled technologies (such as video recording and playback, CD-ROM and video disc) allows televised instruction to be adapted to a variety of learning styles.<P>
The Adult Literacy Media Project (which is housed at the Education Development Center and funded by the Ford Foundation) is creating new adult literacy video programming for telecast and VCR use--at home and in community settings--along with complementary print and interactive materials. The project research findings that follow have implications not only for people using television and video to teach adults, but also for those working with older adolescents with very limited skills. <P><HR>

<H3>Promoting Active Engagement</H3>For many adults, watching TV is a well-practiced activity. They approach television with a set of expectations and established viewing habits. Yet the way viewers interact with the medium has an important impact on what they learn from it. The more actively viewers process the information presented--which may be very different from the way they watch television ordinarily--the more they will learn. The research illuminated some building blocks of active engagement:<P>
<UL><LI> Pre-viewing activities can help orient learners to the television program by making them aware of its purpose and by helping them to develop and apply the necessary processing skills. <P>
<LI> Viewing strategies like note-taking, co-viewing, peer mediation, and stopping the video for discussion help older learners to retain what they see and hear.<P>
<LI> Post-viewing activities that help learners retain information include reviewing difficult material, elaborating on it, and practicing newly learned skills. </UL>
<P>The Adult Literacy Media Project will be integrating these strategies into television programming to reach adults and adolescents who have been missed by the school system.<P>

<H2>Educational Technology Is a Business Investment</H2>
Louisville, Ky., was an anxious place in the early 1980s. The city's industrial base was eroding, and community leaders were wracking their brains for strategies to ensure its economic future. That's when the local Chamber of Commerce invited MIT economist David Birch, an authority on small-business growth, to give a speech about economic development. The Chamber members had one particularly pressing questions for Birch: If he had $10 million to spend for economic development in Louisville, where would he put it? Would he spend it on expanding airport capacity? Tax breaks for new businesses?<P>

"No," he said. "I'd spend it on computers in schools." <P>
Birch's perspective is one that's now being shared by business leaders around the country.<P><HR>

<A NAME="why"></A>
<H3>Why Technology-Focused Partnerships Are Increasing</H3>
In the past decade and a half, more and more businesses have come to view partnerships with education as vital to developing a competitive workforce. Grooming that workforce is a responsibility businesses no longer feel comfortable leaving to the schools alone: In a recent survey by the National Alliance of Business only 4 percent of business people felt the public schools prepare students well for the world of work, compared to 68 percent of superintendents and 44 percent teachers. Educators have responded with national programs like the Department of Education's <A HREF="links1195.html#edu">Goals 2000</A> initiative and the business-led New American Schools Development Corp., in addition to countless local alliances.<P>
Developing students' technological know-how is an important aspect of many of these efforts. ''Of all the changes that are happening in today's workplace, technology is the driving force behind most of them,'' says Keith Poston, spokesman for the National Alliance of Business, a business-led group. ''It's really a matter of trying to assist the schools to prepare what will be our future workforce.''<P>
For their part, educators across the country are actively seeking out corporate partners in the area of technology. The focus on technology comes partly from a recognition of the importance of technology for reform, and partly from schools' desperate need for financial support to equip and maintain strong technology programs.<P><HR>

<A NAME="what"></A>
<H3>What Makes Partnerships Tricky</H3>
While some of these school-business partnerships have been enormously successful, others have not. (See <A HREF="#tips">10 Tips for Cultivating Partnerships</A> for advice on how to make your business partnership a winner.) The reasons are easy to fathom. Businesses and schools enter partnerships from different cultures. Businesses can be impatient with what they see as wastefulness or inefficiency within schools, and they may consider educators ill-equipped to address bottom-line concerns. They may not understand the complex issues educators must juggle in addition to the curriculum--such as satisfying parents and taxpayers while dealing with everything from drug use to students' family crises. <P>
The partners' motivations often differ as well. Businesses may see partnerships as a marketing vehicle--a way to bring products into schools or increase their products' visibility among school-age children. And schools sometimes approach businesses with a "tin cup" mentality, focusing on how much they can walk off with and how quickly. A bad match in partnerships, or one in which expectations are not made clear, can result in frustration on both sides, says Margarita Colmenares of the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Corporate Liaison. ''No one ends up knowing if they've accomplished any results.''<P>
Here are tales of four very different communities in which schools and businesses have reached out to each other--with varying degrees of satisfaction.

<A NAME="tips"></A>
<H3>10 Tips for Cultivating Partnerships</H3>
How can your school or district develop a fruitful, long-term relationship with business? Experts from the business and education communities offer these choice pieces of advice.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL><LI><H4>Two Provisos</H4>
No matter what else you do, say those in the know, keep these two commandments in mind.<P>
<OL><LI><STRONG>Know your own agenda.</STRONG><BR>
''It is extremely important that a school know what its goals and visions are,'' says Margarita Colmenares of the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Corporate Liaison. ''Businesses can help schools establish those goals, but a school should be able to tell a prospective partner, 'I'm sorry, your proposal doesn't fit in, but here's a different place where we need you.''' At the same time, you need to be flexible enough to take advantage of opportunities that arise--say, to allow a new technology to be demonstrated to others at their school in return for its free use.<P>
<LI><STRONG>Don't be a dumping ground for dinosaurs.</STRONG><BR>
Be wary of offers of free computers. ''Schools seem to be a logical place for companies to put old equipment they don't need any longer,'' says Diana Rigden, vice president of the precollege program at the Council for Aid to Education, which advises businesses on grants and other forms of aid to education. ''A lot of times schools get equipment, they but they don't even have the right kind of outlets in the room to use them.'' Many schools, eager to acquire computers, may not think about whether software may be available for the older units, or what the costs of maintenance and staff training will be. (But then, if all you want is a writing lab, a bunch of 286s may be a find.)</OL><P>

<LI><H4>Eight Steps To Partnership</H4>
Apple Computer has put together a guide to help schools in conceiving, developing, and maintaining successful relationships with businesses. The steps are summarized here.<P>
<OL><LI><STRONG>Get started in-house</STRONG>:<BR>
Create a planning team made up of those who will be involved in the partnership as well as those who are visible in the community. The team should draw up a charter that defines the goals of the partnership within the school or district's long-term educational plan. Next, think about the relationships you already have with businesses and the partners that you'd like to have, and brainstorm project ideas. Then narrow the ideas down to projects that meet your central vision, address critical needs, and have the best chance of success.<P>
<LI><STRONG>Create a preliminary project plan</STRONG><BR>
Choose two or three projects and create preliminary plans for each one. Each plan should include an overview, a project description (including possible outcomes), the scope and timeline, and a list of resources. Before moving on, discuss the plan with key school decision makers and make necessary revisions.<P>
<LI><STRONG>Find partners</STRONG>:<BR>
Don't just consider Fortune 500 companies--look for local businesses, trade associations, civic organizations, and cultural or special interest groups, among others. Find out your potential partners' needs so you'll have a better understanding of what you can offer them. Then match potential projects with possible partners.<P>
<LI><STRONG>Create the proposal</STRONG><BR>
Tailor your initial plan for a specific partner. Be sure to include an executive summary that will attract the business' interest, a description of the benefits to each partner, a method for measuring results, and a budget. Wrap up with a call to action --a description of what you are looking for in a partnership, including length of commitment, roles and responsibilities. <P>
<LI><STRONG>Present and follow up</STRONG><BR>
Present your proposal at a face-to-face meeting with those who have the authority to accept it. If it is turned down, you may need to revise or look for alternate partners. If you receive a positive response, schedule follow-up meetings to focus on getting acquainted, organizing partnership teams, choosing co-leaders, and defining the charter.<P>
<LI><STRONG>Build a joint plan</STRONG><BR>
The joint plan should set measurable objectives, and list specific tasks as well as time, human resources, and money requirements. Decide how you will monitor the program's implementation and evaluate its impact. Develop a budget and identify funding sources. Meet with decision makers to gain final approval.<P>
<LI><STRONG>Implement and evaluate the plan</STRONG><BR>
Begin with a kick-off aimed at raising awareness of the project and cultivating support for it. Once the project is underway, determine what things were and were not accomplished; determine what benefits have accrued to your partner and develop regular progress reports. Every now and then, step back and take a long-term view of the project. Consider changes and negotiate further projects with the partner.<P>
<LI><STRONG>Keep the vision alive</STRONG><BR>
Maintain the support of the wider community by making the success of the project visible through newsletters, questionnaires, and tours. Keep communication lines open with your partner and continually adjust the relationship to meet changing needs.

The long-lived and much-acknowledged school-business connection in Louisville, Ky.--which began as a fundraising drive for computer labs and now involves hundreds of businesses in the daily lives of every Louisville school--had its roots in mutual crisis. While business leaders were searching the horizon for replacements for Louisville's declining smokestack industrial base, the district was reeling from the fallout of court--ordered desegregation and merger of the Louisville city school district with the suburban Jefferson County district. The district had lost nearly one--third of its population from white flight following the loss of manufacturing jobs. "By the early 1980s, there was a lot of turmoil in the county, a lot of demonstrations and riots," says Bill Barnes, director of computer education support for Jefferson County schools. Here's what happened next.<P><HR>

<A NAME="delicate"></A>
<H3>Delicate negotiations</H3>
Inspired by a visit by MIT professor David Birch, Louisville's major business leaders--including Liberty National Bank's Malcolm Chancey and Humana Inc. chairman and chief executive David A. Jones--formed the Jefferson County Public Education Foundation. Seizing the moment, Superintendent Donald W.
Ingwerson (who has since left Louisville to become superintendent of Los Angeles County schools) invited the group to sit down with him to discuss ways to fund all or part of Birch's proposal.<P>
Ingwerson set up a series of monthly luncheons at which the group discussed a wide range of questions facing Louisville at the time. When the conversation strayed too far from his objective of funding computers in the schools, Ingwerson brought it back on track. When discussions about providing the schools with
computers hit a snag, he would delicately move off the subject. "One had to be very careful about pushing too hard and about being able to keep the door open," he says. "When you came to a point where there was silence or there were questions that weren't easily answered you went on to a something that was easier to deal with," <P>
Two major questions loomed over the discussions. First: Was technology the best way to go?  "That was kind of an extreme position for a Southern city to be thinking about," says Ingwerson. "Not many people had thought of education as a sort of salvation [for economic problems]." Second was the question of cost. Between the first and second meetings, someone on Ingwerson's staff estimated it would cost around $17 to $19 million for a computer program for the elementary schools. "When that number was thrown out I think everybody realized there was not that kind of money out there," Ingwerson says.<P><HR>

<A NAME="pilot"></A>
<H3>Planning a pilot</H3>
Chancey says he and other business leaders liked the idea of helping bring computers into the classroom, but they wanted to know how they were going to measure the results. They had heard of other school districts where expensive computers had been purchased but hadn't been put to use. "I said to the
superintendent, 'We can't commit to spending $9 million on computers and then have them sit around gathering dust,"' he recalls. <P>
Finally, says Ingwerson, the potential partners reached the point at which the plan either had to move forward or be abandoned. That's when Chancey told him, "If I were doing this in the banking business, I'd pilot it and see what the results were." Shortly afterward Humana's Jones stepped forward to fund a $150,000 pilot program at the inner--city Roosevelt Perry elementary school, in the same West End neighborhood in which he had grown up. <P><HR>

<A NAME="test"></A>
<H3>The test site: Roosevelt Perry</H3>
The pilot, which began in 1983, brought in Apple clones called Syscoms. Humana technicians rigged an ersatz network connecting the two computers in each classroom and the new computer lab, and converted one PC into a server. "When the computers first arrived, the main thing was to learn what the computer was," says Roosevelt Perry principal J. Back, who was a counselor at the time. "I don't think any one of my staff members even had a computer at home." The school district, wanting to ensure the pilot was successful, placed two support people in the building, one to run the computer lab, the other to be in charge of staff development. Teachers spent hours upon hours in the lab, getting stipends from the district when the school ran out of in--house funds.<P>
Students began writing journals on the computers, doing drill exercises, and augmenting textbook lessons. Humana executives toured through often, showing the pilot to other businesses and encouraging them to get involved. "What happened was that computer lab served as a catalyst for very positive things," like higher attendance, more parent involvement, and better teacher morale, says Chancey. And after a year and a half, the students showed significant improvement on test scores. At that point, says Chancey, 'We kicked off a full--scale fund--raising."<P><HR>

<A NAME="funds"></A>
<H3>Raising funds, sharing costs</H3>
The education foundation stayed out of the classroom, focusing its efforts on publicity and fundraising. But based on the pilot, it asked the schools to play a financial role as well. Instead of a fully--business funded program, the Louisville model called for the school district to pay 20 per cent of the cost of the computers and each local school to raise 20 per cent. Also, worried that the computers might languish in a warehouse, the businesses asked the district to commit to a staff development program. The district required each school to form a technology team that went through 60 hours of training during the summer, in exchange for a stipend or credit.<P><HR>

<A NAME="uneven"></A>
<H3>Uneven but successful</H3>
Louisville's technology program has been faulted by some as uneven because staff development is left up the individual school. As a result, schools like Roosevelt Perry--which has been designated a state demonstration site for technology--remain strides ahead of others in the district that haven't made a commitment to staff development. By cobbling together Federal Chapter 1 money (97 percent of the student population is classified as at-risk) with grants, Roosevelt Perry has been able to fund both a full-time computer resource teacher and a lab teacher, even though the district supplies money for only one position. <P>

Although one can point out implementation flaws, the fact remains that, without the support of businesses, the Jefferson County Schools' technology program is richer and more comprehensive than any the district could have developed on its own. And although the Jefferson County Education Foundation has kept its
focus on large fundraising projects (it is now helping the school district fund early education for children starting at age three) and reform efforts, the district has gone on to develop partnerships with United Parcel Service, General Electric, and other big companies. UPS workers tutor students at Roosevelt Perry, and senior citizens from social service agencies read stories to them. <P><HR>

<H2>Los Angeles Unified: A Double--Edged Sword</H2>

For the Los Angeles Unified school distract, a proposed partnership with Pacific Bell grew out of that company's marketing needs--a pattern that observers like educational technology consultant Saul Rockman are seeing more frequently. "People who produce products that are aimed at the school market see opportunities to demonstrate their wares in schools," Rockman says. <P>

This is especially true among purveyors of cable and telephone services, who are trying to determine in advance of deregulation which types of expanded communications services they will be able to sell, and to what markets. Phone companies have hit upon a kind of souped up telephone service called ISDN, or
integrated services digital network, which offers faster data delivery than typical phone lines, but isn't as expensive to install as fiber optic cable. ISDN is seen as a potential interim step, offering capability for
video-conferencing and high-speed access to the Internet. But the market hasn't yet developed, and that's where schools have come in. <P><HR>

<A NAME="cost"></A>
<H3>The cost of "free"</H3>
The Pac Bell initiative, called Education First, seems like a great high-tech, low--cost package on the surface. The company will install an ISDN free to any school or public library in California. The line is then free to
the schools for the first year, and Pac Bell has asked regulators to allow it to charge a reduced fee after that. But after district officials analyzed Pac Bell's proposal with the help of Rand Corp., they realized that there were some extra costs, like connecting equipment required for the ISDN lines, construction costs for the installation of conduit, and the cost of an ISDN connection to the Internet through a commercial service, something the district already provides to its schools for free already through its own wide-area network.<P>

The Pac Bell proposal places California's schools on the cutting edge of a new technology, with all the financial risks and uncertainties inherent in that position. "You have to say to yourself, 'Why are they proposing this?'" says Andy Rogers, coordinator of school support for school information systems at L.A. Unified's Information Technology Division. "When ISDN was brought out four years ago, the commercial interests didn't take [the telecom companies] up on it. So what you're left with is this sense that they wanted to establish ISDN in the schools so that they would have a presence statewide, and that would make it commercially viable."<P><HR>

<A NAME="do"></A>
<H3>The do-it-yourself alternative</H3>
Despite Pac Bell's highly publicized offer, which was promoted on television commercials, some school administrators were skeptical. "My issue is if you put in the line here free for a year, and I have no idea what it is going to cost me in the future, I can't make a decision based on imaginary numbers," says Les Higger, student information systems local area network coordinator for Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet High School. <P>

Instead, Higger spent $2,700 on software, $2,000 on a router, and $800 on a modem. The one-time investment gives all 400 PCs in the school Internet access. Up to 30 can be on the Internet at one time (compared to eight at a time before), and somewhere between four and 10 can be using Netscape, a World Wide Web browser. "Why would I spend $2,000 a year [the amount he estimates the ISDN service would cost] for a service that would only run two or three computers?" he says. "And I could be using that money to establish a network. It's like buying a propane tank and you can't afford the stove." <P>

To help school administrators decide whether to go along with the Education First pilot project, the district set up a series of meetings in May between Pac Bell representatives and school people to clarify some of the costs. So far, only a handful out of 600 schools have done signed on to the Pac Bell plan, says Victor
Placeres, director of school information systems at the district's Information Technology Division.  "What we are saying (to schools) is, you are free to go with ISDN, but know what the costs involved are," he says.
"Know what you're getting for your money. A freebie isn't always a freebie."<P><HR>

<A NAME="arts"></A>
<H3>Taking the challenge at Manual Arts</H3>
Not everyone in Los Angeles has reacted to the Education First initiative the same way. At Manual Arts High School, Principal Wendell Greer sees the offer as a chance for the school to connect to the information superhighway and expand the partnerships the school already has. Manual Arts was chosen by Pac Bell as a
three--year demonstration site for Education First. The school will receive ISDN service and staff support free for three years, and will receive five video-conferencing units for free. In return, the school will make itself
available for site tours by prospective purchasers of ISDN. When the demonstration period is over, the school will begin paying for the ISDN lines, but it will own the video units. <P>

Manual Arts knows exactly what it will do with the ISDN service. For example, a class on mortgage banking, financed through the Academy Foundation by Fannie Mae, will take part in a distance learning session this semester conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco. The school's graphic arts class also
plans to expand its current relationship with Disney, which now includes occasional field trips to Disney's studios in Burbank. Once the ISDN system is up and running, the exchanges will be much more frequent. Disney also is donating 14 new computers to the school.<P>

"Knowing that you're the first, you're making the path for everyone else, that is the challenge," says Greer. "You're taking the unknown and making it work. That's what myself and my staff are really excited about."<P><HR>

Given the new interest in the part of business in education, school people need to be savvy in their use of natural advantages--such as proximity to a large, high-tech company--as assets in building strong technology
partnerships. But even the most unlikely communities can find that they too have resources, as the Maxwell, Neb., Public Schools, with a K-12 population of 185, has discovered. The school, which serves the children of cattle ranchers and farmers, won a 1992 Partners in Education Grant from Apple Computer Inc. The
grant brought in a lab with eight computers, but that was just a beginning. The small district's creative use of the lab, and its unique partnerships with local businesses, has helped it amass more than 60 new computers all with an investment of less than $15,000.<P><HR>

<A NAME="needs"></A>
<H3>Understanding community needs</H3>
What made Maxwell's Partners in Education grant proposal stand out was its demonstration of a clear, no--nonsense understanding of its own needs and those of the community it serves. At Maxwell, the student body is so small that a sporting event at an opposing school can deplete class sizes by half; students who aren't on the team often used to stay home on game days to help out on the farm, knowing that not much would be happening at school. "A lot of them weren't looking at college," says Kathy Brosius, the school's technology director. So when Brosius and other teachers began to put together a technology plan for the grant proposal, they designed one that they thought would help keep kids in class every day.<P>

The plan designers took advantage of the students' sense of responsibility, finely honed from years of pitching in on farm chores. They also sought to build general community support for a computer program. By offering to have students provide computer services to any farm or business in Maxwell, the design team
accomplished both: The students would be meeting deadlines set by real-world clients, and their incentive to come to school every day would be increased. Meanwhile, the rest of the would benefit from having computers in school.<P><HR>

<A NAME="help"></A>
<H3>Help for small businesses</H3>
One of the most successful partnerships arose from Sandy Brook's accounting class that first year, whose lone student agreed to keep the books for a couple that owned several pieces of rental property, Bob and Mary Ellen Mann. The student, Andy Miller, used a Claris Works accounting program to create separate
reports for each property, based on Mrs. Mann's receipts and check stubs. "I think we were both kind of surprised at the result we got out of it," says Andy. The exercise helped show which properties were making money, and which weren't. "There were a couple of them that weren't doing as good as they thought," he says. Mrs. Mann, for her part, was impressed with the results. "They really showed me how to keep track of my books," she says. The next year, she also turned over to the accounting class the books for the Jeffrey Lake development association where she lives. "It's so much different for them when they know it's for real," she says. "They know it's a real business and they don't dare make a mistake...they'll know what life is all about when they go out into the business world."<P><HR>

<A NAME="full"></A>
<H3>A full-service computer operation</H3>
The computer services the school has offered run the gamut from accounting to printing invitations and tickets to creating the school's yearbook. (At the Miller ranch, Andy's younger sister created a system on the home computer to help track newborn calves.) And the students' enterprise has been a boon for the technology program, bringing additional awards like $15,000 from U.S. West to create a network between classrooms and a direct connection to the Internet, and $6,000 from the Peter Kiewit Foundation to recognize Brosius as Nebraska's outstanding teacher (she used the award to buy a Power Mac).  <P>

The school now has three computer labs, and has created a corporation to fund the technology program through the contributions of local businesses who receive services. <P>

Moreover, says John Brown, the superintendent, the computer program has helped the school shift its identity from one that was essentially limited to sports boosterism to one in which it is recognized for its competitiveness in academics and its real--life applications. <P><HR>

<A NAME="ri"></A>
<H2>Newport, Rhode Island: A Community-Wide Project</H2>
In the Newport (R. I.) Public Schools, where we are beginning year three of our technology integration plan, our progress depends on yearly budget allocations, a small steady stream of grant dollars, and considerable creativity. But our lifeline has been the partnerships we've developed with various community
resources. One example is Project On--Ramp. <P>

<A NAME="wire"></A>
<H3>A desire to wire</H3>
In 1992, the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission and NYNEX, the regional telco, agreed that NYNEX would provide all classrooms in the state with phone lines for telecommunications projects for no installation or usage charges, for a two-year trial period. NYNEX offered to do the interior cabling for a fee, but we opted to take care of this ourselves. Initially, cable pulled to classrooms would provide a dial-up link to Internet to take advantage of the NYNEX agreement. Eventually that same cable would accommodate building networks as well. <P>

To begin developing the infrastructure, we decided to turn to community partners. We divided the total estimated cost of the project by the total number of classrooms in the district to get a per classroom cost. Our goal was to convince local businesses, organizations, and individuals to sponsor one or more classrooms.<P><HR>

<A NAME="partners"></A>
<H3>Recruiting Partners</H3>
We visited the Newport Public Education Foundation, which pledged a dollar contribution and agreed to act as a conduit for all project funds. Next we spoke at a joint luncheon meeting of the Kiwanis, Rotary, and Chamber of Commerce. The high point of that presentation was a group of our third graders who told of
their Internet experiences.  As a result of our efforts, a local printer donated services. A Newport
firefighter who was developing a small public relations business agreed to track and acknowledge contributions. So far we have exceeded 60 percent of funds needed to cable our schools and feel confident that we can reach our goal.<P><HR>

<A NAME="people"></A>
<H3>People challenges</H3>
The real challenge in this project turned out to be the management of people. There are all kinds of questions about who will do the actual work. Labor issues, donor enthusiasm, and teacher impatience have each required more time than I could have imagined at the outset. <P>

At our high school, for example, a few teachers were working in partnership with a government defense contractor to develop science activities in a high tech testing environment. Without stopping to check with the district, the contractor enthusiastically arranged to network several classrooms to its facility--in conflict with the structured wiring plan we had developed for the district.<P>

After a few tension--filled days of meetings and telephone calls, we adapted our wiring plans and made arrangements for the link to move ahead. Unfortunately there were some lasting bruises that jeopardized a valuable partnership.<P><HR>

<A NAME="learned"></A>
<H3>Lessons learned</H3>

So far On-Ramp has taught me a lot. You need clearly defined goals, roles, and responsibilities. You have to develop a few reliable community links (I have technical/community advisor from Brown University). And you have to communicate regularly and clearly. <P>

Beyond the resulting installed cabling, Project On-Ramp has raised the awareness level of Newport's technology initiatives. There is a greater sense of ownership and interest throughout the district and in the community. Our sponsors include private foundations, banks, artists, accountants, fishermen, yacht brokers, teachers, judges, parent groups, and others. Paradoxically, our desire to connect our students to the world has provided a closer look at the strengths of our own community.<P>

<CENTER><H2>Internet Resources for Linking with Business Partners</H2></CENTER>
Creating partnerships between schools and corporations is a grassroots process: local businesses represent at least as much an opportunity as information you might find cruising the Web. But some government organizations, foundations, and large corporations do maintain extensive Web sites that include information about their partnership programs and how they may contribute to various schools. Here are some of the more promising sites we found.<P><HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><A NAME="limited"></A>
<H2>Limited English population booming</H2>
Since 1965, when the immigration laws changed, waves of people from countries as diverse as the Dominican Republic, China, and Azjerbijan have uprooted themselves and come to make a home for themselves in the U.S. In the last 20 years in particular, the number of Limited English Proficiency (LEP) students has ballooned in the nation's schools. According to the 1990 Census, one out of four of this country's 20 million foreign-born population came here between 1985 and 1990. The Department of Education estimates that there are currently 3 million LEP students speaking 180 languages in the nation's schools.<P><HR>

<A NAME="educators"></A>
<H2>Educators take sides</H2>
As the number of LEP students has exploded, educators have been caught in a continuing, volatile battle over what is the best way to educate those students -- bilingual education, English as a Second Language, or something on the continuum in between. Bilingual educators cite research showing that a child takes from three to seven years to attain academic proficiency in English; if non-native speaking children are thrown into all English classes, they say,they quickly fall behind in content area classes, become discouraged and are at risk of dropping out. But anti-bilingual education advocates argue that an over-reliance on bilingual education negatively impacts academic performance,and prolongs the time it takes children to learn English and to be integrated with other kids.<P><HR>

<A NAME="technology"></A>
<H2>How technology can help</H2>
Educators working with immigrant students say that technology can help bridge the language and culture gap.<P>
"Technology is a great equalizer," says Stephanie Hamilton, an instructional technology coordinator in the Alief, Texas, school district."It helps students to not be handicapped by the fact that they're second-language learners."<P>
"Schools are really the last and the best possibility for giving kids an equal playing field," agrees Janet Meizel, a high school computer science teacher in Davis, Calif., who is trying to integrate technology into migrant education programs. "If we don't give them the ability to use the technology and the ability to learn, then we've lost them."<P><HR>

<A NAME="software"></A>
<H2>Software not keeping pace</H2>
As quickly as the LEP population has grown, software manufacturers have been slow to invest in and produce new products for what they see as a market so fractured by language and by methodology. Little instructional technology is available in languages other than English and Spanish, particularly for secondary subjects.<P>
Teachers also warn that much ESL material is of the rote, "drill and kill" genre, and products in other languages are often translated from English and lack cultural authenticity."We have a long ways to go," says Eugene Garcia, director of the U.S.Department of Education's Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Language Affairs (OBEMLA) <A HREF="gopher://gopher.ncbe.gwu.edu:70/11/obemla">gopher://gopher.ncbe.gwu.edu:70/11/obemla</A>**
<P><HR>

<A NAME="funding"></A>
<H2>Federal funding is shrinking</H2>
But money for technology in LEP education is in short supply--and drying up fast. Title VII funding, which has provided competitive grants to improve education for LEP students by training teachers, purchasing technology, and many other activities, has been shrinking as the numbers of LEP students has been growing.<P>
Available since the mid-1960's, that funding declined by 40 percent from1984 to 1994, while the population of LEP students increased by 26 percent,according to a U.S. General Accounting Office report. The $196 million allocated for 1994-1995 served only about 10 percent of the nation's LEP students, according to the Department of Education.<P>
And things are only getting worse, as Congress considers abolishing or severely restricting Title VII funding.  Since November, the amount of money educators will have to spend on technology -- or any other material -- to educate LEP kids has been in question. With the election of a conservative Congress last year, federal assistance for LEP students has been one of the first items on the budgetary chopping block.<P><HR>

<A NAME="whatstory"></A>
<H2>What's your story?</H2>
Do you use technology to teach students who speak a language other than English? Here's a chance to share your wisdom and frustrations as well as any practical pointers you might have for your colleagues across the country. E-mail messages to <A HREF="mailto:micrevel@aol.com">MicRevEL@aol.com</A>.

Despite an overall shortage of useful technology, educators have uncovered --and adapted -- some valuable learning software for LEP students. The following is a list of software tools recommended by the California Computer Software Clearinghouse, which has evaluated hundreds of instructional technology products for use in bilingual education. The office, funded by the California Departmentof Education, will soon publish a CD-ROM listing of evaluations.<P>

From tropical islands to the Bering Strait, children are using sophisticated multimedia technology to learn native Hawaiian, American Indian Navajo, and Alaskan Eskimo languages that are close to extinction. <P><HR>

<A NAME="navajo"></A>
<H3>A Navajo renaissance in Arizona</H3>
</A></font><P>On a Navajo reservation in Northern Arizona, all students at the Tuba City Schools receive Navajo instruction. Some in the early grades become fluent in the tonal language and can write essays on their computers in the 36-letter Navajo alphabet using special fonts.<P>
 But it wasn't always that way, recalls Elsie Carr, who has taught for 17 years in the district of 2,000 K-12 students. Years ago, children would come to school speaking Navajo, but now, only a few native speakers remain. That changed several years ago when Arizona mandated that all students study a second language.<P>
"The children are relearning their language," says Carr. Currently, children in grades K-4 receive two-way, bilingual instruction, and the district plans to expand that program to upper grades. Finding fluent Navajo teachers is not easy, but those who are fluent in the language are now publishing their own Navajo books.<P><HR>

<H3>Alaska Natives: whaling, sealing, and CD-ROMs</H3>
A pilot program to preserve the Inupiaq Eskimo language recently began in Barrow, Alaska. Last year, about 30 preschoolers received instruction entirely in Inupiaq at the Ipalook Elementary School. Teachers use culturally relevant materials and technology to teach about whaling, traditional camping, Inupiaq holidays, festivals, and customs. Parents who voluntarily enroll their kids must speak Inupiaq with them at home, as well.<P>
This fall the program expands to kindergarten, and by 1996, to other villages so that children have the option of total Inupiaq immersion up to 2nd grade, followed by two-way bilingual education through 6th grade.<P>
Because the Inupiaq language was oral and not written, educators are using technology---HyperCard stacks and CD-ROMs---to create a collection of Inupiaq legends and stories from the Inuit Eskimos in neighboring Canada, an Inupiaq dictionary and computer games. The stories are being published for the first time in children's book form.<P>
"Then if the older kids want to read to little kids, they have something to use," Liz Boario, curriculum instruction director says. "And with the CD-ROMs, they can actually hear the language too."<P><HR>

<A NAME="hawaii"></A>
<H3>Saving a language in Hawaii</H3>
As a child in Hawaii, Puanani Wilhelm often wondered why her father never spoke to her in native Hawaiian.What she didn't know was that just before the turn of the century, the Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown and when Hawaii later became a U.S. territory, the native language was banned from schools. Only several hundred native Hawaiian speakers remain in the Islands.<P>
Now a specialist at the Hawaii Department of Education, Wilhelm directs an immersion program that began in 1987 and is teaching more than 750 children in grades K-9 fluency in Hawaiian.  "The dream is that these children will grow up speaking Hawaiian and teach their children Hawaiian, thereby perpetuating the language," says Wilhelm.<P>
At seven schools, the Hawaiian immersion classes emphasize Hawaiian culture, with the children singing in Hawaiian and dancing during classes. As far as Kananinohea Kawaiaea, 14, is concerned, learning Hawaiian has been the best part about attending Nawahi elementary school in Hilo.<P>
"It's the language of our land," she says. "If we don't speak Hawaiian, then it will be gone and nobody will be able to learn. If we don't speak Hawaiian, it will die.&quot she says.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<H2>"NETDAYS" SPREAD ACROSS THE U.S</H2>               
  
  Like the Energizer Bunny, NetDay keeps on going and going; 
  the momentum unleashed in California last March 9 is rolling 
  across a growing number of states, all seeking to replicate 
  the day's accomplishments. On that original NetDay, a 
  volunteer army of parents, engineers, educators, and others 
  helped wire schools throughout California; President Bill 
  Clinton and Vice President Al Gore installed network ports 
  at Ygnacio Valley High.
  <P>

  In the <A HREF="#CALENDAR">calendar</A> below is a partial list 
  of states and dates for NetDays scheduled for the new school 
  year. If you want to get involved, or if you don't see your 
  particular state listed, call your state board of 
  education's education technology office. 
  <P>

  The reverberations from NetDay continue to have a profound 
  effect: about 33 states now have their own Tech Corps 
  chapters, in-state organizations that help schools get wired 
  (<A HREF="http://www.ustc.org">http://www.ustc.org</A>).

Plus
<UL><LI><A HREF="#training">Training for Teachers
</A><LI><A HREF="#schoolwork">School to Work Initiative</A>
</UL>

Microsoft wants Windows 95 to be your classroom's operating system so much that it's offering the software for a special school price        of just $19.95 through October 31. Previously, the school price for a single copy was the same as retail, $109. The discount does not   affect the school multi-user version (Academic Edition License Pack) of Windows 95, at $49.95. For more information: (800) 633-2114 or (800) 555-4K12; or see <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/k-12/win95">http://www.microsoft.com/k-12/win95</A> or      <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/hed/win95">http://www.microsoft.com/hed/win95</A><P><HR><P>
<A NAME="training"></A>
<H2>Training for Teachers </H2>
In conjunction with this recent announcement, Microsoft said it will donate $1 million in Windows 95 software and instructional guides to individual state departments of education for use in teacher training programs. Donations will also go to community-based special needs technology centers affiliated with the Alliance for Technology Access, based in San Rafael, Calif. The instructional guide bundled with the offer, "In & Out of the Classroom with Windows 95," offers teachers self-paced lesson and hands-on activities exploring the features and capabilities of the software. Additional training is offered as a purchase option, as is technical help via telephone. <P>
For more information, educators can call (800) 633-2114 or (800) 555-4K12; further details are also available at the company's Web        sites, <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/k-12/win95">http://www.microsoft.com/k-12/win95</A> or           <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/hed/win95">http://www.microsoft.com/hed/win95</A>.<P><HR><P>
<A NAME="schoolwork"></A>
<H2>School-to-Work Initiative</H2>
In other company news, Microsoft joined with Dell Computer Corp., Manpower, Inc. and the Jobs for the Future organization to unveil       "Employees for Tomorrow," a pilot school-to-work initiative designed to give students working knowledge of current business software and other computer literacy skills. The program is training selected high school teachers to use the Windows-based software that graduates will likely encounter in the workplace, including Microsoft Office for Windows 95, while Dell Computer is providing each teacher with desktop and portable computers. In class, the teachers will guide students through a series of "real-life" challenges, such as formulating proposals for low-cost, energy-efficient housing using computer-based models, building Web sites, and other projects. <P>
The program is currently testing in Boston, Mass; Lake Washington, Wash.; Louisville, Ky.; Milwaukee, Wisc.; and Philadelphia, Penn. <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H2>IBM Unveils SchoolVista 2.0;<BR>
Names Rodrigues to Head K-12</H2>
<UL><LI><A HREF="#interface">Customized Interface for Teachers and Kids</A>
<LI><A HREF="#add">Software to Add and to Have
</A><LI><A HREF="#access">Access to the Net</A>
<LI><A HREF="#face">A New Face for K-12</A>
</UL>

IBM K-12 Education's new one-stop instructional technology package,  SchoolVista 2.0, is a comprehensive integrated school courseware and management system that includes over 50 classroom and administrative products. The Windows 95-compatible CD-ROM, available on June 28, includes titles from a range of third-party vendors, including SkillsBank and MECC. Designed to run on a school building's local area network (LAN), SchoolVista 2.0 features range of elementary language arts, science, math, reading and writing software, as well as a full  suite of assessment tools--authentic as well as traditional--to evaluate student progress.<P>
SchoolVista 2.0 allows educators to share curriculum resources, testing/assessment tools, and communications capabilities, and lets 
teachers customize lesson plans for individual classes. To help move its customers onto the new system, IBM is offering users of earlier versions of SchoolVista a complete software upgrade, free of charge.<P><HR><P>
<A NAME="interface"></A>
<H2>Customized Interface for Teachers and Kids</H2>
The software interface, or "home screen," has a broad range of customized graphical allegories to assist users. Instructors and       students use individual log-ins and are presented with a student or teacher's interface. The teacher's screen, for example, shows the         view from the head of the classroom; at his or her desk, there are "public" and "private" drawers for open sharing of files and keeping     confidential data, respectively.<P>
Jim Schnitz, IBM K-12 director of product strategy, noted that the upgrade to SchoolVista 2.0 offered several advantages to educators, 
including the "modularizing" of various features. For example, if an educator running a reading program wished to access a particular      electronic book, he or she could access it directly without having to go through all the preceding courseware.<P><HR><P>
<A NAME="add"></A>
<H2>Software to Add and to Have</H2>
Also, a school need not buy all 50 products associated with SchoolVista 2.0, but can build its system according to its needs;          any Windows 95 program (networkable) is compatible with SchoolVista 2.0, and can be imported into the system's "Bookshelf" section. In conjunction with IBM's announcement of SchoolVista 2.0, letters were sent to 750 educational software developers inviting them to join the company's new Independent Software Vendor (ISV) program; this program allows those firms to use SchoolVista-related icons on their software packages.<P>
Subject-specific software for SchoolVista 2.0 includes upgraded  versions of <EM>At the Seashore</EM> and <EM>A Walk Through the Woods</EM>, two video-rich programs exploring basic principles of life sciences. Other courseware includes <EM>SchoolVista Mathematics</EM>,<EM> SchoolVista Language Arts for Grades 2/3</EM>, and <EM>Writing and More for Grades 2/3</EM>.           IBM has also bundled Lotus' SmartSuite (including WordPro) into the package.<P><HR><P>
<A NAME="access"></A>
<H2>Access to the Net</H2>
The system's Internet component, NetVista Internet Solutions, is an upgrade of IBM's earlier "k12.net" offering, and can run on a       school's local area network with LAN modem; this means that several networked computers could access the Internet simultaneously through a single phone line. If a school does not already have an Internet "filter" to block inappropriate content, NetVista can supply it as well.<P>
SchoolVista 2.0 is designed to handle up to 250 concurrent users; individual network workstations require Windows 95, a 486DX2/66MHz processor, 16MB RAM, at least 75MB free hard drive space, and any token-ring or Ethernet adapter compatible with NetWare 4.1 and Windows 95. For NetVista, the workstation can run Windows 95 or Windows 3.1, but DOS-users must run IBM's OS/2 Warp Connect. Pricing for the entry-level (10-user) configuration of SchoolVista 2.0 starts at $1,050.<P><HR><P>
<A NAME="face"></A>
<H2>A New Face for K-12</H2>
In other division news, William Rodrigues was named general manager of IBM K-12 Education, responsible for development, marketing and distribution in the U.S. Rodrigues joins K-12 from IBM's AS/400 division, where he served as general manager of sales for North       America. He is a 19-year veteran of IBM.<P>
For information about SchoolVista product, services and software, educators can call 1-800-IBM-4EDU, or go to IBM solutions Web site: <A HREF="http://www.solutions.ibm.com/k12/">http://www.solutions.ibm.com/k12/</A>.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>NetDay96: What's the Bottom Line?</H3>
By <A HREF="#hertzberg">Lanny Hertzberg</A><P>

<UL><LI><A HREF="#information">Information Incomplete</A>
<LI><A HREF="#success">Success for Starters</A>
<LI><A HREF="#turn">Your Turn</A>
</UL>
NetDay96 on March 9 was a huge one-day public/private initiative that aimed to jumpstart California's K-12 schools onto the information superhighway. The brainchild of two prominent Californians--John Gage, president of Sun Microsystems, and Michael Kaufman, an executive at San Francisco's public television station KQED--NetDay involved more than 1,100 companies, including technology superstars Sun Microsystems, Apple, America Online, and Netscape, who donated equipment, software, and volunteers to the statewide  effort. Schools across the Golden State were sent NetDay kits containing cabling, plugs, and other goodies valued at about $500 each to aid their efforts. Even President Clinton got into the act, kicking off the day by switching on an Internet connection at a school in Concord, Calif.<P>
And now, for the post-game analysis: did all the hype get results? The answer is yes--but it wasn't easy, and there's still a long way to go before Internet access is woven into the fabric of schools as deeply as desks or blackboards.<P>

<A NAME="information"></A>
<H3>Information Incomplete</H3>
Part of the problem was a technology Catch-22. Those schools which already had some Internet access hotly pursued sponsors and volunteers, while many of the unwired--ostensibly, those for whom NetDay was created--did not know about the event. Organization for the event was unbalanced. While the business community was involved and informed early on, the State Superintendent of Schools was not actively involved until late September. School administrators did not receive information about how to participate until late December. Many districts responded to the opportunity, but others deliberately abstained, preferring to adhere to their own previously approved technology plans. <P>
It is illustrative to look at two very different schools, worlds apart but connected to each other on NetDay. Ygnacio Valley High School is a relatively well-off school in affluent Concord, California; by March 9, it had more than 70 volunteers and 13 sponsors. It also has the distinction of being the only place in the world which has a network port installed by the President and Vice President of the United States. In contrast, Freeport Elementary School in Sacramento is one of the poorest in a financially strained district. Through the hard work of principal Dalila Delancey and her staff, the school finally got 16 sponsors and more than 25 volunteers. Because Freeport overcame the odds and signed on the most sponsors of any one school, U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown came to visit on NetDay.<P>

<A NAME="success"></A>
<H3>Success for Starters</H3>
Technical problems arose and were solved, and somehow the magic happened--Ygnacio Valley and Freeport linked, using their newly cabled and connected computers and White Pine Software's CUSeeMe program. Once the link was up, the President kidded Secretary Brown for wearing a suit to pull wire. (The Secretary shot back that he didn't know there was a dress code.) Glenn Rules, a student at Freeport, also spoke with the President. Later, he told us that talking with the Clinton was not as important to him as being able to use his school's computer to talk to the rest of the world.<P>
In the end, more than 20,000 people and nearly one in five schools (the final number is still not known) were involved in NetDay. Furthermore, the state of California has made a commitment to continue the process for the next two years until every school is connected. That alone makes NetDay a success of at least minor proportions.<P>

<H3>Telecommunications Bill Passes Congress</H3>
On February 1, 1996, the House and Senate passed the Telecommunications and Deregulation Act, which decontrols the telecommunications industry but also assures schools and libraries affordable access to telecommunications. Among other measures, the bill provides discounted connection rates for schools and libraries and sets up a funding vehicle for stimulating investment in needed technology. President Clinton signed the bill on February 8.<P>
How will schools get discounts--and how deep will they be? As the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) goes through a rulemaking process to determine how the bill's affordable-access provision will be implemented, a joint state-federal board will determine the discount. According to the language of the bill, schools or libraries will have to make a formal request before they can receive assistance. It will be several months before the rulemaking process is completed.<P>
Some of the groups who pushed for this legislation hope that the discount will allow for partnerships so that schools and libraries can share connectivity costs with small businesses, government, and others in their community. To learn more about this community network concept--and get updates as the rulemaking process moves forward--see the Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) Web site at <A HREF="http://www.cosn.org">http://www.cosn.org</A>.<P>

<A NAME="speakout"></A>
<H3>ACT NOW!:<BR>
Speak Out for Affordable Access</H3>

Act now (while the rulemaking process is getting underway) to let the FCC know that schools and libraries deserve universal access at discounted rates. Here's how:<P>
<UL<LI>Write a letter to: FCC, 1919 M St. NW, Washington, DC 20554.<P>
<LI>Send e-mail to Chairman Reed Hundt at <A HREF="mailto:rhundt@fcc.gov">rhundt@fcc.gov</A>. If you don't mind of other educators see your ideas, send a cc of your e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:telecom@itc.org">telecom@itc.org</A>.<P>

<A NAME="apple"></A>
<H3>Apple Commits To Under $2000 Macs for K-12</H3>
After Apple Computer reported a $69 million loss for the first quarter of its fiscal year, speculation swelled over what course the Cupertino, Calif.-based company might take--including predictions that Apple would turn its low-end Macintosh market over to"clone" licensees in order to concentrate on the high-ticket models.<P>
Not so, says Apple senior vice-president for education Terry Crane. The company  is "definitely not" abandoning its "education price band strategy" which includes having an under- $2,000 Macintosh available for schools. "In no way are we vacating our commitment to schools," Crane told EL. About 60 percent of models sold by Apple are shipped with an education bundle, she said.<P>
Crane said, however, that there has been a general movement of schools "up the technology line" in the past 12 months: for example, roughly 40 percent of Apple computers sold to schools a year ago did not have CD-ROMs; that number has shrunk to under 2 percent. She noted that the average new K-12 Macintosh is in the $2,000 range, and that the LC line will continue its migration up the Power Macintosh platform. Currently, over 60 percent of Apple models sold to schools are Power Macs, according to an Apple spokesperson.<P><HR>

<A NAME="contest"></A>
<H3>EL Web Explorers Contest</H3>

<H3>AT&T Offers Internet Access to Schools</H3>
In a move to entice more schools to go online, telecommunications giant AT&T is offering 100 hours of free Internet access to all public and private K-12 schools. Additionally, schools will be offered three months of voice-messaging and free list-management software-technology that will allow schools to send messages to designated groups, such as PTA members or parents of children who are frequently late. AT&T will also provide voice mailboxes to students' homes at no charge during those three months, so residents can receive school messages.<P>
These initiatives are components of a $150 million, five-year plan that will rollout this spring under the banner of the AT&T Learning Network. Schools will be entitled to 100 hours of online time using AT&T's WorldNet Services, described by the company as a "value-added Internet access service." Further, participating schools will be able to use the WorldNet Services Web browser, which can run on Macintosh or Windows platforms. Down the road, AT&T plans to include monitoring and control capabilities, giving teachers greater supervision of student activity on the Net. Schools will be responsible for the cabling and modems that will allow them to receive WorldNet Services, said AT&T spokesperson Ruthlyn Newell.<p>
After the 100 hours of online time are spent, AT&T will offer schools a continuation of the service at 30 percent below its standard fee for the balance of the five-year program. Recipients of voice mail will be able to continue service at a "significant discount," according to a company statement. The company plans to offer several types of teacher support and training, including toll-free help lines for the Internet and voice-mail services.<p>
AT&T WorldNet is poised to enter a consumer market dominated by heavyweights America Online, Compuserve, and Prodigy. Elementary and high schools represent a largely untapped market for such services. Signing up schools for free hours may prove to be a short-term investment with a long-term payoff for AT&T, if WorldNet emerges as schools' provider of choice.

<H3>Gates: A "Connected" Vision for Education</H3>
Can technology foster more parental involvement in education? Microsoft, Inc. and several development partners think so, and have come up with a computer-basedstrategy to bring school closer to home. <p>
The Microsoft Parent-Teacher Connection Server, announced by company chairman and CEO Bill Gates during a recent speech at Georgetown University, will provide parents with local dial-up access to school bulletin boards and e-mail while providing two-way access between classroom and living room. The Connection Server is a software extension of Microsoft's Windows NT operating system. Schools can get the extension free, but must purchase the NT system software, according toTom Corddry, creative director/strategic relations division at Microsoft. (NT Academic Server prices start at $209 for 20 clients.) Schools need at least one computer powerful enough (386 or higher) to act as hardware server and run NT; Bell Atlantic and Pacific Bell have signed on to assist schools with telecommunications training and support. <p>
Gates said that home computers running DOS, Windows, or Macintosh platforms would be able to communicate with their local schools using the Parent-Teacher Connection Server. It is expected to be available in the spring.<p>
The introduction of the Connection Server is part of a larger Microsoft initiative called The Connected Learning Community, a three-pronged approach to education outlined by Gates in his Georgetown speech. Declaring that "the most important use of information technology is to improve education," Gates had reassuring words for those who fear that the proliferation of knowledge tools (such as Web browsers) will undercut the role of educators: "In no way is this a substitute for great teachers," he said. "If anything, this can only work with teachers involved." <p>
The idea behind The Connected Learning Community, said Gates, is that technology will be the accelerator for easier student/student and student/teacher interaction, parent-school feedback, and finally, links among schools internationally. To build on that final piece, Microsoft is contributing funds and support to expand the Global Schoolhouse (GSH) site on the Internet developing a bank of accessible lesson plans, classroom projects, and data on training and conferences. All this information will be available free of chargeat the GSH site, <a href="http://www.gsh.org">http://www.gsh.org</a>. <p><hr>

<H3>Net-Centric Computing: Will Schools PlugIn?</H3>
At the November Comdex show in Las Vegas, trend-setters agreed that this year's hot vision is "net-centric" computers. Still in the conceptual stage, these IPCs (Inter-personal Computers) would be lightweight boxes built for speed and connectivity, designed to locate software on remote servers and quickly download an application (such as a spreadsheet or word processor) to networked users. The"guts" of the end-users' network--processing and storage capacity--would reside in a powerful server connected to users' dumb terminals in a local or wide-area network. These terminals would need fewer parts and so would be less expensive than today's crop of network-ready computers. Proponents of net-centric computingsay IPCs could be sold for around $500.<p>
One major player, IBM, has taken a high-profile stance on IPCs. CEO Louis Gerstner announced IBM's intention to manufacture IPCs, with the first units expected to surface sometime this year. Big Blue's education group, IBM Worldwide Education Industry, is also looking at the potential of net-centric computing in a school setting. Building on what began with IBM's Teaching and Learning with Computers long ago, the company sees a logical migration of courseware, teachersupport, software upgrades and more to wide-area networks. <p>
According to Bruce Nelson, IBM K-12 program manager/advanced network solutions,these services would help educators develop networking skills to find resourcesinside and outside the school. For example, a large server might delivercourseware from IBM K-12's offices in Atlanta to the main server of a schooldistrict; computers in individual schools would then log into the district serverand download that software, and share it over LANs. These net-delivered products would probably be sold on a site-license basis to schools, at least in the beginning.<p>
Industry observers have likened the IPC to a computing "appliance," and the software usage as similar to renting videos for a VCR. In theory, you don't need to pay for a built-in CD-ROM drive if you can download the same contents over a network. IPC advocates hope that the low prices will encourage wide use in schools, furthering the integration of technology into education.<p>
But Learningways (Cambridge, Mass.) president Art Bardige, who is developing an online curriculum delivery service called Up to Date, is not so sure the IPC model would really bring costs down for schools: "The issue is that someone must provide storage [for software, drivers, etc.]," he says. "It has to be there, one way or another--either you'll pay for it as part of the hardware costs up front, or as a service fee down the road." Bardige believes that until future broadband services can easily transmit the mutlimedia contents of a CD-ROM over the Net,it's preferable to have local storage and processing. Other critics see net-centric computers not as a leap forward but as a step back, in that terminals with less power and very little memory would be placed on the desks of students and teachers. <p>
The bottom line may be this: Even if an IPC is not fully a computer, it would enable students to start using computers. As long as those students have access to the same software and can perform the same tasks as their peers with PCs, the IPC could become the affordable net-ready solution for schools.<P><hr>

<a name="bag"></a>
<H3>The State of Educational Technology: A MixedBag</H3>
Here's the good news: the student-to-computer ratio for North American schools has improved to roughly 9-to-1. The bad news is that over half of those computers are so old that they can not be used for Internet access. <p>
This information, along with a wealth of other findings concerning the state of school technology, has been released in Education Market Report, a comprehensive overview available from the Software Publishers Association (Washington, D.C.). Among the many sources that provided research for this report were CCCConsulting, Inc., Quality Education Data (QED), Microsoft Corp., Scholastic Inc.and Electronic Learning, Market Data Retrieval, and Anne Wujcik & Associates. <p>
Other key trends identified in the report include: <p>
<ul><li>Almost one-third of all teachers and students have computers athome.
<li> Over half a billion dollars ($565 million) was spent oninstructional software during school year 1993-94.	 <li>Forty-two percent of U.S. K-12 schools owned modems during the1994-95 school year, up from 29 percent from the previous school year (QED,1995).
<li> From state to state, ed tech funding is a mixed bag. Texas and Florida are cited as examples of states committing resources and funds towards improving education technology.
</ul>
<p>In related news, the SPA has published its Report on the Effectiveness of Technology in Schools, '95-'96, a study of the role technology plays in learners'achievement, self-concept, and student-teacher interactions. The research was conducted on behalf of the SPA by ed tech consulting firm Interactive Educational Systems Design, Inc., based on five years (1990-95) of research interviews, reports, and original research projects. Among other data, the study indicates that technology's impact is affected by student population, software design, the level of student access to technology, and the role of the instructor. <p>

<H3>Talking for TechCredits</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you think talk is cheap, you may find it's gained extra value thanks to TechCredits, a plan sponsored by AT&T and the Computer Learning Foundation. The plan allows AT&T residential long-distance and True Rewards customers to select any school in eight states piloting this program, and grant that school TechCredits based on the customers' monthly long distance charges. Schools receive regular statements of accumulated credits, redeemable for software, printers, Windows or Macintosh computers, and other items from a specially compiled TechCredits catalog. The pilot states are California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, and Rhode Island. <P>
The project, "Technology for Education Program-A Community Partnership," is scheduled to run for one year, and then be evaluated for possible expansion in to other states.

<H3>Distance Learning via Phone Lines</H3>
<blockquote>A company that found its fortune as a U.S. government technology contractor is branching out to offer a more affordable type of distance learning to schools.OutReach Technologies, Inc. is gearing up to market a simultaneous voice and PC data/graphics system using a single modem and a school's ordinary, already-installed phone lines. This distance learning system, called ConferEase, can foster multipoint voice and graphical communication among as many as 72 participants, using one central Multipoint Controller Unit (MCU) to handleall the activity. Students and/or teachers from widespread districts and campuses would be able to speak to one another in real time, while viewing related charts,data, text, animations, or any other presentations on their computer screens. <P>
The largest expense involved with ConferEase is the central MCU, which lists at about $24,000, but would be available for less to educational development partners or other learning institutions. Schools or districts interested in becoming education development partners, or who want to learn more about OutReach's ConferEase system, can contact Pamela Arnold, marketing communicationsmanager, OutReach Technologies, 8975 Guilford Rd., Suite 100, Columbia, MD 21046,(401) 381-5087, or e-mail: <A HREF="mailto:PArnold@csti-md.com">PArnold@csti-md.com</A>.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Diplomas from Cyberspace</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The state of Minnesota is allowing three public high schools to offer diplomaprograms entirely via the Internet. The state will contribute its standard per-pupil cost--about $4,460 per year--to allow any Minnesota resident under age 21 who has left high school to earn a diploma from one of these schools. Students (including adults) from out of state and even overseas can also register for the online program, called MindQuest, provided they pay the per-pupil fee. MindQuest's Kevin Byrne says the results of the new program would be an actual high school diploma, not a GED, based on a cumulative student "authentic assessment" portfolio and occasional exams proctored by an online mentor.<P>
For more on MindQuest: e-mail MindQuest at <A HREF="mailto:shape4@primenet.com">shape4@primenet.com</A> or contact Kevin Byrne, SHAPE Coordinator at 8900 Portland Ave., Bloomington, MN 55420,(612) 885-8511.

<STRONG>Internet In A Box For Kids to Be Donated to K-12 Schools</STRONG><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In a move bound to nudge more of the nation's schools into cyberspace, CompuServe's Internet Division (formerly SPRY) will give free copies of its upcoming release, Internet in a Box for Kids ($49.95 retail) to any school sending a formal request on school stationery.<P>
The software, to be available in mid-October, provides an"Internet suite" -- that is, combining communications (including e-mail), browser, and other functions with a graphical interface appealing to kids. Additionally, for teachers and parents concerned with the more trouble somepossibilities of the Internet (inappropriate contact by adults, etc.), Internet in a Box for Kids includes:<P>
<UL><LI> A mail-audit, so that teachers/parents can see who's been mailing letters to your child, and vice versa;
<LI> Site-blocking technology, to prevent access to unwanted areas of the Internet;
<LI> A timer, so that adults can keep on-line access and line charges under control;
<LI> A password/management utility for teachers/parents;
<LI> Disable option for child's e-mail.</UL><P>
Strategic marketing also plays a part in this offer:according to CompuServe Internet Division product manager Kevin Britt, once students get the feel of the program at school, the idea is that they would also want it at home. Further, Britt told EL that the company is considering subsidizing on-line access for a limited number of schools, but at EL deadline there was no formal plan under which the offer would take place. Interested schools should write to:Kevin Britt, product manager, CompuServe Internet Division, 316 Occidental Ave. South, Suite 200, Seattle, WA 98115(phone: 800-777-9638).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Telecommunications Reform: The Drama Continues</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Eleventh-hour support by a key Congressman is keeping hope alive for schools and libraries as the House and Senate begin conferencing on telecommunications reform.<P>
Near midnight on August 2, House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley of Virginia--the sponsor of the huge House telecommunications reform bill--promised to support the intent of the Morella-Orton "affordable access" amendment when the bill goes to the House-Senate conference committee. This amendment, sponsored by Rep. Connie Morella (R-Md.), Bill Orton (D-Utah), and others, would give schools, public libraries, and rural telemedicine discounted access to advanced telecommunications services.<P>
Thanks to the House Rules Committee, however, the Morella-Orton amendment nevermade it to the floor before the House passed H.R. 1555, its version of telecommunications reform legislation (the Senate had passed its own version, S.652, in June). While the Senate's version had a discounted tariff provisionfor schools--in the form of the Snowe-Rockefeller amendment--the House telecom bill did not. This fall, a House-Senate conference committee will determine whether education and library provisions stay in the final bill. Many watching this issue feel that Bliley's last-minute statement provides an important opening.<P>
To build momentum for a low-cost access provision, the 45 or so groups working on this issue are urging educators to write letters to Congress in support of theSenate version. Model letters are available on the World Wide Web at <A HREF="http://digital.cosn.org/">http://digital.cosn.org/</A>.** You can also send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:letter@cosn.org">letter@cosn.org </A> and an auto-mailer will send you a model letter. The message is simple: when the conference committee meets this fall, the Snowe-Rockefeller amendment must stay in the final bill. <P>

Whenever I ponder the concept of teamwork, I think immediately of the Big Red Machine-the Cincinnati Reds. I grew up in close proximity to Riverfront Stadium and during the mid-1970's, the Reds were unbeatable. Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan, Tony Perez, and the rest of gang could beat you with their eyes closed. They could not show up for the game, and still beat you.
<P>
I often have asked myself why the Machine was so effective. The answer is simple: Each player had a very specific role to play on the field yet each role melded into the other. Inevitably, one of the players would be injured, or traded, and the Machine would develop a "ping" or a rattle. But replacements were quickly found and trained, and it was up and running before opposing players could say "Cincinnati" three times, real fast. This is the essence of teamwork, and it is the only way to win.
<P>
In trying to obtain grants, it is wise to learn from the Machine-collaboration and teamwork are an absolute necessity. The Cincinnati Reds don't have a patent on the word "machine," so make it the goal of your school or school district to create a team that, once in position, is very difficult to defeat. You will soon find yourself producing winning grant proposals-and using your best and most effective resources in the process.
<P>
Here's the starting lineup of your grant team: 
<P>
<A NAME="RESEARCHER">
<STRONG>GRANT RESEARCHER.</STRONG> <BR>She's your pitcher. She's got a great arm for delivering those delicious grant opportunities to the staff. She keeps her wits as hordes of hungry grant fans rush in with chants of "Get me a grant for this!" and "Get me a grant for that!" She reminds the staff that funders give money for ideas more than needs, and she emphasizes the school's established funding priorities that everyone must adhere to. She also knows there's no sense in throwing pitches all day just because the balls are there. She'll wisely spend time only on those grants for which her team will be competitive.
	
<P>
<HR WIDTH=40%>

<A NAME="ANALYSTS">
<STRONG>GRANT ANALYSTS.</STRONG> <BR>A core group of teachers serves collectively as your catcher. They take what the grant researcher throws them, analyze the information, then decide whether or not to proceed. Catchers are very important. They give signals (red light or green light) to the rest of the team regarding each grant opportunity. Since the team has set priorities (such as funding for technology, playground equipment, outdoor education centers, or library books), the catcher ensures they either stick to the priorities or change them as a team. Once the decision is made on a particular grant, the catcher calls on the infield for assistance.
<P>

Once the team decides to go for a grant, and once everyone is clear on the grant's guidelines and deadlines, then creation of the proposal can begin. And in the infield....
<P>
<HR WIDTH=40%>
<A NAME="PROFILER">
<STRONG>THE PROFILER.</STRONG> <BR>This person, your first baseman, is responsible for maintaining and continuously updating boilerplate information on the school. This information should include enrollment statistics, demographics, school awards, prior grants, community make-up, staff characteristics, financial data, or any other pertinent information that changes little during the school year. Boilerplate information may be used throughout a grant proposal, but it mostly is called for in either an abstract, introduction, or needs assessment.
	<P>
<HR WIDTH=40%>


<A NAME="ASSESSOR">
<STRONG>NEEDS ASSESSOR.</STRONG> <BR>This is your second baseman. Every grant proposal addresses some type of educational problem, then offers a creative solution. To show the funder that your team is aware of the problem and its root causes, the second baseman pulls up citations from recent research, studies, quotations, and professional analysis like they were so many grounders up the middle. He also applies this knowledge to the overall proposal by setting up the needs assessment.
	
<P>
<HR WIDTH=40%>

<A NAME="COLLABORATION">
<STRONG>COLLABORATION MANAGER.</STRONG> <BR>At shortstop is the player responsible for identifying and soliciting individuals and organizations that can assist you with the project your grant proposes. Certain projects will require outside paid assistance-for instance, the services of neutral evaluators, typically college professors or graduate students-and they may be paid a stipend from grant monies. You may also pay training specialists, consultants, or software designers. However, most collaboration is the unpaid pulling together of interested parties. For instance, your school may be seeking grant funds for an environmental project. An environmental scientist who happens to live near your school agrees to collaborate during your design and implementation phases to ensure scientific validity. The collaboration manager locates these people, paid and unpaid, and determines their overall value to the grant. 
	<P>
<HR WIDTH=40%>


<A NAME="PROCESS">
<STRONG>PROCESS MANAGER.</STRONG> <BR>Also known as the editor and deadline-setter, this player covers third base. From her vantage point, she can easily view the pitcher, catcher, and the rest of the infield. Her job is to monitor the quality of prose being turned out, and to make sure the team remains on schedule. Every draft of the grant proposal goes to her for review and editing, and she should be adept at desktop publishing. For instance, the third baseman must know that quotation marks are not inch marks, and that word-processed documents only require one space after a period. Sound like nit-picking? You betcha. But the third baseman is key to submitting a professional-looking, professional-sounding document-one that arrives on time and leaves the entire team feeling pleasantly exhausted, not stressed and angry.
	<P>
And in the outfield...Collectively, the backbone of every grant proposal is your outfield. This is comprised of individuals and organizations that will support your efforts. Unlike collaborators, who assist your team for a specific purpose during the life of your grant, the outfield stays in the background and grabs those nasty mistakes before they leave the park. 

<P>
<HR WIDTH=40%>

<A NAME="BUSINESS">
<STRONG>BUSINESS MANAGER.</STRONG> <BR>Playing left field, this essential person offers guidance and advice on purchasing grant-supported items and maintaining accurate financial records. 

<P>
<HR WIDTH=40%>

<A NAME="PRINCIPAL">
<STRONG>PRINCIPAL AND/OR SUPERINTENDENT.</STRONG> <BR>They're in center field. They are there to support your grant project by providing substitutes, release time, conference and workshop attendance, and specialized training. 
<P>
<HR WIDTH=40%>


<A NAME="PARENTS">
<STRONG>PARENTS.</STRONG> <BR>Out in right field there's a vast resource often overlooked in grant projects. Just say the word, and parents can be there to help you in any or all phases of your project. Use them as utility players; they don't mind. 
	<P>

The Big Red Machine was an incredible sight to behold-but its legacy could live on in your school. Understand that writing and obtaining grants is a team process and then form an unbeatable force among your staff, local businesses, and parents. This type of school-community effort is very impressive to a funder, and having a grant-writing team boosts your chances of success more than any other strategy. So lace up those spikes, oil that mitt, toss a wad of bubble gum in your mouth, and take the field. Let's PLAY BALL!

<CENTER><H2>Grant-Writer's Primer:<BR>
Creating a Fundable Monster</H2>
<H3>The secret is to start with a fantastic idea and build from there</H3></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>By <A HREF="#norris">Dennis M. Norris</A></STRONG><P>

In one of my past lives, Dr. Frankenstein came into my office and asked me to write a grant for him (I have always been a grant writer). "Norris," he said, "I need an electromagnetic, worm-driven, left-handed thingamabob."<P>
"What for?" I asked.<P>
"Well...because I don't have one," he sputtered incredulously.<P>
I stood up from my desk, annoyed. "You can't expect me to write a proposal to The Transylvania Foundation and ask for something simply because you don't have one!"<P>
"Isn't that what a grant is?" he said, pouting.<P>
"I'm sorry," I said, "you're way off track." I tried to soften the blow. "Think instead of a wonderful project--a creative, innovative undertaking--that will address a problem. You need that vital piece of equipment to pull it off, but your project is what a granter wants to fund."<P>
Dr. Frankenstein's face came alive and his eyes widened. "Hey, I know!" he shouted. "The thinga-mabob could be used to restore dead human tissue." He thought for a moment, then added, "I need a live specimen . . . " He pulled a string from his pocket and started to measure my head . . .<P>

<STRONG>Ideas First, "Stuff" Later</STRONG><BR>
Many teachers and administrators make the same mistake as Dr. Frankenstein did. They see grants as showers of money from foundations and corporations which like nothing better than to buy computers and send teachers to conferences in Bora Bora. Too many of us think of grants as free money to buy neat stuff, rather than opportunities for planned and needed projects that yield positive and measurable results.<P>

<STRONG>Reactive vs. Proactive</STRONG><BR>
Grant seekers go after funding in one of two ways: reactive or proactive. Some funders issue grant announcements that provide project guidelines, letters-of-support requirements, page restrictions, deadlines, and preset money ranges. Successful applicants are who are willing to work within the framework that is given. You react to this type of grant by analyzing current needs and resources, then give them what you think they want. Most of the time it is worth the effort, and often these grants allow the applicant to become very creative within the guidelines. Reactive grant opportunities include almost all federal and state programs, along with certain foundation/corporation competitions in areas of special interest to their boards (intergenerational illiteracy, juvenile delinquency, environmental issues, and the like). If you respond to a grant opportunity in a proactive way, however, then you've already identified a need, you've wrapped a creative idea around it, and now you're out hunting for funds. You are taking the initiative to fund your project, rather than reacting to a funding competition. Either way is fine, but in the proactive mode you are more free 
to "create the monster."<P>

<STRONG>Start Brainstorming</STRONG><BR>
A few years ago I was approached by one of our middle schools and politely asked to place 50 or 60 laptop computers into the science classrooms. My response was like the one I had for Dr. Frankenstein. I found myself shouting, "Create the monster!" I asked them to bring their entire staff together to have a gigantic brainstorming session. Their task was to take their need for computers and transform it into a workable, creative idea. "When you make equipment, training, and professional development requirements peripheral to your central idea," I explained, "then you make yourself more attractive to funders interested in dreams, not nuts and bolts." Tell funders you are going to create a monster, and that you will need certain items to help you do this. Don't do the opposite and tell funders that you need certain items, since at some point in time you hope they will be used to help create a monster. <P>

<STRONG>An Idea Is Born</STRONG><BR>
Through our brainstorming, the middle school teachers came to the conclusion that laptops are perfect for telecommunications, and with telecommunications our students could gain knowledge and information otherwise unavailable to them. Since our home state of Indiana is basically landlocked in the middle of the Cornbelt, and most Midwestern students have had little or no exposure to the world's oceans (except for what they see on Baywatch), we set out to form a telecommunications partnership with the United States Coast Guard's ice-breaking vessel, the Polar Star. We boosted our "fundability" by forming our objectives around female under-representation in science, math, and engineering. The SIGNALS Project (Supplemental Instruction for Girls in the Nautical Applications of Learning Science) was born of a need for computers. It now creates unparalleled excitement and reward for young girls who are online with professional female scientists. It provides instruction and inspiration for all students, but it allows young girls and minorities a chance to envision a future that, without the project, would have continued to seem out of reach.<P>

Think of yourself as the one with the money, the person who gets to choose which grants get funded and which do not. You read a mountain of proposals droning on about bytes and boxes with not a word about ideas. Imagine your reaction when a terrific monster jumps out of the pile. If the grant writer has done the job correctly, you'll be picking yourself up off the floor, cracking a grin, and yelling "Bingo!"<P>

Goals-Objectives-Activities</H2>
<H3>Translating the grant writing mantra<BR>
into understandable and fundable English</H3></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<FONT SIZE=4>By <A HREF="#norris">Dennis Norris</A></FONT><P>  
Recently I caught myself speeding along one of our major interstate highways. I wasn't in a hurry, and I wasn't fleeing some form of real or imagined threat. I was in a deep, transcendental zone. My foot grew heavier as the hypnotic white lines pulsated beside me. I snapped out of it just as my radar detector screeched hysterically, warning me of an impending cash outlay and a sentencing to defensive driving school. Suddenly I shuddered at the thought of those three words that had clouded my consciousness and sent me deep within the abysmal fog. ''Goals-objectives-activities,'' I said aloud, in expressionless monotone. ''Man,'' I added, ''I've been working too hard.''<P>
As teachers and administrators, do we know precisely what is meant by these three terms that are the mantra for writing grants? It is difficult enough to stay abreast of changes within our own professions, let alone remain competent in the field of philanthropy and fund solicitation. To many educators either unfamiliar with or intimidated by the grant writing process, the proper use of ''goals-objectives-activities'' in a proposal is as elusive as the Arctic Yhetti.<P>
<STRONG>A goal by any other name?</STRONG> Let's try to expose the mystery, starting with goals. A goal is many things to many people, but only one thing to a grant funder--what you are trying to achieve, written in very general terms. In a perfect world, all of our goals would be met and surpassed. Of course, it's not a perfect world, but that doesn't mean expectations should be proportionately lowered. Goals should be constructed just beyond the grasp, requiring extra effort and resources exceeding normal limits to reach. Kids speak in terms of goals all the time when they say, ''I want to be President,'' or ''I'm going to be an astronaut.'' Theoretically there is nothing stopping them from obtaining their goals. Realistically, however, we can assume their chances are slim without strategy and applied effort.When goals are stated in a grant proposal, they should be lofty. You are looking for a best case scenario like ''this project will help students learn telecommunications,''or ''our goal is to make parents more active in homework assignments.'' As one of my colleagues is fond of saying, ''You know something is a goal when, after you say it, optimistic people shout 'Cool!' and pessimistic people shout 'Fat chance!' '' Don't worry about measuring your goals--your objectives will do that for you.<P>
<STRONG>Lofty ideas into hard data.</STRONG> Now let's get our hands dirty and talk about objectives, the meat of every grant proposal. I have seen teachers visibly cringe at the mention of this word, and I was once swatted at like a horsefly after informing an administrator her objectives were unmeasurable. There is a simple formula grant applicants can follow when writing objectives, and it is very close to the familiar journalistic code. Objectives must answer who is going to do what, when and where it will be done, and how it will be measured.<P>
Recently I wrote a proposal in which the goal was to effectively deliver adult literacy classes to underserved areas of Indianapolis. The objectives focused on two areas, retention and learning gains, and they read as follows:<P>
<UL><LI><STRONG>Retention:</STRONG> Project REACT staff will accomplish a quarterly 50 percent retention rate for the first year, and a quarterly 50 percent retention rate for the second year. Rates will be measured comparatively through beginning enrollments, average daily attendance, and average stay in the program. <P>
<LI><STRONG>Learning Gains:</STRONG> For those participants who complete a level of instruction. Project REACT staff will show quarterly group learning gains of 80 percent. Gains will be measured by both computer assessment and management programs, the use of standardized tests, and by evaluation of instructors and tutors on an individualized basis.</UL><P>
As you can see, objectives give real measurement to the pursuit of the goal. They translate lofty ideas into hard data, and they create project benchmarks from which success and/or failure can be gauged.<P>
<STRONG>Getting busy.</STRONG> Activities can be thought of as the ''busywork'' of a grant proposal. They indicate how, exactly, project staff will carry out their tasks in the never-ending quest to meet objectives. Activities are the means to a project's end; they are the nautical chart by which the voyage to objectives is navigated. They may include specific methodology, timelines, testing procedures, logistical strategies, or any number of tasks designed to make the project run smoothly and effectively. <P>
Activities should be constructed so that they evolve logically from the goals and objectives. That is, to adequately recruit participants to an entry-level adult literacy program, it would not be wise to use text-based brochures and complicated registration forms. In the Project REACT example, activities under the Retention objective included creating computer-generated progress reports, providing professional development for instructors and tutors, and involving members of the community for peer support. To meet the Learning Gains Objective, activities centered on adapting testing strategies to participants' learning levels, creating realistic and achievable tasks, and modifying student attention-span, expectancy and memory. Both sets of activities guided both the physical and mental tasks of the project, and in so doing were the seamless pathway to objective fulfillment and goal attainment.<P>
<STRONG>Remember the mantra.</STRONG> This trio of goals-objectives-activities is truly the mantra of every successful grant writer. One must think in these terms in order to write properly constructed proposals, to impress potential funders, and to create a usable document that will last the life of the project and beyond. That being said, let's all assume the lotus position, close your eyes, and repeat after me:  ''Goals-objectives-activities. Goals-objectives-activities. Goals-objectives-activities. . .''<P>

<IMG SRC="../commongraphics/star.gif"> <FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Computer Learning Sweepstakes</FONT></STRONG><BR>
The Computer Learning Foundation (CLF) is running two sweepstakes launched in conjunction with Computer Learning Month. For the Computer Learning Month Event Sweepstakes, an educator must host a computer-learning event involving the theme, ''Partnering to Help Children Learn.'' Qualifying teachers/event leaders will receive a certificate and be automatically entered into the sweepstakes. Two grand prizes of Macintosh Performas with internal CD-ROM drive and modem will be awarded, and the winners' schools will also get Performas. Six second-prize winners will receive software. <P>

The Eighth Annual Computer Learning Foundation Certified School Sweepstakes encourages innovative use of technology in school; to enter, teachers must attain one of three levels of certification. At the highest level, entrants form a collaborative partnership with homes, community, or business. A grand prize of an IBM EduQuest Forty-Five PC will be awarded to the winner at each level. Deadline for both sweepstakes: Nov. 30. For information/guidelines: CLF, Dept. ED95, Box 60007, Palo Alto, CA 94306<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

Q & A with Dennis Norris, grant writer for Perry Township Schools<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><EM>How did you get the idea for the grants? </EM></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Teachers at Douglas MacArthur Elementary approached me about developing a project focusing on environmental science, which is the school's curricular emphasis. The third-grade students raised tadpoles last fall, which were released as frogs into nearby Buck Creek. I came up with the idea of having a fictitious frog (named Mac, for the school) escape and journey by water from Buck Creek all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. We called it Project CROAK! (Creeks, Rivers, Oceans and Kids!) and the idea behind it was to show kids that interdependent relationships make collaboration critical to maintaining a healthy environment. I made a lot of calls to schools all along the connecting waterways that Mac would be traveling. We wanted to target schools that didn't have much technology and were isolated because they were rural or in an inner city area.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><EM>How did the Project CROAK! work?</EM></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Twenty-eight school signed up to be partners with us in five states--Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. We asked their third-grade classes to create text, sound, and graphics about their portion of the water route and any environmental hazards Mac the Frog might encounter on his adventure. All of the schools used IBM Linkway to put their contributions together. Students wrote stories about how Mac got from one place to another. One class warned Mac about a big plant on the river where they dumped a lot of chemicals; another class told him about all the fishermen he might encounter. The kids really got into it. When we combined all the Linkway folders so that each school could get the complete story about how Mac got all the way to the Gulf of Mexico (where he was last seen basking in the sun, sipping on bug juice), we discovered that our collaboration would fill 60 floppy disks.

<FONT SIZE=4><EM>What did the grants support?</EM></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The initial grant was $40,000 from the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation. A good part of the initial funds went toward the purchase of 15 Zenith multimedia computers in the third grade classrooms. The remainder, a $5,000 grant from Pioneering Partners of which $2,000 is matched locally, is for managing and disseminating the project to interested schools.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><EM>What learning needs does the grant meet?</EM></FONT><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As Project CROAK! readies for its second year with the new third graders, the objectives continue to be an increase in students' knowledge about water pollution, restoration, and conservation; appreciation for collaborative and interdependent relationships; and competency with manipulative software.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><EM>What was a key factor in making it work?</EM></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Keeping in touch with all the schools involved. You really have to have a communications plan so that everyone is kept up to date and on target.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><EM>What are your plans for the future? </EM></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I'm starting work on writing a grant having our school and others across the country follow Flo the Buffalo on the Buffalo Trace, a trail that started in Indiana and went out west. And we'd also like to get our school hooked into telecommunications by "sending" Comet the Mouse up into space and connecting up to schools all over the world through the Internet to track his visits to other planets.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<IMG SRC="../commongraphics/star.gif"><FONT SIZE=4>Refurbishing Donated Computers</FONT><BR>
The Lazarus Foundation receives donations of old computers from business, industry, government agencies, and others, and refurbishes them for useful classroom computing. Currently, Lazarus has sites in Virginia, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Vermont. and California, but is working to open sites in 20 states, says Lazarus president Don Bard. Schools applying for partnerships with the Lazarus Foundation usually approach with a specific instructional project in mind. Schools are also encouraged to find donor companies or colleges getting rid of old computers, printers, peripherals or software (Microsoft Corp. has donated quantities of MS-DOS and Microsoft Works for DOS). The Lazarus Foundation conducts training for teachers who become Lazarus volunteers on how to repair and refurbish computers, and how to train others to do the same. In order to form a partnership with Lazarus, the principal of the applying school must send a formal request on school stationery to: Don Bard, Lazarus Foundation, 10378 Eclipse Way, Columbia, MD 21044. </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<STRONG>Team</STRONG>: Jeff Holte, technology coordinator; Bob Berry, network technician; ShirleyKratochvil, staff development specialist<BR>
<STRONG>Time Frame</STRONG>: June 1993-July 1994<BR>
<STRONG>Grant Tip</STRONG>: Technology is the last step; restructuring the school is the first.<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><EM>How did you get the grant?</EM></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>U.S. West called us. They wanted to experiment with electronically connecting every home to school. They needed to test hardware and software products and explore the opportunities created by the home-school connection. Because we were early pioneers in building local area networks within schools, US West knew we had the technical capability to make the project work.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><EM>What wasyour educational vision behind the project? </EM></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We wanted to improve the communication between families and schools and to involve parents in the day-to-day "real time" educational progress of their children. We connected everyone's home: all families, all teachers, secretaries, and administrators. The 2,000 Minitel terminals allowed folks at home to log onto our servers at school.They could access our information resources on our local area networks and usethe Internet gateway.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><EM>What were the results?</EM></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We underestimated the popularity of the chat service by students and parents. Kids were talking with each other in real time -- incessantly. In fact, they quickly overwhelmed the modem pool. We had to limit the chat to 2 hours per week; if you wanted more, you had to pay. Parents were chatting as well. Parents would communicate with each other about parenting practices, rules in the home, how to help their kids with school. Two single parents met and then married. One was in California in a similar project with U.S. West but linked to our network.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><EM>What were the disappointments?</EM></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There was not as much interaction between teachers and parents as we hoped. Though we were technically capable of providing real-time information for parents, therealities are that teachers' time is not organized to allow them to provide that kind of daily information. Our semester-oriented assessment of students is not geared to real-time or even daily updates about how kids are doing.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><EM>What did you learn?</EM></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We had the interest of parents but we just could not deliver. I think what this means is that we have to look at the school schedule and our assessment methods. The hardest thing to do is to give up what you are currently doing. This is true for both parents and schoolpeople. Most parents are used to face-to-face models at teacher conferences or report cards as ways of getting information on their kids. They're not used to real-time interaction online. On the school end, we have to think about a way to restructure and assess so that teachers can have up-to-the-minute evaluation of their students. We thought if we had technology it would happen. But real-time interaction is a whole new ball game. Finding a technical solution is really the last step--the icing on the cake.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<FONT SIZE=4><EM>What are you doing this year?</EM></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In addition to working on home computer access so people can dial into the school's computers for data bases and e-mail, we have two groups working on assessment. How do we redo our assessment so it can be available to the parents now that we have the technology to access it? If we don't rethink what we are doing, parents won't have anything to dialup.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<A NAME="newtool"></A>
<H3>New software tool to track students' research strategies</H3>
It is impossible to overlook the excitement that the Internet is generating or the resulting scramble by educators to connect classrooms and schools. All over the country, schools that are not yet networked are fervently discussing how to do it and how they'll fund it. The cost--in dollars and human resources--of obtaining, maintaining, and using connectivity dwarfs the levels spent on earlier technologies.<P>

But once the lines are in, and once even a small number of teachers are getting their students online, an important question arises: How will we  know that the investment is paying off? How do we know that students are effectively taking advantage of all the educational resources the Internet has to offer?<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="doubts"></A>
<H3>Teachers' gnawing doubts</H3>
Teachers already working with telecommunications in their classrooms are probably most aware of these challenges right now. Their excitement about the technology and the opportunities it offers is tempered with some gnawing doubts. As much time as you might spend planning a lesson,  finding interesting spots on the Internet, or searching out Web sites, it is impossible to be sure exactly where your students are going online at every moment, or most importantly, to know what they are absorbing as they explore. Are they revisiting a small number of sites? Are they moving randomly without the guidance of any organized research process? Are they learning anything meaningful from the resources they now have access to? Understanding students' research processes as they develop their project work can be far more important to a teacher than the final outcome. But it is obviously impossible to always be there, observing and commenting on students' work as it develops or encouraging them to take it further.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="footprints"></A>
<H3>Follow the footprints</H3>
What if the network could be harnessed to be a self-documenting research tool? At the Education Development Center/Center for Children and Technology, we have been experimenting with one such technique for use as a valuable research tool. Our Footprints project, funded in part by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, has developed a software system that can track what applications are used on an individual computer, how they are being used, and for how long.<P>

This software presents users with questions to capture their thinking before, during, and/or after the use of any application. The information collected on individual computers is stored in a centralized database, which can hold an enormous quantity of information. Individual sites scattered all over the world can act as participants in any particular study. Accumulated data is available immediately for analysis and reporting by researchers.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="minds"></A>
<H3>How inquiring minds work</H3>
We are particularly interested in using Footprints to help study the development of students' inquiry skills. It could allow us to collect the necessary information to understand how students structure their research, how the process of collecting information informs and shapes their later research, and how they reshape their central questions along the way. Here's how it would work: Once Footprints is installed on the computer, a short survey appears when a student logs on and begins to work. The survey asks the student to describe what she or he is trying to accomplish during the session. The software then automatically begins tracking the time and sequence of use with each application. Additional surveys could appear as needed, and the software could track information specific to an application, such as a record of which URLs were called up by a Web browser. When the student finishes, another form appears asking for an evaluation of what she or he accomplished.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="browsing"></A>
<H3>Two styles of Web browsing?</H3>
Findings from such research would be useful not only to the research community but also to the teachers using Footprints in their classrooms. One hypothesis that we want to investigate is that students fall into two groups: those who spend the whole period on the Web, and those who move between the Web and other software tools several times in the course of a period. We would like to see if it is true that students who move frequently between the Web and analysis tools like word processors and spreadsheets are making more substantive, analytical use of Web-based material than those students who are spending more, but less-focused, time on the Web.<P>

Of course, there are significant ethical concerns that must be considered when using a tool like the Footprints, specifically the danger of its being used surreptitiously to invade students' privacy. We have purposely designed the software so that users will always actively choose to participate in the data collection--the tracking software will not function without a user's knowledge and agreement. If you want to look at larger trends across projects as the database grows and the number of projects included in it increases, safeguards for individual and school identity must always be maintained as they would be in any research project.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="future"></A>
<H3>Future teacher tool</H3>
While pilot testing Footprints, we learned how interested teachers were in having a classroom version of the system, so that data could be used on a classroom level to help them assess student work on project-based curriculums. A tool like the Footprints might provide a way for teachers to collect detailed information on the progress of their students' work that they would not otherwise be able to collect. We hope to make a later version of Footprints available for this type of assessment.<P><HR><P>

<a name="tapes"></A>
<H3>Students make and use tapes to evaluate<BR>
their own performances</H3>
Two parents, two students, a visitor from the city university, and a teacher huddle around desks carefully arranged in a semicircle at a small alternative high school in the Bronx, New York. It is the day of the roundtable--the culminating event of the semester at which students present and discuss their portfolios to demonstrate that they have met the school's standards. A student with a video camera stands  off to the side and begins to pan the participants faces as they introduce themselves. The last student in the circle clears her throat and begins: "Parents, teachers, and invited guests. I want to talk to you about my work on the social impact of AIDS...."<P>
At the other end of the city, in Brooklyn, four juniors in a pre-engineeringclass at a large public technical high school stand before a classroom of peers and invited guests. In the front row sits a panel of "experts"--an engineer from the local tunnel and bridge authority, a graduate of the class, and physics and English teachers.  On the table in front of the room, the students position the model street sweeper that they designed and constructed out of Lego-likematerials, Plexiglas, and small motors. The students talk about their work on the project, gesturing to their sketches and blueprints. They flip a switch that jump-starts their street sweeper to begin zipping across the tabletop. A student with a video camera zooms in for a close-up of the gear system that makes the street sweeper's wheels turn. The engineer asks the students: "Why did you decide to use three gears instead of two?"<P>
The two scenarios above have become assessment "rituals" in two high schools that the Center for Children and Technology/EDC has been collaborating with. We have been investigating the types of performances and projects that can be recorded, studied, and evaluated using videotape. We interviewed 16 students from the two schools to investigate their views of performance-based assessments and video in particular. How do the assessments relate to their own learning? Do they make useof the video records afterward?<P><HR>

 <a name="performance"></a>
<H3>How students view performance assessment</H3>
We asked the students how they measured their own learning. More than 60 percent of those interviewed told us that they know that they have learned something when they can explain their work and ideas to others or when they can successfully teach others difficult concepts or content. The rest said they know they've learned something when they are able to apply the knowledge to new problems or situations, or when they can create physical projects that actually work.<P>
Perhaps it is not surprising that the majority (75 percent) expressed a preference for presentations, roundtables, and journals over other forms of assessment like tests, written reports, and interviews. They said that these formats allowed people to see what they are really capable of doing. "[The assessors] look at you, but then they can look inside you. It doesn't allow me to hide behind [a grade] of 95," said one student.<P>
Whatever their preferences, nearly all reported that presentations and roundtables --along with other alternative assessment methods like keeping portfolios and journals-- required more maturity, ownership, and a great deal more work. Many felt that they were being prepared for college since these methods helped them to think and speak for themselves. Others felt overscrutinized and overworked. Whether critics or supporters, they all felt that these assessments were quite different from traditional paper-and-pencil tests."In other classes, the things that you miss and don't do are more on the teacher's shoulders," said one student. "With this assessment you need maturity,since you are motivating yourself."<P><HR>

 <a name="record"></A>
<H3> Utilizing the video record</H3>
Since video creates a permanent record, we wanted to see how the tapes were used once the initial assessment was made.<P>
In many schools using alternative assessment, videotapes of students' performances typically end up in a cabinet rather than being used as a reflective tool by students. In the two schools we worked with, students reported that they rarely reviewed their tapes. They said that they did not feel it was necessary since it was not required by their teachers nor were the videos always made available. More than half said that they felt uncomfortable about looking at them because they were self-conscious about their appearance.<P>
Several students, however, did review their tapes. They reported that the tapes allowed them to see things that they were not aware of doing during their performances. Others spoke of how the videos showed them how they collaborated with other students and made them ask critical questions about whether they were monopolizing the presentation. More often than not, though, students said that they watched the tapes because they wanted to see how they looked while presenting.<P><HR>

 <a name="focus"></A>
<H3> Helping students shift focus</H3>
The fact that students acknowledge performance-based assessments as valuable to their learning--but still tend to focus on how they looked rather than the content of their presentations--points to the need for finding ways to help students reflect more deeply. Just as we ask students to go back to their journals and notes to reflect about their learning, why not help them develop the skills of critically looking at their "knowledge in use" on videotape? We will need to provide time for reflection and tools to help students assess their ownperformances throughout the year. <P><HR>

<a name="tools"></a>
<H3> New tools for self-assessment</H3>
A number of computer tools are available to help students analyze their own taped performances. <EM>C-Video</EM>, produced by the Institute for Research and Learning, enables students to revisit and annotate videotapes. With a computer, cable, and VCR, students can use the software to cue up important segments of their performances and create a written log of their thoughts. Another tool currently being developed by the Coalition of Essential Schools and IBM is a digitized portfolio that allows students to include video selections <P>
With video records of these performances, appropriate tools, and time for reflection, students can examine how their skills and knowledge have changed in the course of the year. In this way, they can learn to use their recorded past experiences to develop a more insightful view of their work. <P>

<a name="teams"></A>
<H3>Using teams and technology to make<BR>
inclusion possible one grade after another</H3>
For several years now, there has been a growing recognition that the best way to educate most students is through inclusion--students with disabilities and those without working together in the same classroom. This evolution in thinking has progressed greatly thanks to the development of a wide range of technology--computers, video, telecommunications, and assistive devices to help disabled students function in regular classrooms.<P>
Yet, despite the promise that technology offers and the innovations in many individual classrooms, few schools or districts have included significant numbers of students with special needs over their whole school career. Giving students a single year of effective teaching and learning in isolated classrooms is not enough; individual students need to participate, year after year, in educational experiences that are customized to their particular needs, and where teaching and learning in one grade, including the use of technology, builds a foundation for the next. Yet, to date, few school districts have been able to create such pathways of learning for individual students with disabilities.<P>
That's why we at the Education Development Center (EDC), with funding from the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs are currently working on the Pathways for Learning Project. Our goal is to develop, demonstrate, evaluate, and disseminate successful organizational strategies that,with the effective use of technology, improve learning outcomes for students with disabilities in regular classrooms. Key to making this happen is creating teamsof educators to monitor the progress of each disabled child over his or her entire school career; facilitators to lead the teams; and identification of thekind of technology which would be the most useful in implementing the Pathways approach.<P>
We would like to share with you the preliminary findings from the first year of implementing the Pathways Project in Lawrence, N.Y. which is now entering its second year. The district is a small suburban district that includes seven schools serving approximately 4,000 students where ten percent of the student population receives special education services. <P><HR>

<a name="creating"></a>
<H3> Creating teams</H3>
In order to follow the progress of disabled students throughout their educational career we felt that three teams should be established in the district: one at the classroom level, one at the school level, and one at the district level.  <P>
Teachers from several consecutive grade levels, administrators, and support personnel such as resource room teachers, psychologists, and social workers formed a Pathways Team within each school. The teams met to develop curriculum activities that support the integration of children with disabilities into regular classrooms using a variety of technologies. The idea was that planning for a child in the sixth grade, for instance, would be shared by her current and future teachers, ensuring that successful strategies for targeted students would be carried over from one grade to the next, rather than each teacher having to piece together a new approach at the beginning of the school year.<P>
The Lawrence district chose to build teams across school buildings, as well. During the first year of the project, the team met bi-weekly during school hours.They selected target students, defined the work regarding those students, and explored a variety of technologies and curriculum ideas.  <P><HR>

<a name="training"></A>
<H3> Training the facilitators</H3>Key to having the teams work well was training a facilitator for each team to implement the Pathways approach.  Our initial expectation was that the main role of the facilitator would be to train teachers. We quickly discovered that in factwe needed two facilitators--one for staff development and one to make sure all of the administrative wrinkles could be ironed out. <P>
While the professional development activities were rated as very important and useful by the participants who we surveyed at the end, they also said that the leadership role of the facilitator was just as important. Collaboration across buildings can be a minefield and this facilitator's job was to secure resources,such as funds for purchasing new technology and professional development time for the teachers. That person also brought in consultants, scheduled activities, and conducted an ongoing informal evaluation of the progress as well as arranging for teachers to have computers in their classrooms or take computers home over the summer, scheduled computer lab time, and made recommendations for purchase.  <P>
Because the teachers felt so strongly about the importance of this person to workout organizational details as well as the facilitator to do staff development, we realized that leadership training should be included as an important part oftheir professional development.  <P><HR>
<a name="selecting"></A>
<H3>Selecting and providing the technology</H3>
One of our primary concerns during the first year of this project was to identify the kinds of technology that were most useful for the students. The discussion quickly focused on how to make use of and build on what was already available inthe district and to identify appropriate software.  <P>
The Pathways Team identified several requirements that the software had to meet:<P><UL>
<LI>The software should be suitable for multiple purposes to facilitate its integration into different curriculum areas and differentclassroom situations.
<LI>It should include basic utilities (e.g., spell checkers, text-to-speech capabilities, word prediction) that can help students with different kinds of disabilities to communicate more effectively.
<LI>It should be suitable for a broad range of ages to facilitate itsuse across grade levels.
<LI>It  should be available for multiple hardware platforms to be compatible with the existing equipment in different schools.
</UL><P>
The Pathways Team spent one and half days reviewing specific programs and decided to explore the use of text-to-speech and multimedia composition software.Teachers participated in a workshop learning how to use the software and to plan its integration into their curricula. During this year teachers will use the software with their students in a variety of ways, and evaluate the suitability of these kinds of technology for supporting pathways of learning that we envision.<P><HR>

<a name="planning"></A>
<H3> Planning for the future</H3>
This school year, teachers will begin to explore how the work of the first project year affects students entering their classes this fall.  They will also start using curriculum activities based on text-to-speech and multimedia composition software with their students and document their experiences. Additional Pathways teams will be established, to raise issues of how the work might be expanded district-wide.<P>
 The whole idea of Pathways is to build steps--not just for the students but for the program itself.<P>

<CENTER><H3>Judging the quality of information in an unfiltered medium</H3></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>The Internet and its profusion of information presents new challenges for today's students and teachers. We asked Cornelia Brunner, associate director, and Bill Tally, senior research associate, of the Center for Children and Technology/EDC to talk about some of those challenges, including the need to make students (and teachers) information literate.</EM><P>
<STRONG>BILL TALLY:</STRONG> Cornelia, how would you define information literacy?<P>
<STRONG>CORNELIA BRUNNER:</STRONG>I think being information literate means being able to gauge the value and meaning of information in multiple media from avariety of sources, as well as being able to create and disseminate information using those same media. I know that's quite a mouthful.<P>
<STRONG>BT:</STRONG> What new challenges are facing teachers and kids who have begun using the Internet for teaching and learning?<P>
<STRONG>CB:</STRONG> The greatest challenge has to do with the undigested natureof the information that they're suddenly encountering on the Net. Kids have never before been exposed to information in such variety--not only by subject but inquality. Everyone is worried about pornography on the Net, but I think the pornography issue is just the most public way of talking about this. I personally think misinformation is far more dangerous.<P>
<STRONG>BT:</STRONG>  Why is that?<P>
<STRONG>CB:</STRONG> The kind of pornography that kids who are not hacking around are likely to find is really no worse than what they see on newsstands. It's more difficult than it's generally hyped to be to get access to the kind of pornography that would be frightening to kids. <P>
<STRONG>BT:</STRONG>  What kinds of things on the Internet are you more concerned about?<P>
<STRONG>CB:</STRONG> Information which purports to be relatively neutral writing or reporting that turns out to be dangerously untrue--and there is so much out there.<P>
 <STRONG>BT:</STRONG>  For example, denying the existence of the Holocaust.<P>
<STRONG>CB:</STRONG> Right. Until now, most kids were confronted with real controversies only in carefully managed classroom situations. Teachers have handled controversial issues by presenting two different perspectives--or, at most, two and a half--usually with some way to arrive at an acceptable consensus. But on the Net, students are likely to encounter multiple perspectives--some of them offensive, inimical to consensus. You can have people on the Internet saying things that are truly outrageous and wrong, and using all the tricks of the trade to substantiate them. In denying the Holocaust, for example, they could bring up statistics and show all kinds of "proof." In its form, the piece of writing on the Internet could look and sound similar to other, more legitimate arguments kids have heard before. <P>
<STRONG>BT:</STRONG> When you are dealing with print materials, there is additional material--for example, book jackets, bibliographies, and footnotes--you can examine to tell how reliable a source is. How can teachers and students verify the reliability of information on the Internet?<P>
<STRONG>CB:</STRONG> There are few ways so far. One is to check out the source of the information. If something is from the CIA World Factbook, it is likely to be written in an apparently objective style which hides the fact that there is a very real bias. Kids should be taught to recognize this. <P>
Another way is to check out the links provided by the author(s). Students can gather a lot about authors' predilections by what Internet sites they consider valuable and by what news groups they are part of. To use an extreme example, if a student gets involved in an online discussion about gun control and notices that the bottom of the posting that the author also belongs to alt.rec.guns oral.conspiracy, they'll get a sense of the author's political point of view.Students can always e-mail an author with questions designed to gauge his or her reliability; they can also compare any Internet site with others on similar topics. <P>
But, in general, the conventions that would identify the quality of material on the Internet have not yet been developed. The best indicator so far is the quality of the written texts themselves. If something is well written and makes the kind of sense a good essay does, it is likely to be more reliable, but that can be deceiving. Images are very deceiving as well. Some of the most interesting information has no multimedia glitz at all, while some of the cheapest, most dubious information is heavily illustrated. <P>
<STRONG>BT:</STRONG> Before the Internet, a teacher who wanted a student to dig into a question would send that student to the library. How different is it sending a kid onto the Internet to find out more?<P>
<STRONG>CB:</STRONG> Kids have to learn how to search without a librarian helping them to refine what to look for. A thorough Internet search will always result in too much information, so kids need to develop skills to figure out how to eliminate information--"I don't even have to look at that, that's not useful"--and then to ask, "What's missing?"<P>
Kids often only begin to interpret and understand an assignment as they do the research. Because they don't have an easy set of categories to put the information in, they're can get sidetracked intellectually. At the same time, many kids follow the urge to just get the damned assignment done. If they can find a picture, article, or statement that looks right, they're satisfied. The job of the teacher is really to push them further, to say, "What you've found isgood, but how does it fit with what you know already--and what more do you need to know?"<P>
<STRONG>BT:</STRONG> What other skills do students need for an ever-changing, ephemeral medium like the Internet? <P>
<STRONG>CB:</STRONG> Students need to know how to locate information, how to appraise its value, how to question it, how to download it--and then how to construct it and upload it. They also need an appreciation for electronic epistolary etiquette. There are ways to "flame out" online that, however well-intended, are very destructive because they monopolize the discussion space and turn others off. Some people just get carried away and there are no real clues telling them that it's enough now, everybody has gotten the point! <P>
Students need to learn to write better and more in order to use the Net well. They need more experience reading in general to be able to understand how something strikes an audience. They also need to know when a picture or a soundbite or a movie is really necessary and when it is just an option for those who have the time and the space. Then they have to know what to DO with all that info they can download--what to keep and what to trash, what to back up and what tosend on. <P>
There are some technical skills in here, but they are minor in importance compared to the information literacy stuff.<P>
<STRONG>BT:</STRONG> Specifically how do teachers need to be trained to give kids some of these skills?<P>
<STRONG>CB:</STRONG>Teachers mostly have been trained to help kids move, through explanations, from a place of ignorance and confusion to a place of greater clarity and more knowledge. What they have not necessarily been trained to do is help kids understand why different interpretations make sense for different kinds of people, how people use information to make their own meaning and form their own opinions.<P>
Teachers themselves need to be trained to be information literate. Information is not only going to grow, but it's going to be flexible and it's going to come in forms that we don't yet understand. We have to make sure that teachers learn thesame kind of skills that we keep saying we want students to learn--you know, to become lifelong learners and to think critically.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The authors of this outstanding geometry program, the first software offering from Tenth Planet, clearly thought about how to entice students to learn geometric concepts and enable them to show what they've learned. The result is a product that can be used to teach, remediate, or enhance your curriculum, depending on the needs of your individual students.<P>Each geometry investigation focuses on real-world situations. Students learn how to combine shapes by exploring hopscotch courts and flags around the world. They learn about creating patterns through examining American Indian basket patterns and Japanese fish prints. Narrated on-screen videos on these topics are used to inspire student learning and creativity. After students complete activities on the computer, they save their work in their personal electronic journal, which can be enhanced by their oral or written comments. You will be able to track your students' progress by using a simple built-in management system.<P>The accompanying teacher's guide is filled with creative non-computer activities that will lead your students from exploring a concept to applying it. Blackline masters and activities that link the home to the learning process are also included. What else does this product offer? Beautiful on-screen and page design that facilitates ease of use for both students and teachers.<EM> Tenth Planet Explores Primary Math</EM> is a superbly constructed multimedia curricular program that is well worth Its price.<P>By <STRONG>Hilary Cowan</STRONG>, technology director for the Kanawha County (W.

This program unlocks the mysteries of a patch of ground, allowing visitors to take a very detailed look.<P>Based on Scientific American's Books for Young Readers series, <EM>One Small Square</EM> invites children to explore nature with more than text alone. Every screen offers information and engaging activities and links; users can activate animated video clips, listen to narration, play games, and learn about experiments they can perform in their own backyards. Using an onscreen "camera," kids can capture pictures of what they find. An online journal holds these photographs and provides space to write their personal observations.<P>The program contains detailed investigations of 60 natural environments above and below the soil. It features two modes of exploration. In 3-D Ecosystem, kids examine a 3-D diorama of the backyard, using a zoom tool; they get more detailed information by clicking objects.

This information-rich program consists of several sections. An interactive adventure game re-creates the 1995 bicycle journey of journalist Dan Buettner and his team of  professional assistants. Cyclists pedaled 2,854 miles to 19 sites in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras, searching for clues to explain the collapse of ancient Mayan civilization. Challengers go on an expedition of their own to explore  the ruins of eight famous Mayan archaeological sites. As youngsters travel, experts send messages to guide their mission. The goal is to complete as many assigned tasks as possible before disaster strikes.<P>In other program segments, students visit contemporary Mayan communities to see how the culture of the past is preserved in the present. In the section called Multimedia Resource Tool, there are detailed descriptions of Mayan artifacts and archaeological sites. Additionally there are brief essays on such topics as Mayan math and astronomy, warfare, and connections to other civilizations. Articles may be copied to the Clipboard for use in other applications. <P>The CD employs 1,500 photographs and five movie clips from Buettner's 1995 MayaQuest expedition. A special online option allows students to expand the adventure by downloading game updates (consisting of new  information and tasks) from the Internet (see URL above). The Internet site also provides a wealth of information about the ancient Mayans and contemporary archaeology.<EM> MayaQuest</EM>'s printed teacher's guide includes background information, lesson plans, suggested activities, and student handouts to supplement coursework in social studies and geography, science and technology, and mathematics.<P> By <STRONG>Carol Holzberg, Ph.D.</STRONG>, a computer consultant and computer resource person at the Shutesbury (Mass.)

A  wide selection of stickers is available, including divers, whales, and sharks which can be rotated in up to eight directions for a convincing 3-D appearance. They also respond to their position on screen--they can appear to be submerged underwater and can change in size to give the illusion of depth.<P>The stickers can also be easily animated by dragging (using path animation). Kids can "rewind" animated sequences and drag other shapes to create multiple animations on the same page. Students can record  sounds--or employ music and sound effects provided on the CD-ROM--to add atmosphere to the stories. Finished books can be saved, edited, and printed.<P>A nice feature of the program is its integrated "Ocean Factbook," an electronic resource with reference information about ocean life.

At each location, they look for hidden audio/visual surprises and complete several engaging activities that build reading and spelling skills. A printed Franklin storybook is included as well.<P>Even children too young to read can get involved, as each scene they visit becomes a gateway to many more activities. For example, if kids follow Franklin to his house, they can click on the door to go inside;  once indoors, they can explore different rooms--the living room, kitchen, and his bedroom. Throughout their journey, the cursor changes shape as it pauses over a "hot spot." Children quickly learn that if the cursor  becomes a star, clicking the mouse brings up an amusing animation. When  the cursor turns into a letter, a click prompts Franklin to ask them to create a word starting with that letter, giving them a choice of four different endings.<P>All scenes feature an animated bookworm. When kids click on this character, they jump to an illustration to build a sentence using the words they've just learned--what a great way for PreK children to start learning to read. Completed sentences may be printed, each with a blackline picture ready for coloring. Kids can then create their own  books about Franklin.<P>By <STRONG>Carol Holzberg, Ph.D.</STRONG>, a computer consultant and computer resource person at the Shutesbury (Mass.)

<EM>Pip and Zena's Science Voyage</EM>, another "home run" from Tom Snyder Productions, uses the power of a wonderful story to transport young children into the world of science.<P>
Students set sail with Pip and her grandfather aboard his fishing boat, the Zena. Pip's grandfather is a master of real-world science. He navigates by the stars, reads the clouds, watches the ocean currents and tides. Twelve "video offshoots" are the basis for in-depth lessons on tide pools, whales, the operation of a drawbridge, navigational instruments, cloud formations, and more. Each lesson includes three to six minutes of video; a related classroom activity; strategies for integrating math, social studies, and language arts; and ideas for related activities at home and online. Each child gets his or her own Captain's Log filled with motivating activities.<P>
Along with Pip, students learn about the sun, moon, and stars; day and night; seasons; tides; and other basic science concepts. Even more importantly, they come to understand what science is and how it relates to their everyday lives. They learn to ask questions, explore, and make careful observations--then compare, discuss, and chronicle their discoveries. In short, students learn to be scientists.<P>
This delightful story with its charming art presents science in context, and also models wonderfully how much kids have to learn from their elders.<P>

Everybody likes a good story. In <EM>How the Leopard Got His Spots</EM>, children get to hear and see one of the very best. This multimedia storybook, adapted from one of the tales in Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, introduces beginning readers to Kipling and to the people and wildlife of Africa. Narrated by actor Danny Glover, richly illustrated, and featuring an a cappella sound track by the South African vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, this story invites children to discover why African plains animals look the way they do and why people must sometimes change to survive.<BR>
The story follows the adventures of a boy and a straw-colored leopard in search of food. Kids can listen to the tale read aloud or they can page through the book on their own--exploring the illustrations to discover surprises; clicking on words to hear them pronounced; or double-clicking for pop-up definitions, video clips, hidden pictures, and animations.<P>
This CD-ROM book is divided into 15 chapters; four story pages also lead to entertaining games. There's no better way to stimulate reading interest or to prepare younger students for a unit on African culture or the scientific principles of adaptation and camouflage.<P>

True to its constructivist ideals, LCSI has created another microworld  to encourage exploration, creativity, and problem solving. <EM>My Make Believe Castle</EM> is perhaps the company's most magical yet.<P>
Any child intrigued by toy soldiers or dollhouses will delight in this play world and its cast of characters, including a dragon, a princess, a witch, and a band of knights. Children play with characters much the way  they play with manipulatives. They can place them in one of seven engaging castle locales, including a dungeon, an enchanted forest, a lady's chamber, and a courtyard. When they click the green light, characters move across the screen--but the real fun begins when children do their own choreography with an action icon that makes characters shrink and grow, spin out of control, speed up or slow down, do somersaults, speak, and even change moods. Other tools allow children to draw a path for a character to follow, record their own dialogue, or transform characters altogether. Because animation is in real time, feedback is immediate and motivation is high.<P>
<EM>My Make Believe Castle</EM> includes a variety of other creative activities. For example, children design their own family crest, experiment with a catapult, play songs on a harp, and navigate a maze. This engaging play world is sure to spark imagination, inspire creativity, and challenge young problem solvers.<P>

Imagine a tool that lets you create an endless supply of colorful math manipulatives and even provides an inviting environment to explore with them. Broderbund's <EM>Tabletop Jr.</EM> does just that. This easy-to-use tool allows students to create and arrange collections of on-screen objects including party hats, pizzas, friendly aliens, and a variety of numbered data objects. Students select one of 14 "construction kits" and then define attributes like hair and eyes--or let the computer randomly generate these traits. Children drag these objects around the screen as they devise their own systems for organizing data or use any of the program's six sorting "plots."<P>
Within each plot, students can engage in a range of sorting activities, from "Stack Up" (arranging objects in columns) to "Link Up" (joining similar objects in a chain). A comprehensive guide includes class projects and project ideas and over 50 Challenge Cards for small group activities.<P>
<EM>Tabletop Jr.</EM> introduces important concepts that help younger children make sense of data. It's a fitting counterpart to <EM>Tabletop Sr.</EM>, a more powerful and flexible tool available for older students.<P>

<EM>Vital Links</EM> is a graphically rich, project-based multimedia history of the United States. Each of six historical segments includes five CD-ROMs, a videodisc, a videotape, an audiocassette of period songs, and 30 student copies of a newspaper called the Chronicle. Generous teacher resources include a complete teacher's guide, a training guide, an overview guide, and  a toll-free technical support help line. A World Wide Web support site is currently under construction.<P>
<EM>Vital Links</EM> was jointly developed by Davidson, the Los Angeles County Office of Education, Florida Department of Education, and the Texas Education Agency. The program enriches the American history curriculum from pre-colonization to the present by offering various interrelated reference materials. Each suggested student multimedia research projects is amply supplemented with support materials that encompass all learning styles. My students' favorite and most often-used part of the program was the material on CD-ROM, including all the productivity tools (write, paint, presentation, and analysis) they needed to produce multimedia reports. In addition, we found that resources like the video clips of historical events and the Chronicle newspaper accounts added up to a research experience students would never forget.<P>

One of the many advantages of using technology to teach science is that it helps students visualize the wonders of both microscopic and visible worlds. Holt, Rinehart and Winston's <EM>Concepts of  Biology</EM> provides access to these worlds through a vast range of fascinating video segments, illustrations, diagrams, photographs, and concept maps. Students and teachers alike will welcome these
visual aids that help in conceptualizing difficult scientific abstractions. <P>
The organizational structure of the courseware is unusually flexible.  Resources from four major areas of biology are cross-referenced so that teachers can emphasize one or more approaches to the study of the field. The table of contents is beautifully designed to simplify access to specific material. Teachers can
also customize each unit to fit their own approach. The complete text and resources of <EM>Concepts of Biology</EM>are contained on four CD-ROMs. Readable teacher, user, and media guides accompany the software. Four videodiscs, synchronized with the software, contain the same still media but differ in their
video presentations. Most teachers will value these for whole-class viewing and discussion.<P>
<EM>Concepts of Biology</EM> has much to offer biology teachers, but I believe the publisher needs to reconsider the price, which will be out of reach for many teachers who could use this courseware effectively. An MS-DOS/Windows version of the courseware would also be welcomed by high schools not equipped with Macintosh computers.<P>

Future Vision's <EM>Explorers of the New World</EM> vividly re-creates history in a marvelous multimedia portrayal of the Age of Exploration. Students travel back to the 15th and 16th centuries to join the expeditions of Columbus, Cortes, and Magellan. They meet these famous explorers in dramatized video re-creations and
learn about their exploits through voiced narrations, brief articles, maps, and interactive learning games. 
The program's data base contains biographies of 60 additional travelers to the New World. Students access this data base to read about explorers, examine maps, and view digitized portraits. An interactive time line places people and events in historical context. A section called "Impact" shows how items brought back
from the New World (tobacco, corn, hammocks, chocolate, potatoes, and so on) affect our lives today. It also shows the impact of European culture, technology, and diseases on New World native populations.<P>
Photo-realistic images, colorful 3-D graphics, music, animation (occasionally quite humorous), and sound effects enhance information delivery. Students explore lifelike historical scenes, clicking on people and objects for more information. Sometimes a narrator explains the historical significance of a student's
selection. Special interactive presentations reinforce concepts that are taught. For example, students may be asked to help Columbus calculate map distance (in degrees) from Europe to Asia, or experience how sailors navigated during Columbus's time by using instruments and maps. Data base articles and maps can be printed. While articles are not very detailed, they serve as a good starting point for further research. <P>

If you are serious about learning electronics, <EM>The Electronics Workbench</EM> is for you. This software, from Interactive Image Technologies, does an excellent job of helping students build and test hundreds of circuits.<P>
Assembling circuits in this program is very easy. Students choose each component from an on-screen parts bin and drag it onto the main window. Connecting components is as simple as running a line between them with the mouse. By turning the power on, a student can quickly see a faulty or complete circuit.<P>
<EM>The Electronics Workbench</EM> is packed with features and choices.  Several hundred items are located in the parts bin. A multitude of options are available, including 9 sources for power, 7 linear components, 5 switches, 16 nonlinear components, and more. The menu of on-screen instruments include a multimeter, a voltmeter, an oscilloscope, a word generator, and other virtual devices for student engineers. Double-clicking a component or instrument allows students to set the unit's value or range.<P>
In this latest version (4.0), students can do mixed-mode simulations, meaning that they can mix digital and analog circuits together. <EM>The Electronics Workbench</EM> offers students and teachers a reasonably priced, comprehensive, and easy-to-use tool for exploring the world of electronics. <P>

With ConnectSoft's <EM>KidMail Connection</EM> and a modem, it's easy to introduce young children to the world of electronic mail. The program is designed so you can set up a KidMailer account for each child who will use the program, selecting which commercial online service youngsters connect. Currently, KidMail supports Prodigy, MCI Mail, and CompuServe, plus three network services: Microsoft Mail MAPI, NetWare MHS, and Lotus cc:Mail/Notes. Kids can also leave electronic messages for friends who are using the program on the same PC without having to transmit over a network. <P>
The program also lets you create an address book for each user--and since a KidMailer can only send e-mail to people and places listed in their address books, adults can guard against unsuitable correspondents. In addition, you control the number of messages sent because every message requires a "stamp"--and you determine how often a child's stamp allowance is replenished.<P>
A friendly, animated KidBox character provides spoken instructions on every screen. When youngsters check for mail on a commercial e-mail service configured for their account, the program dials the number, logs on, downloads new mail messages, then logs off, automatically returning kids to the KidMail Communication Center to view or print messages and write replies.  The program's colorful screens, animations, boisterous sound effects, and simple instructions make sending e-mail messages as easy as point and click.<P>

<EM>Job City</EM> is a multimedia program that teaches students about the skills and technologies associated with 12 different occupations. This comprehensive package includes a videodisc, computer software, student worksheets, and hands-on materials. The program draws students into a mystery game, and information on various careers is presented within that context. Students work in teams to solve the
theft of a statue from a city park. Two cartoon characters, Carlos and Luan, guide students by pointing out clues. The software accesses a videodisc that contains footage related to the mystery, as well as movie clips about different occupations and the role of technology. Students can use a map to go to different locations in the city, drag objects into a backpack to use as clues, and learn about various occupations. In addition, students can access an online glossary and an interactive career library. Information may be printed.<P>
A large binder containing a manual and supporting material provides teachers with excellent suggestions for integrating the activities into many curriculum areas. Student activity sheets provide problem-solving activities related to each occupation. A realia kit, included with the package, contains hands-on materials to support activitiesÑfor example, convex and concave lenses are provided to help students study topics relating to optometry. Overall,  Job City provides a unique and complete resource for introducing students to a range of occupations. <P>

If you've ever had to get rid of a Windows application and its related files, you know what a pain it can be. MicroHelp's <EM>Uninstaller 3</EM> lets you easily clear out those software cobwebs--such as drivers associated with older programs--when your PC is now running either Windows 3.1 or the new Windows 95. 
<P>
<EM>Uninstaller 3</EM> creates a data file called "Smart Links," which keeps track of all the programs (and files related to these programs) in your computer. When you update or upgrade a program, it rids your system of the older data and connected files. It eliminates all the associated drivers, help files, special
fonts, and attached files that can cause conflict or clog your system. The result is that Windows will run faster, and you'll have far more space free on your hard drive. <P>
<EM>Uninstaller 3</EM> also lets you archive (compress) seldom-used files to save space--if you need the file, just clicking on its icon will uncompress it and make it available. Further, this program will allow you to move programs from one subdirectory to another; you can move whole groups of files from one place to
another, and it alerts Windows as to their place in the system. <P>
While it may not have an exciting name, <EM>Uninstaller 3</EM> can free up enough space on your computer so you can do new (and possibly exciting) things. <P>

<EM>Jack's House Special Edition</EM> from Kids Count Entertainment is a big playhouse designed for learning. Children are invited into Jack's bedroom, his sister's room, and front yard to play with letters and numbers; learn U.S. and world geography; grow vegetables; and more.  <EM>Jack's House</EM> also features several imaginative open-ended activities, inviting children to experiment with primary colors, paint faces, draw, and decorate a dollhouse room.<P>
The program is designed for kids to explore pretty much on their own. There are no voiced instructions. To investigate, users simply point and click at on-screen objects. A selected item may offer audio-visual reinforcement or it may lead to a learning game. For example, if youngsters click on Jack's globe, they jump to a world map that they must fill with continents. For each correct answer, they see and hear the name of the selected continent. The program's interactive map of the United States is first-rate. Like the globe game, kids drag a state's outline to its place on a U.S. map. When all states are placed, they can click a particular
state to see and hear its name and capital city.  <P>
Nonreaders may find some of the activities a bit difficult. For example, the alphabet game expects players to match a picture of an object with the first letter in the object's name (if they see a picture of a whale, they should click the W). After completing this activity, if they are using the CD-ROM version, they can print the alphabet--but if they wait too long, the print option disappears.<P>
Overall, <EM>Jack's House</EM> is a warm and friendly place to visit. It offers an amazing number of things to do, and it teaches early learning skills in an engaging, nonthreatening way.<P>

<EM>The Multimedia Bird Book</EM> helps students identify different species of birds by taking on the role of a photojournalist. Everly Glades, an animated character, invites students to take pictures of specific birds for his new magazine. Their task is to listen to clues and birdcalls, and then choose from among a variety of habitats--all represented by colorful, clickable graphics--to find each assigned bird.<P>
As animated birds fly into the habitat, students must select and photograph the right birds. When they have successfully photographed a chosen bird, the program gives more detailed information about it. Maps display typical locations for the bird for different seasons, and students can also hear birdcalls and songs. A full-screen, digitized photograph of each bird is available, as well as a short video clip. Written information about each bird appears in magazine format, and includes information about the bird's habitat, marks that aid in identification, voice characteristics, and preferred food. Students can choose to have this article read to them.<P> 
When all the photographs are completed, students can read the entire issue of Everly Glades' magazine to learn more interesting bird facts and try their hands at a jigsaw puzzle. There are many issues of the  magazine to complete, and over 60 birds available to be photographed. The emphasis of the program is  clearly on fun and exploration. Teachers looking for a comprehensive scientific field guide will not find it here, but young children can enjoy learning about different species of birds. <P>

"Welcome! If you've never visited before, let me show you around," says the hostess who welcomes you into the entrance doors of Grafica's <EM> A House Divided: The Lincoln-Douglas Debates.</EM>
<P>
A tour through the house that the program inhabits reveals treasures in every room. The library contains the texts of the famous debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas and extensive resource materials, in addition to lesson plans for teachers who want to integrate the program into their classrooms. The parlor offers games and music, with selections ranging from spirituals to instrumentals of the time. The gallery is filled with political cartoons. Viewers can also access a time line and narrated photo essays

The tour reaches its peak in the sitting room, where students can watch and listen to a reenactment of the debates, thanks to the magic of QuickTime and video footage from C-SPAN. Even reluctant history students will enjoy this fascinating tour and will leave with a far greater understanding of the debates. <P>

Why are those lawn mowers exploding? And what's that blob on the beach? Young scientists and aspiring detectives will eagerly solve these and the other humorous mysteries in the new CD-ROM version of <EM>Science Sleuths,</EM> the award-winning program from Videodiscovery offered originally on videodisc. Each mystery introduces important science concepts and asks students to follow the scientific method as they research, perform tests and calculations, and present evidence.<P>
Although the mysteries are the same as in the original, there are now six levels of difficulty, each with a different solution and requiring the use of different resources. The CD-ROM version has many other enhancements, notably an expanded collection of resources. These include newspaper and magazine articles, video clips, animated  movies, charts and graphs, maps, an encyclopedia, and a "sleuth" database for keyword searches. The program also includes a calculator and an impressive collection of scientific tools - thermometer, scale, Bunsen burner, microscope, Geiger counter, gas chromatograph, mass spectrometer, and others. Students learn the function and operation of the tools and use them to collect data to solve mysteries. A notebook automatically records resources used and lets students enter test results and personal notes.  <P>
A comprehensive and entertaining multimedia tutorial introduces program use and the problem-solving process and help text guides students through each step. The new version of <EM>Science Sleuths</EM> ships on two separate CD's, each with two mysteries.<P>

<EM>Bioethics Forums</EM> is designed to get high school science students out of their textbooks and into the arena of today's scientific controversies. This engaging videodisc provides the settings and necessary resources to explore tough ethical issues arising from genetic research and biomedical technology. The societal ramifications of fetal alcohol syndrome and genetic disease screening are two of the 12 forums designed for class discussion and analysis. <P>
Each forum consists of a series of fictitious video clips which identify the issue through the eyes of a wide range of stakeholders in the dilemma. A variety of written resources for whole-class viewing are included with each forum. A teacher's manual provides  discussion points and focused questions for each clip. <P>
The purpose of <EM>Bioethics Forums</EM> is to involve students in making rational decisions which take into account the many facts, opinions, and values inherent in  complex issues. This program will serve them well.  <P>

With school operating budgets as tight as they are, it's nice to know that this latest edition of <EM>ClarisWorks</EM> is worth every penny. Like its predecessors, Version 4.0 combines word processing, outlining, spreadsheet, charting, database, graphics, communications, and presentation functions into one user-friendly application. Instead of spending hundreds of dollars for stand-alone applications that may not work in sync, you pay less than $100 for a tightly integrated bundle.<P>
The new <EM>ClarisWorks</EM> (CW) 4.0 offers over 100 enhancements and features. For example, the word processing module now allows users to divide a single document into single parts, with separate headers, footers, margins, each with its own unique format. CW 4.0 also introduces style sheets, with several predefined formats to stylize text appearance. You can call up the floating ExpressStyle palette within any module, and apply a variety of predefined styles. <P>
ReadyArt libraries containing more than 500 pieces of clip art, grouped thematically by categories. You can keep a clip art library on screen as you work, then drag a desired image to your document whenever you need it. Additionally, productivity enhancements added to ClarisWorks 4.0 include three automated "Assistants," offering step-by-step guidance for creating mailing labels, designing a certificate, and analyzing payment schedules. <P>
Ready for the Web? With the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) translator built into <EM>ClarisWorks</EM> 4.0 you can save a regular ClarisWorks document in a format compatible for display on the World Wide Web (WWW). You don't have to know cryptic HTML tags and codes to produce a Web page--just use the program's word processor, which includes special HTML style sheets that make it easy to apply formatting codes. "Shortcut" buttons available in CW's "WWW HTML" document stationery help outfit a page with hypertext links or horizontal rules. The CW HTML translator will convert pages downloaded from the WWW into a format that CW can edit. However, to translate PICT graphics into a Web-compatible format such as GIF or JPEG, you need a graphics converter not supplied with the program. <P>
<EM>ClarisWorks</EM> 4.0 delivers quality performance at a price any school can afford. Two optional activity-based guides, <EM>ClarisWorks</EM> for Teachers, and
<EM>ClarisWorks</EM> in the Classroom, help make this versatile product even more
useful by suggesting projects to manage conventional classroom tasks and extend the curriculum.<P>

<EM>How Animals Move</EM> is an innovative program which uses animation and actual footage of animals to demonstrate the principles of animal locomotion. The program features over 250 video segments of animal movement and over a dozen simulation activities which allow students to control animal animations. <P>
The program makes excellent use of digital video to explain important concepts. For example, you can compare the wing movement of a bird and a bat by running simultaneous QuickTime movies on screen. Many movies are set to loop automatically, allowing students to observe movement patterns. In addition to the videos, the program features beautifully rendered 3-D animations so that students can compare and contrast the patterns.  <P>
An index of topics allows you to search for specific animals or concepts by media category (movie, picture). Each screen has a page number, making it easy to go back to review topics or map a particular sequence. Bookmarks can also be used to mark areas of interest.<P>
Although most of the program contains excellent content that can be appreciated by older elementary and middle school students, it occasionally presents more advanced scientific vocabulary and concepts. A teacher would need to preview the segments on the CD-ROM to determine appropriate content for his or her students. <EM>How Animals Move</EM> is an excellent model of how CD-ROM technology can be used to present scientific information that would be difficult to show in traditional books.<P>

<EM>Around the World in 80 Days</EM> is an enchanting interactive tale filled with beautiful graphics, the object of which is to teach geography, reading, and vocabulary. As the animated story unfolds, the user is asked to choose one of the program's "Paintbox Pals" to help out the main characters, Phineas Fogg and his pet monkey Sidney. The  pals include an eraser, a paintbrush, a pencil, and a spray can, each with their own personality. <P>
Phineas has challenged Baron Henry Hogsbreath to a race around the world. Each country they venture to brings them new challenges, even as they experience the local culture. <P>
Students learn basic map skills as they journey from country to country. An on-screen book of "fun facts" can be clicked to learn more about the different countries. Dialog  between characters is displayed on the screen for the user to read or the text can be spoken. Red words within the text can be clicked on for a definition. For pre-readers, all text can be read aloud by a computerized voice, or it can be turned off for older students to read for themselves.  <P>
<EM>Around the World in 80 Days</EM> features graphics that are truly beautiful with vibrant colors, fine details and smooth animation. It will provide young children with many hours of interactive learning. <P>

<P>
<EM>Kids on Site</EM> allows young children to become part of an interactive movie where they drive and control construction vehicles. The program does a good job of simulating the movements of each machine, making kids feel like they're really in control.<P>
 The program features full-motion interactive video which plays smoothly, but is somewhat grainy. Each machine is introduced by a female construction worker. Two other characters, Dizzy and Nuts, guide you through tasks using the machine. Students can make each machine move to the right or left, or perform an action. Keyboard controls can be used instead of the mouse. <P>
Each machine has a specific challenge. For example, the excavator must fill a dump truck with three loads of dirt. Merit badges are awarded for successfully completing each task. Although students are given specific tasks to do, the program "rewards" bad choices with funny mishaps. Many of the video sequences are often wild and wacky. For example, in one sequence, the construction workers dress up in cheerleading outfits and cheer the user on. The program runs in 256 colors (unfortunately, the user must switch to this  manually). <P>
Although some teachers may be concerned with having their children use the machines to "destroy" things on screen, children will love running the machines and the program's humorous sequences. While this program is probably more appropriate as a home entertainment title, educators may find it useful for teaching sequencing or learning how  to follow specific directions. <P>

<EM>Foo Castle </EM>is a delightful program for young children to explore with little supervision. By simply clicking the mouse, children can move throughout the castle and explore the many activity rooms located inside. The castle's structure is all shown in  perspective, so students can easily visualize the rooms and hallways.  <P>
The downstairs level contains rooms where children can learn about telling time, practice their numbers and the alphabet, recognize shapes and colors, build jigsaw puzzles, and complete four different mix and match activities in the game room. These mix and match activities encourage students to create human faces from a choice of whimsical facial  parts, create funny animals and beasts from a variety of silly animal sections, and move furniture and decorate four rooms of a doll house. The upstairs level contains several eerie rooms containing harmless ghosts, spiders, bats, and skeletons. And of course, a castle would not be complete without a fire-breathing dragon. This one likes to make  toast with his flames! A "crazy room" is also located upstairs where a variety of surprises await young explorers. <P>
Children will learn necessary pre-school skills as they have fun with <EM>Foo Castle.</EM> The jigsaw puzzles and shape-recognition activities will challenge school age children as well. <P>

I have just finished looking at World Discovery Deluxe published by Great Wave  Software. I am looking at it on CD-ROM for Mac and Windows. It is a wonderful  program.

Twinkling objects in the scene invite them to click to hear interesting tidbits of history and culture.<P>
A journal is available for students to record their thoughts as they travel, while a "camera" lets them take snapshots of items of interest.  These "photographs" are automatically placed in the journal for students to
write about. A compass lets students keep track of their direction as they navigate; a map is provided to show their exact location. On-screen help is available by clicking on an icon of Aladdin's lamp.<P>
The most valuable on-board component is the program's media player. Once students choose a topic, a multimedia presentation is played on screen, displayed in either a small window or full screen. Color photographs and videos depict historical items, including temples and artifacts. The program contains thousands of photos; the full-screen viewing option makes it an ideal classroom teaching tool. Text can be copied to the clipboard for pasting into other applications (and all text can be read aloud). Five logic games are also included.<P>

Microsoft's <EM>500 Nations: Stories of the North American Indian Experience </EM>provides a rich portrait of American Indian culture and history. Based on a television documentary of the same name, this CD-ROM features over 2,000 images and many video segments designed to let users immerse themselves in North
American Indian life.<P>
 The program enables students to examine an immense amount of material in a number of ways. With the help of a timeline, they can look at American Indian life from an historical perspective. The "Homelands" section features a U.S. map locating specific tribes, which helps students see how Native Americans are
represented in every region of the country. Another section, entitled "Pathfinders," discusses the history of Indian culture. It includes a beautiful computer-generated tour of a Mayan city. A Native American storytelling feature relates the emotionally wrenching saga of the destruction of many tribes.<P>
The menu choices allow access to an index of topics, options for adjusting sound, and a help system. One of the program's nicest features is a cross-reference system with hot links to related topics. There is a limited
selection of pictures available in a picture gallery, which can easily be copied and pasted into other applications. Overall, this CD-ROM provides a stimulating source of material for the study of North American Indians.<P>

Star gazing takes on new meaning with <EM>Astronomica,</EM> an amazing multimedia learning adventure from Hyper-Quest. This program consists of three modules. First, there's a full-reference "Encyclopedia" containing information on dozens of space-related topics. Alphabetically organized articles may be searched by title or keyword, copied to the clipboard or printed. Second, there's "Amazing Facts," a fast-paced
question-and-answer game. Challengers play alone or with a friend at three levels of difficulty, scoring points for each multiple-choice question answered correctly before time runs out. <P>
"Astronomica," the final activity, is a super-charged astronomy adventure game with over two dozen brain-teasing puzzles. In this section, a renegade supercomputer named Astronomica sends players on a series of quests inside a high-tech astronomy museum. Exhibits in this SkyQuest Exploratorium feature scientifically accurate astronomy puzzles and pictures of newsworthy events in outer space. Visitors are encouraged to tackle quest challenges in order to rescue Dr. Mayer, the missing director of the SkyQuest AstroLab. Kids exercise a variety of skills during their <EM>Astronomica</EM> adventures. For example, "Planetary Pinball" requires that they use math to send different ball-sized planets into orbit, while "Deep Space" has them identifying objects in space to avoid spaceship damage. Other games ask them to pinpoint constellations, create an eclipse, or pilot a spaceship back to Earth without getting lost. The puzzle contents change with each new game. The program is rich in humor, 3D graphics, orchestrated music, and sound effects, and uses these elements to stimulate interest in the wonders of outer space.<P>

If your students are mesmerized by the Saturday morning cartoons, why not encourage them to create their own animations? With <EM>Big Top's Cartoon Toolbox </EM>they can set the scene with an engaging background, and then choose one of six popular cartoon characters including Felix the Cat, The Professor, and Poindexter. For each character they select an appropriate animation from dozens of options-- such as Felix running, laughing, climbing, diving, or flying on a magic carpet. Next, students add any of over 200 props, many of which are already animated. They can also create their own animations by selecting and
dragging objects. Special effects make things bounce, bang, splat, or disappear in a cloud of smoke. Finally, the extensive library of tunes and sound effects provides the makings for an entertaining soundtrack. With the embedded Cartoon Player, students can show their productions without the original application--a real plus for sharing with parents.<P>
<EM>Cartoon Toolbox </EM>runs very slowly with the minimal configuration and is limited by the inability to add text or record narration, so you may want to extend the experience by having students write about their cartoon or copy it to videotape and record a narration. Despite these shortcomings, the program is a powerful tool that will delight young animators. <P>

The magic of Sesame Street lives--this time as a delightful CD-ROM program from Creative Wonders (formerly EA*Kids). <EM>Sesame Street: Letters </EM>will be a welcome addition to early childhood classrooms. The program reinforces basic literacy ideas by presenting children with a wide choice of
visual, oral, and manipulative experiences, much in the manner of the television show itself.<P>
<EM>Letters</EM> is a natural for an independent learning center in the classroom. If children can control a mouse, they can explore the program's hidden wonders on their own. In cooperative groups, they can walk down Sesame Street and watch video clips, sing songs, play games, and manipulate the many buttons that
produce literacy surprises.<P>
The strength of<EM>Sesame Street: Letters</EM> lies in its ability to go beyond the simple replay of the television series. Unlike the original show, children can control the pace and duration of learning on each concept. Young children need lots of repetition and a wide latitude of learning experiences. Letters offers
these qualities, along with a star-studded cast that includes Big Bird, Ernie, Bert, Oscar, Snuffy, and Telly. Young children have a lot to learn from Letters-if they can keep the adults from blocking their view.<P>

It's 1897, and your students are off to strike it rich in the Klondike with MECC's <EM>Yukon Trail</EM>. Before leaving Seattle, they "talk" with a variety of colorful characters, including actual historical figures, who offer conflicting advice and valuable background information. Students then select a partner, outfit themselves, and board a ship for the Yukon towns of Dyea or Skagway. From there, they travel overland to Lake Bennett, where they build a boat to run the rapids down to Dawson City. <P>
Throughout the long and treacherous journey, students deal with injuries, blizzards, crowded trails, damaged boats, and thieves. Along the way, they talk with dozens of people, including author Jack London and  Skookum Jim, the prospector who was the first to strike gold there. All the characters seem to come alive thanks to excellent graphics and digitized speech. When students finally reach Dawson City, a few strike it rich, some earn enough to get back home, and others lose everything. The program automatically keeps a journal of events that students can add to, edit, and print. Adventurers young and old are sure to love this engrossing new simulation from the creators of the <EM>Oregon</EM> and <EM>Amazon Trails.</EM> More importantly, they'll walk away with an impressive knowledge of the Alaskan Gold Rush.<P>

</CENTER>
 <P>  
This past summer I had the great fortune of working with a bunch of kids at a computer camp. One of the best projects that we did was using <EM>Oregon Trail</EM>, the latest disk version. <P>
The kids completed the simulation and had the usual great time, but what happened next was really a unique learning experience for them. They were able to save the log of their trip to a text file. Then they opened it in <EM>ClarisWorks. </EM>I told them to choose two forts on the trail and find the log description from one to the other. <P>
For each day of this part of the trip they did a creative writing activity about what happened. The text was only about 50-75 words for each day. The days were divided using the "page break" option. They then went back and added a graphic, hand-drawn using the paint module or imported from the clip art files. Once they were finished they used the <EM>ClarisWorks </EM>"slide show" option under the View menu. Parents came in and loved the final day presentation and the kids really learned a lot-not only about the 1850s on the trail but about organization, research, and becoming the computer "driver," not just a passenger. <P>
I have <EM>Oregon Trail II</EM> and it has some terrific graphics and other options, but I think that I will stick with this version and the options that it provides-expecially when you have a limited number of CD drives.<P>

Besides being loaded with text, theCD-ROMcontains more than 150 animations and videos plus hours of audio. You can easily copy text and pictures in order to paste them into other applications; they can also be printed. An online tour provides a general overview of the program's features. Searching for information is very intuitive and flexible. For example,you can search by subject, by using an index, or by browsing through the gallery of media. Teachers can also filter searches by removing certain books from the search. The program easily switches among the different reference books. The quality of the images is very good, and I found the maps in the program to be of higher quality than ones found in other CD-ROM reference collections. For example, state maps featured realistic shading to represent elevation. A 260-page book, "How to Write Term Papers and Reports," and a "QuickStart Guide" are included with the package.

An adventure-laden multimedia journey into the world of animals, it is packed with more than 120 full motion videos, brilliant photographs, and outstanding narratives. The program has interactive tours of areas such as "Storybook Theater" where animal tales come to life; "The Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species," in which the user learns of scientific efforts to help save species from extinction; and a vast "Media Library" that is jampacked with videos, over 1400 pictures, and thousands of pages of text. There is also a "Kid's Corner" of animal projects for the youngest users and an "A to Z Gallery" with animal representations for all 26 letters.

In <STRONG>Counting on Frank</STRONG>, kids are introduced to Henry -- a shades-sporting hipdude -- and his faithful sidekick, Frank the dog, who accompanies Henry through all his adventures. The storyline provides opportunities for students to tackle all kinds of math problems. For instance, Henry enters a Jelly Bean Counting Contest at Sherman's General Store; if he guesses the correct number of beans in the jar,he wins a trip to Hawaii. Players help Henry by solving word problems and math equations at three levels of difficulty. The program also features four brain-teasing math games offering practice with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and shapes. In order to get through the adventure, Henry and Frank must gather at least eight clues. Henry earns a clue whenever he solves a math problem, but he must explore the town, and rooms in his house, to locate each problem. Kids can solve at least three different math problems at every location to earn additional clues. An optional "hint"button leads youngsters in the right math solution direction and a pop-up calculator assists them with computations. The program is based on a popular children's book of the same title, written by Rod Clements. Counting on Frank is a program kids will enjoy playing time and again.<P> <STRONG>-- Carol S.

<STRONG>Grammar Games</STRONG> does the nearly impossible: it makes learning and applying the correct usage of grammar a lot of fun for students. The program is divided into four main activities. "Hidden Wonders" presents text about the rain forests; students must read and correct the verb usage. As the changes are made, hidden jungle animals appear on the screen.  In "Falling Fruit," students read a sentence and decide upon the correct punctuation. The mouse is used to position a toucan under the correct punctuation mark located on a piece of fruit falling from the trees (if they choose the wrong punctuation, the fruit splats on the toucan's head). Students choose between plural and possessive nouns to complete a sentence in "Jungle Gizmo," while in "Rain Forest Rescue" they must decide if a sentence is a fragment or complete. Correct answers provide fuel for a helicopter that flies over the endangered jungle to rescue animals and put out fires. Students' progress is monitored throughout the activities. Records of each activity chosen, the level of difficulty, and the number of points received may be viewed or printed. Grammar Games includes an extensive help section with explanations and examples of a wide variety of grammar uses. <P> <STRONG>-- LarryPogue</STRONG>, education director, SOITA Learning Center, Franklin, Ohio.<P><HR>

<H3>At Your Service</H3>
Assistive screen devices are products that help people with disabilities access and interact with information on their computer. These assistive technologies range from simple text-enlargement programs that make words appear bigger on-screen to devices that give people with only the ability to move their heads--or breathe--the power to write letters, go online, and run the latest software.<P><HR>

<A NAME="motion"></A>
<H3>Range of Motion</H3>
HeadMouse is at the higher end of the screen-device spectrum; there are less-expensive switch interfaces, such as RJ Cooper's Switch Adaptive Mouse device (or SAM, $120). A SAM device lets the disabled interface with mouse functions using the switch best fitted to their abilities (for example, a "puff" switch). Typically, the user's teacher or physical therapist recommends a switch to fit his or her capabilities. For low-vision or blind 
users, Henter-Joyce, Inc., has developed Job Access with Speech, a Windows-compatible program ($795) that browses the screen, reading it aloud; it requires a speech synthesizer to work ($300 to $1,200). Dan Clark of Henter-Joyce says that 25 to 33 percent of the products sold are used by children. Other special-needs/kid-friendly devices include TouchWindow by Edmark (Redmond, Wash.), a $335 device that slips over the computer monitor.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="mouse"></A>
<H3>An Extraordinary Mouse</H3>
Some high-flying companies are repurposing their technologies for people with special needs. Aerospace firm Origin Instruments now offers HeadMouse, a radar-based access device ($1,795). A lightweight box sits atop the monitor; it plugs into the modem port (Macintosh or PC). A radar beam from the box targets a small, wafer-thin adhesive "dot" placed on the user's head or eyeglasses; the cursor is then controlled by the user's head movements. Users are able to "click" their mouse in accordance with their abilities--speech activation lets users say "click," while those with more severe disabilities can "click" by breathing into a "puff switch." Origin president Steve Bain told <EM>EL</EM> that about 30 percent of HeadMouse users are K-12 children.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="power"></A>
<H3>Purchase Power</H3>
Thanks to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, each state must provide a free, appropriate education to special-needs kids--with federal financial help. But proposed changes in Medicaid--a significant provider of assistive devices--may mean that state legislators and managed-care programs will have greater discretion over spending. "There's a great concern over whether representatives in state governments are even aware of assistive technologies, or whether they believe it's worthwhile," says Janet Hosmer, editor of Directions, an assistive technology newsletter.<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H2>What's New for Libraries?</H2>
<H3>By Roberta Salvador</H3>

<A NAME="access"></A>
<H3>The Access Place</H3>
Libraries across the country are getting wiredÄputting many of their resources online for patrons to access from both inside and outside the library. According to a recent survey by the Public Library Association, a 
division of the American Library Association, 70 percent of libraries allow remote modem access to their online catalogs. A majority (68 percent) of public libraries provide Internet access for staff while nearly one-quarter (23 percent) grant Net access directly to patrons. Further, 68 percent of libraries let patrons search commercial data bases with the help of a staff member.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="drivers"></A>
<H3>Designated Drivers</H3>
Leading-edge libraries wishing to free staff from having to dig up and change CD-ROMs on patrons' demand are finding a solution in CD networks. McQueen Associates installs mega-networks of up to 150 CD-ROM drives--though vice president Lee Johnson says that school systems usually need no more than 28 (allowing up to eight users to access each disc simultaneously without losing performance). The drives are housed in groups of seven-bay cabinets; a networked configuration of seven drives, software, and integration of existing computers runs about $10,000, says Johnson. Apple's new Library Research Server, which includes a seven-bay Optical Access CD-ROM tower, reference CD-ROMs, and an Apple Workgroup Server that will distribute Mac or Windows software, costs about $8,499.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="dos"></A>
<H3>In the DOS Age</H3>
Back when the advantages of cataloging and tracking titles by PC were first recognized, most school libraries taking the plunge used DOS--and they've stayed with it. McGraw-Hill School Systems' Columbia Library System (installed in 2,700 libraries, 80 percent of which are school sites) is a DOS-based system that maintains computerized online public-access card catalogs. In addition to keeping circulation records, it also dovetails with that company's Student Information Management System, offering a totally integrated student data resource. Auto-Graphics' Impact/ONLINE, a rival library system for DOS and/or Windows, will be installed in 558 Texas K-12 libraries this year; it also catalogs and tracks library data, and handles interlibrary loan requests.<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="stacks"></A>
<H3>Hot Stacks</H3>
A less expensive approach to freeing librarians can be found in CD-ROM "jukebox" disc-changers, such as Pioneer's new DRM-624X quad-speed changer ($475), featuring a six-disc magazine that can be locked to prevent theft. At the upper end of the spectrum, Sony's new CDZ-R360 jukebox contains two double-speed drives, and holds 360 discs ($12,500); it includes a SCSI-2 interface, meaning that it can be controlled from almost any computer.<P><HR><P>

<H3>For More Information</H3>
Pioneer New Media, (800) 444-6784; Sony, (800) 222-7669; Auto-Graphics, Inc., (800) 776-6939; McGraw-Hill School Systems, (800) 663-0544; <A HREF="http://always.apple.com">Apple Computer Inc</A>., (800) 800-APPL.

When 3-year-olds head for the computer, they're often stymied by tiny fingers, immature hand-eye coordination, and not knowing how to read. If you're the grown-up left to clean off the peanut butter and mashed banana gumming up the keyboard, take heart--an array of devices specifically made for the toddler/preschool set is here. These keyboards, mice,and trackballs all have oversized, colorful features designed to invite the pitter-patter of little hands. <P><HR>

 <A NAME="icons"></A>
<H3>Icons vs. Qwerty</H3>
The Comfy Activity Center (see photo, $99) was created by Comfy's staff of child psychologists; the firm also markets a line of software for the very young. Comfy North America president Carrie Lace says that children need a simple, uncluttered user interface--and this keyboard'sbuttons are wide enough for a full-palm press. Instead of letters, the keyboard uses easily recognized icons: suns, moons, candy, and the like. Competitor kidBoard also sells colorful keyboards ($99/Mac, $59/PC), but with the 101-key"qwerty" layout. "Kids will eventually graduate to this [standard] anyway," says kidBoard CEO Dave Dorn.  <P>
<CENTER><img src="../articlegraphics/tech1295comfy.gif"></CENTER><P><HR>

<A NAME="eyes"></A>
<H3>The Eyes Have It</H3>
Lace and Dorn agree that when dealing with the youngest students, eye-appeal is crucial, making bright colors essential. Dorn, whose kidBoard ships with three pre-K games, adds that anothe rvital factor in designing for preschoolers is the technology's ability to respond in a variety of engaging ways. "No matter what key a child hits, something happens--sound, music, animation," says Dorn of his hardware/software package. This multiplicity of responses makes keyboard like these particularly useful for the disabled as well; firms such as RJ Cooper & Assoc., (714) 240-4853, sell similar devices to both markets.<P><HR>

<A NAME="pond"></A>
<H3>Into the Pond</H3>
Lace estimates that there are 20,000 day-care centers (including Head Starts) with computers. Add national franchises such as ComputerTots and the home market, and major companies are bound to take notice. Compaq Computer and Fisher-Price are jointly producing a line of early childhood PC products for release in 1996, while Microsoft recently unveiled EasyBall, a large, colorful trackball bundled with Microsoft's Explorapedia: TheWorld of Nature ($54.95), aimed at ages 2-6. <P><HR>

<CENTER><H2>What's New in Whiteboards?</H2>

<A NAME="evolved"></A>
<H3>Evolved Blackboards</H3>
An electronic whiteboard is a presentation system which captures electronically whatever you write or draw with a marker on a broad, white, standing surface. The lines, images, or words on the board are either sent to an attached printer, or immediately downloaded and displayed on a computer. The more sophisticated models save your scribblings as a file to put onto a network for distribution. <P><HR>

 <A NAME="write"></A>
<H3>The Write Signals</H3>
Several companies manufacture whiteboards, which function in different ways. Microfield Graphics' SoftBoardhas a porcelain-coated steel surface. It uses dry-erase markers with reflective bar-coded sleeves. Lasers scan the board surface 80 times per second,reading the barcode to track the position and color of the marker. SmartTechnologies' Smart Board uses a grid under its touch-sensitive surface; a SmartPen Tray attached to the board is serially connected to a computer. Whenever a colored marker is removed from the pen tray, that particular color will appear on the computer display as the user draws on the board. <P><HR>

 <A NAME="class"></A>
<H3>In Class</H3>
These days, whiteboards are more likely to be found in higher ed than K-12, since they can cost between $2,000 and $4,000per setup. Yet some companies are trying to reach the K-12 market. Microfield is placing its SoftBoards in district offices for use in teacher training to encourage classroom sales. And according to Smart Technologies' Natalie Young, teachers and students in Alberta, Canada, are already using the Smart Board to make and save class presentations. <P><HR>

 <A NAME="replicators"></A>
<H3>The Replicators</H3>
A less complex, less costly whiteboard alternative for schools is a printboard, such as the Panaboard from Panasonic (available for under $900 for schools). After writing or drawing on its surface, the user presses a button, and a built-in scanner captures the image and sends it to an attached black-and-white thermal printer. Inside the printer is a roll of 8-1/2" x 11" thermal paper (similar to faxpaper) on which the image is imprinted. <P> <HR>

<A NAME="world"></A>
<H3>Kids Meet the World</H3> Electronic mail is already fostering communication between students and among classrooms across the country and around the globe. Composing letters to friends has long been a common path into literacy; kids like e-mail because it makes sending a letter easier - and getting a response back faster than regular mail.In addition, electronic messaging lets kids post their thoughts on bulletin boards designed just for them, such as homework help lines or discussion forums,on school BBSs, commercial online services, and beyond. Yet there are surprisingly few e-mail programs specifically designed for kids.<P><HR>

<A NAME="child"></A>
<H3>Child-Friendly Messaging</H3>
The best-known commercial product is <A HREF="http://www.connectsoft.com/products/kidmail.html">KidMail Connection</A> ** (ConnectSoft, $24.95/CD-ROM), which invites youngsters to use e-mail with a friendly graphical icon--"KidBox," the animated mailbox. KidMail also offers three graphical environments called communications centers, including the "Outer Space Message Center," complete with animations and sound effects. All centers let kids send original letters, or any of 50 pre-written messages (for birthdays and the like), as well as receive mail. With KidMail, the host computer must already have Internet access (via services such as <A HREF="http://www.prodigy.com/">Prodigy</A> ** or <A HREF="http://www.earthlink.net/~finances/htmls/emailmci.html">MCI Mail</A>**).<P><HR>

<H3>Coming to a School Near You?</H3>
<EM>Internet in a Box for Kids</EM>, the made-for-youngsters Internet software slated for mid-October release, will offer e-mail through an interface that resembles the cockpit of a jet. It also includes a parent-controlled timer, a mail audit so that teachers/parents can see who's been mailing to their kids and vice versa, and an option to let adults simply disable e-mail if they don't like what they're seeing. (Internet site filters are also included.) To establish a beachhead in the K-12 market, <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe's Internet Division</A> (formerlySPRY) ** will give schools free copies of Internet In a Box for Kids ($49.95 retail) if they write a formal request on school stationery (see address at end).<P><HR>

<H3>Starting Up</H3>
There are a handful of children's desktop programs that promote e-mail and Internet "readiness" without actually sending messages through cyberspace. One is Edmark's popular KidDesk Plus ($34.95/schools), which lets kids compose e-mail to anyone--from classmates to family members--sharing the same computer, the letter appears when the recipient launches his or her own desktop. KidDesk Plus and another children's title, Launch Pad (Berkeley Systems), allow icons of any online service to sit on the desktop, so the child can launch online access from within a familiar surrounding.

While you were getting ready for the winter holidays, two of the most reputable educational software companies in America were devoured by the technology equivalent of K-Mart: in early December, SoftKey bought the Minnesota Education Computer Company (MECC) and The Learning Company.<P>
Kevin O'Leary, president of SoftKey, says he will offer lower-priced software to consumers, but for good software his prices are in fact higher.<P>

<A NAME="titles"></A>
<H3>Of "A" and "B" Titles</H3>
Mr. O'Leary has made it clear that his strategy was based on a low-cost product to consumers. That means a low-cost product line had to be created. In his strategy, CD racks of 10 to 12 titles were planned with the expectation that one of every 12 titles would be an "A" title in terms of units sold; maybe two or three would achieve a "B" ranking; the remaining titles would become fodder for the gremlins who recycle jewel-cases and used CD-ROMs. To achieve the critical mass of titles necessary to test this strategy, Mr. O'Leary boldly stated that he would fund, at $10,000 to $50,000 per, titles that small, mom-and-pop developers were working on but couldn't quite finish. This, combined with a few "A" titles he already had in his back pocket--namely the <EM>Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Calendar</EM> CD-ROM--would be the ticket.<P>
Schools, educators, and parents:  beware!  Creating good, high-quality, effective, technology-based learning products can not be achieved on 10 to 50 thousand dollar R&D budgets. The track record of  high-quality product that both MECC and The Learning Company have historically maintained is in serious jeopardy.<P>
What that simply means is that schools, educators, and parents is that SoftKey will be throwing a lot of low-cost software at them on very thin gross margins--the kind of margins that do not support good things like sound research and development.<P>

<A NAME="bargains"></A>
<H3>High-Priced Bargains</H3>
Mr. O'Leary's response to this is: parents and educators won't mind getting a couple of "B" or "C" products from time to time since they are only paying $20 per product, versus $40 and up. The dirty little secret that Mr. O'Leary does not share with consumers is that under his strategy you end up paying $240 for every "A" title ($20 x 12 titles). For every $240 you spend, you will have the pleasure of knowing that statistically you will get one "A" title, two or three "B" titles, and a bunch of junk. Another way of looking at this is that, if you are satisfied with the "A" and "B" titles, you have spent $60 per satisfactory title, versus $40 and up that you spend today. Think about it.<P>
The equity, brand loyalty, and goodwill created by our friends at MECC and The Learning Company have been placed on a billion-dollar wager. With technology racing ahead at mind-boggling speeds, it may not be long before Mr. O'Leary will face the consequences of his actions. At the end of the day, he and SoftKey may be the richer. Unfortunately schools, educators, and parents will be the poorer due to the increased total spending required to find quality products, should this become industry standard.<P>

<A NAME="swimsuit"></A>
<H3>Teacher Swimsuit Calendar?</H3>
If SoftKey's past success and current trends in the educational technology industry were to merge, we might be able to forecast a few things from SoftKey's future offering of educational titles. Titles like: 
<UL><LI>Teacher-of-the-Year Swimsuit Calendar CD-ROM, or
<LI>Oregon Back Road (we couldn't afford a whole new trail), or
<LI>TV Rabbit (at these prices you are not going to want to read what we had to write).
</UL>
If SoftKey attempts to keep MECC's and The Learning Company's corporate cultures and product strategies intact, I am reminded of something Bill Murray said in Ghostbusters. It went something like this: "It's like cats 
and dogs living together--it just won't work."<P>
In the end, I hope these predictions do not materialize. But if they do, you can say that you heard it here first: 1995 was the year we said good bye to two true friends of education. Fare thee well, our friends at MECC and The Learning Company.  All those who care about children will miss you.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H2>Maxing Out on Multimedia:<BR>
More is less if your newest computer can't run it</H2>
<H4>by Hilary Cowan<BR>
Technology director, Kanawha County (W. Va.) public schools</H4><P>

I have yet to hear the sound of one hand clapping, but I'm getting used to the sound of one computer crashing. And with each crash, my unseemly language gets louder and more colorful. Why, I ask myself, are educational publishers creating multimedia software products that exceed the capabilities of most of our current equipment? Why are software manufacturers putting the onus on teachers to make their programs work?<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Limited means...</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Publishers are well aware that districts and schools are saddled with limited technology budgets -- so limited that few of us have the luxury of allocating money on an annual basis for computer upgrades. Recent visits to other districts have confirmed my belief that if I asked every educator who is still using an Apple IIe or an IBM Model 25 to cheer, the tumult would be deafening. Most districts are doing well if they can come up with the money to give every school a few new machines each year, much less an entire equipment upgrade or exchange.<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Crashes and worse...</STRONG></FONT><BR>
So what am I all hot and bothered about? An increasing number of software programs I have previewed recently are crashing on use. They are accompanied by README files that would mystify a technological guru, much less a classroom teacher who simply wants to turn on the computer and use the software. An example for you MS-DOS users: If something like "CDR102 EMS memory no longer valid" appears on your screen, it will probably be followed by "try removing other items which may be using EMS memory." And for you Macintosh users, if an Error 28 or Error Type 1 occurs,you will probably receive a message saying "use a utility such as the System 7 Extension Manager or INIT Info. to disable some (or all) of your INITS. "These README files often go on for pages, attempting to explain what to do in case of computer failure. Wait a minute -- unless I have a defective computer,  isn't it the software manufacturer's responsibility to make its product work if my machine meets the minimum hardware requirements?<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>What publishers can do...</STRONG></FONT> <BR>
 I am not asking for software publishers to make multimedia products that will work on 64K machines. I am pleading, however, for products that have a fair shot of running on a computer purchased last year, or maybe even last month. Publishers need to understand that more is not better when it forces us to purchase extra RAM or stop using their product. If they are going to sell to the education market, their design teams need to use typical computers instead of souped-up models that breeze through the problems most teachers will encounter. They need to offer us an 800 number for the help we deserve for our money. They need to understand that if they embrace a "buyer beware" philosophy, they may lose us in the long run as we revert to our tried--and--true programs and refuse to venture into their inviting waters.<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Why it matters...</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The sad part of this multimedia mismatch, beside the hit to our wallet, is that some of these programs would be great for students. The design of multimedia products is constantly improving,and the programs' resources are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and morerelevant for learning. Students could learn a lot from them -- if the programs would run. So what can we do as consumers? First, ask around before we buy a product. The Internet, for example, has given us a huge resource bank of teachers who love to let others know what they think. Second, read software packaging carefully. Beware of buying software which lists both minimum and recommended machine requirements, unless you have a computer that meets the higher standard. Third, preview the software before purchasing it, whenever possible. Fourth, complain, complain, complain. If you have problems, let the publisher know. Demand a solution or your money back. DO NOT shove the product into your closet and write it off as a bad buy; we'll never get this problem solved if we continue to be timid. Fifth -- and this runs against the grain of all of us pack rats -- share the school's latest and greatest equipment so that allstudents can benefit from newer programs. If the computers aren't networked, mobile tables are a great investment.<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Parting advice...</STRONG></FONT> <BR>
Don't feel guilty or stupid for not understanding some cryptic message on the screen. Unless you are a software technician, it is not your responsibility to become versed in the intricacies of troubleshooting. Your job is to educate kids, and you shouldn't have to compromise that function by spending hours reading up on computer memory allocations. Let's put the responsibility where it belongs -- with the designers, creators, manufacturers, and sellers of educational software. </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<HEAD><TITLE>Help on Making Queries</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<A NAME="Making Queries"></A><H1>Making Queries</H1>
Excite for Web Servers gives web users access to a sophisticated concept-based
searching engine. But even though the search engine is advanced, users
can form queries without using a complicated query language. This page
will help you to choose the queries that will give you the best
results.
<P>
<A NAME="Query Basics"></A><H2>Query Basics</H2>
A query is simply a description of an information need. Unlike Boolean
systems that search for just those documents containing <I>all</I> the
words in your query, Excite for Web Servers will search for documents that are a
best match for the words in your query. Excite for Web Servers will also search for
documents that are about the same concepts that your query describes,
so sometimes Excite for Web Servers will bring back articles that don't mention
<I>any</I> of the words in your original query.
<P>
What this means is that your query -- the description of your
information need -- can be as detailed as you like. Don't worry about
providing too many words; the more words, the better. Additional words
in your query will help Excite for Web Servers figure out what concepts you're
really interested in. On the other hand, Excite for Web Servers will do a pretty
good job of figuring out what documents are interesting to you even if
your query is vague.
<P>
For example, let's say you're searching a web site for documents about
customer support for the Widget2000 product you're using. A good
starting point would be
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Widget2000
</PRE>

If you have a question about a particular feature of the Widget2000,
for example the Blurfl upgrade package, you might choose a query like
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Blurfl upgrade package
        of the Widget2000
</PRE>

Even if there are no documents that are actually about the Blurfl
upgrade, Excite for Web Servers will still show you documents about Widget2000
customer support.
<P>
<A NAME="Advanced Query Tips"></A><H2>Advanced Query Tips</H2>
Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of
Excite for Web Servers.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Only use words that are relevant to your query</B><DD>
If you're looking for documents about the Widget2000, don't enter a
query like "<CODE>Find me all documents about the Widget2000</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers
considers <I>all</I> the words in your query to be part of your
information need, so queries like the previous example will find all
documents about <I>finding all documents about</I> the Widget2000, which
may not be exactly what you want.
<P>
<DT><B>Specify multiple forms of the same phrases</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers distinguishes between hyphenated and un-hyphenated words. So,
sometimes it might be necessary to explicitly say that you want both
versions, for example "<CODE>CDROM CD-ROM</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers will try to figure
out that <CODE>CDROM</CODE> and <CODE>CD-ROM</CODE> are the same, but it never hurts to
explicitly specify multiple forms.
<P>
<DT><B>Common words are ignored</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers doesn't index common words like <I>a</I>, <I>and</I>, or <I>the</I>.
Consequently, those words in your query will be ignored. Excite for Web Servers also
ignores numbers; however, it can find strings that happen to contain a
number, for example <I>3Com</I>.

<FONT  SIZE=+1 FACE="Arial" FACE="Arial"><STRONG>By Kevin Feldhausen,<BR>
Presentation Creative Lead, Microsoft Presentation Group</STRONG></FONT></CENTER><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Putting together an electronic presentation involves preparation, organization, and planning. It's important to storyboard or outline what you intend to say, so that you have a clear sense of your intended message.</FONT>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="redbar1.gif" WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=9 ALT="graphic line"></CENTER><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2 FACE="Arial" COLOR=RED><STRONG>Planning:</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial">When planning a presentation, allow 2-3 minutes of viewing time per slide, so that everyone in the audience has a chance to appreciate slide contents and the presenter has enough time to get through the materials.</FONT>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="redbar2.gif" WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=9 ALT="graphic line"></CENTER><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2 FACE="Arial" COLOR=RED><STRONG>Fonts:</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Use fonts your audience can easily read. Fonts should enhance the presentation without being the focus. Keep display fonts to a minimum because you want your audience to concentrate on what you're saying. Familiar fonts like </FONT><FONT  FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Times New Roman</STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> (serif) or <STRONG>Arial</STRONG> (sans serif) cause the least distraction. Apply them in large sizes so that people in the back of the room can see the text. Choose contrasting font and screen colors for easier viewing.</FONT>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="redbar3.gif" WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=9 ALT="graphic line"></CENTER><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2 FACE="Arial" COLOR=RED><STRONG>Content:</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Text on each slide should reflect the main points of your presentation. Bulleted items are intended to introduce or summarize key points. They should not recite verbatim what you plan to say. Keep them 4-6 words long.</FONT><P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="bluebar1.gif" WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=9 ALT="graphic line"></CENTER><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2 FACE="Arial" COLOR=RED><STRONG>Audio-Visual Elements:</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Make sure that sounds and video clips are relevant. If you overload the audience with sensory "candy," viewers may not retain the message. Hide sound objects until they play. Keep AVI objects visible, even when they are not playing. If a video object is hidden, it will distract the audience when it pops up on screen to play.</FONT>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bluebar2.gif" WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=9 ALT="graphic line"></CENTER><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2 FACE="Arial" COLOR=RED><STRONG>Transitions:</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Be consistent. Subtle transitions work better. Fancy transitions attract too much attention. Simple transitions like "wipes" or "strips" use less memory than elaborate "cover" transitions, presenting more smoothly on machines with video cards having only 1 Mb of RAM.</FONT>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bluebar3.gif"></CENTER><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2 FACE="Arial" COLOR=RED><STRONG>Builds:</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Don't go overboard! If you build everything your audience will find it difficult to concentrate on what you're saying. When using builds, be consistent in the effect you apply.</FONT>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="greenbar1.gif"></CENTER><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2 FACE="Arial" COLOR=RED><STRONG>Rehearse:</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Once you assemble your slides, rehearse the slide show again and again until you're sure that the presentation will proceed without a hitch. The more comfortable you are with your delivery, the more believable your presentation will be. Practice the presentation on the same machine that you will use for delivery. You'll know what to expect.

  <LI>After school, apply polyurethane to their shapes in a well-ventilated

USING BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS TO TEACH CRAFT</H2>

<P>
Supporting children in honing their writing craft can be daunting because most of us don't feel accomplished ourselves as writers. That's why focusing on beginnings and endings works so well: it's concrete and manageable. The approaches outlined in this cover story are favorites of the teachers I visit, and are easily adapted for students of any age.

<IMG SRC="apple.gif" border=0 WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=82 ALT="Apple Computer, Inc."><P>
<H1>YOU'RE THE BOSS</H1>
Want to jump start your business career? Maybe just earn a little extra money (for that new action/adventure game you've had your eye on)?<BR>
No problem. Your computer's here to help. Watch flyers come flying from your printer. Make enough business cards for every pocket in town. Your computer can help keep track of that new income, too.<P>
<IMG SRC="../ins-graphics/line.gif" border=0 ALT="___________________" ><P>
<IMG SRC="../ins-graphics/bullet.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT>
<STRONG>Say It with Flyers.</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Wow potential customers with flyers that advertise pet-walking, car-cleaning, baby-sitting, or other services. With <EM>ClarisWorks</EM> (Claris Corp.), for example you can choose from many different formats, type styles, and type sizes. A "Paint Documents" feature makes it easy to brush on color. For a really professional look, print your flyers on designer paper. Ask permission to distribute or post flyers at school. Offer them to neighbors and post on community bulletin boards.<P>
No need to re-create the wheel each time you advertise. <EM>ClarisWorks</EM>' database and mail merge features let you produce mailing lists to make your life easier.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="../ins-graphics/bullet.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT>
<STRONG>Your Name Here</STRONG>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Design a business card using a paint and draw program such as <EM>Fine Artist</EM> (Microsoft). Or try the business card template in <EM>ClarisWorks 3.0</EM>. A good place to start is by taking a look at other people's business cards. What information do you need to include on yours? If you're using <EM>ClarisWorks,</EM> you can construct your card in the graphics grid. To add your name, or other information to your card, just click the text tool, click the location where you want to type, then type. Check out the tool panel to add straight lines in any direction, ovals, circles, and more.<P> 
Remember, in a draw document, such as in <EM>ClarisWorks</EM> (Claris Corp.), a block of text is considered an object that you can move and place anywhere you want. You can move it as often as you like--till you get it just right.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG SRC="../ins-graphics/bullet.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT>
<STRONG>Stand-Out Resumes</STRONG>.
<BLOCKQUOTE> Your computer can help you put together a resume that not only tells prospective employers how smart and creative you are, but that actually demonstrates those qualities, too. The word processor feature of multipurpose programs like <EM>Microsoft Works</EM> (Microsoft) and <EM>ClarisWorks</EM> (Claris Corp.) makes it easy to custom-design a resume for each job and company. Be creative! Experiment with the wide variety of type styles (italic, boldface, outline, etc.), fonts (Bookman, Courier, Helvetica, etc.), and the type sizes that the computer puts at your disposal.<P>

Use the program's paint and draw tools to add a splash of color or to create a picture. These programs make it easy for you to position the picture on your resume. You can even change the picture's size and orientation.<P>

Don't forget to edit carefully, including a run through with the spell checker. Ask a friend to take a look, too. Then print up your masterpiece on heavy textured stock for a professional look.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="../ins-graphics/bullet.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT>
<STRONG>Number Crunchers</STRONG>.
<BLOCKQUOTE> Planning on college? Your own apartment? How about a car? Keep track of your own income, develop a savings plan for future expenses, and figure monthly payments over the life of a loan with a spreadsheet program like <EM>The Cruncher</EM> (Davidson). (Hey, parents, a spreadsheet can help with the family budget, too!)<P>

A spreadsheet, which is like having a bookkeeper on your computer, looks like a chart or grid organized in rows (going across) and columns. Each block (or cell) contains a number, equation, or formula. When you add or change information, each related piece of information changes, too.<P>

Spreadsheets are great for other things, too--like tracking statistics of your favorite sports teams, the progress of a fund-raiser, even your grade-point average.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="../ins-graphics/bullet.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT>
<STRONG>Investment Options</STRONG>.
<BLOCKQUOTE> Demonstrate your Wall Street acumen (or lack of it) by advancing yourself some imaginary cash, establishing a "brokerage firm," and selecting a few likely looking stocks from an online service (using a modem--that piece of equipment that lets you send and receive information via a phone line). Follow the progress of your stocks on a daily or weekly basis. Graph price fluctuations, profits, and losses.<P>

Online services can plug you into more than the stock market. With eWorld (Apple Computer, Inc.), for example, you can keep up on the news, "chat" with experts, e-mail (that's short for electronic mail) your pals, listen to a hot band, even get homework help. Connecting with online services is as easy as one, two three: dial up the number of the service, enter your password, then select from the menu that pops up on your computer screen.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Putting Together A Stamp Collecting Kit?</H3>
<IMG SRC="looking.gif" align=left WIDTH=151 HEIGHT=168 ALT="looking at stamps">
<STRONG>Here's what you'll need to become a true stamp collector:</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Stamps -- of course
<LI>Stamp Album -- to mount and store stamps
<LI>Stamp Hinges -- to hold stamps in your album. You can buy them at most hobby stores
<LI>Magnifying Glass -- to better see a stamp's tiny details.
<LI>Stamp Tongs or Tweezers -- for picking up and handling stamps.<BR>
(Even clean fingers can damage stamps with skin acids.)
</UL><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="album.gif" WIDTH=215 HEIGHT=81 ALT="album" align=left>
<STRONG>How Should I organize my stamps?</STRONG><BR>
<OL>
<LI>Organize your stamps--in your album--in different groups, such as countries,	sports, animals, dates, value of the stamps, etc.
<LI>Write down stamp notes (date, title, theme of stamp) underneath each stamp.
</OL><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="envelope.gif" WIDTH=101 HEIGHT=45 ALT="envelope" align=left>
<STRONG>How do I get stamps off envelopes?</STRONG><BR>
The best way to remove stamps from envelopes is to soak them. Here's how:
<OL>
<LI>Tear or cut off the area of the envelope that contains the stamp.
<LI>Float stamp face down in a small dish of lukewarm water. Let stamp stay in water for about 20 minutes (30 minutes for peel-n-stick stamps).	
<LI>Gently lift the stamp out of the water with metal tongs.
<LI>Gently peel the paper from the stamp (not the stamp from the paper) using your fingers. If they don't come easily apart, let them float a bit longer. (A peel and stick stamp will float away from the envelope.)
<LI>To dry, place stamp between paper towels with a book on top.
</OL>
<STRONG>Where can I find stamps?</STRONG><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE> You can collect used stamps from your mail at home. Just ask your parents if you can have their old envelopes. You can also buy new stamps at the post office, hobby shops, or from stamp dealers.<P> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Sticking Together:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> To learn more about stamp collecting or to join a stamp collecting club, visit your local library and post office. Also, contact the Junior Philatelists of America, Central Office, PO Box 850, Boalsburg, PA 16827-0850. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>ON THE WAY HOME</H1>
<STRONG>QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR CHILD ABOUT<BR>
THE MOVIE YOU'VE JUST SEEN</STRONG><P>
<IMG SRC="filmreel.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Film Reel" ALIGN=LEFT>
Does your child really understand the movies he or she watches? Do you wonder how the movies affect your child? Discussing a movie with your son or daughter can be an enlightening experience for both of you. As a parent, you will come to gain a better understanding of how your child thinks and views the world. Your child, on the other hand, will become a more critical thinker and movie-watcher. Kathy Faggella, a noted educator and author who has written extensively on critical thinking and television viewing, provides you with key questions to ask your child after watching a movie, as well as the kinds of responses the questions may elicit. They're sure to help launch an animated discussion.<P><BR>

<STRONG>What was the movie about?</STRONG><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Asking a straight forward question is always a good way to start a discussion, and it helps you to find out whether your child understands a movie's main ideas. Such a question will prompt children to recall details and incidents in sequence, which are two important thinking skills.<P><BR></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<STRONG>Where did the story take place? How do you know that?</STRONG><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Children need to be aware that movies are staged--that props and scenery are used to set a story in a particular time and place. These questions help you determine if your child realizes that, say, a horse and carriage signals the fact that the story is set in the past. When children notice a movie's details, movie-viewing will be a richer experience.<P><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>What was your favorite part? Why did you like that part so much?</STRONG><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Here, you're guiding children to think about how movies affect them,and how movies relate to real life. Most important, you're boosting a child's self-esteem. Anytime you ask children their opinion, you build their confidence tremendously.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>If you were an actor in this movie, what character would you like to be?</STRONG><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Children usually love to think about the character they feel they are most like, or would most like to be. And your child's responses, of course, can give you insights into his or her wishes and concerns.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Would you do just what that character did, or do you think you would have done things differently?</STRONG></B><P> <BLOCKQUOTE>

This question gets kids to think about the plausibility of a character's actions. It's important to invite your child to consider whether a character's action was the right choice--because sometimes moviemakers manipulate a character's choice just to make the movie more exciting. Kids should know that kind of thing goes on. <P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>What did you like about the hero/heroine? What things were important to the hero/heroine? Are those things important to you?</STRONG><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE> In asking these questions, you're getting children to explore the association between a movie character and their own lives. Children become aware of why they like a hero-- because the character made them feel good or because he or she did something that they could do. Movies made for children often communicate values of honesty, loyalty, and so on. So hopefully, your child will respond to your questions with answers like, "Well, she was a good friend to him and believed in him no matter what," conveying to you that your child is picking up on these values. <P><BR> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>What feelings did you have as you watched the movie? When did you feel sad, mad, or scared? What part of the movie made the feeling change?</STRONG><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Can your child identify what he or she is feeling? Does the child realize it's the movie and the story line that is making him or her feel that way? It's important for parents to explore this, because children need to put a name to their feeling--especially younger children who might not know where the feelings are coming from. Asking children questions such as these after seeing a movie helps them identify the source of their emotions.<P><BR> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>What special effects were used to do those scenes?</B><P> <BLOCKQUOTE> This question helps demystify the movie genre so that kids know that it is pretend--that it is all created. Children can be unsettled by even seemingly innocent things in a movie, so it's important to emphasize that some movies are fantasy. If your child is very young, you might ask questions like: How do you think they made that character fly without getting hurt? What pretend things were the characters doing in the movie? A lot of young children want to duplicate what they see, so it's wise to point out what is not real. <P> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>Make Creativity <BR> a Family Affair</H1>
Teachers find that children like to work cooperatively with other students when using the computer. Here are some fun activities that will encourage all members of your family to be a creative team.<P>
<STRONG>Stay in Touch</STRONG><BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALT="Girl making a greeting card." ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=130 HEIGHT=130 SRC="card.gif"> During the holidays, instead of buying mass-produced greeting cards, everyone can pitch in to create a custom-made greeting card on the family computer. First, using a desktop publishing program, create a personal greeting for your card ("Happy New Year from the Smith family!"). Let your child make an illustration on the computer, using a drawing program, to enhance the greeting. When your child has completed his or her illustration, print it out on colored paper using your printer.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><BR>

<STRONG>Spread the News</STRONG><BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALT="Newspaper boy." ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=133 SRC="paperboy.gif"> Is the family down the street having a garage sale? Did the local Little League team do well in the playoffs? Is the neighborhood ballet school having a recital next month?<P>
Why not get the word out in a newsletter? The editorial team (your family) can begin by discussing the kind of articles and news events that should be covered in the newsletter.<P>
Then, have each family member report on an event and write an article. Design the newsletter together on your computer! Then simply make copies on a copying machine, and have one of the kids deliver it to the neighbors.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><BR>

<STRONG>Remember When</STRONG><BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALT="Book of Family Record."ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=131 HEIGHT=132 SRC="scrapbook.gif">
Keep a family scrapbook of essays, poems, notes, and school reports on floppydisks or the hard drive. Over the years, you'll have a great record of what everyone has been up to. Rotate the job of family record keeper (the person who inputs the material into the computer). And why not keep a family journal or personal journals on floppies (or hard drive) as well.<P>
A drawing program will allow family members to add illustrations to their personal journals and give the family scrapbook a professional look.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><BR>

<STRONG>Start a Business</STRONG><BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG BORDER=0 ALT="Girl selling lemonaide" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=132 HEIGHT=132 SRC="lemonade.gif">
Your children can keep track of a business on a computer. Whether it's a lawn-mowing, dog-walking, or baby-sitting service, or simply a lemonade stand, a computer makes a big difference. <P>
Use a drawing program to create logos and signs. Writing software can be used to create ad flyers or letters to send to customers. Your child can even create his or her own business cards. Graphics can be added to enhance the flyers, letters, and cards.<P>
Whatever business a child might wish to start, a home computer and the right software will make any project easier and more fun--not only for the child but for the entire family.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>From "Learning Together," a Chrysler Learning Connection Program</STRONG>
<H1> How to Help Your Child Want to Help You</H1>
<STRONG>"I want to do it."<BR>
"Let me try."<BR>
"When is it my turn?"</STRONG><P>
How many times have we all heard those words? And how many times do we hear ourselves replying, "Next time..." "I'm sorry..." "We just don't have a spare minute today"?<P>
We all know that letting kids help can take more time than simply doing something ourselves. And yet, letting our children help today can give them a chance to earn self-respect, enjoy being responsible, and learn problem-solving skills that will pay off later on.<P>
Here are some ideas to experiment with, as a way of strengthening these important qualities in your child. All you need is a bit of patience, a readiness to laugh--and, yes, just a little extra time.<P>
<STRONG>Let Their Fingers Do the Walking.</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The next time you plan an outing or an errand, try making your child a partner instead of just a passenger. Your seven-year-old might find the phone number of the store or museum and call to ask for its business hours. At the mall, your five-year-old might plot the best route to the shoe store, bank machine, and snack bar, using a mall directory.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Sort It Out.</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Kids love to sort. Put that instinct to work the next time you're doing laundry, emptying the dishwasher, or sorting pennies into 50-cent rolls. Make it a game by adding one nonmatching "mystery sock," or calling your loose change a pirate's secret treasure. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Let's Eat!</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> When eating out at a fast-food restaurant, get your children into the act by asking them to do the ordering. If you're cooking, give your "assistant chef" an apron, ask for his help in planning the menu, and make him Chief of Measuring and Stirring. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>The Official Recycler</STRONG>.
<BLOCKQUOTE> Most kids love to recycle. Why not put yours in charge? And don't stop with newspapers, bottles, and cans. After all, today's paper-towel tube or applesauce jar might live again as tomorrow's bowling pin or pencil holder. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Make Your Next Birthday Party a Learning Adventure!</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> What seven-year-old wouldn't love visiting the local fire station as part of a birthday celebration? In many communities, firefighters welcome such visits and go so far as to provide kid-friendly fire-safety handouts, tours of the big fire trucks, and a chance to try on a genuine firefighter's helmet. Children love it--and learn some lessons about work and safety in the process. Other workplaces that might provide unique "learning-together" settings: local airports, working farms, TV and radio stations (try public stations first), newspaper offices, sports arenas or stadiums, theaters, factories, bottling plants. . . even city hall can be a fascinating place to a child (especially if everyone gets a chance to twirl in the Mayor's swivel chair). Call first, as"open house" policies will vary from community to community. </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<P><CENTER>One hundred years ago, Carlo Collodi wrote <I>Pinocchio: The
Story of a Puppet</I>, the timeless story of a wooden puppet who wants to
become a real boy and the lessons he learns on that journey. Today Pinocchio
continues to entertain and educate. <P>
In the new videocassette <A HREF="../redir/pinhome-pin.html">The Adventures
of Pinocchio</A>, New Line Home Video brings this favorite story to life, entertaining all ages with Collodi's
magical puppet. There are plenty of tough-to-teach lessons to be learned
along the way, too-lessons in honesty, courage, kindness, and friendship.
<P>
Sponsored by New Line Home Video, this 12-page guide is designed to help
you use the story as a teaching tool in your classroom, weaving the story
and its lessons with activities that feature literacy connections for children
in grades K-6. We hope you and your students enjoy these materials. Please

<BLOCKQUOTE>
</H2>
This cross-curricular teaching unit, sponsored by the National Frozen Food
Association and 22 leading frozen food brands, will help your students learn
all about the frozen food industry and the role it plays in their lives.
<P>
<A HREF="repro1.html">Reproducible 1</A> will acquaint children with the
step-by-step process involved in moving frozen food products from &quot;sea
to shelf&quot; or &quot;farm to family.&quot; The related classroom experiments
and activities that follow are designed to help students understand how
and why this method of food preservation works so well.<P>
Most important, as students explore the process, people, and events related
to the frozen food industry, they will better understand how frozen food
revolutionized the way we shop and eat and how these products will continue
to contribute to our nutritional needs now and in the future.

<UL>
  <LI>Clarence Birdseye, inventor of the first freezer, discovered the quick-freezing
method of food preservation when he was ice fishing in Labrador in northern
Canada. He pulled a fish out of the water and it froze almost instantly
in the Arctic air. Later, when Clarence thawed and cooked that same fish,
it tasted &quot;ocean fresh.&quot; <P>
  <LI>Frozen fruits stored at 0 &#176;F can stay fresh for a year or more.
<P>
  <LI>Once harvested, most fruits and vegetables are whisked away to processing
plants located no more then a few miles away from the farm. There, the foods
are prepared and quick-frozen to lock in flavor, color, freshness and vitamins.

COOL FOOD FOR KIDS</B> is comprised of the following cross-curricular designed
to educate students on the history and technology of the industry. Begin

<STRONG>This special section, sponsored by Microsoft, will help your students turn research into reports and presentations they'll be proud to share--complete with maps, sounds, and more.</STRONG></CENTER><HR><P>

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
CHILDREN ARE BORN RESEARCHERS, always asking why. They begin to develop important lifelong research skills at an early age--asking questions of the people around them, picking up facts and explanations in books that others read to them, and then eventually seeking information on their own in available resources.<P>

Libraries are one place your students can search for information: in books, encyclopedias, and periodicals. Now reference tools such as <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/EWA">Microsoft&reg; Encarta&reg; 96 World Atlas</A>, <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/Encarta">Microsoft&reg; Encarta&reg; 96 Encyclopedia</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/Bookshelf">Microsoft&reg; Bookshelf&reg; 1996-97 Edition</A> are opening up a new world of information to children. "These tools are an invitation to explore and be a part of new worlds," says Doris Dillon, a media specialist in the San Jose Unified School District in San Jose, California. "They put multiple sources at children's fingertips, encouraging them to cross-reference and think about what they're seeing, reading, and hearing. As children conduct research, they become detectives, comparing information from different sources and finding out how authors come upon their material."<P>

In the pages that follow, you'll see how students can integrate multiple resources into presentations they'll be proud to share. Building an Olympic Biography is a model you can adapt for written and oral reports on any topic, though with the Summer Olympic Games scheduled for Atlanta in July, it's an opportune time for students to research participating countries and athletes, as well as Olympic history.<P>

<IMG SRC="biography.gif" WIDTH=102 HEIGHT=61 ALT="BUILDING AN OLYMPIC BIOGRAPHY"><BR><P>
Introduce your students to Romania's gymnast Nadia Comaneci--with a mouse click. This history-maker is just one of the Olympic athletes students can research using <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/EWA">Encarta World Atlas</A>, <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/Encarta">Encarta Encyclopedia</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/Bookshelf">Bookshelf</A>. Follow the procedures outlined below to show students how to use <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/Works">Microsoft&reg; Works</A> and <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/MSPowerpoint">Microsoft&reg; PowerPoint&reg;</A> when integrating information and images into compelling written reports and oral presentations. Students can adapt the models, too, substituting other athletes to create their own Olympic biographies--or a report on any other topic.</TD>

<H3>Add a new dimension to the stories you and your students spin. This special section, sponsored by Microsoft, shows you how.</H3></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"There isn't anyone who doesn't love a story," says Virginia Tashjian, a storyteller and anthologist of <EM>Juba This and Juba That</EM> (Little, Brown, 1995), a delightful collection of favorite stories, songs, chants, riddles, and  rhymes.<P>
What makes storytelling such a wonderful experience for all ages? "Storytelling is the most marvelous vehicle for promoting a lifelong love of literature and language," Virginia says. "When you have good and strong and beautiful words to impart information, it enhances children's imaginations and their lives."<P>
Though the voice and word are at the heart of storytelling, explains Virginia, you can enrich this tradition with multimedia. Ask children to draw pictures of what they envision a character in a story looks like and  "as many kids as you have, that's how many different pictures you'll have," Virginia says. "That story will stay with them."  Songs, films, and puppets are other familiar ways to enhance storytelling.<P>
Now multimedia CD-ROMs add a new dimension to story time. Dazzling animations and videos, rich and lively sounds, creative activities, interactive games, and a wealth of information invite children to investigate special interests, adding depth to the story-time experience.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Preparing Students for the Brave New Work World</STRONG>.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="workstation.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=155 HEIGHT=153 ALT="Students at computer staions." 	ALIGN=LEFT>
Today's basic workplace skills are a world apart from yesterday's. Technology has not only changed the face of the workplace, it's changed the level of skills we as teachers need to impart to our students.<P>
There's no need for the purists among us to fret, however. Basic reading and math concepts remain primary in the teaching and learning process. What's changed is how we manage and apply the basics.<P>
At the Tulsa Technology Center's Education Enhancement Center (EEC), we found that technology is the most effective learning tool available to educators who need to prepare students for this brave new world.<P><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG SRC="../ins-graphics/bullet.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT>
<STRONG>First things first</STRONG>.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The EEC quickly harnessed technology to help bring our students up-to-speed, at their own speed.We started with an ILS, networked in a lab of 35 Macintosh computers. Here, students got immediate solutions to academic skill deficiencies in a diversity of subject areas. Interestingly, although our students come from 22 different schools with various technologies in place, we didn't experience any technology "jet lag." Students were able to get right down to the math and reading business at hand.<P>
With improved skill levels, students were ready to learn accessing information skills from various on-line research tools. We use a library of CD-ROM titles to expand the information base available to students and staff on almost every topic from the general romp through a multimedia encyclopedia, to a visit with the Mayo clinic for a scientific study of the human heart. Students using this center learn how to organize materials, search for answers, and devise methods of analysis--much like a real work setting.<P><BR><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="../ins-graphics/bullet.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT>
<STRONG>Vocational tour guide</STRONG>.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are writing our own multimedia recruiting project using a CD-ROM format, so students can tour the multitude of vocational programs that are offered on our different campuses. Some of these programs include drafting, aviation maintenance technology, auto service, marketing, advertising design, and radiological technology. Each vocational cluster area breaks down the particular job opportunities, educational opportunities, prerequisites, requirements, aptitudes and skills needed to be successful in that area. Students can view video and snapshots of other students working in a particular field. This spring, we are piloting the CD-ROM at two high schools, before placing it in the media centers and counseling offices at all of the district's 22 sending schools. Right now, we're exploring options available to us in video-conferencing and telecommunications. Educators involved in the training -- and retraining--of the work force should use all the help technology offers.<P> </BLOCKQUOTE>

Dear Principal and K-3 Teacher:<P>
If you're like most school leaders, you're always searching for ways to encourage parental involvement in student learning.<P>
To help you do that, the Chrysler Corporation is sponsoring a special new educational program for 1996 called Learning Together.<P>
Created by Scholastic Inc., Learning Together is designed to help schools and families help children develop the attitudes, personal qualities, and skills they will need to thrive in the world and workplace of the 21st century.<P>
Beginning in January 1996, teachers in grades K-3 throughout the country will receive sets of Learning Together guides to be sent home with their students. In addition, a special Teacher's Guide accompanies each of the three issues of the Learning Together family guides.<P>
Learning Together culminates on May 3-5, 1996, with National Family Learning Days-- a celebration of the power and impact of family learning. <P>
Learning Together can directly benefit your school community in a number of important ways:
 <UL><LI>Teachers can build learning links with their students' families; showcase the importance of family learning in their classrooms; and enter national competitions to win classroom libraries worth nearly $100 each.<P>
<LI>Parents and caregivers can receive practical, creative suggestions on how to help their children develop positive attitudes towards work and learning, and develop communication and problem-solving skills.<P>
<LI>Students can understand that learning is a daylong, lifetime practice that takes place in school, at home -- and everywhere in between.<P> </UL>
 We hope you will join us in celebrating Learning Together. If you would like more information, contact Ingrid Blinken at 212-505-4927.<P>
Sincerely,<P>
Andy Calkins<BR>
Executive Director<BR>
 Learning Together<BR>

<STRONG>From "Learning Together," a Chrysler Learning Connection Program</STRONG>
<H1>Help Promote Family Learning <BR>With These Teacher-Tested <BR>Ideas</H1>
Want to help parents get more involed in the education of their children? Here are some bright ideas inspired by teachers who participated in a special 1994/95 reading initiative called <EM>Reading Together</EM>, sponsored by the Chrysler Corporation last year:<P>
<STRONG>Reach Out</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Many teachers send class newsletters home with their students. If you do, consider including descriptions of the skills and concepts addressed by your classroom activities. When writing home about your class science fair, for example, make mention (without using jargon) of cooperative learning, journal writing, or research activities that helped to make the fair a learning success. If you don't send home a regular parent letter, the New Year is a great time to start. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Help Parents Learn About Learning</STRONG>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Evening open houses have their place. But this spring, make an effort to bring parents to class so they can witness the learning that takes place on a typical day. Help parents tie that learning to activities they might foster in the home. (For example: "See your child playing with these blocks? She's teaching herself how to sort and classify.") Then provide a list of at-home activities that strengthen similar skills and concepts. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Send Learning Together Activities Home</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Make a classroom"family learning pack" by tucking a variety of suggested family activities and manipulatives into a child-size backpack or canvas tote. Try including books, puzzles, games, activity sheets, and a parent/child response sheet. Enlist parents' help in building a library of backpacks for families to borrow.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Try Triangle Conferences</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Once a year, instead of holding traditional parent-teacher conferences, why not plan some three-way sessions that include (at least for a portion of the meeting) parent, teacher, and child? You can reflect together on the student's learning progress and challenges while exploring the responsibilities you each need to help the child reach new learning goals in the future. The child will learn that he or she is respected as a responsible "partner" in the learning rocess.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Building Bridges to the Workplace</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE> For many young children, the workplace is a pretty remote concept; it's simply the place where Mom and/or Dad seem to spend a lot of time away from home. But children can benefit from knowing more about how, where, and why people work. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Help your students gain this perspective by trying the following activities:</STRONG>
<UL> <LI>Prepare a simple job description form for parents to complete and send back to class. Encourage parents to snap pictures of themselves on the job. Place the profiles and photos together in a photo album. 
<LI>Send a note home asking parents to notify you if the class may visit their workplace. Then enlist students' help in planning a series of field trips to those work locations willing to host a visit.
<LI>Invite parents and other family membersto visit your class and talk about their jobs and the skills they need in the workplace. Have students prepare interview questions so they can learn more about the responsibilities associated with each job.</UL>

"Restaurant menus are terrific for language arts. They're full of tasty adjectives and adverbs. I also use the menus for math activities. Students can total up items ordered, add tax, calculate tips, and give change. Empty food packages such as cereal boxes are also a good thing to collect. Students can read and compare the nutritional information on the boxes." <BR>
<EM>Carol Harris, second-grade teacher, Temple Beth Am Day School, Miami, Florida</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Make the most of discarded phone books. </STRONG><BR>
"I use phone books when my class studies medieval times. We learn about how people's last names represented their trades. I have my class look through the phone books to find names that indicate what profession a person's ancestors may have practiced. I also use the phone books for math: I ask students to add five different phone numbers together, then circle those five and five others. Another student then has to figure out which of the five phone numbers the first student selected." <BR>
<EM>Kathy Lane, sixth-grade teacher, Anderson Elementary School, Reno, Nevada</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Use travel brochures.</STRONG><BR>
"I bring travel brochures into the classroom for math skills. There's information on them that can be used for graphing. The maps and  geographic information are also great for social studies activities." <BR>
<EM>Wendy Waldman, third-grade teacher, Solomon Schechter Day School, Marlboro, New Jersey</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Start a collection of user's manuals.</STRONG><BR>
"Technical reading and writing are important skills for the future that we should begin teaching today. I make sure to keep on hand software guides, equipment instructions, even the manual for a VCR, all for kids to read." <BR>
<EM>Martine Wayman, sixth-grade teacher, Kenmore Elementary School, Bothell, Washington</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Bring in clothing catalogs. </STRONG><BR>
"I tell students to imagine they have $100,000 to spend. They then have  to go through the catalogs and 'buy' things. Each time they select an item they have to add 10 percent sales tax to it. Students have to keep a running total and subtract from $100,000 until their total is less than $1." <BR>
<EM>Kathy Lane</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Create a recipe book.</STRONG><BR>
"Students bring in recipes and I assign a 'chef of the day' once a week to prepare one of the recipes. Throughout the year we collect the recipes in a book." <BR>
<EM>Carol Harris</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Use the newspaper.</STRONG><BR>
"Our local newspaper has an education department. Four times a year they produce a teacher and student guide that goes along with the newspaper for 20 cents a student. It helps to laminate the articles you want to  keep." <BR>
<EM>Diane Iglehart, third-grade teacher, Foerster Elementary School, Houston, Texas</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Bind student-created work.</STRONG><BR>
"I keep the poems that students write throughout the years in a bound book in the classroom library. Before I begin my poetry unit I have students look through some of the previous students' poetry. I also make copies and bind some of the older grade's student books. My students  love to read through them."<BR>
<EM>Carol Harris</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Attend teacher's night at your local museum.</STRONG><BR>
"Check with all the museums in your area to see if they offer an open-house  night for  teacher's. If so, they usually give away all sorts of handouts and teaching materials." <BR>
<EM>Diane Iglehart</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Contact your state or  local historical society.</STRONG><BR>
"The historical society can put you in touch with people who can supply you with folktales and legends from your state." <BR>
<EM>Harold Tuttle, fifth/sixth-grade teacher, Lafayette Regional School, Franconia, New Hampshire</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Check out your district warehouse.</STRONG><BR>
"Some school districts have storehouses of old textbooks where you can hunt through the materials. One good find is old basal readers. I choose what I want--like the beautiful storybook sections--and take them apart." <BR>
<EM>Carol Harris</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Call the information department of your state government.</STRONG><BR>
"My state government offers wonderful curriculum guides and brochures for free or cheap. I got curriculum guides for Project Wild from the Department of Natural Resources for $12." <BR>
<EM>Charlotte Stone, teacher, Crabapple Middle School, Roswell, Georgia</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Encourage student hand-me-downs.</STRONG><BR>
"I always ask my students to donate their favorite book to the classroom library at the end of the year. I've even had students come back the next year and ask if their book is still there." <BR>
<EM>Nancy Palastrant, fourth-grade teacher, Snapper Elementary School, Miami, Florida</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Use the school of education library at your local university.</STRONG><BR>
"Many of the materials in the education school library can be checked out or duplicated. The resources here really help me to expand my classroom library." <BR>
<EM>Bill Palmer, fourth/fifth-grade teacher, Columbia Elementary School, Bellingham, Washington</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Print out and bind on-line information.</STRONG><BR>
"I belong to a telecommunications network. With each on-line project, I download all the information into a file, and then print out each entry. Everything is then three-hole punched and put into a binder. My 'books' are all displayed in the room until the end of the year. I then send  them to the district office to have them bound into book form. Now I  have the makings of an inexpensive, comprehensive library."<BR>
<EM>Jane Coffey, computer teacher, Dutcher Elementary, Turlock, California</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Gather freebies from book fairs.</STRONG><BR>
"I'm always getting notices about book fairs. I try to attend them because I usually come away with a lot of free materials. If a company wants you to buy a product, they'll offer you something for free." <BR>
<EM>Karen Lupka, second-grade teacher, P.S. 199, Brooklyn, New York</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Create your own books on tape.</STRONG><BR>
"When I taught first grade, I enlisted parent volunteers to work with their children at home to record books on cassette tapes. Instructions, a blank cassette, a copy of the book, and a rhythm instrument to use as  a page-turning signal all went into a self-sealing bag. In addition, parents were given a simple generic script to use as the introduction. The parent read the book and the child usually was in charge of making the page-turning signal. We displayed all of the newly recorded books and tapes right in the plastic bags in our listening center. Children  were thrilled to share their parents as they read favorite books aloud to our class. Older students may enjoy recording books to share with younger children." <BR>
<EM>Wendy Buchberg, fourthgrade teacher, South Hill Elementary, Ithaca, New York</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Never pass up a garage sale.</STRONG><BR>
"I always look through the books at garage sales. A lot of times I pick up something I can use in my classroom for just 25 cents. It's especially fun when you come across an old reader." <BR>
<EM>Diane Iglehart</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Shop at used bookstores.</STRONG><BR>
"I teach a lot through art. I buy used Time/Life books and magazines for kids. Many of these books are above their reading level, but students can use them for reference."<BR>
<EM>William Weinreb, fifth-grade teacher, Haight Elementary School, Alameda, California</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Ask for a teacher discount.</STRONG><BR>
"Anywhere I go, I let people know that I'm a teacher. Many stores, especially at bookstores, offer special deals for teachers. I can't tell you how many discounts I've gotten over the years." <BR>

<STRONG>ACTIVITY STARTER: </STRONG>Have students create plays to demonstrate conflict-resolution and problem-solving strategies.
<A NAME="music"></A>
<H3>MAKING MUSIC</H3>
Voyager<BR>

Mac/Win CD-ROM<BR>
<STRONG>TARGET GRADES:</STRONG> K-6 and beyond<BR>
<STRONG>CURRICULUM FOCUS:</STRONG> Music<BR>
<STRONG>WHAT YOUR STUDENTS CAN DO WITH IT:</STRONG> Students play with music much like   they play with crayons.  They can create rhythms and melodies with a  variety of instrumentation,  "paint" music in a composition area, and  play games that reinforce auditory skills.<BR>
<STRONG>SPECIAL FEATURES:</STRONG> A very playful tool for exploring music without getting formal--everyone from age three to adult who looked at it was hooked! <BR>
<STRONG>TROUBLE-SHOOTING:</STRONG> Has no teacher-support materials. You might want to   spend some time with the program before introducing it to students.<BR>
<STRONG>ACTIVITY STARTER:</STRONG> Students can create music and then have classmates  illustrate how the music makes them feel or the images it brings to mind.
<A NAME="mayaquest"></A>
<H3>MAYAQUEST </H3>
MECC<BR> 
(800) 685-MECC<BR>Mac/Win disk, CD-ROM<BR> 
<STRONG>TARGET GRADES:</STRONG> 3-8<BR> 
<STRONG>CURRICULUM FOCUS:</STRONG> Social Studies<BR>

Teacher manual includes lesson plans, classroom management strategies, and black-line masters.<BR>
<STRONG>SPECIAL FEATURES:</STRONG> Allows for free exploration of geometry. Teachers can customize the product to meet student needs. Brilliant on-screen graphics are beautiful when printed in color. Supports many NCTM  standards for math.<BR>
<STRONG>TROUBLE-SHOOTING: </STRONG>If you're working with younger students, you may want    to customize the program to block the 3-D objects.<BR>
<STRONG>ACTIVITY STARTER: </STRONG>Have kids create puzzles for others to complete using  shapes and a "blackout" tool that looks like a flashlight.
<A NAME="timeshift"></A>
<H3>TIMESHIFT RADIO</H3>
Tom Snyder Productions<BR>
(800) 342-0236<BR>
Mac/Win CD-ROM, Audio CD<BR>
<STRONG>TARGET GRADES:</STRONG> 5 and up<BR>
<STRONG>CURRICULUM FOCUS:</STRONG> Science, History<BR>
<STRONG>WHAT YOUR STUDENTS CAN DO WITH IT:</STRONG> Combines the audio drama of old-time radio with hands-on experiments to help students learn about the history of electricity and telecommunication, and the excitement of being a scientist.  One CD plays on any CD player; the other, for your computer,  is an interactive teaching guide that manages the experience.<BR> 
<STRONG>SPECIAL FEATURES:</STRONG> Approaches science content from a "story behind the  facts" approach. Students listen, think, share, and research while being enchanted with the passion behind scientific advancement. Made for the one-computer classroom. Requires audio CD capabilities.<BR>

<STRONG>CURRICULUM FOCUS:</STRONG> Math, Problem-Solving<BR>
<STRONG>WHAT YOUR STUDENTS CAN DO WITH IT:</STRONG> This cartoonlike program invites   students to work with coordinates on a grid, manipulate geometric shapes, practice deductive reasoning, build and sequence patterns, and more. Younger children can enjoy many of the activities, while logic   games challenge older students with multiple-step problem-solving. <BR>
<STRONG>SPECIAL FEATURES: </STRONG>A fun approach to the noncomputational strands in math. Printouts let students continue some of the fun off the computer.  (See Activity Starter.) <BR>
<STRONG>TROUBLE-SHOOTING:</STRONG> Teachers may need to help students make the  connections between the computer's games and paper-and-pencil tasks. Requires 8MB RAM.<BR>
<STRONG>ACTIVITY STARTER:</STRONG> Students can create their own activities off the  computer--such as a coordinate map to play hide-and-seek with--that mimic the on-screen activities.
<A NAME="quick"></A>
<H2>QUICK SOFTWARE SUGGESTIONS</H2>
Here are a few more terrific new programs to consider:
<H3>PETER RABBIT'S MATH GARDEN </H3>
Mindscape<BR>
(415) 897-9900<BR>
Mac/MPC CD-ROM<BR>
<STRONG>TARGET GRADES:</STRONG> PreK-2<BR>
If you enjoy the soft, watercolor-like art of the original Peter Rabbit books by Beatrix Potter, you will love the look and feel of this software. With the help of a talking bird that guides them through each activity so even non-readers can play, children help Peter hide from Mr. McGregor in a matching game, count bugs in Mrs. Tittlemouse's house, and more. The skills covered in this gentle product include sorting, classifying, matching, counting, beginning addition and subtraction, and number recognition. Each activity has three levels of difficulty so the program can grow with your students.
<H3>A TO ZAP!</H3> 
Sunburst<BR>
(800) 338-3457<BR>
Mac/Windows CD-ROM<BR>
<STRONG>TARGET GRADES:</STRONG> PreK-2<BR>
Children interact with colorful alphabet blocks as they explore letters and their names. Activities are connected to each letter, providing lots of replayability. Teachers can adapt portions of the product to make it appropriate for their students. My three-year-old loved it and said "I can do this one real good." My six-year-old suggested, "I can make up other games to go with some of the letters," and he did!  
<H3>READ, WRITE & TYPE!</H3> 
The Learning Company<BR>
(800) 852-2255<BR>
Windows CD-ROM<BR>
<STRONG>TARGET GRADES:</STRONG> 1-3<BR>
Read, Write & Type! is a combination of phonics, beginning writing, and keyboarding instruction. The cartoonish characters are motivating for this age group (though teachers may tire of them). This product is  sound-driven instead of letter-driven, supporting mastery of phonics; beginning writers will love its simple word processor and simulated e-mail. To make the most of the keyboarding part, you'll need to watch kids at work--after all, the computer doesn't know which finger is striking each key!
<H3>STUDENT WRITING AND RESEARCH CENTER </H3>
The Learning Company<BR>
(800) 852-2255<BR>
Windows CD-ROM (requires 8MB RAM<BR>
<STRONG>TARGET GRADES:</STRONG> 5 and up<BR>
This product builds on Student Writing Center by combining a word processor and page publisher with Compton's Concise Encyclopedia. Now students have immediate access to thousands of pictures, many videos,  and audio clips. Imagine what this year's reports will be like!
<H3>AFRICA TRAIL</H3> 
MECC<BR>
(800) 685-MECC<BR>
Macintosh/Windows CD-ROM, diskettes<BR>
<STRONG>TARGET GRADES:</STRONG> 5 and up<BR>
As a longtime user of MECC's other "trail" software (Oregon Trail, Yukon Trail, Amazon Trail), I can happily report that this newest addition is an equally motivating teaching and learning tool. Based on an actual  bicycle expedition throughout Africa, this program helps students discover more about the land and its people. If you have seen Oregon Trail II CD from MECC, you will recognize the rich photos and the "pack, make decisions, and trek" format of this game. What's new here is the multimedia resource tool, which allows students to access hundreds of  photos, video clips, and other resources to use in multimedia reports and presentations. 
<H3>WITH OPEN EYES</H3>
Voyager<BR>
(800) 446-2001<BR>
Macintosh/Windows CD-ROM (requires 8MB RAM<BR>
<STRONG>TARGET GRADES:</STRONG> K-adult<BR>
Full screen shots of more than 200 works of art from The Art Institute of Chicago are displayed with a variety of tools for further investigation. There is a narrative for each, a map of the country of origin, and a virtual gallery to help set a sense of scale. Close-ups reveal details, and games and puzzles engage viewers even more deeply. View artwork randomly, by time period, or by country of origin.

<H2>How To Choose The Best Multicultural Books</H2>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

In this article you'll find leads to 50 great books, plus advice from top educators, writers, and illustrators on how to spot literature that transcends stereotypes.<P>

How do you know if a children's book you're about to share with your students accurately portrays the culture of its characters? Are there warning signs to look for? Are there telltale things that mark an outstanding multicultural book? To answer these questions, <EM>Instructor</EM> invited <A HREF="#contributors">five children's literature specialists</A> to give us their candid advice on selecting books about or related to <A HREF="#native">Native Americans</A>, <A HREF="#latino">Latinos</A>, <A HREF="#africanamerican">African-Americans</A>, <A HREF="#jewish">Jews</A>, and <A HREF="#asian">Asian-Americans</A>. We'd also like to <A HREF="#turn">hear about your experiences</A> with multi-cultural literature.<P>

<A NAME="native"></A>
<H2>Native Americans: Let Our Words Be Heard</H2>
<EM>Native American stories passed from mouth to ear to heart</EM><BR>
<STRONG>By <A HREF="#contributors">Peggy K. Ford</A></STRONG><P>

For centuries, Native Americans relied upon oral storytelling for entertainment and to keep alive information needed for survival and moral direction. Today, more Native Americans are preserving these legends, myths, and folktales in written form. Writers like <A HREF="#bruchac">Joseph Bruchac</A>, Shonto Begay, and Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve bring new life to ancient tribal stories and depict past and present Native American life with accuracy and grace.<P>

<STRONG>10 GREAT CHILDREN'S BOOKS</STRONG><BR>
<EM>Gluskabe and the Four Wishes</EM> retold  by <A HREF="#bruchac">Joseph Bruchac</A>, illustrated by Christine Nyburg Shrader (Cobblehill, 1995). In this tale of the Wabanaki nations, four men each ask for a different wish from Gluskabe, the Great Spirit's helper, but only one learns that great gifts come to those who listen and take heed.<P>

<EM>Ma'ii and Cousin Horned Toad</EM> by Shonto Begay (Scholastic, 1992). Cousin Horned Toad gives tricky Ma'ii the coyote a lesson to remember when Ma'ii tries to get something for nothing in this Navajo tale.<P>

<EM>In a Circle Long Ago: A Treasury of Native Lore</EM> from North America by Nancy Van Laan, illustrated by Lisa Desimini (Apple Soup Books, 1995). This is an impressive collection of Native American tales, songs, and poetry from the Arctic North to the Florida Everglades.<P>

<EM>Fire Race: A Karuk Coyote Tale About How Fire Came to the People</EM>, retold by Jonathan London, illustrated by Sylvia Long (Chronicle Books, 1993). How Coyote--with the help of Eagle, Cougar, Fox, Bear, Measuring Worm, Turtle, and Frog--captures fire is a dramatic tale of bravery and cooperation.<P>

<EM>Beyond the Ridge</EM> by Paul Goble (Bradbury, 1989). With beauty and simplicity, Goble captures the spiritual journey of a Plains Indian grandmother.<P>

<EM>Katie Henio: Navajo Sheepherder</EM> by Peggy Thomson, photographs by Paul Conklin (Cobblehill, 1995). In this nonfiction book, you'll follow Katie as she moves between her traditional Navajo world and the modern world of her great-grandchildren.<P>

<EM>Fox Song </EM>by <A HREF="#bruchac">Joseph Bruchac</A>, illustrated by Paul Morin (Philomel, 1993). In this story, young Jamie learns that death is a natural part of life when she realizes that her grandmother, even in death, is still near her.<P>

<EM>The White Deer and Other Stories Told by the Lenape</EM>, edited by John Bierhorst (Morrow, 1995). Open your students' hearts and minds with these 25 stories from the Lenape, or Delaware, culture.<P>

<EM>The Nez Perce: A First Americans Book</EM> by Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve, illustrated by Ronald Himler (Holiday House, 1994). The author retells the creation myth of the Nez Perce Indians, who lived in what are now the states of Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and Montana.<P>

<EM>Indian Winter</EM> by Russell Freeman, illustrated by Karl Bodmer (Holiday House, 1992). In 1833, German Prince Alexander Philipp Maximilian and Karl Bodmer, a Swiss painter, journeyed up the Missouri River and spent the winter among the Mandan Indians. Russell Freeman draws upon the prince's diary and Bodmer's detailed paintings to create an incredible account of their adventure.<P>

<EM>Peboan and Seegwun</EM> retold and illustrated by Charles Larry (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1993). Glorious illustrations enhance this Ojibwa story portraying the transition from winter to spring.<P>

<EM>Shadow Catcher: The Life and Work of Edward S. Curtis</EM> by Laurie Lawlor (Walker, 1994). This biography for older readers is filled with Curtis's majestic photographs of North American Indians.<P>

<A NAME="bruchac"></A>
<H3>MEET JOSEPH BRUCHAC</H3>
<STRONG>Q: </STRONG> What do you suggest teachers look for when selecting Native American literature?<BR>
<STRONG>A: </STRONG> Seek out books that depict characters from a well-defined individual native nation-as opposed to generic Indians. I say this because there are popular books that were written without understanding these specific differences. For example, in <EM>Annie and the Old One</EM> by Miska Miles--which is a story of a little girl dealing with the death of her grandmother--descriptions and illustrations are totally incorrect for the Navajo culture. And no one in any Native American culture would call his or her grandmother "old one." Books like this are insensitive due to ignorance, not through intention--but it hurts just as much.<P>

<H3>KEEP IN MIND</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Make available books that reveal today's Native American cultures.
<LI>Be prepared to talk about the ways in which Native American cultures have influenced world culture.
<LI>Talk about values Native American cultures share, such as respect, sharing, and reverence for living things.
<LI>Avoid books that suffer from what <A HREF="#bruchac">Joseph Bruchac</A> refers to as "The Dances with Wolves Syndrome"--books in which all Indians are noble and all white people are bad. Any children's book that builds up one culture at the expense of another ultimately keeps racial tension alive.

<A NAME="latino"></A>
<H2>Latinos: A Fiesta of Stories</H2>
<EM>Books that portray the history, customs, and family traditions of Latinos</EM><BR>
<STRONG>By <A HREF="#contributors">Gonzalo Ramirez</A></STRONG><P>

Growing up in a Spanish-speaking community in Texas, I remember reading stories such as Hans Reys's <EM>Curious George</EM>, E. B. White's <EM>Charlotte's Web</EM>, and Madeleine L'Engle's <EM>A Wrinkle in Time</EM>. Although I loved these books, they did not speak to me-they did not celebrate the uniqueness of my culture.<P>

In my first years as a teacher, I discovered children's books that gave a true portrayal of the Mexican-American culture, as well as books that revealed the diversity among Americans of Latino ancestry (Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cuban-Americans, and others). Here are the books that I think do a good job of reflecting the lifestyles, values, and customs of Latinos.<P>

<STRONG>10 Great Children's Books</STRONG><BR>
<A NAME="tamales"></A>
<EM>Too Many Tamales</EM> by <A HREF="#soto">Gary Soto</A>, illustrated by Ed Martinez (Putnam, 1993). Mexican-American Maria tries her mother's wedding ring on while she is making tamales for Christmas dinner. When the ring is missing, Maria is sure it is in one of the tamales, and she and her cousins try to eat their way out of trouble.<P>

<EM>All for the Better: The Story of El Barrio</EM> by Nicholasa Mohr (Steck-Vaughn, 1993). Renowned Puerto Rican writer Mohr tells the true story of a young girl, Evelina Lopez Antonetty (1984-1992), who made a difference in her community.<P>

<EM>Green Corn Tamales/Tamales De Elote</EM> by Gina M. Rodr&iacute;guez, illustrated by Gary Shepard (Hispanic Book Distributors, Tucson, AZ, 1994). Come join the tamale-making at a Latino family reunion at grandmother's house-the warmth of this family leaps off the page.<P>

<EM>Hairs/Pelitos</EM> by Sandra Cis&ntilde;eros (Apple Soup/Knopf, 1994). This picture book conveys the diversity within Latino cultures through the simple story of a young girl talking about the different kinds of hair her family members have.<P>

<EM>The Desert Is My Mother/El Desierto Es Mi Madre</EM> by Pat Mora, illustrated by Daniel Lechon (Pi&ntilde;ata Books, 1995). With English and Spanish text, Mora captures the wondrous beauty of Mother Earth through vivid pictures and descriptions of the desert.<P>

<EM>Rabbit Wishes</EM> by Linda Shute (Lothrop, 1995). Your students will love the story of tio Conejo (Uncle Rabbit) and his wish that Papa Dios make him bigger. This African-Cuban folktale is one of many tales about tio Conejo.<P>

<EM>Friends from the Other Side/Amigos Del Otro Lado</EM> by Gloria Anzald&uacute;a (Children's Book Press, 1993). Combat immigrant-bashing with this story of a young, undocumented Mexican worker who struggles against hardship and misunderstanding to endure.<P>

<EM>Borreguita and the Coyote: Tale from Ayutia</EM>, Mexico by Verna Aardema (Knopf, 1991). Borreguita, whose name means little lamb, uses her wits to keep Coyote from eating her. This folktale--which uses five Spanish words in the English text--will delight children.<P>

<EM>Three Kings Day</EM> by Beatriz Zapater (Modern Curriculum Press, 1992). Come meet two young Puerto Rican children living in the United States as they prepare for the celebration of Three Kings Day on January 6.<P>

<EM>&#161;Viva M&eacute;xico!</EM>: The Story of Benito Ju&aacute;rez and Cinco de Mayo by Argentina Palacios (Steck-Vaughn, 1993). Inspire kids to have faith against all odds with the story of Zapotec Indian Benito Ju&aacute;rez, who became president of Mexico. The author provides information on Cinco de Mayo, a major holiday celebrated by Mexicans and Mexican-Americans.<P>

<A NAME="soto"></A>
<H3>MEET GARY SOTO</H3>
<STRONG>Q:</STRONG> <A HREF="#tamales">Your books</A> portray the Mexican-American experience honestly and without sentimentality. How can teachers find this quality in works by other authors?<BR>
<STRONG>A:</STRONG> Find out whether the author is from the Mexican-American culture. If not, be wary. It can't be done from the outside-it's too hard to get it right. Also, look for good storytelling. If the author is not dealing with social issues-that's a good sign. Too often I see books about Mexican-Americans that adopt a patronizing "poor them, they're working too hard" tone.<P>

<H3>KEEP IN MIND</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Select books that show Hispanic women in contemporary roles.
<LI>Share biographies of Latinos so students understand Latinos' contributions to the U.S. and to the world.
<LI>Use picture books and novels as a way to inspire students to learn more about the history and culture of the Latino group depicted in the story. 
<LI>Look for stories that use Spanish words and phrases--they provide realism and show respect for the culture. Learn to pronounce the Spanish words correctly; many books include pronunciation guides to help you.<P>

<H2>African-Americans: Lift Every Voice and Sing</H2>
<EM>Books that reveal the diversity within African-American culture</EM><BR>
<STRONG>By <A HREF="#contributors">Luther B. Clegg</A></STRONG><P>

Major changes have occurred in African-American literature within the last 25 years. Before 1970, books of this genre were few, and those that existed often perpetuated stereotypes. Since then, many outstanding African-American authors and illustrators have given voice and vision to their experiences through biographies, historical fiction, and contemporary fiction. Here are ten titles worth sharing with your students.<P>

<STRONG>10 GREAT CHILDREN'S BOOKS</STRONG><BR>
<A NAME="porch"></A>
<EM>From Miss Ida's Porch</EM> by Sandra Belton, illustrated by <A HREF="#cooper">Floyd Cooper</A> (Four Winds, 1993). Miss Ida's porch is a place where mothers and fathers and uncles and grandmothers and neighbors gather to share stories. Cooper's paintings give dimension to this story about the power of memories.<P>

<EM>A Caribbean Dozen: Poems from Caribbean Poets</EM>, edited by John Agard and Grace Nichols, illustrated by Cathie Felstead (Candlewick Press, 1994). A diverse and joyous collection of poems by a dozen Caribbean poets.<P>

<EM>Meet Danitra Brown</EM> by Nikki Grimes, illustrated by Floyd Cooper (Lothrop, 1994). Cooper's drawings enhance the joyful poems of Danitra and her best friend, Zuri. Your students will love these city gal-pals as they jump rope and swap dreams.<P>

<EM>The Sunday Outing</EM> by Gloria Jean Pinkney, illustrated by Jerry Pinkney (Dial, 1994). Ernestine's dream of visiting her relatives is realized when she takes a train trip to visit North Carolina.<P>

<EM>Alvin Ailey</EM> by Andrea Davis Pinkney, illustrated by Brian Pinkney (Hyperion, 1993). This insightful biography about dancer/choreographer Ailey provides children with a model of an important 20th-century African-American.<P>

<EM>Christmas in the Big House, Christmas in the Quarters</EM> by Patricia C. McKissack and Fredrick L. McKissack, illustrated by John Thompson (Scholastic, 1994). This book provides historical accounts of Christmas on a plantation, using alternating narratives from the "big house" and the slave quarters.<P>

<EM>Pink and Say</EM> by <A HREF="#polacco">Patricia Polacco</A> (Putnam, 1994). An unforgettable story of friendship between a black and a white soldier during the Civil War. Polacco bridges cultures like no other author/illustrator.<P>

<EM>Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing</EM> by James Weldon Johnson, illustrated by Jan Spivey Gilchrist (Scholastic, 1995). The song that many consider to be the African-American anthem fills the pages of this book while Gilchrist's paintings make the lyrics soar.<P>

<EM>The Last Tales of Uncle Remus</EM> by Julius Lester, illustrated by Jerry Pinkney (Dial, 1994). In the fourth in this series, Lester uses contemporary southern black dialect to preserve the richness of folktales.<P>

<EM>The Glory Field</EM> by Walter Dean Myers (Scholastic, 1994). Myers takes readers from 1753 to 1994, tracing six generations of the Lewis family, in this complex story of struggle and achievement.<P>


<A NAME="cooper"></A>
<H3>MEET FLOYD COOPER</H3>
<STRONG>Q:</STRONG> How do you portray African-American characters authentically in <A HREF="#porch">your illustrations</A>?<BR>
<STRONG>A:</STRONG> I try to be true to the culture and take the reader there.I want readers to feel the atmosphere of the setting, to know what it smells like, what the light looks like, the sounds the characters hear-all these senses come into play. Hopefully my illustrations will strike a certain chord, bring back a certain memory, and help you feel the characters are someone you know.<P>

<H3>KEEP IN MIND</H3>
<UL>
<LI>African-American experiences are diverse and unique. The black experiences of the South do not necessarily reflect those of the North, nor do inner-city situations parallel rural settings. Make sure your classroom library reflects this diversity, as well as that of blacks living in places such as the Caribbean, Africa, and Great Britain.
<LI>Reject books with offensive expressions, negative attitudes, or stereotypes. You'll know them when you see them-trust your instincts.
<LI>Don't ignore these books because there are no children of color in your class. Books depicting African-American experiences are valuable for all children.

<A NAME="jewish"></A>
<H2>Jewish Culture: History, Humor, and Humanity</H2>
<EM>Jewish literature that spans the globe and imparts wisdom</EM><BR>
<STRONG>By <A HREF="#contributors">Etta Miller</A></STRONG><P>

Most of the Jewish children's literature I read as a kid was didactic: It set out to teach lessons, not to entertain. Today Jewish children's literature informs, inspires, amuses, and tackles larger themes, including coming of age and coming to terms with the past. The characters are full characters, growing up in a variety of cultures--and mixed cultures. The following ten titles possess a richness of character and storyline that make them especially memorable.<P>

<STRONG>10 GREAT CHILDREN'S BOOKS</STRONG><BR>
<A NAME="katz"></A>
<EM>Mrs. Katz and Tush</EM> by <A HREF="#polacco">Patricia Polacco</A> (Bantam, 1992). This heartwarming story chronicles the friendship between a lonely Jewish widow and a young African-American boy.<P>

<EM>The Diamond Tree</EM>: Jewish Tales from Around the World, selected and retold by Howard Schwartz and Barbara Rush (HarperCollins, 1991) and Rachel the Clever and Other Jewish Folktales, selected and retold by Josepha Sherman (August House Publishers, 1993). Both collections offer stories as diverse as the countries in which they originated.<P>

<EM>When Shlemiel Went to Warsaw & Other Stories</EM> by Isaac Bashevis Singer (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1968). This is a classic book by the famous writer of folktales. Also read Singer's <EM>Mazel and Shilmazel</EM> (Sunburst, 1995 reissue).<P>

<EM>Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins</EM> by Eric Kimmel (Holiday House, 1989). The author weaves another amusing modern folktale about Hanukkah.<P>

<EM>King Solomon and the Bee</EM>, adapted by Dalia Hardof Renberg, illustrated by Ruth Heller (HarperCollins, 1994). This legend about the wise king imaginatively combines religious texts and folklore.<P>

<EM>Sheltering Rebecca</EM> by Mary Baylis-White (Lodestar, 1991). In this Holocaust story, a girl is sent away from Germany by her family and must deal with the absence of her parents, as well as her Jewish identity.<P>

<EM>Molly's Pilgrim</EM> by Barbara Cohen, illustrated by Michael Deraney (Lothrop, 1983). A Jewish immigrant from Russia is accepted in her third-grade class when, for a class Thanksgiving project, her mother makes a clothespin pilgrim doll that looks Russian. This is a good book to teach that not all pilgrims came to America in the 1600s.<P>

<EM>The Devil's Arithmetic</EM> by Jane Yolen (Viking, 1988). In this compelling novel, a young girl is mystically transported from present-day New York to Poland during World War II, where she goes into a gas chamber to save the life of another.<P>

<A NAME="polacco"></A>
<H3>MEET PATRICIA POLACCO</H3>
<STRONG>Q:</STRONG> <A HREF="#katz">Your books</A> do such a good job of bridging cultures, and they never smack of contrivance. How do you make that happen story after story?<BR>
<STRONG>A:</STRONG> It's the way I've lived my life. My mother's people were Russian Jews who emigrated here at the turn of the century. My father's family is shanty Irish. I live in Oakland, California, in a mixed neighborhood. My best friend is a black man. We've done everything together from birthing babies to burying our dead. I'm used to seeing people of different races and cultures and religions in my living room. Most kids don't have that environment. When they can read stories that celebrate our diversity, hopefully they'll come away from them with a renewed respect for people who are different from them. If you can build this respect at a very young age, then society will eventually even out.<P>

<H3>KEEP IN MIND</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Seek out good literature with a strong plot and believable character development. The story should be worth revisiting again and again.
<LI>Make sure the illustrations and text do not leave the students with stereotypes. For example, many folktales portray Jews living in small European villages before World War II. Although many did live in rural areas, many others lived in large cities such as Odessa, Warsaw, and Berlin. Kids shouldn't come away from a book with a quaint notion of any group.
<LI>Before sharing a book about the Holocaust with students, think through whether your students are mature enough to handle it.
<LI>Avoid books that infer that there was a single cause for or a simple answer to the Holocaust, or that stereotype events or characters, whether Jewish or German. They should address issues of human rights and oppression in a way that shows that people living under brutal conditions often did so with dignity.<P>

<H2>Asian-Americans: The Heart of the Matter</H2>
<EM>Asian stories that teach universal truths</EM><BR>
<STRONG>By <A HREF="#contributors">Bill Vanderhoof</A></STRONG><P>

When I first delved into Asian children's literature, I was amazed how it both opened a new world to me and struck familiar chords. Reading ancient Chinese folktales and fables is like hearing a familiar song in another language--the lyrics aren't the same but the harmonal tones are. They remind me of Aesop in their power to impart ethical insights. Here are ten books that are especially memorable.<P>

<STRONG>10 GREAT CHILDREN'S BOOKS</STRONG><BR>
<A NAME="afternoon"></A>
<EM>One Afternoon</EM> by <A HREF="#heo">Yumi Heo</A> (Orchard Books, 1994). This book by a Korean-American author/illustrator communicates love through the simple story of a boy and his mother doing errands. <EM>Father's Rubber Shoes</EM> is <A HREF="#heo">Heo's</A> latest.<P>

<EM>The Journey: Japanese Americans, Racism, and Renewal</EM> by Sheila Hamanaka (Orchard Books, 1990). In this deeply personal book, Hamanaka shares a mural she painted depicting the racism her relatives and other Japanese-Americans endured while imprisoned in U. S. concentration camps during World War II.<P>

<EM>Yang the Youngest and His Terrible Ear</EM> by Lensey Namioka, illustrated by Kees de Kiefte (Little Brown, 1992).

<H3>MEET YUMI HEO</H3>
<STRONG>Q:</STRONG> Both your books--<A HREF="#afternoon"><EM>One Afternoon</EM></A> and <EM>Father's Rubber Shoes</EM>--portray the Korean immigrant experience. Tell us how they came about.<BR>
<STRONG>A:</STRONG> I came to America from a small town in Korea six years ago. When I was at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, I did a book about the racial disharmony there. An editor said it would be difficult to publish, but she encouraged me to write a Korean immigrant story. So I wrote and illustrated <A HREF="#afternoon"><EM>One Afternoon</EM></A>. The child's experience of the big buildings, noises, and excitement of New York City was like my own.<BR>
In <EM>Father's Rubber Shoes</EM>, the father telling the story about the rubber shoes is a story my mom told me when I was little. The basis for the story is that when Koreans come to this country, they don't come with a lot money. They start from the bottom and try to work their way up. They are trying to do better for their children.<P>

<H3>KEEP IN MIND</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Search for stories that exhibit values inherent in many Asian cultures, such as cooperation and a respect for family and tradition.
<LI>Ensure that the events depicted are historically accurate; in a work of fiction, that the events described are plausible.
<LI>Asian-American children, as well as others in the class, should perceive the characters as competent problem-solvers, responding in positive ways to the challenges they confront.
<LI>While including stories whose settings are in the United States, it is also appropriate to include those set in other countries, thus providing students with a richer description of the cultural roots of Asian-American students.

<H2>Teaching About Families</H2>


<STRONG>By Ruth Bilbe & Naomi Kornman</STRONG><P>



Family is a topic that fits anytime, anyplace into the school curriculum. Kindergarten teachers Ruth Bilbe and Naomi Kornman make a cross-curricular family unit a staple in their classroom at Newman School in New Orleans, Louisiana. Here, Ruth and Naomi peek into their planbooks and share the best of their family activities. <P>

<A NAME="button">
<H3>Button Broods</H3>
To help show that families come in all shapes and sizes, we turn students loose on our button collection and ask them to find buttons that match in some way. Students put these buttons together into families and glue them onto cutout construction paper houses.Then they describe what makes their buttons a familyfor example, the same color and two holes, despite different shapes and sizes.<P>


<A NAME="display">
<H3>Families on Display</H3>

Near the beginning of our family unit, we cover a large bulletin board with craft paper, then comb through magazines, catalogs, and discarded books to collect pictures of families of different configurations, cultures, and origins. We glue these pictures collage-style directly onto the board. Then we invite children to add drawings and photos of their own families to the display. On a nearby table or book rack, we place a collection of books about families (see <A HREF="#resources">Resources</A>).<P>




<A NAME="animal">
<H3>Animal Families</H3>

Young children love learning about animal families. Using books and nature magazines, we learn about what  animal family groups are called (herd, litter, and so on) as well as animal baby names (such as cub and foal). We also explore animal family behaviorshow animals live together and how they care for their youngand compare these with human behaviors.We then invite children to create their own picture books about animal families. 
 <P>



<A NAME="art">
<H3>The Family in Art</H3>

Our public library has several collections of fine art prints and illustrations featuring families. Some good resources include <EM>A Child's Book of Art: Great Pictures First Words</EM> selected by Lucy Micklethwait (Dorling Kindersley, 1993)  and <EM>I Spy: An Alphabet in Art</EM>  (Greenwillow, 1992) devised and selected by Lucy Micklethwait. We use the prints as we would wordless picture books, having children imagine what the subjects are saying, doing, thinking, or planning. Then we invite children to each bring in a small collection of family photos to refer to as they paint portraits of their own families. 
<P>



<A NAME="ancestors">
<H3>Meet Your Ancestors</H3>

When children are ready to turn their attention to their family's history, we begin by reading books such as <EM>Watch the Stars Come Out</EM> by Riki Levinson (Dutton, 1985). Then we have the whole class collaborate to create Our Map of Family Places, starting with the reproducible <A HREF="k1where.html">Where We've Been</A> in this theme unit. To make your own map, photocopy and distribute the reproducible.  Ask kids take to have a family memberhelp them fill out the page, which asks about family moves and memories. We invite our students to share their completed reproducible pages in class. Then we gather around a large wall map of the world and help children use pushpins to mark their families' places of origin and patterns of movement. We connect the pins with lengths of yarn and use sticky notes to label and date these moves. We ask children to notice details about our class map,  such as which family traveled the farthest, which one made the most moves, and so on. Then we make a list of important family places and post nearby. Over the course of the year, we help children track down more information about those places. We also like to invite family members in to the classroom to tell about their family's history and important places (we find that providing copies of the <A HREF="k1where.html">Where We've Been</A> pages can help these speakers shape their presentations).<P>




<A NAME="vacation">
<H3>A Family Vacation</H3>

One of our favorite books for reading aloud is <EM>The Relatives Came</EM> by Cynthia Rylant (Bradbury Press, 1985). After the story, we ask children to talk about times they've traveled with family or had family visiting them. We invite children to bring in souvenirs, postcards, or photos from these times. Then we brainstorm a list of year-round, no-travel family "vacations"  (such as vacant lot nature walks, living room campouts, and so on). We've even tried a few of these with our classroom family!
<P>



<A NAME="graphs">
<H3>Family Graphs</H3>

Here are two ways our students graph family information:<P>

<OL><LI>Turn a piece of graph paper horizontally. Print the letters of the alphabet along the bottom (one letter per square). Make one copy of this page for each child. At the top of the page, help each child print the names of his or her family members. Then, have children create name bar graphs by coloring in one square above each letter that appears in each name until all the names have been graphed. Finally, help children to count and record the total number of letters represented in their family members' names. </LI><P>


<LI>Read <EM>How Many Feet in the Bed?</EM> by Diane Johnston Hamm (Simon and Schuster, 1991) Then use the reproducible <A HREF="k1counts.html">My Family Counts!</A> page to create family counting wheels. Mount copies of the wheel onto construction paper. Have children take copies of the wheel home so they may count and total the number of family member's body parts as directed on each wedge of the wheel. Back in class, help children calculate their own grand totals and those of the class. (This activity is great for teaching kids how to skip count by twos, fives, and tens.) </LI>
</OL>

<P>
<A NAME="house">
<H3>A House is a House...</H3>

Our students love the book <EM>A House is a House for Me</EM>  by Mary Ann Hoberman (Penguin,1978). For a fun interactive chart to go along with the activity, we draw an large house shape on butcher paper (approximately 4-by-7 feet), then laminate it so it can be reused. Together with our students, we make a list of various household things (such as cups and shoes) that can serve as houses for other things. Then we offer children blank index cards so they can illustrate their ideas and tape them directly onto the house. (We find that it helps to encourage children to "color to the edges of the cards" so that their pictures will not appear too small.) We help each child label their cards by completing for each one the line "A_________is a house for a____________." 
<P>



<A NAME="grandpa">
<H3>Writing About Grandpa</H3>

<EM>Grandpa Loved</EM>  (Simon and Schuster, 1989), the award-winning book by <A HREF="k1mentor.html">Josephine Nobisso</A>, celebrates the relationship between a child and his grandfather. You might want to share the following information with your students before handing out the <A HREF="k1mentor.html">Meet a Mentor reproducible</A> about Josephine. Then invite students to share feelings about their own grandparents.
<P>

Despite the book's poignant, believable storyline, Josephine herself grew up not knowing her own grandfathers. "One grandfather died just before I was born, the other passed away when I was just an infant," she says. Then why did Josephine choose a grandfather as the book's central character? "The book takes us to four different landscapes I love: the sea, the forest, the city, and the family," she explains. "There's always a sense of nostalgia when I'm in one and not the other. I thought, 'Who else to bring to the places I miss the most than someone I most miss?' My grandfathers were alive for me even though I never had them in the flesh. My family still accorded them the love and respect as if they had been alive. And just as the grandfather in the book will forever live on in the boy's heart, my grandfathers will be with me always."

<P>

<A NAME="celebrations">
<H3>Family Celebrations</H3>

We like to culminate our unit on family with fun-filled  get-togethers like these. 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Sibling Celebration:</STRONG> Have children prepare invitations asking their siblings to join them in class or at recess. Siblings can team up to present puppet shows, do readings of favorite poems, or share memories about each other.   </LI><P>

<LI><STRONG>Film Festival:</STRONG> Have children bring family videos to view together in school. Ask each child to act a narrator for his or her family's film. Use the opportunity to explore family roles and relationship labels (cousins, aunts, great-grandparents, step-parents, and so on). Point out how we all often assume more than one role in a familyfor example, a boy can be a son, a brother, a cousin, a nephew, and a grandson at the same time.</LI><P>

<LI><STRONG>Family Food Fair:</STRONG> Invite family members to share favorite recipes at a taste-testing feast. As your students and guests sample the fare, read the book <EM>Everybody Cooks Rice</EM> by Norah Dooley (Carolrhoda, 1991). Then ask family members to take turns describing the origins and meanings of their family recipes and the occasions on which the dish is served in their homes. Afterwards, ask the family members to write out their recipes and have your students illustrate them. Make copies of these recipes and bind them together to create your own classroom Family Cookbook. Give each student one copy of the cookbook to take home.</LI>

<H2>Teaching About Families</H2>

<STRONG>By Dolores Choat</STRONG><P>


These days, units on the family can include many fun activities-but making the traditional family tree isn't one of them. Families come in so many configurations that a tree is no longer a workable way to think about families. In my classroom, I've discovered that family activities need to be broader and more accepting of the many types of families my students come from. The following activities, focusing on family structure, members, homes, and history, encourage children to be proud of their families-no matter what family means to them.
<P>


<A NAME="button">
<STRONG><FONT SIZE=4>Button Brood</FONT></STRONG><BR>
To help students understand that families come in all shapes and sizes, I start off with an activity where students create "button families." They can find buttons that match in some way, put them together into families, and glue them in a house made from construction paper. Once students have created their families they can compare their button family members-the buttons may be the same color or have two holes, but be different shapes and sizes.
<P>


<A NAME="animal">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Animal Clans</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Another way I introduce the concept of many types of families is by discussing animal families. For example, we discover that seahorse and Emperor penguin fathers-not mothers- nurture and protect the eggs. We discuss other family structures found in the animal world, including young that are cared for by extended family members, animals that live alone, and "single-parent" families. Students can think about the ways in which the traits of these animal families compare to those of human families.
<P>


<A NAME="circle">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Family Circle</STRONG></FONT><BR>
When talking about students' families, I like to reinforce the idea that differences don't mean better or worse. I begin by having students compare their eyes, hair, heights, and other attributes. Students can discuss the fact that these differences don't affect whether we like each other, and that none of these attributes are right or wrong. Then, we discuss the many kinds of families that exist. Individually, students create a Family Circle diagram, with themselves in a center circle and other family members on "rays" that emanate out. Students can include whomever they wish-people who live in primary and secondary residences as well as those who don't. After they complete their diagrams, we discuss the many types of families that are represented in our class.
<P>


<A NAME="shape">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>The Shape of Families</STRONG></FONT><BR>
This activity also reinforces the "no right or wrong family" concept. On separate pieces of paper, draw a large rectangle and a large square. Make photocopies and give one rectangle and one square to each student to take home, along with several long pieces of string. Ask students to measure each of their family members from the tip of the middle finger on the left hand to the tip of the middle finger on the right hand, then from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head. If the two measurements are the same, the family member is a square. If the lengths are different, the family member is a rectangle. On the sheets, students record all of their family members' shapes. Students can then create graphs of these results and, as a class, we determine if there are more squares or rectangles among students' families. 
<P>


<A NAME="mobile">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Mobile Families</STRONG></FONT><BR>
This project gets my students thinking positively about the members of their families. I provide each student with one coat hanger labeled with his or her name, along with yarn and construction or drawing paper. Then students draw and cut out faces of their family members. On the reverse side of these drawings, I have students describe each family member positively. These drawings can be attached to the hanger with yarn in any arrangement students choose.
<P>


<A NAME="trait">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Family Trait Chart</STRONG></FONT><BR>
I start this activity by asking students to think about the different kinds of facts that add up to a description of their  family members. Often, my students choose birthdays; relative heights and sizes; favorite/least favorite colors, foods, and sports; and quirky abilities, such as tongue-rolling. Students compile the information about their families and create their charts, listing their family members down the left side, categories along the top, and findings in the appropriate places. Once students complete the charts, they can determine if there are patterns in family traits.
<P>


<A NAME="snapshots">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Family Snapshots</STRONG></FONT><BR>
If possible, provide your students with a Polaroid cameras and film and have them take turns taking pictures for "A Day/Week In the Life of My Family" display. Students can photograph their family members, homes, and activities during this day/week. If you don't have access to cameras, students can keep a family journal which can be presented in a storyboard or cartoon format. 
<P>


<A NAME="recipes">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Family Recipes</STRONG></FONT><BR>
My students learn a lot about family customs with this activity. They ask parents about a special family recipe, preferably one made for a family celebration or holiday. Then they write a story about the recipe, its history, when, how, and why it's made, and so on. Students can share these recipes and stories with the class. This is a great time to discuss different family traditions and holidays.
<P>


<A NAME="quilt">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>How to Make a Family Quilt</STRONG></FONT><BR>
My class celebrates family by creating paper family quilts that highlight all family members-or as many as each student chooses to include. 
You can reproduce and use the <A HREF="23quilt.html">Quilt Square Master</A>  for this activity, providing your students with as many squares as needed (this will depend on the number of people in each student's family). You can use the <A HREF="23quilt.html">Quilt Square Master </A>  as is or have students cut out the shapes and create their own quilt square pattern. In the center square, students can draw a portrait of a member of the family-pets included-and on the surrounding shapes, place special information about that family member. Students can include information, such as special memories of that family member, where and when the person was born, when that person became part of the family, and so on. When the squares are complete, students can tape them together and add "stitches" with black felt-tip pen. 
<P>


<A NAME="express">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Express Mail</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Students can send specially made "Thinking of You" cards to elderly family members, neighbors, or friends. I use this as an opportunity to discuss the changes aging can bring about and start students sharing information about the oldest members of their families.
<P>


<A NAME="window">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Window Box Families</STRONG></FONT><BR>
This activity is a student favorite. Kids create drawings of their families and rooms in their homes, then incorporate special "windows" (like in an Advent calendar) that highlight each family member. Here's how:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Give each student a sheet of paper. </LI>
<P>
<LI>Have students fold the paper in half horizontally, like a card. </LI>
<P>
<LI>Ask students to unfold the paper. On one inside half, they should draw family pictures, including all family members and pets. The setting for each drawing should be a room in the home; students should incorporate as much detail about the room as they can.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Next, students re-fold the paper and outline boxes-windows-that will frame their family members.</LI>
<P>
<LI>They then cut three sides of the window outlines so that each can be folded back to reveal the faces of family members.</LI>
</OL><P>
Students can make more than one window box drawing if they live in more than one place (such as father's and mother's homes in the case of shared custody after a divorce).

<P>

<A NAME="grandpa">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Writing About Grandpa</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<EM>Grandpa Loved</EM>  (Simon and Schuster, 1989), the award-winning book by <A HREF="k1mentor.html">Josephine Nobisso</A>, celebrates the relationship between a child and his grandfather. You might want to share the following information with your students before handing out the <A HREF="k1mentor.html">Meet a Mentor reproducible</A>  about Josephine. Then invite students to share feelings about their own grandparents.
<P>
Despite the book's poignant, believable storyline, Josephine herself grew up not knowing her own grandfathers. "One grandfather died just before I was born, the other passed away when I was just an infant," she says. Then why did Josephine choose a grandfather as the book's central character? "The book takes us to four different landscapes I love: the sea, the forest, the city, and the family," she explains. "There's always a sense of nostalgia when I'm in one and not the other. I thought, 'Who else to bring to the places I miss the most than someone I most miss?' My grandfathers were alive for me even though I never had them in the flesh. My family still accorded them the love and respect as if they had been alive. And just as the grandfather in the book will forever live on in the boy's heart, my grandfathers will be with me always."

<H2>Teaching About Families</H2>

<STRONG>By Adam Berkin </STRONG>
<P>

What's the best way to approach the theme of families for upper-grade and middle school students? Instructor talked with fifth-grade teacher Sandy Kaser of Tucson, Arizona, about a family studies unit she developed to encourage her students to explore different ethnic groups and types of families. Sandy has a diverse group of students in her classroom, including Native Americans, Hispanics, African-Americans and Caucasians, but she's had mixed reactions from them on past multicultural units. Sandy started talking with her colleagues about a family studies unit that would draw students in. The following activities were the result of her search. Sandy said this unitwhich was also spotlighted in If This Is Social Studies, Why Isn't It Boring (Stenhouse, 1994)was one of the most successful in her 17 years of teaching.  
<P>



<A NAME="reading">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Start with Reading</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Sandy loves using literature in the classroom, so for her family studies unit she assembles a variety of resources into "text sets" focusing on family sub-themes such as fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers, grandparents, family stories, and family issues (including foster families and families with people with disabilities). Sandy stores the materials for each themeincluding quick-to-read picture books, articles, and poetry, as well as longer fiction and nonfictionin a separate plastic bin. To introduce the sets, Sandy schedules 45 minutes for small groups to browse through each set and choose one to read more thoroughly. During the next two weeks, each group pores through its bin, reading, discussing, and recording responses in logs before selecting several subjects to research in depth. In the end, Sandy has each group present two of the issues they discussed. Each year, Sandy is amazed at how the text sets inspire students to share their own family stories.
<P>

<A NAME="comfort">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Raise the Comfort Level</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Kids can feel uneasy when discussing personal issues such as family backgrounds and cultural identities. To help them feel more comfortable, Sandy has the following suggestions.
<UL>
<LI>Be willing to share about your own experiences. Sandy makes a point about telling students about her own family history, including the fact that she is adopted. 

<LI>Use literature to introduce sensitive issues. Sandy found that discussions on racism developed when she read <EM>Angel Child, Dragon Child</EM> by Michele Maria Surat about a Vietnamese girl who starts attending an American schooland that issues of homelessness came up naturally when she read Eve Bunting's <EM>Fly Away Home</EM> which describes a father and son who live in an airport. 
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="know">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Get to Know Each Other</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Sandy has students interview each other to gather information and to practice interview skills for future activities. Before they start asking questions, Sandy asks her students to check out interviews on television and in magazines. Students then brainstorm what they want to know about each other.  They publish their completed interviews in a classroom newspaper. 

<P>

<A NAME="name">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Where's My Name From?</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Each year, Sandy asks her students to find out how they got their names. (You can use the <A HREF="48what.html">What's in a Name?</A> reproducible for this activity.) "Fabian was surprised to find out he was named after a famous singer," she says. Not only do students like solving their name mystery, but the activity encourages them and their parents to talk about other memories. 

<P>

<A NAME="remember">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>I Remember When...</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Sandy has her students collect family memory stories by asking their parents to relate a memory such as  "I remember when you were born," or "I remember when you broke your foot." Students record these stories in writing for their classmates; later, Sandy collects the stories for a book. To help students tell their stories orally, Sandy invites a storyteller to class to share drama, music, and movement techniques. Her class also creates a "story rope": students tie objects reflecting memories onto a rope and then tell the stories behind the objects. 
<P>


<A NAME="time">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Time Line of My Family</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Sandy has her students explore their own lives and the lives of their families through time lines. The students first do a time line of their life from birth to their current grade. They record such events as learning to read, learning to ride a bike, losing a first tooth, and starting school. But this is merely a warm-up for a 100-year time line of their family's history. Since most students can't immediately recite a century of family history, this project prompts family research and lots of reminiscences and discussions about cultural heritage. Events students record on their time lines include immigration dates, moves across town and across the country, work history, marriages and divorces, and births and deaths. In addition to recording these events on their time lines, students post objects such as photos, postcards, and souvenirs. Sandy invites students to include as many events as they wantbut they have to write up the stories behind at least 10 of them. Since Sandy has begun doing this project with her students, her class has heard stories of family heroes, war stories, memories of living on reservations, and more. Sandy points out to her students that many of the stories they share make reference to other events of the time period, such as "around when we saw the Beatles" or "the year Kennedy died." This often prompts students to learn about historical events. 
<P>


<A NAME="eat">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Let's Eat!</STRONG></FONT><BR>
After reading <EM>Everybody Cooks Rice</EM>  by Norah Dooly (Carolrhoda, 1991) and <EM>Bread, Bread, Bread</EM>  by Ann Morris (Lothrop, 1989), Sandy and her students collect recipes from as many different cookbooks as they can find and also ask family members for suggestions. Then Sandy has each student select one bread recipe and one rice recipe to prepare at home and bring in to share with the class. On the feast day, the kids select music and light candles to create a festive mood. Afterwards, the class collects all the recipes in a cookbook that kids take home to their families. 


<P>

<A NAME="place">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>This Is My Place</STRONG></FONT><BR>
At a reading conference, Sandy discovered what is now one of her favorite family studies tools: a book called <EM>My Place</EM>  by N. Wheatley and D. Rawlins (Kane/Miller, 1992). The book is a collection of stories about a town in Australia, illustrated with maps. The story begins with the main character saying, "Hi, my name is _________ and this is my place." On the opposite page is a informal map that the main character has labeled with important places, including a tree at the center of the map. Each story is narrated by a family member from a different generation and includes a map to match. The book starts in the present and goes back in time by 10-year increments to Aboriginal times and ultimately to a time when there were no people, just the tree. 
<P>

Sandy divides her class into small groups and asks each group to read two stories from <EM>My Place</EM> each day, then share with the whole class what they notice about how the place and characters change over time. When they finish the book, Sandy asks students to look over their list of observations and divide it into categories such as jobs, historical events, family relations, and Australian words. Students divide into groups corresponding to these categories, re-read the book looking for information related to their category, and decide on a way to share their information with the whole school. For example, one year the group that investigated the tree made a big tree out of a colored paper and put dates on the leaves. Underneath each leaf they drew a picture and wrote a narrative of what was happening to the tree in that time period.
<P>

Soon after Sandy introduced <EM>My Place</EM>, one student independently chose to write her own version of the book. The student told her own family story and drew her "my place" map of her neighborhood, labeling important places such as "This is where I get off the bus to buy a soda every day." The other kids liked her book so much, they all decided to write their own! 

<P>

<A NAME="biography">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Biography Browser</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Sandy finds that biographies tie family studies and a literary genre together. Each year, she brings in a collection of biographies and says to students, "Here is a box of people's lives -- read about anyone's life you are interested in." Since the students have just written about their own lives, they are excited to find out about other people's. They browse through the biographies and select at least one to read completely. Then, since Sandy wants students to talk in small groups about the biographies, she helps them organize themselves into discussion groups focusing on such categories as Artists and Authors, People of Great Courage, Famous People in History, and Western Heroes. While they read and talk, Sandy asks students to think: How did this person's family influence him or her? What can I learn from this person's life that I can use in my own? For example, one of her struggling students who read a biography of Abraham Lincoln concluded, "I learned that Lincoln made a lot of mistakes along the way,  the same as me." 
<P>


<A NAME="show">
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Show and Sing</STRONG></FONT><BR>
To finish the unit with a flourish, Sandy invites parents for an art show and choral performance. Students display all the projects they've worked on, including time lines, "my place" maps, and "I remember when" stories, and perform songs about family (see <A HREF="#resources">Technology Tips in Grade-Perfect Resources</A>). Last year, even the superintendent turned out for the show!

<H2>Teacher's Help-One Another Club<BR>
Rewards and Incentives</H2>
<STRONG>Posted 6/1/96</STRONG><P>

Teacher's Help-One-Another Club, a regular feature in <EM>Instructor</EM> magazine, brings teachers together to solve problems and share ideas. Each month, we'll provide a round-up of responses to a teacher's request for help. This month's topic, is <A HREF="#motivate">motivating students to read</A>.<P>

Want to participate in Teacher's Help-One-Another Club? How do you get your students motivated to read more?  Offer your suggestions or your questions to fellow teachers! Send your e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:kkykim@aol.com">KKYKim@aol.com</A>; you may see it posted here in future updates.
</UL>

<A NAME="motivate"></A>
<H3>Motivating Your Students to Read</H3>
"How do you motivate students to read more?"--wrote Teacher Tanya Martin of Chicago, Illinois, to <EM>Instructor</EM>. Our readers responded via postcards, letters, and e-mail.  Here is a roundup of them:<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Sing Together!</STRONG><BR>
On an overhead, write a few phrases about books you want your students to read. Then sing the phrases to a familiar tune such as "Are You Sleeping?" or "Yankee Doodle." Hold up each book as everyone sings  along. Have children choose one of the books to read; afterward, write additional verses to the song and sing it together as a class. When you've gone through this process a number of times, type up all your new songs, have children illustrate the pages, and assemble them into a  class songbook.<BR>
<EM>Kay McAlpine<BR>
Dunkirk, Ohio</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Make Reading Buddies</STRONG><BR>
To motivate my emerging readers in kindergarten and first grade, I have  a can full of cutout cardboard characters attached to wooden dowels. Some of these are favorite characters from books, but I encourage  students to make their own reading pals. I explain that these "little readers" want to go on a walk and be read to. Individually or in small groups, students stroll around our classroom and into the hall, reading everything on the walls to their pals. You can do the same activity with stuffed animals or puppets. Remember to alert other teachers and office personnel that your students will be in the hallways, and send out just a few at a time.<BR>
<EM>Judy Meagher<BR>
Bozeman, Montana</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Seasonal Add-ons</STRONG><BR>
To motivate my students to read more, I developed seasonal add-ons. For  October, I cut out jointed skeleton pieces from card stock. Each student has a skull hanging from the ceiling. As kids finish a book, they earn another part of their skeleton. They write the title and author of the book on the bone and attach it to their skeleton with a brad. Students are always anxious to complete their skeletons in time for Halloween. In November, I design a bulletin board with a turkey body for each student.  As students complete each book they add a feather to their turkey. (This idea could also be adapted as a whole-class add-on by having one large turkey body that students feather collaboratively.) Other ideas include:
adding candles to a tree or a menorah; building a snowman; dressing a leprechaun; putting decorated eggs in a basket; adding petals to a flower, or apples or leaves to a tree.<BR>
<EM>SouthPride@aol.com</EM><P>
<LI><STRONG>Celebrate reading for a week</STRONG><BR>
Our school has a week of special reading activities each year to celebrate Children's Book Week (third week in November). Students get a list of all kinds of creative activities to choose from, such as making mobiles, putting on puppet shows, and interviewing playwrights. At the end of the week, students come in dressed as characters from their favorite books. They vote on who has the best costume, and the winners  get gift certificates to a local bookstore.<BR>

<H2>The Tools You Need to Assess Writing</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF="#gregory">Cynde Gregory</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

To thoughtfully evaluate students' creative writing, you must start where they are and then read beneath the 
surface. Here's some hands-on help for getting started.<P>

<A NAME="epiphany"></A>
<H3>My Assessment Epiphany</H3>
I sat in a Chinese restaurant sipping tea, wishing I'd never agreed to lead a workshop on assessing children's 
creative writing. The words of the teacher-center director who arranged the workshop echoed in my head. "Our teachers work hard to bring writing into their classrooms, through journals, portfolios, and daily blocks of writing time," she'd said. "They are reluctant to 'grade' the resulting work, but parents and administrators, as well as the teachers themselves, need some way to accurately assess the children's progress."<P>

I shook my head. What kind of assessment tool could I develop for teachers that would be useful, consistent, and clear? I thought about children's writing. Some pieces are models of surface perfection--beautiful handwriting, perfect punctuation--but they lack heart. Others are full of scrawled, misspelled words, smudges, and random punctuation, yet they glow with an honest voice. With traditional grading, which determines the success or failure of a particular text by focusing on its errors, the technically polished work would be given a higher grade than the messy work. I sighed and sipped more tea. Teachers need a method of assessment that sees mistakes in a more positive light. Error, after all, can mark the furthest frontier of abstraction or deep thought the author can manage.<P>

Puzzling over the nature of assessment, I broke open my fortune cookie:<BR>
<CENTER>
<p align=center>"To know that you know what you know,<BR>
and that you do not know what you do not know,<BR>
that is true knowledge."<BR>
--Confucius.</p>
</CENTER>
Confucius sure was a smart guy. Assessing children's writing shows what they know and do not know. With that, we can determine how far toward writing fluency each has come, and what we can do to help make the journey easier.<P>

With this in mind, I began to sketch out an assessment checklist, or rubric, that would allow teachers a consistent means of assessing chidren's work over time.<P>

The <A HREF="#rubric">rubric</A> I created focuses on three features of writing, within which are 18 specific competencies. The rubric's notation system is not number-based or letter-based, to help you remember that assessment is not grading. I recommend using the rubric to review students' work at least once month. More detailed instructions are listed on the rubric page. You'll also see a <A HREF="#sample">sample assessment</A> I did of one student's work.<P>

As you apply the rubric, consider what you know about the student-author's abilities and approaches. Study 
<A HREF="#expect">"What to Expect"</A> for further insight. Remember, the process of learning to write is 
fluid; writers might cross category boundaries at various stages of development. Leave blank any fields that do not apply to the piece of writing. In no time, using the rubric will become second nature.<P>

EMERGING WRITERS<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Scribble-writing: writing perceived as a magical act.
<LI>Initial sounds scripted: letters recognized as symbols (D=dog).
<LI>Final sounds scripted: comprehends the existence of words (DG=dog).
<LI>Missing auditory information: consonants appear first, then long vowels.
<LI>No distinctions made between certain sets of sounds: b-p, f-v, th-d-t. One or two vowels serve all purposes.
<LI>Overcompensation: scripting every nuance of sound, distinct or not.
<LI>Gradual replacement of scribble writing with attempts at spelling; extreme nervousness about spelling.
<LI>Frequent use of illustration. 
</OL>
DEVELOPING WRITERS<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Nervousness about spelling persists.
<LI>Frequent use of empty words such as very, much, and a lot to inflate text.
<LI>Growing attachment to writing and physical result; tendency to count number of words used.
<LI>Growing attachment to act of writing as expression of inner vision. Pride of ownership: "Listen to what I 
wrote!"
<LI>Developing understanding of poetry; initially, rhyme is seen as the only distinction. Later, delight in shaping poems.
<LI>Use of illustration to support text.
<LI>Delight in expanding vocabulary.
<LI>Primitive attempts at revision.
</OL>
EXPERIENCED WRITERS<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Increasing fluency of ideas and words.
<LI>Greater facility with surface features.
<LI>Increasing sense of writing as means of expressing individuality.
<LI>Much detail, to the point of slowing down action. Later, more conscientious selection of details. 
<LI>Delight in unusual verbs.
<LI>Integration of personal knowledge into texts.
<LI>Interest in opinions of others; text's unrealized potential is of greater concern. 
<LI>Rereading and simultaneous self-editing becomes more integrated into the writing process.

<H2>Assessment Guru Grant Wiggins on Measuring Student Progress </H2>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>


All the talk about changing the way we measure student progress raises important questions. What do we mean by <A HREF="#difference">assessment</A>-as opposed to grading? How do you design <A HREF="#reliable">reliable assessments</A>? Should you "teach to" <A HREF="#standardized">standardized tests</A>? How can you evaluate an <A HREF="#cooperative">individual performance on a cooperative project</A>? And how do we <A HREF="#parents">explain it all to parents</A>? To get answers, <EM>Instructor</EM> senior editor <A HREF ="../info/editors.html#bozzone">Meg Bozzone</A> interviewed assessment expert Grant Wiggins, president of the nonprofit Center on Learning Assessment and School Structure (CLASS). <EM>Instructor</EM> also wants to learn <A HREF="#turn">about your experience with assessment</A>.<P>

<A NAME="difference"></A>
<H3>What's the difference between assessment and grading?</H3>
When teachers assess student performance, they're not placing value or judgment on it--that's evaluating or grading. They're simply reporting a student's profile of achievement.<P>

<H3>What's a "profile of achievement"?</H3>
It's like a baseball card that lists the batting average, runs batted in, and other data about a player without placing a value on performance. In order to evaluate a player's performance, you must factor in other information, such as: Is the player a rookie who has a low batting average in general, but a high average for a rookie? Therefore, for student performance you report about such things as absolute achievement, relative progress, scores for specific writing skills (not writing as a whole), and so on.<P>

<H3>Should teachers trade in their traditional assessment methods for profiles of achievement?</H3>
It's not 'Yeah, portfolios! Boo, multiple choice!" or any other either/or choice. Good assessment is about expanding the assessment repertoire because no single form is sufficient. There are reliability and validity problems with each. Every method has its strengths and weaknesses, and its place.<P>

<A NAME="parents"></A>
<H3>Are parents comfortable with profiles of achievement?</H3>
Parents at schools that have switched from report cards to narratives often say, "This is great, but how is Johnny doing?" I'm sympathetic to them and return to the baseball-card analogy: I don't know how to judge the value of a batting average of 280 unless I have some comparative information. It may turn out that hitting three out of ten, which sounds poor, would land a player in the majors.<P>

In schools, teachers should report the profile of achievement and compare students to standards or norms. For example, a student in a second-grade class may be a year younger than classmates and therefore less experienced. There is no reason to compare this child flat out with others with no qualifying language or context of expectations. At the same time, teachers should report, for example, that a child who may not be a strong writer for his age has made progress in attitude and with some writing skills.<P>

<H3>What are ways of putting students' performance in context?</H3>
Many schools report performance on a novice-expert continuum. Teachers draw up a rubric that describes what a student should have mastered from the novice to the expert level, with steps delineated and explained along the way. Teachers then put students' learning into context. They can point out to parents, for example, "Here's where we placed your child on this continuum. The evidence we used to support our assessment will help you see why."<P> 

The same rubric also can be used to report individual progress. Teachers can say, for example, "Relative to other five-year-olds, your child is still behind. But, as you can see from the last assessment, she has made gains and we're happy with that progress."<P>

<H3>How can teachers expand their assessment repertoire?</H3>
Begin where you know you have a mismatch between an outcome you value and the way you now assess it. For example, if you know your 20-question multiple-choice quiz on the Civil War is inadequate, experiment with adding another type of assessment that's rich and interesting. What have you got to lose? You're not tossing out the test. You're finding a way to fill in a gap. Also, give students scoring rubrics and other insight into what criteria is applied to assessment--secrecy should be minimal--and have kids practice peer review. Self-assessment and self-adjustment are at the heart of better performance.<P> 

<A NAME="reliable"></A>
<H3>How will teachers know if an assessment is reliable?</H3>
There's a big difference between a neat activity and valid assessment, and not all assessment is hands-on. Teachers need to design assessments backward from the task, asking at each step of the way "What's the evidence I need of children's understanding? Will this assessment get at it?" For example, if you're considering using a diorama of the Civil War as an assessment, ask "Could students do the diorama but not understand the Civil War? Could students not do the diorama well but understand the Civil War?" The answer to both is yes, so it's a good idea to either rethink using the diorama as assessment or use other types of assessments, such as oral presentations, in conjunction with it.<P>
	
<A NAME="cooperative"></A>
<H3>What about assessing cooperative projects? </H3>
Many parents worry about this because they want to know the specifics of their child's performance. I'm sympathetic to that, and again return to the sports analogy: Your team can lose ten games in a row, but the data for your best player still stands and vice versa. So teachers need to find assessments--such as presentations by each student on an aspect of a collective project--that pull out information about each child<P>

<H3>If a school's policy is to give letter grades only, what can an individual teacher do?</H3>
There's nothing to prevent teachers from expanding their modes of assessment while still living in a letter-grade world. Assessment reform is about getting different and richer information about students' performance, all of which teachers can factor into a grade. It's a matter of expanding your pile of evidence, not necessarily changing the grading system.<P>

<A NAME="standardized"></A>
<H3>Where does standardized testing fit in with assessment?</H3>
Many teachers think that they have to teach worse in order for their students to get better scores on standardized tests. Not true. The tests are usually simplistic and generic, so if teachers have a rigorous local curriculum and assessment system, their students should do very well. The test designers aren't interested in teaching through the test--all they're trying to do is find the quickest and easiest way of getting at some basic skills. Teachers' standards should be much higher than the test designers' standards, which are minimal.<P>

Take it from us--assessing what students know in mathematics can be a real challenge. What number concepts are children comfortable with? Struggling to grasp? On the verge of understanding? We found fertile ground for evaluating students in straightforward activities that we based on two captivating children's books. While the moral of the books may be that things aren't necessarily the way they seem, the moral for us is this: Teachers don't have to look any further than everyday activities for rich assessment opportunities.

<A NAME="primary"></A>
<H2>Stephanie's Primary Lesson</H2>
Marc Harshman poetically begins his book <EM>Only One</EM> (Cobblehill, 1993), "There may be a million 
stars, but there is only one sky. There may be 50,000 bees, but there is only one hive." Each page of this 
beautifully illustrated countdown book contrasts a collection of things with a single object, sending the message to children that while something may belong to a group, it can, nevertheless, be unique.<P>

<H3>Step 1 </H3>
After reading the book aloud to my first graders, I ask students to think about how the pages are alike or different. Some may notice that the numbers at the beginning of the book are very large, diminish by leaps, and finally end up decreasing by ones. Others may point out that each page contains the words only one.<P>

<H3>Step 2 </H3>
I reread the pages that state, "There may be 11 cows, but there is only one herd. There may be 10 cents, but 
there is only one dime." Then I ask: Why must the page about dimes feature the number 10, while the page about the herds doesn't have to be about 11? I have children discuss why some words are specific to a particular number and why others could work for a variety of numbers.<P>

<H3>Step 3</H3>
On the blackboard or a sheet of chart paper I make two columns, one labeled Dime and the other, Herd. Then I review the book with students, asking children to classify the object or animal featured on each page as a member of the dime or herd category. As students decide, I add the word to our class chart in the appropriate column. Some of the pages, I've discovered, require a bit of discussion. For instance, my students felt that the page that reads, "There may be 9 players..." was open to interpretation. The illustration shows a baseball team that has a set number of positions, but students decided to include team in the herd category. The word, they reasoned, doesn't necessarily imply a specific number of players.<P>

<H3>Step 4</H3>
I have my class create our own Only One books. To get the publication process rolling, I ask students to 
brainstorm ideas for our book and record their suggestions on the board under either the Dime or Herd heading.<P>

<H3>Step 5</H3>
Once we have a dozen or so examples (including larger numbers as well as several from which to count down by ones), students decide which number to use to kick off our book and which number to use to start counting down by ones.<P>


<A NAME="intermediate"></A>
<H2>Rusty's Intermediate Lesson</H2>
<EM>A Million Fish...More or Less</EM> by Patricia C. McKissack (Knopf, 1992) is a tale of adventure and 
one-upmanship set in a Louisiana bayou. Hugh Thomas doesn't know what to make of the whopper stories his friends Papa-Daddy and Elder Abbajon tell him. Are his friends telling the truth? Before Hugh has the chance to figure it out, he finds himself alone in the middle of a bayou where he catches three small fish, and then . . .a million more! To match the tales that Papa-Daddy and Elder Abbajon have been telling, Hugh conjures up an action-packed story complete with tangles with alligators and raccoon bandits.<P>

<H3>Step 1</H3>
After reading the book to my fifth/sixth graders, I return to the part of the story where Hugh throws half of his catch back. To check students' number sense, I ask: If Hugh really had a million fish and threw half back, how many fish would he be left with? I give students time to talk in small groups and then ask for volunteers to give and explain their answers.<P>

<H3>Step 2</H3>
For students who aren't comfortable thinking about halving one million, I have them look for patterns: "What is half of 10?" I record the answer on the board and then we continue incrementally as follows:<P>
<CENTER>
number | half<BR>
10 | 5<BR>
100 | 50<BR>
1,000 | 500<BR>
10,000 | 5,000<BR>
100,000 | 50,000<BR>
1,000,000 | 500,000<P>
</CENTER>
<H3>Step 3</H3>
I return to the part of the story where Hugh offers Mosley half of the fish he has left. I ask: How much is half of 500,000? I give children time to figure this out and have volunteers explain their solutions.<P>

<H3>Step 4</H3>
I build the next part of the lesson on the exaggerations in the story, using several examples. First, I reread: 
"Take the time back in '03 me and Elder here caught a wild turkey weighed five hundred pounds!" I say to 
students: Five hundred couldn't be the number of pounds a turkey weighs, but it could be . . . I leave the last part of the sentence for students to complete, writing down several suggestions. Next, I reread the part of the story in which Hugh jumped 5,553 times in a jump-rope contest. I say: Maybe 5,000 isn't the number of times a person jumps rope, but it could be . . . Again, I leave the sentence for students to finish.<P>

<H3>Step 5</H3>
I write on the board: "_______ could not be the number of _______, but it could be the number of _______." and ask students to suggest numbers we could use to begin the sentence. (Students have suggested numbers ranging from 3 to 1,000,000.) Then I have children pick a number, use it to complete the sentence, and illustrate their work.<P>

<H3>Step 6</H3>
After students share their completed sentences--explaining why the number they chose is reasonable for some things but unreasonable for others--we bind their papers into a class book.<P>

<H2>Help Students Develop Standards for<BR>
Evaluating Their Work</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF="../info/advisers.html#henry">Jim Henry</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

Portfolios have been part of my first-grade classroom for years, but recently I took portfolio assessment to the next stage by guiding my students to develop their own standards for evaluating their work and deciding what goes into their portfolios. Here's how we did it.<P>

<A NAME="portfolios"></A>
<H3>To Portfolios and Beyond</H3>
I moved toward portfolio assessment in my first-grade classroom when I realized that the kind of learning that 
was taking place could not be measured by unit tests and worksheets. My students were involved in problem 
solving. They were developing an understanding that there were often many ways to get to an answer and often many correct answers to a problem. In language arts, my students were choosing their own writing projects to work on and sharing their work with others.  I valued this learning greatly, and I sought a form of assessment that could capture some of this magic. Portfolio assessment seemed the perfect solution.<P>

Initially, I was thrilled with our portfolio system; my students' individual accordion folders bulged with projects.
 I panicked in February, however, when, while preparing students for a second round of portfolio sharing with 
their parents, I discovered that their writing wasn't improving. There was more of it, but there was little change in quality.<P>

My students needed to develop an awareness of the characteristics of effective writing. I knew that I couldn't just dump a list of writing characteristics on them. To be meaningful, the writing criteria had to come from them.<P>

<A NAME="modeling"></A>
<H3>Modeling Self-Assessment</H3>
I keep my own portfolio of many of the projects that I created with the kids during writing sessions. I've saved 
poems, songs, letters, nonfiction, and fiction, including our rendition of stories with highly predictable texts.<P>

Sitting before my class, I emptied out my portfolio for all to see. I hadn't looked at the selections for a while, and I referred to them in a manner similar to how one might recollect old friends. I told the kids how I loved all these projects, and that they were all good. But, I told them, even though they were all good, some were a little more special to me than others. Then I  labeled three index cards: Good, Very Good, and Excellent. We discussed the words, then I decorated each card with crayons and taped them to the chalkboard to serve as headings.<P>

I then reviewed each project and placed them under one of the headings. Students heard me thinking the 
process aloud (I tried not to divulge formal criteria for my decisions-we'd get to that later) and soon wanted to 
make decisions for me, but I told them that these decisions were mine. I wanted them to understand that a 
portfolio is a self-assessment tool, and that the decisions involved belong to its owner.<P>

<A NAME="selfassess"></A>
<H3>Students Self-Assess</H3>
I gave a set of the three labeled index cards--which I prepared ahead of time--to each student to decorate. Soon the class was happily decorating the headings. I invited them to evaluate their portfolio projects, and students began poring over their portfolios, asking one another for advice. The conversations were rich with comparisons. I walked around the room and asked questions about their decisions.<P>

Kneeling beside Todd's desk, I glanced at his journal entry about a family trip to the zoo. It was filled with
 sentence fragments and missing capital letters. I asked him why he had placed this under the excellent heading. With a huge grin he answered that his visit to the zoo was one of the greatest days of his life. I realized then that the criteria we would develop as a class would have to reflect far more than my mechanics-oriented goals. <P>

<A NAME="classchart"></A>
<H3>Developing A Class Chart</H3>
After everyone had sorted their work into three piles, I wrote the three headings at the top of a sheet of chart 
paper. "What's the difference between an excellent project and a good one?" I asked. "What would you need to do to change a very good project into an excellent one?"<P>

The children began to look at their portfolio selections with a more critical eye. "My excellent projects have color in their drawing," one student offered. "My handwriting is better in these," said another. "[My excellent pieces] are longer. I spent more time working on them," said a third child. With each student's comment, children glanced back at their work and reevaluated their decisions based on the unfolding criteria of their peers.  However, I began to sense that students were devaluing projects that they hadn't deemed excellent. I reaffirmed the worth of the "nonexcellent" efforts by pointing out that many of these projects were rough drafts.<P>

We continued to make observations about the characteristics of effective writing, recording our ideas on the 
chart paper. We made inferences: If an excellent project had all correct spelling, what might a very good project have? And how many misspelled words could a good project have? We agreed that an excellent project should have no spelling mistakes. My first graders raised their hands, eager to contribute to the discussion. I knew then that their writing would never be the same.<P>

<A NAME="adding"></A>
<H3>Adding to the Chart</H3>
For the rest of the year, our chart grew as students refined their ideas about effective writing. The students went about adding to the chart in a grassroots, democratic way that went beyond my expectation. For example, at one point during an informal portfolio conference with me, a student commented that all of her excellent projects had illustrations that used more than one color. She then recommended to the class that this characteristic be added to the chart. Another student picked up a copy of <EM>Blueberries for Sal</EM> by Robert McCloskey and said that this was an excellent book and that it had only one color. After discussion, the students decided that not every excellent project had to have every excellent characteristic from the chart.<P>

<A NAME="longterm"></A>
<H3>Long Term Benefits</H3>
The writing criteria my students hammered out thoroughly infused their work and their thinking. During class 
portfolio sharing, students often referred to the project they were presenting as excellent or very good, and 
articulated their reasons for thinking this. And I often observed students evaluating their projects with their three cards laid out on their desk. To ensure that the writing criteria stayed fresh in their minds, we formally did the index card activity each quarter.<P>

I still have questions about the proper role of portfolio assessment in a first-grade classroom. Nonetheless, this process has provided my students and me with an opportunity to develop writing criteria.<P>

<H2>Performance Assessment for Reading</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF="#fiderer">Adele Fiderer</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

When I first began using literature to teach reading in my fourth-grade classroom, I encouraged my students to choose their own books, read them independently, and periodically write and talk to me about what they were reading. In time we developed portfolios of their best work for reading and writing. Yet I had a nagging feeling that some key element was missing from the assessment process. I searched for a way to measure 
comprehension that would support the natural act of reading and responding to a story and allow for diverse 
interpretations. By reading professional literature, I discovered performance assessments. Here's the process 
I use now.<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#text">Select a Text</A>
<LI><A HREF="#prompts">Provide Writing Prompts</A>
<LI><A HREF="#rubrics">Work with Scoring Rubrics</A>
<LI><A HREF="#sample">Sample Rubric</A>
<LI><A HREF="#beyond">Beyond Reading: Assessing Social Studies</A>
<LI><A HREF="#turn">Your Turn</A>
</UL>

<A NAME="text"></A>
<H3>Select a Text</H3>
The performance assessment I use for reading comprehension two or three times a year requires a common 
reading and writing task for the entire class. The first step is to select a text that your students have not read--a 
good story with a significant theme appropriate for your grade level, a clearly identifiable problem and resolution, well-developed characters, and high interest for your students.<P>

<A NAME="prompts"></A>
<H3>Provide Writing Prompts</H3>
Once you have selected a text, think about designing a prompt--or writing task--to which students can respond in writing. If you teach primary children, encourage the use of invented spellings or approximations to help them freely express their ideas. Create a task that gets students to really think about the story. Then, along with sheets of lined paper on which they will write their final ideas, provide students with prewriting organizers such as webs, maps, and Venn diagrams, or lists of questions so students can make notes about their ideas. It's also a good idea to allow plenty of time--perhaps two class periods--for students to complete the performance assessment. Here are some sample writing prompts.<P>
<UL>
<LI>For primary students: Think about how you would tell a friend this story. Use a story map outline to help you remember all the important parts of a story. Then write about the story on lined paper.<P>
<LI>For middle and upper elementary students: Characters, like people in real life, often change as a result of events. First use your planning sheets to make notes about:<BR>
-- what the character was like at the beginning of the story,<BR>
-- what the character was like at the end of the story, and<BR>
-- the events and people that led the character to change.<BR>
Now use lined paper to write about how the character changed.<P>
<LI>For students in any grade: Write about an important problem in the story. Tell why it is important and how it was solved. First, make notes on the planning sheet. Then, once you've organized your thoughts, write about the story on lined paper.
</UL>

<A NAME="rubrics"></A>
<H3>Work with Scoring Rubrics</H3>
To evaluate students's performance assessments, you need to rely on your own impressions of each child's 
performance and on a rubric-a table with numerical ratings and explanations of the characteristics of each
 number on the rating scale. For example, <A HREF="#sample">the rubric I use</A> provides a scale of 0-3 to evaluate children's writings about a story problem.<P>
With practice, you will find that scoring is a quick and reliable task, but there are a few things you should know about the process. When reading a student's response, refer to the rubric frequently. Ask yourself which descriptions best match the student's work, but keep in mind that there is some variation. For example, some papers might be a high 3, others a middle 3, and some a low 3. For this reason, you may wish to use pluses or minuses to make finer distinctions.<P>

Whichever scoring system you use, focus only on the criteria in the rubric and avoid comparing students' papers. When in doubt, refer to the child's prewriting organizer. Younger children may write more on an organizer than on a blank sheet because it is a more directed task.<P>

<A NAME="sample"></A>
<H3>Sample Rubric</H3>
Notice that the rubric focuses on three important features you can modify to evaluate a wide variety of written 
responses in just about any curriculum area. Whatever rubric you develop, be sure to explain the criteria to your students before they begin to write. Knowing your expectations in advance will help most students produce better work.<P>

3-The written response is complete. It indicates a very good understanding of the story and its problem, and 
provides accurate, and relevant details, information, and supportive reasoning.<P>

2-The response is partial and indicates a fairly good understanding of the story. Although the information 
selected includes mostly accurate details and ideas, some may be irrelevant or unrelated to the story's problem. <P>
1-The response is fragmentary and indicates only minimal understanding of the story's problem. It includes 
mainly random details and irrelevant information.<P>

0-There is little or no response. Inaccurate and irrelevant details and ideas indicate a serious misunderstanding of the story.<P>

<A NAME="beyond"></A>
<H3>Beyond Reading: Assessing Social Studies</H3>
Developing performance assessments in social studies--or any subject area for that matter--is a process much like the one I described for reading comprehension. Look for interesting nonfiction stories and articles that relate to your students' studies in history and social studies. (<EM>Cobblestone</EM>, <EM>Faces</EM>, and S<EM>cholastic News</EM> magazines are three good story resources.) Then design a prewriting organizer and a writing prompt that challenges students to think in-depth about the subject. Create a rubric for scoring the writing.<P>

For example, as part of a study of immigration, sixth graders read "The Letters of Rosie O'Brien, a convict in
 New South Wales" (<EM>Cobblestone</EM>, April and May 1987). On one side of the planning sheet, students listed words and phrases that they felt described Rosie. On the other side of the sheet they provided evidence from the story that backed up their opinions. The students were then asked to use their knowledge of Rosie's character to write a letter from Rosie to her sister.<P>

<H2>5 Tricky Personalities--and How to Handle Them</H2>
<H3>Use positive behavior management to keep even "difficult" students focused on learning this year.<P>
By <A HREF ="#rogers">Bill Rogers</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

Like every teacher, I know how crucial a task it is to develop the smooth running of a class. In my work in Australia and around the world, I've seen over and over again what a feat it can be to take 25 or more students of mixed ability, background, and temperament and build a cooperative, rights-respecting group. Certain kinds of student behavior--common to every classroom but maddening nonetheless--make that task even more challenging. But I've discovered that even the most difficult classroom personalities respond to positive discipline that balances rights and responsibilities.<P>

In this article you'll find strategies that work for the following personality types:<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#chatterbox">The Chatterbox</A>
<LI><A HREF="#clinger">The Clinger</A>
<LI><A HREF="#boycotter">The Boycotter</A>

</UL>
You'll also have a chance to <A HREF="#turn">share your questions and suggestions</A> on handling the tricky personalities in your class.

<A NAME="chatterbox"></A>
<H3>The Chatterbox</H3>
In a classroom, as I am observing, the teacher is explaining a point on the board prior to group activities, one student turns to another and begins whispering.<P>

<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Lisa and Emma, I'm trying to teach!"<BR>
<STRONG>Lisa:</STRONG> "I wasn't talking. Geez!"<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Lisa, I saw you talking to Emma. Don't talk while I'm teaching. Pay attention."<BR>
<STRONG>Lisa:</STRONG> "C'mon, Emma just asked me about the work!"<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Look--I don't care who said what.<BR>
(The teacher is naturally becoming irritated, especially by Lisa's tone and body language.)<BR>
<STRONG>Lisa:</STRONG> "But, Emma--"<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Lisa!"  This loud response is followed by "One more word and I'll. . ." or a stand-up lecture: "I'm sick and tired of. . ." Either way, there is collateral damage.<P>


<STRONG>Strategies To Use</STRONG>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Give a positive direction or reminder, followed by thanks.</STRONG> Focus on the desired behavior, rather than the behavior you don't want; for example, "One at a time" or "Remember our rule for manners" rather than "Don't butt in!" Keep the directions brief; avoid dwelling on the problem. In addition, I find it effective to use "thanks" rather than "please," even when correcting, because it communicates compliance with the behavioral objective <P>

<LI><STRONG>Choose your tone of voice and body language.</STRONG> How we're heard by students depends greatly on our characteristic nonverbal behavior. Saying the phrase "Walking quietly, thanks" in a sarcastic tone of voice while wagging a finger in students' faces will nullify your positive words. Keep control of your tone of voice, eye contact, proximity to the student, and body language.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Try a strategic pause.</STRONG> When teachers want to initiate and sustain attention, thoughtful use of the pause can help. A pause before giving the necessary direction conveys the expectation that the students look toward you, listen, and subsequently respond. When a teacher calls across the room to two students talking, "Lisa, Emma, what are you doing?," they may only hear their names mentioned, not the question that follows. It's better to start with the student's name (in a firmer tone), followed by a pause for attentive effect, then the direction.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Keep the focus on the primary issue by knowing how to redirect.</STRONG> If we ask talkative students to face the front and listen during instructional time, we are addressing primary behavior--that aspect of behavior that is primarily affecting our right to teach and others' right to learn. If they argue or sulk as a result, this behavior is secondary to the main issue of talking out of turn. Redirecting is a way of keeping the focus on the rule, the right, or the direction at hand rather than being drawn into secondary issues. You can do this by partially agreeing--dignifying the students' feelings--and then quickly shifting the focus back to the primary point.
</OL>

<STRONG>Strategies In Action</STRONG><BR>
Lisa and Emma are chatting privately, distracting others while the teacher is explaining the assignment. The teacher stops talking. She knows that sometimes a sustained pause alone will be enough to trigger students' attention--but not this time. So she directs the girls to face the front and listen: "Emma..., Lisa..., facing this way and listening, thanks."  Lisa, miffed, says, "But we were only talking about the work." The teacher is not interested, at this point, in the veracity of this statement. She redirects, "Maybe you were, but I want you to face the front and listen, thanks. You'll need to know this stuff."  The teacher turns her attention to the rest of the class and resumes the task instructions as Lisa sulks--but quietly.<P>

<A NAME="clinger"></A>
<H3>The Clinger</H3>
Next, we go to a primary-grade class, during a story-writing activity around the children's tables. Halid calls out across the room.<P>

<STRONG>Halid:</STRONG> "Miss, Miss, I need you."<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Just a minute, Halid."<BR>
<STRONG>Halid:</STRONG> "But Miss, I don't know what we're supposed to do next!"<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Look, I can't be in two places at once, can I?"<BR>
<STRONG>Halid:</STRONG> (beginning to whine) "But Miss. . ."<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Oh, all right!" She goes over to help him, reinforcing the unhelpful association that when he calls out, she will always attend to him.<P>

<STRONG>Strategies To Use</STRONG>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Start with tactical ignoring.</STRONG> Tactical ignoring is a teacher's conscious decision to ignore certain behavior and keep the focus on the flow of the lesson, or on acknowledging and reinforcing positive behavior. Students notice what the teacher does attend to--students who follow the rule and put their hand up and wait-and they often follow suit.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Combine simple directions/reminders with hand signals.</STRONG> If tactical ignoring doesn't work and the student's behavior affects other students' right to learn or your right to teach, try a simple direction or reminder: "Hands up without calling out, thanks" or "Remember our class rule."  To reinforce or sometimes replace verbal directions, hand signals can be very effective--particularly if you've established them at the beginning of the year. For example, try a blocking hand to signal that a student should wait, or remind a child of the "hands-up" rule by raising one hand and putting the other to your mouth.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Give children alternatives.</STRONG> Establish a routine of "Ask three before you ask me" unless the assigned task is purely an individual one. Encourage students to help one another with procedures and to conference quietly at their tables, turning to you for help only as a last resort.
</OL>

<STRONG>Strategies In Action</STRONG><BR>
During an art activity in a primary class, I move around the room chatting to students about the clay shapes they've made. At one table while conversing with a student, another opposite me starts pulling my clothes: "Hey, look at this, look at this--mine!" I could look; I could tell him off. Instead, I choose to tactically ignore. Eventually he gives up, raises his hand, and waits. Had he not, I would have shown a blocking hand, said 
"Waiting," and immediately given my attention back to the first student. In either case, as soon as I finish with the first student, if I turn to see the second still waiting quietly, I'll go enthusiastically to see his work.<P>

Across the hall, the third graders are hard at work on their mapping project--all except David, who sits  staring glumly into space. His teacher knows he can do the work-that's what drives her crazy.<P>

<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "David, why aren't you working?"<BR>
<STRONG>David:</STRONG> (sighs) "I dunno."<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Is there a problem with the assignment?"<BR>
<STRONG>David:</STRONG> "Yeah . . .geography is boring."<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Boring, eh? Well, that's too bad. You'll just have to sit there and be bored until that map is done. . . I don't care if it takes all day!"<BR>
David hunkers down for the duration. The power struggle is on.<P>

<STRONG>Strategies To Use</STRONG>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Give students a choice--with consequences attached.</STRONG> When students procrastinate or avoid tasks, give a directed choice/consequence. "If you choose not to do the work now, you will need to do it during free time" works especially well if free time normally involves activities such as board games, personal projects, or computer activities. The language of choice conveys the impression to students that their behavior is their responsibility and that they have some control over how they behave.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Provide take-up time.</STRONG> Take-up time refers to the time a teacher gives a student to respond to corrective discipline.  After giving a direction or a reminder to a particular child, the teacher may conduct a relaxed eye-sweep of the entire group or turn away to attend to another student. In doing so, she conveys the expectation that the student will do what she has directed. This allows students to save face while they comply and permits teachers to avoid unnecessary, prolonged confrontations.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Reestablish the relationship.</STRONG> When you've given a correction and the student has complied--however grudgingly--it is important to go back later in the lesson and reestablish your relationship. You can do this with a positive whisper ("Nice to see you hard at work...") or even just a smile and an okay sign. It is reassuring to the child that, beyond the correction, his relationship with you is still okay; he is still accepted. A brief thanks or an acknowledgment says "I noticed your effort" and conveys that no grudges are held.<P>

Let's backtrack to near the beginning of the exchange between David and his teacher.<P>

<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "David...if you choose not to do your work now, you'll need to do it at recess."<BR>
<STRONG>David:</STRONG> "It's not fair." He folds his arms and sulks.<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Perhaps not, but that's your choice."<BR>
She walks away, giving David take-up time. Grumpily, David resumes his work half a minute later when he thinks she's not watching (though she can still see him in her peripheral vision). Just after the recess bell rings, she speaks to him again.<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "I'm glad you made the right choice, David." She pats his arm as he goes off to play.<P>

<A NAME="debater"></A>
<H3>The Debater</H3>
In every school there are students who challenge teachers, who answer back and want the last word. They have ten reasons and explanations why it wasn't them, why it isn't fair, why the teacher always picks on them. The disconcerting reality is that a lot of the arguments between teacher and student begin on such petty issues, as we see in this upper-grade class.<P>

<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Jason, why aren't you at your desk?"<BR>
<STRONG>Jason:</STRONG> "I'm only borrowing a ruler from Dimi. Geez!"<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Look, don't lie to me. You were not getting a ruler. I saw you. (The teacher is becoming angry as he sees the grin surface on Jason's face that says, I'm conning you.) I'm sick and tired of your behavior!"<BR>
<STRONG>Jason:</STRONG> "How do you know, anyway, whether I was getting a ruler or not? You can ask Dimi." (He folds his arms in megahuff mode. The whole class is watching.)<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "You think you're so smart, don't you. Well, let me tell you . . ."<P>

Here begins a mini-lecture that sees Jason slouch back to his chair, fuming. Still smarting from the previous fracas, the teacher interprets Jason's leaning back in his chair with a scowl on his face as blatant disrespect. He goes over and challenges the student.<P>

<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "What do you think you're doing now, eh?"<P>

<STRONG>Strategies To Use</STRONG>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Distinguish primary from secondary behavior.</STRONG> When Jason's teachers describe him as a problem child, what they are referring to is the sum of his secondary behavior, which has more emotional weight than the primary behavior that precedes it. Even a mere "Yes!" in reply to a teacher's question can be annoying to both ear and eye. It is easy, even natural, to overreact or overfocus on students' secondary behavior--much more so if we impute inherent malignancy into their tone, manner, and words. Keep your focus on the primary behavior, at least for the moment.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Avoid unnecessary power struggles.</STRONG> While we can't directly control the argumentative student, we can control how we deal with the conflict. Reactive and defensive correction, especially when body language is hostile, extends the conflict and changes the behavioral focus away from the original direction or question. Students may play out their power struggle in front of an ever-accommodating audience of peers. Remain assertive but civil, redirect the student to the primary issue (see <A HREF="#chatterbox">The Chatterbox</A>), and don't capitulate to secondary behavior by discussion, argument, or adversarial tactics.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Plan a follow-up.</STRONG> While it works to your advantage to tactically ignore the debater's secondary behavior in the heat of the moment, that doesn't mean you must let it go altogether--particularly if the child makes a habit of such behavior. Plan a follow-up discussion after class, during which you can explain (even demonstrate) to the student what the secondary behavior looks and sounds like and how it affects mutual rights. See <A HREF="#sulker">The Sulker</A> for more on follow-up chats.<P>

In another upper-grade class, I noticed Bradley hadn't started his work. I walked over and casually asked, "Bradley, I notice that you haven't started.  Any problems?" I was pleasant. To his response, "Yeah, well, I haven't got a pen, have I?" I replied, "That's okay. You can borrow one of mine." (Whenever I teach an upper-grade class, I take pens, pencils, rulers, and erasers with me--preventive management). He muttered something, then said moodily, dropping his voice and eyes, "Yeah, well, I haven't got a ruler, have I?" Here I pointed to the box of materials on the teacher's desk:  "You can borrow one of mine." His voice took on a frustrated edge as he said, "Yeah, well, I haven't got any paper. Gee!" Poor chap! I was disrupting his game. I was tempted to be sarcastic, but I said, "There's paper on my desk, as well." I pointed. "I'll come and see how you're doing later." Faced with this last helpful comment, he swore under his breath.  As I moved away I saw him go to the teacher's desk to find what he needed. Later in the lesson, I gave him some encouragement that he received with controlled grunts. It's hard 
being civil.<P>

Veronica is a popular, bright fifth grader. While she generally completes her work, her teachers inevitably describe her as having an attitude problem. In my first teaching session with her class, I noticed Veronica would wander from her seat during class time and chat with other students. I tactically ignored this for a while, then directed her to go back to her own desk. "Geez!" she responded (eyes rolling to the ceiling, followed by a sibilant sigh). "I was only borrowing an eraser from Michelle." Here a punctuated <EM>tsk tsk</EM> and averted eyes finished her sulky retort--typical secondary behavior. Almost every time I corrected her, even with simple reminders, this would occur. In class, I redirected and defused most of this behavior but finally decided that something more was needed.<P>

<STRONG>Strategies To Use</STRONG>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Schedule a follow-up chat, after school if necessary.</STRONG> This kind of brief chat, with the door open for ethical probity, is designed to clarify what is happening during class time regarding students' behavior. It is essential that we convey to students that their habitual secondary behavior is unacceptable in terms of classroom rights and responsibilities. Such chats are at their most persuasive in the establishment phase of the year, acting as a "nip in the bud" approach-the message being that the teacher will always follow up on certain behavior after class time.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Time your invitation effectively.</STRONG> If teachers want to follow up with students after class for a chat, it is good policy to give the direction to stay back just before the recess bell. This avoids any prolonged discussions based on "What for?" "Why me?" or "What have I done?"<P>

<LI><STRONG>Keep your presentation positive.</STRONG> It is important to remember that our correction, guidance, and repair of strained relationships occurs within a working relationship. Keep the tone positive and friendly, and avoid threatening body language such as the extended finger. Better to talk with than to talk at.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Offer to mirror the problem behavior.</STRONG> Many students are quite unaware of how their secondary behavior appears. They certainly don't see it as we do. Teachers often interpret such behavior as rudeness and as an attack on their status. While it is rude, in our value judgment, it's really poor social skills, bad habits, or the student's gambit for attention or power within the class group. When we mirror what we see in their behavior and then explain our feelings and refer them to the class rule for respect or fair treatment, at the very least we've clarified what we mean by rudeness, and that such behavior affects working relationships.<P>

Just before the recess bell, I directed Veronica to stay back after class for a few minutes. "What for?" was her injured-party reply. I ignored this and dismissed the class. As the class left, Veronica folded her arms and slouched against the wall. I asked Veronica if there was a problem in class.<P>

<STRONG>Veronica:</STRONG> (eyes down, subdued sulkiness) "Nope."<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Maybe you're feeling annoyed or upset because I've asked you to stay back?"<BR>
<STRONG>Veronica:</STRONG> "Yeah. What did I do?"<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Do you remember when I asked you to go back to your own desk? Do you remember what you did 
and said?"<BR>
Veronica gave me marginal eye contact at this point. <BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Do you mind if I show you what you said?"<BR>
<STRONG>Veronica:</STRONG> "What?"<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Let me show you." <P>

Here I mirrored to her the postural, gestural, and tonal behavior I'd seen and heard that morning, complete with the tossed head and the hurt look to suggest gross unfairness on my part. As I gave the brief demonstration and came out of role and smiled, Veronica fought back an involuntary grin and said, "I don't do that all the time." "No, that's true," I replied, "but you do act like that many times. I don't speak like that to you, Veronica. When you speak like that, it shows disrespect because of the tone and the way you say it."<P>

<STRONG>Veronica:</STRONG> "Yeah, well, I didn't mean it."<BR>
<STRONG>Teacher:</STRONG> "Okay, maybe you didn't mean it, but that's what you said and that's how it sounded."<P>

At this point, some students give a cursory apology. Avoid saying, "You're not really sorry, are you?" Accept the apology with a reminder of the school rule about respect.<P>

<H2>How To Teach Children About Living in a World with Violence</H2>
<H3>A step-by-step guide--Plus answers to your questions</H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

Violence in today's world runs the gamut from bullying to murder, and finds fertile ground in television programs, movies, videos, and superhero games, where it's gussied up and glamorized. Violence is all around us, and it's taking its toll on children.<P>

According to former teacher and child-development expert Dr. James Garbarino, exposure to violence in any 
form leaves many young children feeling scared, hopeless, and unsafe--even in their own homes. Others develop a pattern of aggressive behavior or carry a burden of discomfort that weighs heavily on their young minds.<P>

To help children understand violence and find ways to live with greater peace, in this article you'll find:<P>

<A NAME="answers"></A>
<H3>Answers to Your Questions About Children and Violence</H3>
How does violence affect children? How can teachers help? To get the answers to these and other questions, <EM>Instructor</EM> senior editor <A HREF="../info/editors.html#bozzone">Meg Bozzone</A> interviewed child-development expert Dr. James Garbarino.<P>

<STRONG>Why is violence an issue teachers need to address?</STRONG><BR>
Every child today is affected by violence at home, on the streets, in the media--somewhere. Kids bring the effects of that exposure with them into the classroom. No teacher can afford to close his or her eyes to this.<P>

<STRONG>What are signs of exposure to traumatic violence?</STRONG><BR>
There are few obvious and unambiguous symptoms. Aggressive behavior is one. Others include: repeated 
nightmares; recounting violence in an emotionally numb tone; reenacting a horrible event; having extremely 
startled reactions; or expressing diminished expectations for the future.<P>

If a student recounts or reenacts violence, you might try to discover the source of this behavior by asking: Is this something you saw on TV? Heard about? Remember from a dream? Report what you learn to the mental-health services in your school so the child can get therapeutic help.<P>

<STRONG>Are some children more affected by violence than others? </STRONG><BR>
Although all children are susceptible, some are more vulnerable than others. Children are less likely to be
 affected if, for example, they have one or more of the following: a strong, positive attachment to at least one
 loving adult; average or above average intelligence; an active rather than passive or withdrawn coping style;
 and behavior patterns that are not rigidly sex stereotyped.<P>

Children who do not have one or more of these qualities are more vulnerable. Kids are most at risk if they 
experience violence in the home or in more than one domain of their lives--such as both in the home and in the community. Some emotionally disabled children are also more vulnerable to soaking up the violence they see.<P>

<STRONG>Can you explain more about the relationship between violence and aggressive behavior?</STRONG><BR>
It's rare for children who are not exposed to violence to become aggressive. Aggression is a learned behavior
 with serious consequences. For example, by age eight, patterns of aggression can become well-established in children, and unless these kids receive intervention, the odds increase that they will become aggressive or 
violent adults. Research reveals that children who are most at risk for developing a serious problem are those who are identified by their own peers as being highly aggressive.<P>

<STRONG>Can pretend violence affect kids in the same way as real violence?  </STRONG><BR>
Research tells us that exposure to televised or film violence is like smoking. Here's how the analogy goes: 
Although some people may smoke for years without exhibiting any obvious ill effects, that doesn't mean that 
smoking is not bad for their health. At relatively low levels in relatively healthy people, the insidious and harmful effects of smoking may not be noticeable right away. However, if you examine a large sample of people, you'll find that the damaging effects of smoking--or effects of watching Hollywood violence--are there and that they get worse over time.<P>

Also, children who have first-hand experience with real violence in their lives are more immediately and severely affected by make-believe violence.<P>

<STRONG>Can aggressive play get violence out of kids' systems?</STRONG><BR>
Kids who develop a pattern of real aggressive behavior seem less able to engage in fantasy aggressive
 behavior. For example, if they start acting out violent fantasies with Power Rangers, their play tends to escalate into real violence. And Power Rangers teaches about only one kind of power--aggression. It doesn't teach about caring, reasoning, and helping.<P>

<STRONG>Can talking and teaching about violence scare children? </STRONG><BR>
It is my experience that you can talk about almost any topic with children if you approach it correctly. So it's not a matter of whether or not you should broach the subject of violence, but how to broach it. Although young children are very concrete, using visual images is too powerful and intense for them. Children should learn and hear about violence in child-size doses and in terms they can understand.<P>

<STRONG>What's the best way to introduce the topic to kids?</STRONG><BR>
For starters, your best bet is to answer children's questions at a child's level and create opportunities to find out if there are issues on children's minds that they are not bringing up spontaneously. <A HREF="#letstalk"><EM>The Let's Talk About Living in a World with Violence</EM> workbook</A> (adapted in the <A HREF="#guide">7-Step Activity Guide to Teaching About Violence</A>) does this in a structured, educational way. It's also been pretested extensively to make sure that its content doesn't scare kids. If you start from scratch with a topic like this, you'll probably spend a lot of time and energy reinventing the wheel or may even inadvertently stumble into dangerous waters you're not prepared to navigate.<P>

<STRONG>Most teachers have not been trained to teach about violence. What advice can you give 
them? </STRONG><BR>
Sit down with colleagues; talk about your own experiences and fears, and concerns with and about violence;
 discuss how you intend to present the subject to kids; and try the <A HREF="#guide">7-Step Activity Guide</A>. It is important for colleagues to use one another as sounding boards when a local incident or national tragedy has raised the level of anxiety. Even when no recent act has heightened children's and adults' fears, it's still wise to invest time discussing the topic. Should some incident then occur, you'll be more prepared to discuss it with your students.<P>

You don't need to be scared of the topic, because if you address it in an educational way, you can bring the 
rest of your classroom-tested teaching skills to bear and incorporate lessons about it into already existing plans. For example, in a fairy-tale unit, you'll find plenty of grist for your mill. The issue is embedded in many curriculum areas.<P>

<STRONG>Should teachers involve parents in the process?</STRONG><BR>
Yes. Teachers should let parents know that they're going to be doing an educational unit about aggression--or incorporating that theme into their curriculum, and give parents the opportunity to contact them if they want to know more.<P>

<STRONG>Are there potential problems in working with parents?</STRONG><BR>
There are two sticky issues to keep in mind. First, if the topic of violence in the family comes up, some parents may feel angry because either they insist on their right to use violence against their children in disciplining them or because they fear disclosure of an abusive situation. It's important to find out what your school's policy is on reporting suspected child abuse. Second, some parents may worry that their children will be upset, so teachers should let them know that they'll be talking about violence within an educational framework, not showing kids horrific images.<P>

<STRONG>Should teachers try to reach out to the community, too?</STRONG><BR>
Yes. Recently I spoke at an elementary school that has an advisory committee of teachers, parents, and 
community representatives. It gets the message out that aggression and violence need to be addressed in 
school, and pinpoints related issues affecting the community. Also, teachers should work with the PTA or PTO. 

<A NAME="preparing"></A>
<H3>Before You Begin: Preparing to Teach About Violence</H3>

Dr. Garbarino and teachers who use his approach suggest the following.<P>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Adapt the activities in the <A HREF="#guide">7-Step Activity Guide</A> to your own 
instructional program.</STRONG> These activities reinforce writing, reading, and discussion skills. Also, you 
may use them to address a range of social studies and character-education issues or to pave the way to 
teaching conflict resolution and mediation. Schedule class time over several weeks to give kids ample 
opportunity to work through the activities.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Do some background reading.</STRONG> If you are unfamiliar with research on violence, 
check out the <A HREF="#resources">resources</A> in this article.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Consider teaming up with a colleague or a group of teachers.</STRONG> Discuss your 
thoughts and feelings about violence, especially if these activities bring up painful feelings for you. As a group, anticipate tricky issues that may come up with your students, share your experiences as you use the activities, and brainstorm follow-up projects.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Anticipate suspicion from children and, perhaps, parents.</STRONG> Communicate to parents in advance that you will be teaching about violence, says Kathleen Perkins of McLean, New York: "I stress that we present the topic in a nonthreatening way and offer strategies to help kids deal with the frightening feelings they often experience." Keep in mind that some parents and their children may believe that authority figures--including police and teachers--are the source of violence. They may have had bad experiences with authority figures or be afraid of repercussions if they talk about violence. To help, schedule a classroom visit by a police representative who you know will make a positive impression. Invite parents, and use the occasion to spark a social studies discussion on social justice.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Give students a chance to talk about their experiences, their thoughts, and their feelings.</STRONG> It's important to let children voice their concerns and to accept what they say to you in a way that does not cut off dialogue. Try to understand what children are saying from their point of view, not yours. To help naturally foster discussions, you might try some of these activities with small groups and afterward invite children to share their thoughts with the whole group.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Be prepared to handle students' thoughts and feelings.</STRONG> For some children, the fear of violence is very intense-to the extent that they may find it difficult to complete some of the activities. If there is domestic violence at home, for example, a student may become defensive or try to skirt the issue. Be as gentle     and sensitive as you can and avoid embarrassing the child in front of his or her peers. Also, take steps so that children don't gang up on classmates whose lives are troubled.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Have children keep folders of their work.</STRONG> This is important so that students can 
reflect on these experiences.

<A NAME="guide"></A>
<H3>A 7-Step Activity Guide to Teaching About Violence</H3>
Here's how to establish a model for a dialogue about violence, adapted from <A HREF="#letstalk">
<EM>Let's Talk About Living in a World with Violence.</EM></A><P>

<STRONG>Step 1: Start simple.</STRONG> Tell students that over the next few weeks they'll be talking, writing, and drawing about violence. Emphasize that the goal is to learn to feel safe. Encourage kids to share what they learn with parents.<P>

<STRONG>Step 2: How do we define <EM>violence</EM>?</STRONG> To help students define the word, 
have them look up violence in dictionaries. Most likely students will find definitions--such as "great physical force"--that don't shed much light on the actual meaning.<P>

Then have students brainstorm and record a list of words they associate with violence,  individually, in groups, or as a class. At first students will most likely come up with words that describe physical violence--such as punching or shooting. Prompt them to consider verbal violence--such as yelling and swearing-and words that hurt, such as dummy, jerk, and so on. Afterward, ask students to create their own definition of violence using these words. Invite volunteers to read their definitions to the class.<P>

<STRONG>Step 3: How does violence feel?</STRONG> For many children it's difficult to express how violence makes them feel. To help them find the words, have them write or draw a picture of a story they know about someone getting hurt. Then ask students to describe the feelings associated with their stories--such as scared, mad, and nervous--and then discuss each feeling. Point out that although everyone experiences anger, it can lead to hurting if it's not resolved. Reassure kids that it's okay to feel scared, too.<P>

<STRONG>Step 4: Why do people hurt one another?</STRONG> The foremost question on children's minds is: Why? To help them find answers, have kids generate a list of possibilities beginning with the word sometimes. For example:  Sometimes people don't know why they hurt others;  Sometimes people are so angry they don't care who gets hurt;  Sometimes people want something and hurt others to get it. Discuss these situations.<P>

<STRONG>Step 5: Take a close-up look at make-believe violence.</STRONG> Begin a discussion of this topic by pointing out that often what we see on television or in the movies isn't real, but still can be frightening. Then ask: Can make-believe violence be funny? Do some people laugh because it makes them nervous? Then try the following.<P>
<OL>
<LI> Ask kids to guess how many times physical violence occurs on TV each hour in the evening (5) and during one hour of programming for kids (26). Have kids count the number of violent acts they see and then have them write about what they saw.<P>

<LI>Have children chart the most and least scary things they see on TV or in the movies during one week.<P>

<LI>Ask children to compile a list of characteristics of "good guys" and "bad guys." Ask: How do they solve 
problems? Is a good guy a hero? A bad guy a villain? Why?<P>

<LI>Have kids rewrite a favorite program without violence. Then talk about how to find less violent programs and movies.
</OL>

<STRONG>Step 6: Examine violence in the news.</STRONG> Bring several newspapers to class and ask 
students to circle photographs and words they think show and describe violence. Then ask kids to think of 
violence they have seen in the news on television.<P>

Tell students that one of the ways children who live in an area where something violent is happening cope with it is to draw about it. Have kids work through their feelings about a recent act of violence they saw in the news by drawing about it.<P>

<STRONG>Step 7: Violence comes close to home.</STRONG> Although some children feel safe in their
 neighborhoods, others feel as if they live in a danger zone. Ask each student to draw a map showing where he or she feels safe. Have kids make a list of adults in their neighborhood who they know they can talk to or turn to for help. Then ask: What would life be like if there were no guns or other weapons in their communities? Is it necessary to have guns to catch criminals? What if police didn't have guns?

<H2>How To Make Parents Your Homework Partners</H2>
<H3>by <A HREF="#dodge">Judy Dodge</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

For years I've been talking to parents about how to help children develop strong study habits. Often they'll say, "Why do we have to teach kids how to study? That's the school's job." And they're right. It is largely our responsibility, but parents have to help us out by creating a home environment that's conducive to kids getting their homework done.<P>
	
One of the best ways you can support parents in this goal is to give a workshop for them one evening, providing practical suggestions for winning the homework battle. The following is a workshop plan that I've used successfully with thousands of parents.<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#getting">Getting Started</A>
<LI><A HREF="survey.html">Parent Survey</A>
<LI><A HREF="#organization">Study Skills Area #1: Organization</A>
<LI><A HREF="#time">Study Skills Area #2: Time Management</A>
<LI><A HREF="#active">Study Skills Area #3: Active Study Strategies</A>
<LI><A HREF="#wrapup">Wrapping Up</A>
<LI><A HREF="#turn">Your Turn</A>
</UL>

<A NAME="getting"></A>
<H3>Getting Started</H3>
Photocopy and send home the <A HREF="survey.html">survey</A> along with an announcement flier stating the date, time, duration (60 to 90 minutes is best), and an explanation of how parents' attendance will benefit their kids. The survey will help you provide parents with the help they need most. To reach as many parents as possible, send home these sheets about three weeks in advance and request that the completed surveys be returned to you within a week.<P>

On the night of the workshop, after you thank parents for attending, break the ice by inviting them to share how they would define good study habits. Convey that study skills are learned abilities that enable students to systematically plan, access, organize, retrieve, and use information on their own.<P>

At this point, explain that this evening you are going to focus on the following three key study skill areas.<P>

<A HREF="#organization">Organizational skills</A>--critical to managing the business of school--put students in control and allow them to feel confident that they can handle whatever is asked of them.<P>

<A HREF="#time">Time-management skills</A> enable students to get their work done without feeling 
pressured and to still have free time.<P>

<A HREF="#active">Active study strategies</A> allow students to study more effectively.

<A NAME="organization"></A>
<H3>Study Skills Area #1: Organization</H3>
Here are three strategies for parents to help their kids stay on top of their homework.<BR>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Find a steady study spot.</STRONG> Point out to parents that kids should study in the same place each night, where they have at hand all the necessary materials--a dictionary, pencils, paper, and so on. This doesn't necessarily have to be the child's bedroom. In fact, in the early grades, it's not unusual for children to prefer to do homework near a parent, and this should be encouraged. Having the child close by provides a parent many opportunities to encourage time-on-task, to remind the child to do his or her neatest work, and to compliment the child for working for at least ten minutes without being distracted.<P>

<LI><STRONG>End the crumple-and-stuff filing system.</STRONG> Keeping track of daily assignments and papers in school is a difficult task for students in any grade. My favorite organizational tool to share with parents is a Homework/Travel Folder. In fact, you may wish to have one at the workshop for parents to see. To make one, label one side of a two-pocket folder "To Do" and label the other side "Done." The "To-Do" file stores worksheets, notices, tests, the student's homework assignment book, permission slips to be signed, and so on. By keeping all these take-home papers in one place, the end-of-the-day rush for the bus is less likely to result in stuff left at school. The "Done" pocket is home to completed assignments, returning report cards or quizzes, notes from parents, and so on. Once a week, parents should encourage their children to clean out their travel folders, filing work at home.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Keep visual organizers.</STRONG> Like 70 to 80 percent of students in any random group, I am a visual learner. And, like most picture-minded folks, I need charts, lists, schedules, and other graphic clues to help me remember what needs to be done. Help parents to help their kids remember by giving them a checklist like the one shown below. They can photocopy it and then post on the refrigerator.
</UL>

<A NAME="time"></A>
<H3>Study Skills Area #2: Time Management</H3>
For many students, getting homework done is a high-stress game of beat the clock. Here are six strategies to share with parents that will help kids make the most of their time.<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Set a definite study hour.</STRONG> Parents need to establish a time for kids to hit the books--whether it's 3:30, 5:00, or 7:30-and enforce the study time each day. There's a common misconception that the best homework/study time is right after school. While this might work well for a few students, I find that most children need to unwind from a busy day. Taking a break and having a snack refreshes and renews children.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Diminish distractions.</STRONG> Remind parents that they can help make study time more productive by creating a quiet atmosphere. Also, while it's important to keep to a regular dinner schedule, parents should be open to shifting the dinner hour slightly to accommodate a special homework assignment or study session before a test. By doing this, parents send kids the message that schoolwork is a priority.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Build in a breather.</STRONG> Let parents know that breaks are okay. In fact, breaks can increase students' productivity. Attention spans vary from child to child, often increasing as the child gets older. Parents know better than anyone how long their child is capable of sitting at one time.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Help sharpen kids' focus.</STRONG> Often children have trouble maintaining their attention because they underestimate how long their assignments will take to complete. One teacher I know helps her children be more realistic about time by working with them to approximate how long an assignment will take. For example, she points out that if one math word problem takes three minutes to solve, then five similar problems will take about 15 minutes. The next day in class, students discuss how long the assignment actually took. While simple, this exercise really helps kids become more aware of time.<P>
	
Encourage parents to help their children with this exercise and to use a timer with children who need additional help focusing. Students can set the timer for brief periods (even two to five minutes for students with short attention spans) and increase the intervals slowly as their ability to concentrate improves.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Watch for homework overload.</STRONG> How much homework is too much? Opinions vary, but research supports the rule of thumb that ten minutes per grade level is a developmentally appropriate amount of work for students. In other words, third graders should be given approximately 30 minutes of work, whereas sixth graders can handle about an hour. Encourage parents to contact you if they feel their child is overburdened by homework.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Stick to a regular bedtime.</STRONG> Kids who are not well-rested have a tougher time learning in school. When parents ensure that their children regularly get a good night's sleep, they succeed in one of the most crucial responsibilities. Suggest that parents could accomplish this by establishing a specific bedtime, enforcing it, and encouraging children to read before sleep.
</UL>

<A NAME="active"></A>
<H3>Study Skills Area #3: Active Study Strategies</H3>
To help parents help students conquer passive studying, study ruts, or pretest panic, share the following effective study strategies. You might even wish to develop several study-technique handouts for parents to take home. They'll really appreciate it. (Blank schedules, calendars, charts, and the like go over big with parents, too.)<P>

<STRONG>To help kids improve learning during studying, suggest they:</STRONG>
<OL>
<LI>recite, describe, explain aloud the topic in their own words;
<LI>draw and label a diagram, map, sketch, or chart from memory, and then check text for accuracy;
<LI>write questions they think will be on the test and recite their answers out loud, make a list of important concepts, write a set of flash cards; and
<LI>visualize a chart, diagram, word, map, event, time period, scene, experiment, or story character by closing their eyes and picturing it. 
</OL>

<A NAME="wrapup"></A>
<H3>Wrapping Up</H3>
I always end my workshop with a ten-minute question-and-answer period. I don't worry that parents may ask me a question that I won't be able to answer. If they do, I simply ask members of the audience what they have done in a similar situation. In fact, I invite parents to share with the group study-time strategies that are working for them.<P>
	
I challenge parents to implement one or two new ideas. I find this helps keep them from feeling pressured to put into action all the strategies they've learned. I let them know that perfecting one or two new strategies at a time is the best approach.<P>
	
To close my workshop, I thank parents for attending and give them any handouts I have.<P>

While planning and running a parent workshop may seem like a lot of work, I think you will find it's worth the effort. Your students will be more engaged, effective learners, and their parents will be much more likely to enter into a partnership with you for the benefit of their children.<P>

<H2>Unbeatable Ways to Reach Your LEP Students</H2>
<H3>Teachers share their strategies for teaching second-language learners in the regular classroom<P>
By <A HREF="#schall">Jane Schall</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

This year, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, at least one in six classes will have one or more Limited-English Proficient (LEP) students. And the number of LEP students is growing at a rate two-and-a-half times as fast as the general school population. These children contribute a great richness of diversity and cultural heritage to our schools and our classrooms, but at the same time they bring considerable challenges.<P>

In this article, voices of experience from around the country share how they meet the needs of their LEP 
students.<P>

<A NAME="quintana"></A>
<H3>Rosa Quintana's Winning Strategies</H3>
Rosa teaches 23 students with mixed proficiencies in English (at least nine of them speak only Spanish) in the regular classroom. For some of the day, children go to a pullout ESL program. Her colleague Marta Weiss and her husband team-teach 80 Spanish-speaking students with varying levels of English proficiency in the ESL classroom.  The amount of time children spend there depends on their needs and proficiency level. Because isolating LEP kids can make them feel different--and make English speakers feel they're different, too--the school creates a community atmosphere where all feel at home.<P>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Recruit native-speaking volunteers.</STRONG> "I speak my students' language, but if you don't," Marta recommends, "try to find someone from the community who can and is willing to come into the classroom. He or she can ask the LEP student questions for you so you can show interest in who the child is, and the volunteer can also speak to the class about the student's culture."<P>

Rosa gets her English-speaking students involved in learning some words in the LEP child's native language. This heightens the sense of community and validates the importance of each child's language. "Two-way learning builds friendships," she says. "Children learn to speak to each other because they want and need to."<P>

<LI><STRONG>Get to know children's culture and background.</STRONG> Marta recommends displaying books, pictures, and other objects that are familiar to the LEP children and all students. She has students trace their origins and involves families in helping each child mark where he or she is from on a large map posted in the regular classrooms. "The goal is for all students to understand that we all come from different places," Marta says. "We break down barriers."<P>

<LI><STRONG>Make personal-history books.</STRONG> Students in Marta's class make personal scrapbooks of their lives that include pictures of families, photographs of where they live and used to live, sketches of their pets, and varying numbers of words in English. These albums, she believes, help LEP students retain their identities. Children work on their scrapbooks throughout the year and Marta finds that their entries improve along with their understanding of English. Periodically, students share their scrapbooks and Marta talks about her personal history, too.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Build understanding through role reversals.</STRONG> Marta recommends inviting into the regular classroom a volunteer who speaks a language none of the children speak--or only one LEP child speaks--to present a lesson in that language. "We give no explanation to the students and keep this up for about 15 minutes. Kids get blown away," says Marta. "Everyone is reminded how difficult learning can be.  And if one child speaks that language, he or she can help others for a change."<P>

When children find out what they were being asked to do in the lesson, Marta says they generally chime: "We know how to do that!" Then she replies, "Of course you do. Just because you didn't understand doesn't mean you're not smart."<P>

<LI><STRONG>Enlist the aid of students who speak the child's language.</STRONG> Rosa asks a student who speaks the LEP child's language to help preview a story she plans to read with the class. The partner summarizes in three sentences what the story is going to be about, then afterward does a quick review of the beginning, middle, and end of the story.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Set up mentor pairs.</STRONG> Where's the bathroom? What are the rules? To help LEP students figure out crucial basics such as these,  Rosa pairs up students who may or may not speak  each other's language. Being a mentor can be very rewarding for a child who last year needed a mentor him- or herself. "We work very hard to establish a mutual sense of responsibility," affirms Rosa, "and try to build feelings of looking out for each other."<P>

<LI><STRONG>Constantly ask children for help in the classroom.</STRONG> Marta points and models the actions when she asks students: Would you get me the tape? Would you wash the board? The goal is to help children feel included, comfortable, and accustomed to the room. "If children get confused, others always pipe up to assist,"she says. "I encourage my entire class to be physical when describing things."<P>

<LI><STRONG>Use tape recorders.</STRONG> Children in Marta's class record themselves practicing English and then play it back. "Kids listen to the tapes at the end of the year so they can hear how they've changed," she says.  Also, she asks English-proficient students to tape-record sentences and common phrases for LEP students to practice repeating.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Make the most of body movements.</STRONG> The technique of Total Physical Response (TPR)-modeling through body language what you want students to understand-helps Rosa foster learning. "If you want to get across concepts such as above/below or over there, use your body," Rosa advises. Adds Marta, "Don't be afraid to take a few risks or to look silly as you pantomime something you want children to understand. Your approach can set a fun, relaxed tone for everyone."

<A NAME="clovis"></A>
<H3>Donna Clovis' Strategies for Kids of 21 Different Languages</H3>
Donna has 43 students who speak 21 different languages. Beginners--kids who don't speak any English whatsoever--are pulled out of class to practice speaking and listening, and are grouped according to the structure of their first language. (For example, students from Israel, Japan, and China learn the English alphabet together.) If at least five children are at an intermediate or advanced level, Donna goes into their classroom to assist during reading and/or writing. The goal is to mainstream students.<P>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG> Remember, a smile is universal.</STRONG>"In any language, a smile can go a long way to helping them feel accepted," says Donna.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Talk in a normal, patient, pleasant tone of voice.</STRONG> "Don't raise your voice or isolate words," Donna advises. "Children imitate the way you speak."<P>

<LI><STRONG>Read aloud.</STRONG> Poetry or anything that has a rhythm, Donna finds, helps LEP kids learn intonation. (Stories and poems that have patterns offer them opportunities to join in the repetition.) She also asks parents, other family members, or people from the community to translate the poems into their native languages. Then kids make a multilingual poetry anthology.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Allow students time to talk to one another.</STRONG> "You'll see kids first trying their language skills with one another while they play or interact in cooperative groups," Donna points out. "That's where you can begin to grasp how much they know. When you hear a child say: 'Give me the swing,' or 'I don't want to do this,' you may realize he or she knows more than you think."<P>

<LI><STRONG>Ask the class to copy sentences from the board.</STRONG> Donna has students copy material in every language represented in her room. "It's great if you have a language like Korean, because children can experience what it's like to try to write in another alphabet," she says," you can discuss such questions as: What made this difficult?"<P>
 
<LI><STRONG>Label objects in the room and use lots of visuals.</STRONG> This is especially important, Donna notes, for children whose language is based on a different alphabet. She posts photographs and lots of other images, too.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Ask students to help make picture cards to teach vocabulary.</STRONG> Each of the more proficient children in Donna's class chooses a particular word in a category such as classroom objects, food, toys, careers, and so on. The student prints the word on an index card and draws a picture of it.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Ask students to keep picture journals.</STRONG> While the rest of the kids are writing in their journals, Donna asks mainstreamed LEP students to choose pictures in magazines (and/or draw pictures), write their thoughts about the pictures in their native languages, and later fill in whatever English words they can.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Learn about students' customs and school experiences.</STRONG> "Remember that some cultural practices affect language interaction," cautions Donna. "In some cultures it is considered disrespectful to talk directly to someone, so a child of that culture may be more likely to nod or smile than respond verbally to a teacher. In some cultures it's rude to look people directly in the eyes when speaking." Donna also advises familiarizing yourself with experiences children have had in school in their native countries.

<A NAME="hom"></A>
<H3><A HREF="../Info/Advisers.html#Hom">John Hom</A>'s Secret To Making Kids Comfortable</H3>
John has 28 students who speak Mandarin and/or Cantonese with varying degrees of proficiency in English.
 John speaks two dialects--Cantonese and Taishan. His newest student speaks a dialect that no one else in the class speaks.<P>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Cooperative learning helps.</STRONG> "My main concern is that every new student not only begin to learn English, but also feel a part of our classroom community,"  John says. So he has students 
buddy-up, pairing newcomers with children who are patient and friendly. John sees buddies as well-rounded role models. He also groups students to build community. "In my classroom we have cooperative tables, so I make sure my new student, Yu Xie, sits in a group that will help her," says John. "To sit next to her I chose a student who doesn't speak Chinese because I don't want Yu Xie to only rely on trying to speak Chinese."<P>

<LI><STRONG>Look for opportunities to encourage class participation.</STRONG> "My students were doing myth projects when Yu Xie came into our class," John explains, "so I suggested that they ask her to be a character they needed. They coached her on the dialogue. She didn't understand everything, but the interaction helped."<P>

Also, during creative writing, he asked Yu Xie to write about herself. It helped that the written form of all Chinese dialects is the same, so one of the students translated her work into English and the kids read it. Then a student helped translate questions for Yu Xie into Cantonese and helped interpret her answers.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Have special assignments ready.</STRONG> "With math, my new student catches on fairly 
quickly because she already has the skills," says John. But word problems are much more difficult, and his kids have been doing a stock market project for half the year. "Rather than frustrate her and everyone else," he says, "I gave Yu Xie a separate assignment--math surveys--so I can find out what she already knows."

<A NAME="language"></A>
<H3>Language Acquisition: What To Expect</H3>
To find out more about the stages of language acquisition and how they affect LEP children, <EM>Instructor </EM>spoke with Andrea Hernandez, assistant director of the Bilingual Bicultural Mini School 
(La Escuelita Biling&uuml;e Bicultural) in New York City.<P>

<STRONG>Q: Please give us an overview of how children acquire a language.</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A: 1.</STRONG> During the first stage, called preproduction, children begin to take in the language and understand it, but they're not yet able to verbalize it. This is a time for listening activities, pointing to things, selecting, drawing. We can't expect to engage children in a conversation or ask them to respond to questions because it's too soon for them to deliver the language.<P>
<STRONG>2.</STRONG> The next stage is early production. Children have limited verbalization and growing comprehension. Because they understand bits and pieces of what is said, we have to remember that they still don't understand everything. At this time children also begin to respond with one- or two-word answers (yes or no, lists and/or names of objects, and so on). Don't look for, or demand, complete sentences.<P>
<STRONG>3.</STRONG> Next comes speech emergence. You'll notice increased comprehension and simple sentences and, of course, some errors. Encourage students to retell and define, explain, compare, and describe.<P>
<STRONG>4.</STRONG> Later, students reach intermediate fluency.  They have very good comprehension 
and are capable of constructing complex sentences, analyzing, examining, and justifying.<P>

<STRONG>Q: What is the teacher's role?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A:</STRONG> Tailor your language expectations to where the child is developmentally, so that you don't ask a child to produce at a stage he or she hasn't reached. Otherwise it's defeating and frustrating.  At the same time, give children opportunities to exhibit skills and not assume that just because the child doesn't speak the new language that he or she doesn't have the ability to function. Capitalize on the child's strengths in his or her own language.  A bilingual aide, student, or volunteer is a great help. So is your sensitivity.<P>

<STRONG>Q: Any other tips?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A:</STRONG> Try to find age-appropriate materials. Fifth graders aren't interested in the same 
things kindergartners are and shouldn't have to use inappropriate materials. Children's self-esteem is vulnerable enough without being forced into such awkward situations. Relate to the child as an individual and learn about who he or she is. Let children know they are special because they add to your class, not because they are different.

<A NAME="glossary"></A>
<H3>Glossary of Second Language Teaching Approaches</H3>
Terms like "two-way bilingual programs" and "the ESL approach" are being tossed around these days like 
tomatoes in a salad. What do they mean? Below, we've adapted definitions in layman's language from 
National Education Association materials.<P>

<STRONG>Bilingual education</STRONG> uses two languages. The teacher develops English skills and 
teaches content in the native language.<BR>
<STRONG>Two-way bilingual education</STRONG> teaches two languages at once. All students learn a 
second language.<BR>
<STRONG>Five common approaches for teaching LEP students:</STRONG> Schools often combine the 
approaches outlined below, some of which involve either bilingual or two-way bilingual teaching.
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>The maintenance or developmental approach</STRONG> fosters parallel learning in two
 languages. Bilingual instructors teach academic subjects in the students' primary language. This enhances 
students' confidence and subject-matter comprehension--although critics charge that it interferes with their 
acquisition of English. The objective is to create bilingual students. While it takes two years for students to 
develop basic interpersonal communication skills (BIC) or "playground English," it usually takes five to seven
 years to achieve fluency.<P>

<LI><STRONG>The transitional approach</STRONG> teaches academic subjects in the students' primary 
language but progressively uses more English. As students' English proficiency increases, the primary language is dropped. This method seeks to place students in English classrooms more rapidly than the maintenance or developmental approaches. It is the most commonly used approach in the United States.<P>

<LI><STRONG>The English-as-a-Second-Language approach </STRONG>(ESL) generally requires that 
students attend one or more classes in which they learn to speak and write in English (sometimes going over 
material studied in other classes). All of the students' other classes are conducted in English. ESL is a part of 
virtually all programs in the United States.<P>

<LI><STRONG>The language submersion approach</STRONG> (not bilingual) places students in classes 
conducted entirely in a language that is not their first language. Critics dub this the "sink or swim" method.<P>

<LI><STRONG>The immersion approach</STRONG> (not bilingual) offers programs for students who lack 
enough English language skills to understand the regular curriculum. Many teachers use sheltered English--or alternate immersion--which is a simplified vocabulary and sentence structure to teach school subjects. Teachers may also use the structured immersion approach where students may speak their native language to the teacher (who understands it), although the teacher generally answers only in English.<P>

<H2>Connect With Kids and Parents of Different Cultures</H2>
<H3>How to develop positive relationships with today's diverse families<P>
By <A HREF="#ross">Linda Ross</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

A sixth-grade teacher in New York City looks over her new class roster and sees that half her students have Asian names. "Good," she says, smiling to herself, "a smart class at last." Across the country, a fourth-grade teacher planning a sleep-over field trip is puzzled when immigrant parents from El Salvador and Nicaragua refuse to let their children attend. Through an interpreter, she soon discovers these families--survivors of terror in their native countries--are afraid to send their children away overnight to an unfamiliar place.<P>

As America's classrooms become increasingly diverse, many teachers face a culture gap that can hinder positive relationships with students and their families. In my work as a diversity trainer in schools, I help teachers begin bridging the gap by first taking a close look at their own assumptions and then finding new ways to reach out to those who are different. In this article, you'll find the following:<P>

<A NAME="assumptions"></A>
<H3>Self-Quiz: What Are Your Assumptions</H3>

<STRONG>Ask Yourself . . .</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>What are the different cultures in my school?  (Include categories such as various ethnic groups, students with disabilities, new immigrants, residents of public housing, and any other relevant groupings.)
<LI>What characteristics first come to mind when I think of each group?
<LI>Where did these impressions come from? (Peers, family, media, religion, etc.) How reliable are these sources?
<LI>How do I treat people based on these impressions?  
<LI>Can I remember a time when someone made assumptions about me based on a group I belong to? How did it make me feel?
</UL>

<STRONG>Where Do Biases Begin?</STRONG><BR>
How we react to people from different backgrounds is influenced by many factors:
<OL>
<LI>Our own personal experiences with people from that background.
<LI>What we've heard about people from this background from our families, peers, the media, popular culture, school, religious institutions, and so on.
<LI>Whether we see ourselves as sharing any values, goals, and ways of doing things with people of this background.
<LI>Whether people from this background have any control over the things that make them different from us.
<LI>How much power we believe people of this background have in our society and any laws or special programs we know about that affect how people of this background are treated.
</OL>

<A NAME="behavior"></A>
<H3>How Culture Affects Behavior</H3>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Speaking Up:</STRONG> Sociologists draw a distinction between high-context societies in which there are many rules and people say less, and low context societies that depend on explicit verbal messages.
<LI><STRONG>Tracking Time:</STRONG> There are also different cultural takes on time: monochronic, meaning that people do one thing at a time and adhere to schedules, and polychronic, in which people do several things at a time, put interpersonal needs over schedules, and may view time as an invasion of self.
<LI><STRONG>Physical Self:</STRONG> Culture shapes the kinds of gestures we use--for example, beckoning someone is offensive in some cultures--and the amount of personal space we need to feel comfortable.
<LI><STRONG>Personal Interaction:</STRONG> Importantly for teachers, our cultures also contribute to how we view cooperation, competition, and discipline.
</OL>

<A NAME="bias"></A>
<H3>How To Build A Buffer Against Bias</H3>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Be aware of your assumptions.</STRONG>
<OL>
<LI>We're all biased in one way or another. The key is to notice when you are making a judgment--positive or negative--about a child or parent, and then figure out what the judgment is based upon. In my workshops I always have teachers ask themselves the questions in the <A HREF="#assumptions">self-quiz</A>. Like many of the teachers I work with, you may be surprised at your own answers.<P>

<LI>Invite an objective outsider to observe you in your classroom. Teachers have been shocked yet grateful when I have given them feedback about their behavior in the classroom. You may suggest that the principal hire a professional to observe each teacher in the school.
</OL><P>
<LI><STRONG>Be aware of cultural differences.</STRONG>
<OL>
<LI> Everything we do--regarding time, personal space, body language, voice volume, small talk, and so on--is <A HREF="#behavior">shaped by our culture</A>. Most of the participants in my workshops named eye contact as the most important feature in communication. Yet people from many cultures, including some Asians, Native Americans, Africans, and Hispanics/Latinos, don't make eye contact like Caucasian Americans do--in some cultures, in fact, making eye contact is considered an insult.<P>

<LI>You can learn a lot about other cultures from your coworkers. Organize an after-school gathering for teachers and other school staff to bring in a favorite dish from their culture and to share cultural characteristics.
</OL><P>
<LI><STRONG>Keep every student in mind.</STRONG>
<OL>
<LI>Try to be sensitive to the cultural shock that new students experience. According to ESL teacher Marge Kaplan from Roseville School District in St. Paul, Minnesota, there is a cycle children often go through in any new setting.  At first they are excited. Then reality sinks in:  They may feel stupid, lonely, and depressed. This can last anywhere from six weeks to three months or more. Most of these students will eventually learn to accept and feel comfortable in their new situation.<P>

<LI>It helps to be direct and deal with student biases right away. One kindergarten teacher relayed the story of Melissa, who showed her new purse to the class during show-and-tell. She then innocently said that on the way to school her mother made her walk faster when an African-American man was walking behind them, because her mother was afraid he might try to steal the purse. In a situation like this, I recommend asking the child why her mother might have felt that way, and then launching a class discussion about how people who steal things come in many colors and why it is a mistake to judge people by their outer appearance.<P>

<LI>When you create different standards for different groups, you do a disservice to everyone. Establish expectations and clearly communicate them--that way, no one will be made to feel second-rate or superior.<P>

<LI>Familiarize yourself with all the holidays and traditions your students celebrate. Record important dates on a yearlong calendar and check it before you schedule special events. Recently, a high school held its first Diversity Day, but it was scheduled during Passover, so some of the Jewish students could not partake of the food. An event intended to promote diversity unfortunately resulted in hurt feelings.<P>

<LI>Encourage students to be honest about their own fears and misconceptions. One Hmong boy told his teacher of the stories he heard before coming to America. He heard that Americans get to be big by eating Hmongs and that blacks send Hmongs to Thailand as canned fish. Needless to say, once the fears were dispelled, he felt much more comfortable in school.<P>

<LI>Make sure your classroom reflects diversity. Take a quick inventory. Do the pictures on your walls include a variety of cultures? Do you have a multicultural curriculum? Little changes can make a big difference, and, if    necessary, you can get grants for larger efforts. One school got a grant to open up a Family Resource Center where parents could learn about the school and community and share information about their own cultures.<P>

<LI>When in doubt about the appropriateness of certain materials, consult others. Think about forming a committee of parent volunteers to evaluate authenticity in questionable material.
</OL></UL>


<A NAME="parents"></A>
<H3>Build Positive Communication With Parents</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Schools differ from culture to culture, as do parents' conceptions of the function of the school and the teacher. Before the school year begins, you might put together a newsletter describing: the benefits of school, the opportunities that are available, what you expect of the students and parents, how the school operates, and how parents can get in touch with you if they have any problems or questions. Have volunteers translate the newsletter into the necessary languages.<P>

<LI> Establish rapport with parents. Encourage them to share about their cultures and experiences with you. They will feel more respected, and will be more open to hearing about what you have to say. It is difficult for some parents to hear criticism of their children, so it will be easier to discuss a child when trust has been built.<P>

<LI>Let parents know that you care about their child, and suggest ways that they can help their child succeed in school. Demonstrate to the parents that a good education can make a difference in their child's life by citing examples of those who came from similar experiences and backgrounds and have been successful in America.<P>

<LI>Be consistent and honest. Teachers have told me that parents from certain cultures can be particularly unforgiving if they feel betrayed. It is often harder to reestablish trust after it's been damaged than to build it the first time.<P>

<LI>Help parents locate community resources. They may be keeping their child out of school to baby-sit or because they don't have appropriate clothing.<P>

<LI>Plan activities such as performances and parties to bring parents into the school. Pam, a fourth-grade teacher, had a problem getting some of the parents to attend open houses even when the school provided transportation. The problem was solved when the school provided food and the children performed.<P>

<LI>Recruit parent volunteers. Explain the benefits of their involvement and create a range of volunteer opportunities. If parents seem hesitant to volunteer, find out why. They may be embarrassed by their language skills or clothing, may need baby-sitting help, or may lack transportation. You may be able to encourage them or help them find solutions.<P>

<A NAME="jimmy"></A>
<H3>About Jimmy</H3>
Dear Instructor:<BR>
One of my fourth graders, who has often come to school with bruises on his arms and legs, finally confided in me that he's had "serious arguments" with his father. The parents are separated, and Jimmy lives with his mother now, but he still sees his father occasionally. The other day I noticed that Jimmy had fresh bruises on his face. He was very restless and ultimately left the building without permission. This necessitated my calling in his mother for an emergency conference, during which I had to confess that Jimmy's academic progress also had me worried. His mother said that if she hears one more time that her son is doing badly in school, she'll send him to live with his father. I was horrified. Jimmy hasn't come back to school, and now I'm even more worried. I'm not sure if he ever told anyone else about his father's abusive behavior. Is it my duty to tell someone? Obviously, there are things going on that I don't understand--but I want to do something to prevent Jimmy's mother from sending him to live with his abusive father.<BR>
--<EM>Mixed-up in Maine</EM><P>

<A NAME="psychologist"></A>
<H3>Dr. Brodkin Responds:<BR>
A Child Psychologist's View</H3>
I'm glad you asked whether you have a duty to report Jimmy's situation. The answer is a simple one: Yes, you do--because it's the law. What's more, reporting is probably the only way to protect Jimmy from further abuse.<P>

According to the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, we have a national emergency. Child abuse has reached epidemic proportions, with some three million reports each year, the majority of which turn out to be accurate. And it's estimated that millions more cases go unreported. Teachers can make the difference for many of these children. Here's how.<P>

<STRONG>Inform yourself.</STRONG> Many people don't know that teachers in all 50 states are now legally obligated to report even reasonable suspicions of child abuse to the police or local child protective services. I urge all teachers to learn about their state's child-abuse laws, including recommendations about how to report. All this information is available from  each state's department of social services and local law-enforcement agencies.<P>

<STRONG>Report suspicions, too.</STRONG> Jimmy told you about the abuse he has endured, but that doesn't happen often. More commonly, abused children protect their parents by making excuses for them or denying the abuse. Often, kids believe the abuse is their own fault. What should you have done in Jimmy's case, then, if you had only suspected abuse? You'd have reported it that way, as you are obligated to do. There is a list of <A HREF="#warning">signs of abuse to watch for</A> later in this article.<P>

<STRONG>What happens next?</STRONG> Although procedures may vary from state to state, it is likely that the child protective services, after verifying your report, will do everything possible to protect Jimmy without separating him from his family. They should also press Jimmy's parents to seek counseling immediately. As the case unfolds, do insist on being kept informed of progress by whomever is in charge of coordinating the case.<P>

<STRONG>Handle Jimmy with care.</STRONG> Most abused children are likely to lose ground academically, socially, and behaviorally. Since they are also fearful of and lack trust in adults--and rightfully so, based on their experiences--teachers need to be cautious in disciplining them and responding to their work. You are in a unique position to guide Jimmy toward some sort of success. If he can't find it in academics right now, how about encouraging him in a sport, music, or some other skill or special interest? Be patient, and know your efforts will make a difference.<P>


<A NAME="leader"></A>
<H3>Dr. Coleman Responds:<BR>
A School Leader's View</H3>
I can certainly empathize with your anxiety over the right thing to do for Jimmy. For educators, suspected child abuse is always wrapped in fear: fear of misidentification, fear of repercussions from parents, fear for the child, and fear of going out on a limb and being left alone to deal with the problem. As a school principal, I used to dread child abuse/neglect cases for all these reasons--that's why I made it my business to prepare my teachers well and stand behind them.<P>

<STRONG>Have policies and procedures in place.</STRONG> Whatever happens with Jimmy, be assured there are almost certainly more children like him at your school. You and your colleagues need to know how to respond in a systematic manner to similar cases that will arise in the future. If your school doesn't already have a clearly defined process for handling suspicions of child abuse, volunteer to get a group of staff members together with your principal and start developing one.<P>

<STRONG>Make knowledge of legal requirements a priority.</STRONG> I always made sure that the teachers in my school had written information about our state's reporting requirements, definitions for reporting, and legal consequences of not reporting. If your school doesn't routinely provide this information to teachers, make it part of your policy to do so. Be aware that some districts go even further, requiring principals to certify that they have informed the staff about how to report, and requiring employees to certify that they know the rules and will comply with them.<P>
	
<STRONG>Focus on prevention as well as intervention.</STRONG> Although the causes of child abuse aren't yet well-understood, many parents who harm their kids have certain "risk factors" in common. The most important of these may be a long-standing cycle of family abuse, in which parents treat their children as they themselves were treated. Short-term factors include marital problems, job loss, or discipline difficulties with the child. Many parents grappling with these problems are desperate to get help but don't know how. Your school can help direct them toward counseling and into support groups such as Parents Anonymous. If your school team finds out and informs parents about community resources such as these, you might prevent some future cases like Jimmy's.<P>


<A NAME="warning"></A>
<H3>A Child-Abuse Expert on Warning Signs to Watch For</H3>
How can you tell if a child is being harmed or neglected at home?<BR>
According to Shirley O'Brien, a human development specialist and spokesperson for the Association for Early 
Childhood International, it is reasonable to suspect abuse if a number of these physical and behavioral signs are present:<BR>

<H2>Help For "They Won't Let Me Play With Them!"</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF ="../info/columnists.html#kreidler">William Kreidler</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

"They won't let me play with them!" How many times have you heard your students say that? In a caring, peaceable classroom, no one should feel like an outsider. But despite our best intentions, many children do. While there's no magic cure for the persistent problems related to exclusion, there are ways to address them with your students. Here's how to set standards and expectations, and how to follow up on them throughout the school year.<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#peacable">The Peaceable Person Profile</A>
<LI><A HREF="#playing">Playing for Empathy</A>

</UL>

<A NAME="peacable"></A>
<H3>The Peaceable Person Profile</H3>
To help students understand what makes a peaceable person, have a volunteer lie down on a 4-by-7-foot sheet of mural paper and ask classmates to trace his or her body. Then ask the class what behaviors, attitudes, and actions they think contribute to a climate of caring in the classroom. Have students take turns writing these positive attributes inside the outline of the peaceable person. (With younger children, do the recording yourself.) As kids write down their thoughts, ask them to give examples of what they mean by helpful, courteous, and so on. If no one comes up with any qualities related to including others, ask, "In our classroom, what would a peaceable person do if someone wanted to play with him or her?" <P>
	
Now have the group write outside of the outline all of the negative behaviors, attitudes, and actions that they don't want as part of the class. Finally, ask children if they can agree to use the attributes of the peaceable person to guide their behavior. Post the peaceable person as a visual contract for you and students. Whenever a positive or negative behavior occurs, kids can point it out on the outline.<P>
	
<H4>Editor's Note: The previous activity is adapted from <EM>Youth Leadership in Action</EM> by Project Adventure.</H4>

<A NAME="playing"></A>
<H3>Playing for Empathy</H3>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Musical Chairs.</STRONG> Use this old favorite to raise issues of inclusion and exclusion.
 First, play the traditional way. When the game is over, explain that you'd like to try a different version--this time the object is to make sure no one is excluded. If everyone has a place to sit, the group wins. If anyone is without a place to sit, the group loses. When playing, eliminate a chair, but not a child, every time the music stops. Students will need to figure out creative ways to pile everyone on one chair.<P>

Afterward, discuss the difference in the two experiences: How did it feel to sit on the sidelines? Have there been other times you've been on the sidelines while other children played? How did it feel? Can you think of other games you could redesign this way?<P>

<LI><STRONG>The Tight Hands Game.</STRONG> This game gives children a metaphor for discussing inclusion and exclusion. Begin by explaining that the class will act as if it is excluding someone. Have students hold hands in a circle. One child volunteer, the outsider, tries to get into the circle through spaces between people, while everyone else tries to keep him or her out. Caution children to be gentle when blocking the outsider. When the outsider gets into the circle, stop the game and ask for another volunteer. As a variation you can have two or three outsiders at one time. After playing several rounds, ask: What did it feel like to be an outsider? Did anyone want to let the outsiders inside the circle? Did you let them slip in? Why or why not? Have you ever felt like an outsider in school? When?<P>
</UL>

<A NAME="books"></A>
<H3>Books That Bind</H3>
There are many children's books that address the pain of exclusion and the benefits of inclusion. For younger children, try <EM>Chrysanthemum</EM> by Kevin Henkes (Greenwillow, 1991) and <EM>Oliver Button Is a Sissy</EM> by Tomie de Paola (Harcourt Brace, 1979). The themes are explored for older children in <EM>The Hundred Dresses</EM> by Eleanor Estes (Harcourt Brace, 1974) and <EM>Thank You, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</EM> by Eleanora Tate (Bantam, 1992). For your own reading, Vivian Gussin Paley's <EM>You Can't Say You Can't Play</EM> (Harvard University Press, 1992) is a thought-provoking account of a teacher's attempt to deal with exclusion in her classroom.


<A NAME="teacher"></A>
<H3>One Teacher's  Strategies</H3>
"In 15 years of teaching I've seen a lot of excluding and a lot of hurt feelings," says third-grade teacher Margaret Bruell of Carlisle, Massachusetts. So last year she made inclusion one of the themes of her classroom.<P>

First, she raised the issue of exclusion in a class meeting. "I had observed a situation in the cafeteria where a second grader told another that she couldn't sit with her. We discussed the incident as a class, then I had children work in pairs to list reasons why the girl might have turned away her classmate. Then we discussed why people exclude others."<P>

Margaret raised the issue in other class meetings, discussing actual incidents of exclusion and inclusion, and she had children write responses to the following:
<UL>
<LI>Tell about a time when you were excluded or included at school.<P>
<LI> Why do you think people exclude one another?<P>
<LI>Are people more likely to include or exclude others in our school?<P>
</UL>

Margaret also tried story starters that described an incident in which a child asks to be included. The children shared their stories in class meetings.<P>

"This is not a problem that is remedied very quickly," Margaret admits. "That's why it's so important to keep bringing it up. The more kids think about it, the more likely they are to change." Margaret adds, "Remember to listen to children instead of lecturing. Exclusion has lots of causes and listening to children's experiences can help you get to the bottom of them." Then, she advises, "Have students share their feelings about exclusion and inclusion. It's one way to help kids develop empathy. I saw many of the children become more sensitive to excluded children. One boy who was severely excluded had a couple of friendships by the end of the year."<P>

<H2>Building A Bridge to Special Students</H2>
<H3>One teacher's story of how her fourth graders developed understanding and, ultimately, friendship with the special-ed kids in their school<P>
By <A HREF ="#martinez">Terry Martinez</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

As my class headed out of the lunchroom one day, the usually indifferent Michael announced, "I'm frightened of them." He was watching our school's special-ed children in the hall.<P>

Two weeks later, Michael and his classmates embarked on the first phase of a three-step process to educate them about these students' disabilities.<P>

In this article, you'll find out how we began building a bridge between regular and special-ed students.<P>

<LI><A HREF="#turn">Your Turn</A>
</UL>

<A NAME="phases"></A>
<H3>The 3 Phases of Building Our Bridge</H3>
In my school, the special-ed students eat in the common lunchroom and are seen as they walk in the hallways, but there is little mingling with the regular students. Four years ago, in an attempt to change attitudes among teachers as well as students, Carla, the supervisor for special-ed, sent out a memo offering teachers in-service training leading to integrative activities with the special-ed children. I was interested, so Carla and I set up the following three-step program.<P>
<UL>
<A NAME="phase1"></A>
<LI><STRONG>Phase 1:</STRONG> Special-ed staff would visit my room to talk about disabilities, how they affect children, and some of the tools used in teaching special-ed students. They'd also encourage students to ask questions. Students would then participate in a workshop that simulates disabilities.<P>

<A NAME="phase2"></A>
<LI><STRONG>Phase 2:</STRONG> My students would visit the special-ed classrooms; afterward, they'd have a chance to discuss their observations and ask more questions.<P>

<A NAME="phase3"></A>
<LI><STRONG>Phase 3:</STRONG> My students and the special-ed students would interact in a culminating activity.
</UL>

<STRONG>Phase by Phase</STRONG><BR>
During <A HREF="#phase1">Phase 1</A> that first year, the children asked some questions but became truly engrossed by the equipment used in special-ed classrooms. 
As Roberta, an occupational therapist, described how some of the students cannot control their muscles to move their arms properly, Michael stared at his own hand, flexing and stiffening his fingers, unconsciously grimacing as he did so.<P>

Then Ellen, a language and communications teacher, showed my students some of the tools she uses to help her children learn to communicate. Michael and the others gathered around to touch pictures that led to words issuing from a machine, repeating their phrases in a computer-recorded voice. Everyone wanted to see, hear, and touch the amazing devices that help students with speech disabilities.<P>

A few weeks later, my class went downstairs for <A HREF="#phase2">Phase 2</A>. My students were divided into four groups and rotated among the four special-ed classrooms, watching as teachers and paraprofessionals worked with their students. My students then met briefly with the special-ed staff after each rotation to discuss what they'd seen.<P>

I was concerned about how my students would react to <A HREF="#phase2">Phase 2</A>, but my fears were groundless. My kids had shed much of their initial fear and/or revulsion since <A HREF="#phase1">Phase 1</A>. They even learned some of the students' names. Their body language had changed, too. In fact, they actively sought responses from the special-ed kids and reacted to being acknowledged with a pat or a shy smile.<P>

In the time that led up to <A HREF="#phase3">Phase 3</A>, my students asked frequently, "Are we working with special ed today?" Finally, on a sunny June day, my eager class went out into the school yard to participate in the Special Olympics that was the culmination of our cooperative effort. Each contestant was assigned to one or two of my students, and the games began.<P>

My students were immersed in their roles--from encouraging a girl to throw a ball in the right direction to lifting up a youngster who needed help. Occasionally conflict arose when my students were competing over "custody" of their charges, but these ruffled feathers were quickly smoothed and they returned to claim their rightful share of guardianship.<P>

The staff and I were elated--the Olympics and the entire experience had been wildly successful. The sun shone; we beamed. The first bridge had been crossed.<P>

<A NAME="grows"></A>
<H3>The Bridge Grows</H3>
The following year, my class underwent the same procedure and, come June, worked with special-ed youngsters to plant a school garden. Numerous bees and the occasional student waving worms at more squeamish classmates (though never at a special-ed child) did not diminish my students' enthusiasm. This time it was even more rewarding for me because of a student in my class named Gloria.<P>

Gloria's initial response to the disabled youngsters had been revulsion; she had avoided all contact with them up to the gardening activity. That day I overheard her telling one child to rake, but the youngster couldn't hold the handle properly or make the necessary motions. "Don't tell her," I said. "Show her." Gloria looked at the child and at me. I stepped behind the child, put her fingers on the handle, and guided her arms in the raking movement.<P>

I stepped back. Gloria came forward, put her arms around the little girl, and, together, they raked. Gloria was proud and happy, and so was I--for both of us. Gloria was not the only one who had avoided direct contact until that day. The bridge became sturdier as I--their teacher--joined them on it at last.<P>

Were there problems? Aside from the difficulty of coordinating schedules so the classes could get together, some of the special-ed staff were skeptical that attitudes would really change. Yet now, fifth and sixth graders regularly work with the special-ed students in the gym. They enjoy helping, feel important, and have improved self-esteem. The special-ed students enjoy the individualized attention and relate well to their helpers.<P>

Does Carla feel her original outreach across the wall of isolation has been a success? "It's broken down barriers and made disabilities and differences acceptable," she says. And me? I read what my students wrote as they began this experience, and what they write now. It has been far more valuable and enriching than many of the mandatory workshops that claim our time in school.<P>

Now, after participating in a disabilities workshop, we are looking forward to the second year of our Special Olympics. My students can't wait. Neither can I.<P>

<H2>Teach Your Students to Be Healthy & Germ-Free</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF ="#kauffman">Deborah Kauffman</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

As a school nurse, I've seen just about every minor health problem your students are likely to encounter. Many of the most common are preventable--if kids know what to do. Here are mini-lessons and resources I've used successfully to help students tackle their top health hurdles. <P>

Choose from:
<UL>

<A NAME="hygiene"></A>
<H3>Topic: Hygiene (Grades 2-5)</H3>
Here are some lesson ideas to help you address the topic of hygiene and to encourage good lifelong habits for students of all ages.<P>
Situation: Your younger students are coming into the classroom obviously unkempt and dirty.<P>
Situation: Your students are at an age where they should start wearing deodorant.<P>
Try This:
<OL>
<LI> Brainstorm with your students definitions of cleanliness and write them on the board. Discuss how cleanliness applies to our bodies as well as homes and classrooms.<P>

<LI>Read aloud <EM>Pigsty</EM> by Mark Teague (Scholastic, 1994), then discuss it. (<A HREF="#resources1">Click here for other books dealing with hygiene</A>.)<P>

<LI>Have everyone take his or her shoes off and then put them back on. Then ask who put on the right one first and who put on the left one first. Tell students that people tend to always start with the same foot out of habit. Define a habit as something a person does without thinking. Talk about good habits, such as brushing teeth after each meal, and bad habits, such as biting nails. Then list a variety of habits on the board. Tell your students that forming good hygiene habits can keep them healthy and strong.<P>

<LI>Together, make a list of items used to keep a person clean, such as: soap, towel, toothbrush, and so on. Discuss what each item is used for.<P>

<LI>Ask: What do you do each morning to get ready for school? List and talk about students' good habits and routines for the morning.<P>

<LI> Discuss, record on chart paper, and post some hygiene tips everyone can follow, such as: "Keep your fingers or other objects out of your mouth" and "Don't use other people's combs or brushes."<P>
</OL>

<A HREF="#resources1">Click here for resource suggestions for teaching about hygiene.</A><P>

<A NAME="handwash"></A>
<H3>Topic: Hand-Washing (Grades K-2)</H3>
Teach your students how washing one's hands and covering one's mouth when sneezing can prevent illness.<P>

Situation: Colds, sore throats, flu, and other such illnesses spread through your classroom like wildfire.<P>

Try This:
<OL>
<LI>First, ask students the following questions. They will lead logically into a discussion about cleanliness.
<UL>
<LI>How many students have been ill? Allow a few students to share what their illnesses were.
<LI>Does anyone know what caused those illnesses? Point out which were contagious and discuss what this means. Explain that germs cause illness.
<LI>Can we see germs? Explain that germs are so small that we can see them only through  a microscope.
<LI>What's the smallest thing you've ever seen? Mention a grain of sand and explain that a germ is much smaller than this.
<LI>Where in our classroom can we find germs? Explain that germs could be anywhere.<P>
</UL>

<LI> Develop a list of things your students can do to prevent the spread of germs, such as covering their mouths when coughing or sneezing, avoiding putting objects other than food in their mouths, and washing their hands to stay as germ-free as possible.<P>

<LI>Tell your students that hand-washing can help a lot in preventing the spread of germs. The two most important times at school to wash hands are after using the toilet and before eating. Have students come up with other appropriate times, such as: after recess, after blowing their nose, and after playing with pets.<P>

<LI>Have each child practice proper hand-washing. If sinks are not available, students can act out the steps. 
<UL>
<LI>Turn on the warm water. 
<LI>Wet your hands. 
<LI>Put soap on your hands. 
<LI>Wash well on both sides of your hands. 
<LI>Wash between fingers and around fingernails for at least 15 seconds. 
<LI>Rinse off the soap. 
<LI>Dry your hands with a paper towel. 
<LI>Use the paper towel to turn off the faucet. 
<LI>Drop the towel in the wastebasket. 
</UL>

You may want to write these steps on chart paper and post it near the classroom sink as a reminder.<P>

<LI>Ask for three volunteers to experiment with hand-washing techniques for the whole class. Place a thin layer of petroleum jelly on each student's hands. Have the first child wash with cold water and soap, the second with warm water and no soap, and the third with warm water and soap. Ask: Which of you has no trace of petroleum jelly left? This experiment will show that warm water and soap clean best.<P>

<LI>Demonstrate how germs are spread when a person does not cover his or her mouth or nose when sneezing or coughing. Use a spray bottle filled with water. Spray in the air, and tell students that this is like a sneeze--but that when someone sneezes, the spray is filled with microscopic germs. Have students notice where the spray lands. Repeat the squirt, but this time hold a facial tissue in front of the nozzle, showing how covering it makes a difference. <P>

<LI>Make a bulletin board to illustrate what students have learned. Have each student draw his or her face on a paper plate. Then glue a facial tissue over the mouth or nose part of the plate. Have students trace a hand on construction paper, cut it out, and write one fact they learned about hygiene on it. Glue the hands on top of the facial tissue and, as a class, think of a title for your sneezing-faces bulletin board.<P>

<H3>Topic: Head Lice (Grades K-6)</H3>
Awareness is the best method of prevention.<P>

Situation: It's every teacher's nightmare--an outbreak of head lice (pediculosis) in your school.<P>

Try This:
<OL>
<LI>Share this information with coworkers, parents, students, and so on.
<UL>
<LI>A louse is a small, sesame-seed-size parasitic insect. It has no hind legs or wings so it can't hop, jump, or fly, but it can crawl very quickly. Thus, lice spread mainly when heads come into contact or when brushes, combs, barrettes, or hats are shared. A louse can also easily crawl from coat to coat in a crowded classroom closet.
<LI>A louse lives by sucking blood from the scalp. A female louse can lay up to ten eggs, called nits,  a day. Nits hatch in 7 to 10 days. The louse reaches maturity in 7 or 8 days. The adult louse will live up to 30 days. Nits are attached to the hair shaft with a very strong glue-like substance, making it very difficult to get rid of them. 
<LI>Lice prefer warm areas of the scalp such as behind ears and on the nape of the neck, but they can live anywhere on the scalp. 
<LI>Crawling lice bite the scalp, causing itching. Excessive itching is a good warning sign.<P>
</UL>
<LI>Here's what your school can do to prevent the spread of head lice. 
<UL>
<LI>Adopt a "No-Nit Policy," stating that no child is permitted to come to school with nits. 
<LI>Hold a schoolwide check of every child's head at the beginning of the school year and after the winter holiday vacation. 
<LI>Adopt a prevention program and teach parents about head lice before an outbreak occurs.<P>
</UL>
<LI>Here's what you can do in your classroom.
<UL>
<LI>Remind students not to share anything that goes on their heads. 
<LI>If you have a dress-up center in your room, eliminate head items, such as hats, or replace them with disposable ones. 
<LI>During an outbreak, ask each child to bring in an extra bag--such as a duffel bag or pillowcase--that can be tied up for each child's coat and book bag to be placed in. This way lice cannot travel from coat to coat.
<LI>After sharing information with students, have them summarize what they've learned and take it home to share with their families.<P>

<H2>Choosing a workshop that'll suit your needs can be a challenge. Here's how to be a savvy consumer. </H2>
<H3>by <A HREF ="../info/editors.html#bozzone">Meg A. Bozzone</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 12/25/95</STRONG><P>

Think about professional development and you probably think of the inservice you've grown tired of: Hired 
"experts" talk at you for an hour about the latest teaching methods, then send you on your way with only your 
notes and a few handouts. And with little or no follow-up, you probably never put these methods to work in your classroom.<P>

The good news? It doesn't have to be that way. Across the country, the lecture-style inservice is being replaced by hands-on workshops that arm teachers with skills they're motivated to put into action. Best yet, teachers are having a greater say in deciding which inservices come to their schools. To help you choose quality inservice-and leave the workshops of old behind-we offer you the following guide, that includes:<P>

<A NAME="pick"></A>
<H2>Five Ways to Pick a Great Inservice and Get the Most Out of It</H2>

When you're poring over brochures in search of a workshop to attend-or lobbying for inservices to come to 
your school-keep these five points in mind. 
<OL>
<LI> <STRONG>Look for an inservice that's more than a one-shot deal.</STRONG> The best inservice learning happens not in a singleafternoon after school, but over the course of several days, a week, or longer-even during the summer, when your schedule is less hectic. To be effective, an inservice experience should build on what you're already doing in your classroom, and help you move toward teaching goals you've set for yourself.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Insist on interactive training. Just like your students, you learn by doing.</STRONG> A good inservice leader-ideally, a veteran teacher-will model skills that you can then practice with others in the workshop. While an effective leader will spend some time on the theory and research behind the practice, she or he will focus primarily on helping you tailor the new practice to your needs and goals. <P>

<LI><STRONG>Team up for off-site workshops.</STRONG> Your school may send you to a workshop alone, and then expect you to train your colleagues. This approach is usually ineffective. How can you teach others what you've only just learned yourself? It's likely to be an unfair burden on you and a frustrating experience for your colleagues.<P>

It's best to attend inservice workshops with a group from your school. That way you can learn together and 
support one another's efforts to implement the new teaching practice. Also, look for opportunities to meet with one another (and with the workshop leaders, if possible) throughout the year to share stories of your first forays into uncharted teaching territory. <P>

<LI> <STRONG>Convince your principal to take the workshop, too.</STRONG> It is important for principals and administrators to participate in workshops with their faculty so they get a taste for what implementing the new teaching practice will entail. By gaining firsthand experience, principals will be more likely to provide greater latitude for teachers to experiment in the classroom. And they will also see the importance of including teachers in the inservice planning process. <P>

<LI> <STRONG>Don't let tight funds keep you from the professional development you need and want most.</STRONG> Even if your district doesn't have a big budget for inservice, opportunities for professional development are available daily-and most don't cost a penny. For example:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Drop by a colleague's room or visit another school to observe a teaching method you haven't tried.
<LI>Keep a journal of what's happening in your classroom, then share it with colleagues.
<LI>Log onto educational telecommunications networks to participate in professional discussions. 
</UL></OL>


<A NAME="questions"></A>
<H2>Questions to Ask Yourself Before and After Inservice</H2>
In schools across the country, teachers like you are joining forces to determine inservice priorities and allocate resources. For the past two years, teachers in Ames Community Schools in Ames, Iowa, have worked together to decide which inservice workshops to attend and which ones to bring to their schools. They recommend the following list of questions to ask yourself before and after you sign up for and attend a workshop.<P>

BEFORE:<BR>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>In what area do I want to help my students learn more?</STRONG> The Iowa teachers caution against choosing a workshop on the latest instructional method or curriculum theme just to jump on the proverbial bandwagon. Instead, they suggest you consider the area in which you most want to affect student achievement. <P>

<LI><STRONG>Am I willing to change what I teach and/or how I teach it?</STRONG> The teachers in Ames Community Schools say it's critical to be honest with yourself about how open you really are to adapting your instructional style and curriculum content. Keep in mind that sometimes the more important a change is, the more uncomfortable it might feel. If you're really willing to change, make a formal commitment before you attend the workshop by making a pact with your colleagues or writing a promise to yourself in your journal.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Does this workshop offer me the highest payoff in terms of improved student achievement?</STRONG> In other words, the Ames teachers say, does the workshop you're considering promise you a new or expanded repertoire in yourtargeted area of student achievement? If it does, seek out research that backs up the workshop's claims for improving student performance. Look for evidence that teachers in schools like yours have successfully implemented changes based on the workshop's method.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Once I return to the classroom and put into practice the skills I've learned, will I get support?</STRONG> The best workshop trainers offer follow-up sessions and help teachers organize themselves into peer-coaching teams. If, however, a workshop you're interested in doesn't offer these features, don't automatically discount it. Try rganizing your own teacher network so you can get support for the changes you'll make. Keep a log of your experiences to share with colleagues. <P>

<LI><STRONG>If a workshop isn't available in the area I've identified, am I prepared to seek support from my district to design one?</STRONG> Teacher organizations, universities, staff development centers, and intermediate agencies like county offices may be willing to create and tailor workshops to suit your specific objectives. <P>
</OL>

AFTER:<P>
To gauge the true effectiveness of the workshop you've taken, the faculty in Ames Community Schools advisesyou to become an observer in your own classroom. To help you in your self-evaluation, here are some questions to ask. <P>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Is the method I'm trying to adapt in my classroom working?</STRONG> If not, how can I modify it to better suit my students' needs?<P>

<LI>A<STRONG>m I getting the results I'd hoped for in terms of student achievement?</STRONG> Is it too early to tell? How long should I wait before I look at the effects of the changes I've made?<P>

<LI><STRONG>Has the follow-up to the workshop been sufficient?</STRONG> Do I need to develop a stronger peer-support network? Who can I turn to for help?

<H2>Kids Learning Together: A Group For Every Purpose</H2>
<H3>How I organize my students for reading, math, social studies, and more<P>
By <A HREF="#schroeter">Adele Schroeter</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

The room dims as I flick the lights, but the muffled din barely subsides as my fourth graders scramble from their small clusters on the floor, the rug, and at tables where they are copying, reading, singing, and writing poetry. They look toward the agenda on the board for their next grouping cue. Book clubs.<P>

First, we all settle on the rug for a few minutes to talk about how things have been going in the clubs. "I think we've worked out that problem we were having and we're going to stick with <EM>Jacob I Have Loved</EM>," reports Adarsha, beaming. "You might not believe this, but nobody forgot their books this week!" Dylan gasps with mock disbelief--and the class bursts into spontaneous applause.<P>

Then children go off in groups of three and four--to their usual spots around tables, in odd corners, out in the hall-to talk, read, and talk some more about the books they've chosen. The buzzing collection of learning groups is not perfect, not just the way I want it to be, but it's not bad, either. At P.S. 321 in Brooklyn, New York, we're discovering that the roads to successful grouping for learning are as numerous and varied as our teachers and classrooms. Here's how it works for me.<P>

<A NAME="groups"></A>
<H3>Groups To Start The Year</H3>
Planning for groups begins long before September when the prior grade's teachers come together to divvy up their classes for the following year in as fair and equitable a way as possible. In a school like P.S. 321, the year begins with a class carefully crafted to reflect a balance in terms of academic, racial, behavioral, and gender considerations--no small feat with six classes and 170 children in the grade.<P>

Our heterogeneously grouped classes become microcosms of the world children live in. As such, kids' initial  attempts at grouping themselves reflect the patterns we see on the streets of our city, breaking down all too often according to gender and race. Our job is to build a sense of community, getting kids to know and appreciate each other as learners and individuals so those lines become a bit fuzzier.<P>

The very first day, I ask my kids to seat themselves around tables for four to six, and of course their primary consideration is sitting with old friends. Then, as kids get to know each other and can make more informed decisions about good workmates, I ask them to write letters to me describing themselves as learners, and listing who in the class they think might complement their own style, strengths, and weaknesses. "Dear Adele," writes Aron, "I think you're going to be surprised by who I want at my table. I like to hang out with Andrew, but I think he distracts me. I'm thinking that Sarah and Ariel would make good partners because they'll keep me focused. What do you think?"<P>

Using these letters--plus some creative matchmaking by me to assure a comfortable, productive spot for even those few kids who have a little trouble getting along with everybody--I regroup the class around the tables.
<A NAME="together"></A>
<H3>Getting Together For Social Studies and Math</H3>
Once these table groups are formed, I find they work really well for most subject area explorations and activities, including science and writing. But I don't use them for every purpose. For some projects, like our extended Native American unit, kids group themselves based on a common area of interest. For months this year, students researched, wrote, and built models in groups that ranged from seven focusing on the Cherokees to one each for the Apache and Delaware tribes.<P>

In my homogeneously grouped math class--P.S. 321's last bastion of traditional grouping--kids are drawn from all of the fourth-grade classrooms, and I like to mix them up a bit more so they can experience working with as many different children as possible. Every two weeks I stand at the door and assign new cooperative groups by dealing cards (ace through seven) randomly as they come in, &agrave; la Marilyn Burns. Well, almost randomly: I've found it helps to rig the deck a bit, stashing the twos at the bottom so I can be sure that kids who need a little extra attention will be at a table close to the front of the room. Deceitful, perhaps, but it takes them months to become suspicious. In groups like these, kids quickly learn that leadership qualities can be as valuable as discrete math skills. The most sought-after workmates are not always the most skillful mathematicians.

<A NAME="heart"></A>
<H3>The Heart of My Classroom: Grouping for Reading</H3>
Our carefully choreographed dance toward reading groups begins as early as the first days of school, when kids are asked to reflect on their own reading lives.  As a class, we spend long hours on the rug sharing memories of our first experiences of reading and being read to. I ask kids to interview their parents and write reading histories as the first entry in their precious reading journals, which will serve as a record of their growth as readers over the course of the year.  They then create reading time lines that chart their changing abilities and tastes as readers.<P>

From the very first day I read aloud to the kids as a whole group, because I love to and because it provides so many rich opportunities for modeling effective reading strategies. No matter how strong or struggling a reader, everyone is passionately involved and has something to offer in response. We model strategies for making sense of difficult text, noticing elements of an author's style, questioning twists in plot, anticipating what impact they'll have on the central conflict, and so on. We also come together as a class for mini-lessons; we may talk about how authors develop character, setting, and plot, or simply delight in gorgeous descriptive language.<P>

Then the kids spin off to read independently, looking for examples in their own text to record in their journals, and return once again, eager to share with their classmates. Throughout, I'm looking for evidence that they've begun to incorporate the strategies we've modeled and discussed into their own reading behaviors.<P>

As that elusive sense of community begins to grow, I ask my kids to again write letters--this time requesting a partner they'd like to read with. Their letters are always very touching, often containing the beginnings of insights about what makes them tick as readers as well as a growing level of awareness or curiosity about their classmates. Though it may seem simpler to group by "ability" as determined by test scores, I've found this process invaluable for both assessing strengths and needs, and for bringing my kids closer together. They truly come to appreciate the child who may not read fluently or quickly, but who has a sensitive and insightful soul and responds in genuine ways to good books.

<A NAME="club"></A>
<H3>Book Club: The Ultimate Reading Group</H3>
By the time we return from winter break, the kids are ripe for something more, and so they begin to form book clubs, a goal we've been edging toward since the very first day of school. I ask them to reflect on and write about what qualities they'd be looking for in a group of kids to read with. Their responses nearly always make me laugh and cry, but mostly fill me with wonder at how attuned they've become to their own styles and those of others.<P>

But our book clubs are not formed by letters alone. Inspired by colleagues and workshops at Columbia University's Teachers College, I ask kids to write ads for themselves, patterned after the personal ads in the local paper--only instead of advertising their marital status, hobbies, and hair color, they sell themselves as 
readers. "Desperately seeking a voracious reader like me, a fast reader, a love to read for pleasure reader!" reads Amy's ad, while Angel's reads, "I'm a medium reader who loves mysteries, but might need some help with hard words." The ads are anonymous and identified only by made-up post office-box numbers. They're hung prominently in the classroom for several days so kids have a chance to read and enjoy them, then respond to the ones they find appealing. Based on their responses, I play matchmaker.<P>

The resulting book clubs of three or four kids choose their own books, set their own weekly goals and agendas, and choose their own journal assignments for homework, drawn from the many possibilities we've worked on for months. They even choose their own names, from '90s Girls to The Bookworms. With all these choices to make, kids soon face the need to negotiate and compromise.

<H3>An Endless Learning Dance</H3>
There are times every day when my head spins with the whirl of group activity in my classroom. It strikes me as remarkable that my kids manage to move so fluidly into and out of the various configurations their day demands. And, yes, there are times when I stand in the midst of the chaos and am consumed with doubt. It's at those times that I try to see through the eyes of that visiting teacher to renew my faith in my kids, so that I can answer her simply and truthfully: "Yes, they are amazing, aren't they?"<P>

<H2>Study Life Cycles with Butterflies</H2>
<H3>Kids can use this butterfly unit to investigate changes in their own lives<P>
By <A HREF ="../info/columnists.html#kepler">Lynne Kepler</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

Nearly a dozen monarch caterpillars occupy the small aquarium each September. As each new school year begins, my three children gather caterpillars from the leaves of the milkweed plants that grow along the roadside, make a home for them, and watch them grow. Every year, my kids are astounded by the incredible change from caterpillar to striking, black-and-orange butterfly. And every year, I'm awed by the change and growth in my kids. Here you'll find fresh, hands--on investigations that compare butterfly and human life cycles-and help you connect math and science, too.<P>

<H3>HANDS-ON SCIENCE: FROM CATERPILLARS TO BUTTERFLIES</H3>

<STRONG>Concepts:</STRONG> Insects undergo dramatic changes throughout their life cycle. All living things change during their lifetimes.<P>

<STRONG>Skills:</STRONG> observing, predicting, measuring, communicating, comparing, and contrasting.

<A NAME="vocabulary"></A>
<H3>Vocabulary</H3>

<STRONG>caterpillar:</STRONG> the larval stage of a butterfly or moth<P>

<STRONG>chrysalis:</STRONG> the hard shell covering the pupa; shaped like an upside down teardrop<P>

<STRONG>larva:</STRONG> the second stage of metamorphosis, during which an insect is wormlike and has new wings<P>

<STRONG>pupa:</STRONG> the third stage of metamorphosis; encased by a chrysalis<P>

<STRONG>metamorphosis:</STRONG> a series of developmental stages often marked by body changes

<A NAME="finding"></A>
<H3>Finding the Caterpillars</H3>
The best way to find caterpillars is to locate their food source. Monarch caterpillars feed only on milkweed. Several species of this common wildflower grow throughout the United States. To find the yellow-black-and-white-striped caterpillars, lift the plant's leaves. Gently pull the caterpillars off and transport them in a ventilated jar to school. If you'd rather purchase caterpillars, see the resource box on the next page for ordering information.

<A NAME="making"></A>
<H3>Making the Habitats</H3>
To care for the caterpillars, you will need a container that allows them to get air and to move around. A small aquarium with a screen lid works well. If you wish to have groups of students make their own caterpillar habitats, here is an easy way to do it.
<OL>
<LI>For each group of students, gather two plastic 2-liter soda bottles (emptied and cleaned) and a small piece of window screening.<P>

<LI>Cut the top off around the shoulder of one of the bottles, as shown. (If working with younger students, cut the bottles for them.)<P>

<LI>To make a lid for the habitat, set the base of the second bottle in warm water and then pull it off. Cut a piece of wire screen to fit inside the lid. Tape the screen in place. This will give the caterpillars a place to attach themselves and keep them from escaping.<P>

<LI>Add the caterpillars and a few fresh, moist leaves-the kind your caterpillar eats-to the habitat. (If you order a butterfly kit, you'll get the food with it.) Replace the food supply as needed.
</OL>

<A NAME="activities"></A>
<H3>Activities Kids Love</H3>
It takes about two weeks for a caterpillar to become a chrysalis. Here are some investigations your students can do as you watch the caterpillars grow.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Make a bar graph.</STRONG> Ask students: How much do the caterpillars grow? Do they all grow at the same rate? To find out, students can measure the caterpillars using a piece of yarn. Cut the yarn to match the length of each caterpillar, then tape the yarn pieces to a sheet of 9-by-12-inch construction paper. Record the date on the paper next to the pieces of yarn. Students can do this every few days, creating a bar graph of the caterpillars' growth.<P>

<LI>Make a line graph. Invite older students to use rulers to measure the caterpillars' growth daily and record their data in a notebook. Students can determine the average daily growth rate of their caterpillars. They may also make a line graph noting any growth spurts or plateaus. Do the students notice any patterns?<P>

<LI>Keep daily diaries. How does a caterpillar change? Students can keep daily journals, describing in words and pictures the caterpillars'  changes. Once the caterpillars have become chrysalises, invite students to make a sketch in their journals of what they think the butterfly will look like, then make another sketch when the butterfly emerges. After the butterflies have emerged, move them to an aquarium to observe for a day or two before releasing them. Place a wet sponge in a dish so they have water to drink.
</UL>

<A NAME="circle"></A>
<H3>Extension Activity: Circle of Life</H3>
Discuss with students how the butterfly develops through four stages of metamorphosis-egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly). The adult barely resembles the larval stage in appearance or behavior. This is known as a complete metamorphosis.<P>

Invite students to compare the butterflies' growth and changes with their own growth and development. Ask them to bring in pictures of themselves as infants and toddlers. Using these photos and their caterpillar charts and diaries, students can create two circles of life-one for the butterfly and one for themselves. To make a circle of life, each student will need two sheets of white construction paper, a file folder, and a brass paper fastener. Here's how to assemble the circles.
<OL>
<LI>Glue two sheets of paper together along one edge. Mark and cut out a 1-inch window from the top sheet.<P>

<LI>Cut out a circle from the file folder. The diameter of the circle should just about match the width of the paper. Poke a small hole through the center of the circle.<P>

<LI>Have students paste their photos or caterpillar/butterfly drawings onto the circle, as shown.<P>

<LI>Insert the circle between the sheets of paper, leaving one edge of the circle-which will now function as the
 wheel-exposed. Adjust so that each picture shows up through the window when you turn the wheel.<P>

<LI>Using the paper fastener, fasten together the wheel and the paper, then glue the paper edges, leaving only the section with the wheel edge open.<P>

<LI>Students can share their circles with each other, narrating the changes seen through the window.<P>

<LI>Students can also use photographs of parents, grandparents, and so on to create more life-cycle wheels. Invite students to brainstorm what other kinds of life cycles they can depict.

<H2>Character Education by the Book</H2>
<H3>Two teachers tell you how they use literature to explore universal values.<P>
By <A HREF ="#logan">Claudia Logan</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

If someone were to ask you whether you include character education in your curriculum, you might pause before answering. But if you were asked whether you address issues of respect, honesty, loyalty, and tolerance with your students, your response would most likely be yes.<P>

In this article you'll meet two teachers--Penny Levy from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Jean Johnson of Boston, Massachusetts-- who explore these basic values, harnessing the power of literature and discussion to help students grapple with difficult questions about friendship, courage, and fairness. Jean Johnson describes her move toward character education this way: "Given the mixed messages kids are getting from television and movies, and increasing social problems around us, you have to enter your classroom prepared to address big issues."<P>

To help you build a character education program of your own--and select books you can use to launch discussions--please choose from the following:<P>

<LI><A HREF="#everyday">The Issue of Everyday Life (Plus connecting to parents)</A>

<LI><A HREF="#character">Why Character Development Counts</A>

</UL>

<A NAME="guiding"></A>
<H3>Guiding the Discussion</H3>
At East Hills International Studies Academy, a public magnet school in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reading/language arts teacher Penny Levy works with third and fourth graders using the Heartwood Program, a trade-book-based curriculum designed around seven universal values: courage, loyalty, justice, respect, hope, honesty and love. (For more information on the Heartwood program, see <A HREF="#resources">Resources</A>). From the first day of school, Penny wants her students to feel they can put themselves on the line during discussions.<P>

Jean Johnson, who teaches first grade at the Advent School in Boston, selects books to address the same values as Penny does, though she doesn't use a structured program. 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Choosing Books</STRONG><BR>
"Using books to teach character education works," says Jean. "Good literature serves as a neutralizer in a discussion about character and ethics," she says, "and students can comfortably discuss the problems and choices faced by a book's character without the sting of infringing on anyone's personal beliefs or background." But, Jean cautions, careful thought has to go into choosing books that will inspire students to consider and express different perspectives. When making your selections, Jean and Penny both advise that you look for books that: feature children making difficult choices; enrich children's experiences with other cultures; explore problems children can grasp; and are not written around a particular message or an obvious choice.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Naming Specific Character Attributes</STRONG><BR>
Penny sees her role in book discussions as that of a neutral facilitator. Here is a glimpse of a discussion about <EM>Fire on the Mountain</EM>, the story of Alemayu, an Ethiopian shepherd boy who wins a bet with a rich man, but is cheated out of his prize.<P>

"I think the rich man showed disrespect when he didn't believe Alemayu knew about fire, but Alemayu and his sister showed hope by believing they could get up the mountain," says one of Penny's third graders.<P>

"I think Alemayu was honest when he was scared on the mountain, but he had the courage to get up there," says another.<P>

As part of the Heartwood approach, the children are naming specific attributes they see in a character, using a vocabulary they all share. This helps children identify behaviors in characters--and in life--that express these traits. In time, children apply what they've learned to their own choices.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Using visual aids</STRONG><BR>
When Jean leads a discussion, she likes to use charts at certain points to frame children's comments and to build connections between literature and kids' lives. After discussing <EM>Sheila Rae, the Brave</EM> by Kevin Henkes and <EM>Brave Irene</EM> by William Steig, Jean invites students to list on a big chart all the 
things they have done that showed courage.<P>

"I swung really high," says one girl, motioning with her hands.<P>

"I climbed this really big fence near our house," adds a boy.<P>

 Children added tree climbing, swimming in deep water, and taking a turn on a scary ride at a park. Then Jean switches direction. "Those are all situations where you were brave about something that you did that was physical," she says, running an index finger down the list. "Can you think of a situation at home or somewhere else where you were brave but where you didn't have to do something physical like climb a tree?"<P>

Children mention not being afraid of the dark or meeting a dog for the first time. When their ideas fill the chart, Jean redirects her class to consider more "feeling situations" and asks the class if they could think of a time in which someone had to be brave with a person or a group.<P>

A student mentions Tomie dePaola's <EM>Oliver Button Is a Sissy</EM>, a story about a boy who isn't afraid to play with dolls. Soon the children are comparing notes on whether boys and girls really can do all the same things. Jean lets the conversation flow.<P>

"Girls can't luge race," said one boy.<P>

"That's not true," responds one girl hotly. "Girls can luge race. But maybe not in the Olympics," she adds in an uncertain voice.<P>

Jean believes that helping children see how missing information can misinform-and how basing an opinion on a single experience can lead to misunderstandings-is one of the most important things teachers can do to broaden children's thinking.
</UL>

<A NAME="everyday"></A>
<H3>The Issues of Everyday Life</H3>
While Jean and Penny know in advance many of the books and positive attributes they plan to address during the year, they're very aware that discussions about these concepts are most effective when linked to the everyday life of the classroom.<P>

Jean's first graders, for example, often have a hard time sharing math manipulatives and other materials during the first few months of school. Jean reads aloud <EM>Harriet's Halloween Candy</EM> by Nancy Carlson, a book about sharing candy, and follows it up by reading <EM>Bet You Can't</EM> by Penny Dale, which is about sharing chores.<P>

From there, Jean and her students move on to a story like <EM>My Mama Needs Me</EM> by Mildred Pitts Walter, about a family with a new baby, to explore how sharing is connected to the concept of love. Jean reads these books and others over a period of a few days, or even a few weeks. "Then, throughout the year, we might revisit some of these books and concepts, as things happen," says Jean, stressing that her students "are able to bring more of their experiences and insights to issues they have previously discussed."<P>

Using the Heartwood Program, Penny Levy also links the discussion of a universal attribute to the familiar terrain of students' experiences. Recently, she led a talk about Demi's <EM>The Empty Pot</EM>, a Chinese folktale about honesty. <P>

After reading the story, Penny asked students: "Have you ever worried about a time when you had to tell the truth but knew you might get into trouble?" Penny encouraged them to think about their responses before talking, and to share something only if they felt comfortable. After a few minutes, Penny asked them to share their stories with a partner.<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Going Beyond the Books </STRONG><BR>
In addition to guiding class discussions, Penny and Jean give their students opportunities to reflect individually on their reading, often by writing their response to a story in a journal. Kids also work with partners or in small groups, writing together, talking together, sharing book-journal entries, and creating book-based projects such as murals, poetry, and stories.<P>

Penny and her third graders also tie community-service activities to their reading. "Once a month we celebrate the attribute we've been reading about with an activity," says Penny. "When we explored hope, students said they hoped things would be better for people who were struggling, so they donated vegetables to a soup kitchen."<P>

Jean and Penny also work hard to practice what they espouse. "Kids learn so much from the way we treat them," says Penny. "They are always watching us. I am much more aware of what I am modeling now that I've worked with the Heartwood Program." Penny feels the changes in her teaching are subtle, but profound. "I am more consistent and more aware of being fair," she observes.<P>
	
<LI><STRONG>The Parent Connection</STRONG><BR>
Penny and Jean both use newsletters to update parents on books the children are reading and attributes or issues being discussed. Both recommend books for parents to read to their children. The Heartwood Program includes discussion questions for parents, to go along with the books. Jean prefers to let such conversations between parents and their children develop on their own.<P>

Penny invites parents to come to the classroom to read books and share their own stories. "One mother had struggled to become an attorney while working and raising a family," says Penny. "She had a difficult time balancing everything, but she passed the bar and is now a practicing attorney. She talked to students about justice, but when my students heard her story, they told her she is an example of courage and hope."<P>

Neither teacher has ever experienced any resistance from parents, in part, they believe, because of the ongoing communication between home and school, and because it is made clear that no classroom discussion will infringe on a family's beliefs or personal values.
</UL>

<A NAME="talk"></A>
<H3>When Talk Spins Out of Control</H3>
What do you do when a student says something insulting or prejudicial during a book discussion? Lynn Murphy, director of the Reading for Real literature program at the Developmental Studies Center in Oakland, California, shares her techniques.<P>
<OL>
<LI>Politely ask the student what experience or facts he or she is basing the opinion on. Guide him or her to see how this viewpoint might change with more information.<P>

<LI>Stop the discussion and ask the class to imagine that someone who might be hurt by a remark is sitting in on the discussion.<P>

<LI>If the comments are really out of line, it is reasonable for you to tell the student that the comments are inappropriate for school and ask him or her to stop.
</OL>

<A NAME="character"></A>
<H3>Why Character Development Counts</H3>
A talk with Eleanor Childs, founder of the Heartwood Institute, a nonprofit ethics program that uses multicultural literature to help children understand the attributes of courage, loyalty, justice, respect, hope, honesty, and love.<P>

<STRONG>Q: What led you, as a practicing lawyer, to start the Heartwood Institute?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A:</STRONG> After practicing criminal defense law for 15 years, I got very discouraged because I was working with a lot of death-penalty cases. I began to defend juveniles, because with juvenile law there is the opportunity to show why a child is amenable to treatment. So there is some hope in the system. But I was still dealing with some terrible crimes. In one case five boys tied an elderly couple to two chairs facing each other and then slit their throats. When I asked them about what they had done, one boy criticized another for not having the courage to do some particular part of the murder.<P>

I began to wonder what they thought courage was. I saw the same confusion over terms like respect and loyalty. Hope seemed the hardest concept for them to grasp.<P>

<STRONG>Q: What did you decide?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A:</STRONG> At first I blamed TV, which does play a part in some of the violence we see. I blamed drugs and the breakdown of the family, but then I began to think a lot about culture and about how so much of our understanding of character comes from stories.<P>

I began to read Native American and Chinese tales and other cultural stories. Since the beginning of time, wisdom has been passed from the elders to the young through stories. These living histories hold the key to life and the important lessons that keep a society strong.<P>

We have exposed our children to violent images without the guidance and nurturing needed to help them make hard decisions and choices. Children have big hearts if developed with care, and they must be helped to understand that the mind must work along with the heart--that they need to think before acting. This impulsive acting, by the way, is not limited to inner-city youth. We must all gather our children around the campfire.<P>

<STRONG>Q: How did this lead you to Heartwood?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A:</STRONG> At the time, one of my children had a wonderful first-grade teacher named Pat Woods, who got everyone in her class excited about reading. Meanwhile, I was watching the crime rate escalate and waiting for the government to take some action. I realized that a grassroots approach would create the firmest base.<P>

I turned to Pat and called in two elementary master teachers who were eager to contribute to a curriculum focused on ethical understanding and character development. We studied Lawrence Kohlberg, Jean Piaget, Carol Gilligan, and all the experts. We knew our curriculum should use fine multicultural literature. We read mountains of children's stories and commentaries on character education. For years we met every week around a kitchen table and tried to figure out which values on our list of 58 were universal. We settled on seven: courage, loyalty, justice, respect, hope, honesty, and love. The program we piloted in the Pittsburgh school system has grown from there.<P>

<STRONG>Q: What do you say to people who feel character education doesn't belong in school?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A:</STRONG> School is the perfect place--as a support to the home--for this kind of education to happen because of the time quotient. Children really need to learn these basic concepts as early as possible. These are basic universal ideas that teachers already deal with every day. We are not asking teachers to take over the role of parents. We're using the program in fact to draw parents into the school.

<H2>Learning with Literature:</H2>
<H3>About Friendship and Love<P>
By <A HREF ="../info/columnists.html#freeman">Judy Freeman</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

Students spend a lot of time and energy on establishing new friendships, nurturing old ones, and fitting in. What better literature link could there be than to regale them with stories about overcoming obstacles to friendships and tales about the quest for love and acceptance?<P>

<H3>Making and Keeping Friends</H3>

<EM><STRONG>The Lettuce Leaf Birthday Letter</STRONG></EM> by Linda Taylor, illustrated by Julie Durrell (Dial, 1995); 32 pages; Grades PreK-2; $14.99.<BR>
Duck is so proud of the colorful picture he has just painted on a big, crisp lettuce leaf for best friend Goose's birthday. Not knowing how to write, he tells the mail rabbit of the letter's destination, which absentminded Rabbit promptly forgets. Instead, he delivers the leaf first to toothachy Beaver; then indignant, lovelorn Pig; and later to nearsighted Owl, whose specs are missing. Although Rabbit succeeds in helping each solve his or her problem, by the time he arrives at Goose's cottage, she is distraught over being forgotten by her best friend. She is baffled but pleased when Rabbit finally presents her with the now limp, soggy, and partially nibbled masterpiece. The cheerful and endearing gouache and watercolor artwork will make this a story-time favorite. Ask your students to talk about the treasures they could make to express their affection for a best friend.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Lizzie Logan Wears Purple Sunglasses</STRONG></EM> by Eileen Spinelli, illustrated by Melanie Hope Greenberg (Simon & Schuster, 1995); 122 pages; Grades 2-5; $14.<BR>
The day eight-year-old Heather moves into her new house, she is taken aback by imperious ten-year-old Lizzie, who claims to smoke, tells her that the previous owner of the house was eaten by a spider plant, and fishes in a neighbor's puddle using a meatball for bait. Sassy and outspoken, Lizzie says things like "Holy crab cakes," and even stages a funeral for Heather's dead cricket, Hoppy. This new best friend is far from being all sweetness and light, which is why your students will ultimately take to her quirky, prickly personality, as does Heather in spite of herself.<P>

Compare the development of another unlikely friendship in P. J. Petersen's <EM><STRONG>I Hate Company</STRONG></EM> (illustrated by Betsy James; Dutton, 1994; 87 pages; Grades 2-4; $12.99), in which Dan's mother invites a newly divorced college chum and her manic three-year-old son, Jimmy, to stay in their apartment while "Aunt Kay" looks for a new job. Dan does his best to cope with the little terror--who wrecks books, shoves crayons up Dan's nose, and listens incessantly to a tape of "The Three Little Pigs"--and eventually learns to like him. Students can write about and share their own humorous adventures with friends.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Crazy Lady!</STRONG></EM> by Jane Leslie Conly (HarperCollins, 1993); 180 pages; Grades 5-8; $12.89.<BR>
In 1981, the year after his mother died, seventh grader Vernon Dibbs first meets his neighbors--crazy Maxine Flooter and her mentally handicapped teenage son, Ronald. Vernon's Baltimore neighborhood is a rough one, and his first reaction is to join his friends in tormenting the volatile, unstable, and alcoholic woman. However, a chance encounter with Maxine in a grocery store allows Vernon to view her as a person. When she realizes Vernon is struggling in English, she even arranges for a former schoolteacher, Miss Annie, to tutor him. As payment, Miss Annie asks him to help Maxine clean up her yard and to look after Ronald, a hapless, nonverbal, frightened, and gawky boy. Reluctantly at first, Vernon gets entwined in Ronald's life and organizes a neighborhood carnival to raise money for sneakers for Ronald to wear to the Special Olympics. Your class may want to know more about getting involved in the Special Olympics after reading this book, but the real legacy of this powerful and complex story is its message about overcoming--or at least confronting--life's many obstacles and heartbreaks.

<A NAME="endings"></A>
<H3>Bittersweet Endings</H3>

<EM><STRONG>Murphy and Kate</STRONG></EM> by Ellen Howard, illustrated by Mark Graham (Simon & Schuster, 1995); 32 pages; Grades 1-4; $15.<BR>
After Kate's dog, Murphy, dies, she can't imagine living without him, ever feeling happy again, or forgetting him, as people claim she will. In a poignantly affectionate remembrance of their 14 years together, illustrated with soft oil paintings, the book shows Kate and Murphy growing up together as inseparable companions. A grieving Kate will carry on without him and even learn to be happy again, "one step at a time," by remembering the times they shared.<P>

To further explore kids' devotion to their pets, read Joanne Ryder's <EM><STRONG>Without Words</STRONG></EM> (photographs by Barbara Sonneborn; Sierra Club, 1995; 32 pages; Grades K-8; $15.95), a poetic musing on the love between humans and animals. The large color photos show children and adults hugging and playing with a variety of animals, including a Bengal tiger, an elephant, a manatee, and two corn snakes. Use Ryder's quote, "Sometimes, without words, we can make a bridge to reach another unlike us," to start a dialogue about likely and unlikely friendships.<P>


<EM><STRONG>Phoenix Rising</STRONG></EM> by Karen Hesse (Henry Holt, 1994); 182 pages; Grades 5-8; $15.95.<BR>
Sometimes science can go horribly wrong, as it did at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. In this moving novel about a fictional nuclear accident, 13-year-old Nyle's Gran has taken in two strangers, evacuees from the nearby   power plant--Mrs. Trent and her 15-year-old son, Ezra, who is dying from radiation poisoning. It has been a week since the nuclear accident that emptied Boston and contaminated the New England countryside, and Nyle is overwhelmed by the enormity of the changes in her life. "I'm not making friends with a dead boy," she insists, but she is drawn to Ezra, and in her compelling first-person narration, describes his temporary recovery and inevitable relapse. Pick up on Nyle's allusions to Anne Frank--"You were an ordinary girl forced into an extraordinary situation. Your death keeps all of us from forgetting what you died for"--in your discussions on courage, responsibility, and survival.

<A NAME="love"></A>
<H3>Love and Marriage</H3>
<EM><STRONG>The Faithful Friend</STRONG></EM> by Robert D. San Souci, illustrated by Brian Pinkney (Simon & Schuster, 1995); 40 pages; Grades 3-6; $16.<BR>
On the Caribbean island of Martinique in the last century lived Clement and Hippolyte, who were raised closely together as brothers. Clement falls in love with a painting of Pauline, even though she is the niece of <EM>quimboiseur</EM> (wizard) Monsieur Zabocat. So Clement and Hippolyte journey to meet Pauline at her uncle's plantation, stopping along the way to bury the body of an unfortunate beggar. Pauline's acceptance of Clement's marriage proposal enrages her uncle, who unleashes a murderous revenge to be carried out by three zombie women. Meanwhile, Hippolyte overhears their plot and subverts the murderers three times, even though he knows his interference will cause him to turn to stone. True love and friendship win out in the end of this dramatic and brooding folktale, which is accompanied by huge, gorgeous oil and scratchboard illustrations, and includes a glossary and pronunciation guide of the Creole-flavored French words.<P>

Another mesmerizing tale of transformation and romance is Marilyn Singer's <EM><STRONG>The Maiden on the Moor</STRONG></EM> (illustrated by Troy Howell; Morrow, 1995; 40 pages; Grades 3-6; $15), adapted from a medieval English song about a lonely shepherd who falls in love with the beautiful, unconscious woman he finds lying in the snow.<P>

<EM><STRONG>The Three Princes: A Tale from the Middle East</STRONG></EM> by Eric Kimmell, illustrated by Leonard Everett Fisher (Holiday House, 1994); 32 pages; Grades 1-4; $15.95.<BR>
In order to win the princess's hand, three cousins--Princes Fahad, Muhammed, and Mohsen--heed her command "to bring back the rarest thing you find in your travels" and set out in different directions on camelback, across the desert and into the world for one year. The three princes meet up at year's end to compare their newfound wonders: a crystal ball, a flying carpet, and a healing orange. The princess gets sick and the princes rush home to save her. Now the princess must decide which of the princes' objects was most responsible for saving her life. Tell students to stop reading the story here and debate which suitor she should choose, and why. This folktale, with its bold acrylic paintings, also makes a wonderful play, transcribed as reader's theater.<P>

Of the three foolish princes in the good-natured Italian folktale <EM><STRONG>The Frog Princess</STRONG></EM> by Laura Cecil (illustrated by Emma Chichester Clark; Greenwillow, 1995; 32 pages; Grades K-4; $16), the queen declares that whomever marries the cleverest wife shall become king. Assign a group of children to work on scripts for these and other folktales, and then stage readings of each.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Catherine, Called Birdy</STRONG></EM> by Karen Cushman (Clarion, 1994); 169 pages; Grades 6-9; $14.95.<BR>
Fourteen-year-old Catherine's diary of 1290 chronicles a year of rebellious outbursts against her family's attempts to tame her and to make her more dutiful and domestically inclined as befitting the daughter of a minor nobleman. Catherine's hilarious attempts to scare off every prospective husband her father dredges up for her--along with pungent details about the era's food, sanitation, clothing, activities, religion, and customs--will be a delight to classes studying the Middle Ages. Though she blackens her teeth and acts like a fool, it appears Catherine may not be able to stop negotiations of marriage with Shaggy Beard, a lord old enough to be her father. A Newbery Honor book (and well deserving of the award), this was my favorite American fiction book of 1994.

<A NAME="relationships"></A>
<H3>Complicated Relationships</H3>

<EM><STRONG>The Arkadians</STRONG></EM> by Lloyd Alexander (Dutton, 1995); 272 pages; Grades 6-8; $15.99.<BR>
My antiquated college dictionary defines Arcadia as "a mountainous district in ancient Greece, proverbial for the contented pastoral simplicity of its people." Master tale-weaver Alexander takes us there in a quest that is every bit as eventful as the first paragraph promises: "This is the tale of a jackass and a young bean counter, a girl of marvels and mysteries, horsemen swift as wind, Goat Folk, Daughters of Morning, voyages, tempest, terrors, and disasters. And the occasional rainbow." When Lucian, an accountant to King Bromios, makes the mistake of uncovering evidence of corruption in the palace storehouse, his only option is to escape before two thieving royal soothsayers silence him for good. On his way, Lucian encounters Fronto, a talking donkey who was a human poet before he swam in a forbidden pool. The two join Joy-in-the-Dance, a young pythoness oracle on her way to the mountains to see the Lady of Wild Things. The Lady's feminist followers have been persecuted by the male-dominated Bear tribe and have been driven into hiding. We root for the budding attraction between Bear tribe member Lucian and Joy-in-the-Dance, who turns out to be the daughter of the Lady. Their union raises hopes for a new society based on peace, knowledge, and reconciliation of the sexes.<P>

Shirley Climo's <EM><STRONG>Atalanta's Race: A Greek Myth</STRONG></EM> (illustrated by Alexander Koshkin; Clarion, 1995; 32 pages; Grades 3-5; $15.95) is an apt accompaniment to Alexander's high-spirited Greek myth-based fantasy. Infuriated that his newborn child is not a boy, King Iasus orders the baby girl to be cast out on a mountain slope to die. Instead, she is found and raised by a she-bear and then taken in by a hunter. Atalanta grows up not believing in love and agrees to wed the man who can outrun her in a race, declaring that the penalty for defeat is death.<P>

<H2>Teaching Kids To Listen To Themselves</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF="../info/columnists.html#graves">Donald H. Graves</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

"Pay attention, Donald." I heard those words throughout my school years. "Donald could do good work if only he'd pay attention in class," was scribbled with regularity on my report cards. I tuned out the voices of my teachers and struggled to listen to an interesting voice in my head. My experience is probably true for many students today. Here's how to nurture that listening to help build kids' writing skills.<P>

<A NAME="listening"></A>
<H3>Why Listening Matters</H3>
Make no mistake, children do need to pay attention--but most of their listening diet requires them to attend to someone else and forget their own thoughts. We work very hard to teach children to listen to us, believing that once this goal is achieved, children will listen to themselves. This simply does not follow.<P>

What does this have to do with nurturing young writers? Everything. Learning to listen is at the heart of sound teaching, learning, and writing. When we listen carefully to children, we teach them to listen to themselves. We begin to help them construct an inner voice and formulate their own questions. We help them begin to trust themselves and their experiences, and to take responsibility for the thinking that responsible choices require. 
They observe the teacher asking herself questions, and therefore learn to ask such questions as, "What is this piece about?"<P>

Children who cannot listen to themselves find it almost impossible to revise, set learning objectives, set a plan of action for solving a problem with a piece of writing, or entertain other points of view. I worry about children who play the game of school so well that they only consider what a teacher thinks while neglecting what they hold to be true to themselves. Sadly, many children have no one to listen to them at home nor are they witness to others who consider alternatives when solving problems. We need to help these children and we can help them.

<A NAME="focus"></A>
<H3>Focus on Listening to Kids</H3>
Take about ten minutes tomorrow morning, while the children write, to walk around the class with no other objective in mind than to listen to children teach you about what they know. Here is how I might engage a student:<P>

"I see you got that period in just the right place, Mark. How did you know how to do that?" I ask.<P>

"Did I? Hmm, let me see. I guess it was just the end of that thought. I'm not sure," Mark says. <P>

In this instance, I've turned the child back to consider what he has done and why. I've reminded him that thinking often goes into decisions regarding the use of conventions.<P>

I peer over Lisa's shoulder, reading her story. "So, you've got a new kitten. What's she like?"<P>

"She's crazy. She plays all the time."<P>

"Is she yours?"<P>

"No, she's my mom's, but I get to take care of her most of the time and Mom lets me feed her. The last one we had got killed. We live on a busy street."<P>

I ask Lisa more questions. She teaches me what she knows about her topic. In the course of our conversation, I've made Lisa aware that she knows quite a bit about her cat and that she is able to converse freely about the subject. Best of all, I confirm her voice in the simple fact that she has something to say. She will now balance what I've said with her own ideas for the piece; the ultimate test of good listeners is that they are able to listen to 
others while listening to themselves.<P>

After talking with Lisa, I move from child to child, focusing on just one thing--the child teaching me.

<A NAME="model"></A>
<H3>Model Listening to Yourself</H3>
Children seldom see us in the midst of solving the kinds of problems they face every day.  They need to literally hear the language we use, the questions we have, as we listen to ourselves.<P>

One good way to do this is through an exercise I call Reading the World, through which I show children how I choose writing topics. I jot down notes on the overhead as I speak:<P>

"Yesterday I went snowshoeing and it was bone cold," I say to students. "We had a fresh 12 inches of snow and I wanted to walk my land. You know, I just like to walk the same piece of land again and again like I did when I was your age, about ten. Each time I walk I try to see new things. I wonder why I get such satisfaction out of that?"<P>

I jot down <EM>snowshoeing, wonder why I like it?</EM> on the overhead before continuing. Notice that I wonder aloud and ask myself questions. I scribble down memories and associations that strike me. I do a lot of "that reminds me" kind of thinking.<P>

I continue this process for about ten minutes, considering a wide range of remembrances from yesterday's walk. The process of wondering, hypothesizing, and considering is essential to the development of inner language. I can't tell a child how to think, I can only show what "inside thinking" looks like.

<A NAME="tips"></A>
<H3>Four Tips for Listening Well</H3>
When visitors come to schools where my colleagues and I have worked, they are struck by the quality of listening between children. Here are some ways to cultivate this in your own classroom.<P>
<OL>
<LI>Show children that you hear what they say. "Let me see if I have this right," I might say to a student. "What you said was that the snake sort of rose up on its tail, then started winding through the branches. Pretty soon it got higher and you could hardly tell the snake from the branches. Is that what you said? Did I get it right?"<P>

<LI>Acknowledge points of view. "Let's hear some different viewpoints on how we can solve some of the problems we encounter when we first enter the room in the morning," I might say to students. "First, let's look at what they are. Then I want some solutions backed by your reasons." It's not enough for a student to have an opinion; opinions require facts.<P>

<LI>Reduce your own speaking. Spend more of your time helping children speak and inform you of what they know and what they feel.<P>

<LI>Slow down. Many of us teach a hyperactive curriculum in hyperactive communities. We spring from subject to subject, bulldozing our way through children's lives. We bypass children's initiative, teach them to tune us out, and jeopardize one of the most important skills they need-the ability to listen carefully to themselves. If you can slow the pace, your students will learn more quickly.

<H2>Creating a Productive Writing Environment</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF="../info/columnists.html#graves">Donald H. Graves</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>


Two children poke one another. Five or six others wander aimlessly around the room. I lean down to help a child with her writing and she doesn't even know this is writing time. I hear a sudden noise at my back, and someone yells, "Ouch!"<P>

This is one of my recurring bad dreams. I have it about once a month, even though I am retired from the 
classroom. I suspect this is a common dream for anyone working in our profession. Most teachers struggle with classroom organization throughout their professional lives. I hope the following suggestions ease some of the struggle--at least on the writing front.<P>

<A NAME="hard"></A>
<H3>Why Writing is Hard--And Why Classroom Set-Up Can Help</H3>
Because during writing children choose writing topics, confer with each other, and are constantly starting new 
pieces, more structure is required than in other subject areas. Writing brings out the itch in most of us. Think
 back to that last course paper you wrote. Two lines in and you're up and moving for a cup of coffee; you pick up a telephone and call a friend, pray for incoming telephone calls, order a pizza. Why? Putting words on a blank page is like looking in the mirror. You face yourself and you may not like what you see, especially if you are not used to writing regularly. You fear that you will not live up to your aspirations. You hear the words of others: "Did you write that awful stuff?"<P>

The same is true for children--and it's even more true for children who do not write every day. When children write only a couple times a week, in effect they are writing as if they are starting on a blank page. As a result, they will have a hard time settling down to work.<P>

Your goal is not a silent writing time. It is natural to talk during writing. Examine a class in painting, ceramics,
 knitting, woodworking, any craft where the hands are used, and you find people speaking. Of course, children have to learn to modulate their voices in order not to interfere with others who may be deeply involved with their pieces. The following guidelines provide other ways to foster a productive writing environment.

<A NAME="rules"></A>
<H3>Six Writing Time Rules</H3>
During writing time, expect children to follow these guidelines.
<OL>
<LI>Write continuously on subjects you, the student, choose. (Among other benefits, giving students choice 
eliminates the disruption that can occur when students wait for you to "okay" their new topics, or to give them 
topics.)<P>

<LI>After finishing one piece, you may take a short break by reading, drawing, or completing other work before beginning another piece.<P>

<LI>When you finish a piece, put it in your work folder. Keep all your writing papers in the folder. If you take your folder home, bring it back the next day.<P>

<LI>Store paper, folders, and writing implements in one place and do not waste them.<P>

<LI>If you need specific help, first ask two other students, then consult with the teacher.<P>

<LI>You may confer with others about your writing, but not for more than four or five minutes.
</OL>

<A NAME="responsibilities"></A>
<H3>Give Children Responsibilities</H3>
Beyond establishing guidelines for writing time, you and your students need to carve out rules and routines for the overall classroom. When you give children responsibility for the room's operation, they can better understand what makes it function, what derails it, and how disorder affects their writing.<P>

I like to plan ways for children to assume as many responsibilities as possible. Students can take care of writing supplies and materials in your centers, water plants, conduct classroom tours for visitors, and so on. You can rotate these jobs weekly.<P>

Showing visitors around the room is perhaps the most important job of all. The more children have to explain the room's operation, the more they have a stake in it running smoothly. You may wish to invite older children to visit, so the room guide of the week gains experience in going through the tours.<P>

From time to time, I ask the room guide to give me a tour. I might say to a child: "I'd like you to take me around the room and tell me how this place works."<P>

As the child takes me around, I ask questions like: What are these for? Would you please tell me what he is 
doing right now? . . .Oh, why is he doing that? When can children talk to each other? What do you do when you get stuck on this?<P>

I ask questions because I am interested in learning children's understanding of the purpose and function of the room's structure, their understanding of the limits, and how they solve problems. I note which areas and practices he or she highlights and leaves out.<P>

After the tour I will ask questions about room areas that the child has neglected. The child may have omitted 
these areas because he or she doesn't understand them as well as other areas. Through these discussions, I 
come to see which guidelines need clarifying.<P>	

As needed, the whole class and I discuss how the room can work more efficiently. We review such matters as why organization counts, the function of classroom materials, how the quiet area works, what to do when you are stuck on an idea or need help with punctuation, and how to work together.

<A NAME="reflections"></A>
<H3>Some Final Reflections</H3>
Writing can flourish in rooms with a predictable structure mutually designed by teachers and children. 
Cooperative structures build a strong sense of what the children are able to accomplish as an effective working 
group.<P>

Listen to your students speak about their room and their knowledge of work in progress, and you'll hear 
responses like: We can do these things.... This is the way we work here.... Timmy is writing about how his dog 
died.... Look at what Angie is drawing. It is language like this that demonstrates a structure that is working well in 
the classroom.<P>

Remember that there is simply no substitute for writing every day to establish classroom structure. Through 
daily writing, children develop their rhythms, their rituals of getting work done, and their rituals of consultation.<P>

<H3>Tap students' excitement with these number-sense problems<P>

<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

If we only had a quarter for each time an excited child talked about a birthday, we could solve any school district's budget crunch--and more. We don't, but we do capitalize on students' birthday enthusiasm by reading two delightful books--<EM>Only Six More Days</EM> by Marisabina Russo (Puffin, 1992) and <EM>On the Day You Were Born</EM> by Debra Frasier (Harcourt Brace, 1991). These books provide a context for engaging children in solving problems that involve counting, number sense, estimation, computation, and graphing.<P>

<A NAME="primary"></A>
<H3>Stephanie's Primary Lesson</H3>
<H4>About the Book</H4>
In <EM>Only Six More Days</EM>, Ben eagerly counts the days until his fifth birthday. He crosses off each day on the calendar, eagerly anticipating his party. Ben's sister, Molly, however, does not share his enthusiasm for the upcoming birthday bonanza. To help Molly deal with her feelings of jealousy, her mother points out where Molly's birthday falls on the calendar so Molly also can count the days until her own birthday.<P>

<STRONG>Step #1</STRONG><BR>
Read the story and give children time to talk about their birthdays. Then find out if any students have a birthday that month and ask the class: How many days until _______'s birthday? Invite students to work together to find the answer. (You may want to have some calendars on hand for reference.) Once students have completed their calculations, ask volunteers to share their answers and explain to classmates how they found them.<P>

<STRONG>Step #2</STRONG><BR>
Continue the discussion about birthdays by asking one child to write his or her name and age on the board or on chart paper. Ask other children who are the same age to write their names underneath. Then ask children whose ages are different to begin new columns and have classmates add their names underneath them.<P>

<STRONG>Step #3</STRONG><BR>
Once all children have recorded their names, ask students to find the total number of children who are each age and have them create statements about the results. Students may say something like: "There are more six-year-olds than any other" or "There are only six names on the seven-year-old list" or "Eighteen kids are six years old and six kids are seven." Record these statements on the board and ask children to explain how they used the data to make their statements. Finally, model mental addition by combining the number of children in each column to check that it equals the total number of students in class that day.<P>

<STRONG>Step #4</STRONG><BR>
Repeat this activity later in the year, varying the ways children record their ages. For example, one day list on the board the numbers that cover the ages of all of the students. Then have each child come up and make a tally mark next to the number that matches his or her age. (This lets you teach the children how to use a diagonal mark to indicate a group of five.) At another time, have each child write on a 3-by-3-inch stick-on note his or her name and age, then post it on the chalkboard. Ask for suggestions on how to organize the stick-on notes to show how    many students are of each age.<P>

<STRONG>Step #5 </STRONG><BR>
As a follow-up problem--or to challenge interested students-pose this question: If Ben's birthday were today,
 when would Molly's birthday be?

<A NAME="intermediate"></A>
<H3>Rusty's Intermediate Lesson</H3>
<H4>About the Book</H4>
In the award-winning book <EM>On the Day You Were Born</EM>, the sun, ocean, trees, animals, and people warmly welcome a new child into the world. "On the day you were born the Moon pulled on the ocean below and, wave by wave, a rising tide washed the beaches clean for your footprints . . ." begins one page. The book invites children to think about science in the world around them and gives you the opportunity to ask: How many days have you been alive since your birth?<P>

<STRONG>Step #1</STRONG><BR>
After you read the story to students, reread the page that begins "On the day you were born the Earth turned, the Moon pulled, the Sun flared . . ." Ask students: How long do you think it takes for the Earth to make a complete turn on its axis? How long does it take the Earth to orbit the Sun? Some students will know the answers, but don't be surprised if others don't. Establish for the entire class that it takes the Earth one day to make a complete turn and 365 days--one year--to orbit the Sun.<P>

<STRONG>Step #2 </STRONG><BR>
Ask: How many days do you think have passed since you were born? Have students record their estimates for future reference.<P>

<STRONG>Step #3</STRONG><BR>
Have students brainstorm what they need to know to figure out exactly how many days old they are. List on the board the information students suggest. If they don't suggest the number of days in a year and the number of days in each month, be sure to post them for students to refer to. You may want to discuss the issue of leap year and talk about how students remember the number of days in each month. (Have a school roster of birthdays on hand in case some students don't know the year they were born.)<P>

<STRONG>Step #4</STRONG><BR>
Ask students to share strategies they might use to figure out how many days old they are. A group discussion 
of ideas can help students clarify the problem and present getting-started approaches they hadn't considered. Then have students solve the problem. Having students work together gives them support for thinking about how they might calculate the answer, but direct students to individually record their solutions and explain them both with numbers and words.<P>

<STRONG>Step #5</STRONG><BR>
After students solve the problem, have them report their solutions, explaining to the class how they did it. Also 
have them compare their results with the estimates they made earlier. Students will be amazed when they realize that they've been alive for thousands of days!

<FONT  SIZE=+1>A fresh look at getting students' heads--and hands!--around math concepts<P>

You find them in classrooms across the nation--buckets of pattern blocks; trays of tiles and cubes; and collections of geoboards, tangrams, counters, and spinners. They've been touted as a way to help students learn math more easily. But many teachers still ask: Are manipulatives a  fad? How do I fit them into my instruction? How often should I use them? How do I make sure students see them as learning tools, not toys? How can I communicate their value to parents? Are they useful for upper-grade students, too?<P>
I've used manipulative materials at all levels for 30 years, and I'm convinced I can't--and shouldn't--teach without them. Here I look at every side--and corner, color, and shape--of manipulatives and share:

<H2>Why & How I Teach with Historical Fiction</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF="../info/columnists.html#lindquist">Tarry Lindquist</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

Here's the story on historical fiction in my classroom: It illuminates time periods, helps me integrate the curriculum, and enriches social studies. Just take Amy's word for it. At the end of our westward-expansion unit, while modeling her journal entry after a fictional account we'd read, this fifth grader wrote: "Dear Diary, July 30, 1852: This journey has been heart-wrenching, thirst-quenching, and most of all, an adventure I will never forget." Blending stories into a study of history turns the past into a dynamic place.<P>

Of course, historical fiction doesn't stand alone in my instructional program; even the best literature cannot address skills and processes unique to social studies that kids must learn. I have students balance fiction with fact, validate historical hypotheses with research. Historical fiction is the spice.<P>

To help you build good fiction into your social studies program, below you'll find:

<A NAME="reasons"></A>
<H3>7 Reasons I Teach With Historical Fiction</H3>
<OL>
<LI>It piques kids' curiosity. Although I sometimes begin units with chapter books, more often I start with picture books because they're engaging and full of information. Before I read aloud, we make a class list of what students already know about the topic, and then I say: "When I finish reading, I'd like each of you to ask a question related to the story. The only rule is, no question can be asked twice." Afterward, I launch investigations, saying, "Now that we've looked at what happened to one pioneer family, let's find out if their experience was typical or unusual."<P>

<LI>It levels the playing field. Some kids come to class with a deep background knowledge to draw upon, while others have just shallow reservoirs. Reading historical fiction promotes academic equity because comparing books from one unit to the next provides kids with equal opportunities to develop historical analogies. I ask, "How is the story we read for this unit similar to and different from the one we read last month?"<P>

<LI>It hammers home everyday details. Picture books today provide visual and contextual clues to how people lived, what their speech was like, how they dressed, and so on. When accurately portrayed, these details are like a savings account that students can draw on and supplement--each deposit of information provides a richer understanding of the period.<P>

<LI>It puts people back into history. Social studies texts are often devoted to coverage rather than depth. Too often, individuals--no matter how famous or important--are reduced to a few sentences. Children have difficulty converting these cryptic descriptions and snapshots into complex individuals who often had difficult choices to make, so myths and stereotypes flourish. Good historical fiction presents individuals as they are, neither all good nor all bad.<P>

<LI>It presents the complexity of issues. If you were to draw a topographical map of an issue, there would be hills and valleys, because most issues are multifaceted. Yet traditionally, historical issues have been presented to children as flat, one-dimensional, or single-sided. Historical fiction restores the landscape of history, warts and all, so children can discover that dilemmas are age-old. My kids often make lists of the costs and benefits of historical decisions. For example, they draw two posters--one encouraging American colonists to join the Patriots, the other urging them to stay loyal to King George. They also write 35- to 45-second infomercials for each side.<P>

<LI>It promotes multiple perspectives.  It's important for students to share their perspectives, while respecting the opinions of others. Historical fiction introduces children to characters who have different points of view and offers examples of how people deal differently with problems. It also informs students about the interpretive nature of history, showing how authors and illustrators deal with an issue in different ways.<P>

<LI>It connects social studies learning to the rest of our school day. Historical fiction, while enhancing understanding of the past, can help you integrate social studies across the curriculum.

<A NAME="new"></A>
<H3>15 Fabulous New Historical Fiction Books</H3>
It's a challenge to select titles that are authentic, have a fresh slant, represent diverse groups, are easily readable, are of high literary quality, and are enriched with illustrations. The following reviews of 1994 titles are excerpted from Notable Children's Trade Books in the Field of Social Studies, compiled by practicing teachers and published by the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS) in cooperation with the Children's Book Council (CBC). I have added my own teaching strategies to each.<P>

<STRONG>PRIMARY</STRONG><BR>
<EM>Casey Over There</EM> by Staton Rabin, illustrated by Greg Shed (Harcourt); 32 pages; $15<BR>
This is a touching story of two brothers whose lives were affected by World War I. Casey fought and his younger brother, Aubrey, waited and worried. Aubrey's letter to Uncle Sam initiates a sensitive response from the president. The illustrations add intensity to the story.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> I make a template of a T-shirt out of a file folder for students to create T-shirts for characters in books. Make one for each of the brothers in the story with a slogan and a symbol, then hang T-shirts with clothespins on a clothesline suspended in your classroom.<P>


<EM>In America</EM> by Marissa Moss (Dutton); 32 pages; $14.99<BR>
 Walter's grandfather tells the story of immigrating to America. Walter learns about his grandfather's village in Lithuania and about courage through his grandfather's experience.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> Storyboards tell lots about what kids understand. For this story, fold a piece of drawing paper into eight panels: a title panel, six depicting what Walter learns about Lithuania, and the final panel for what he learns about courage. <P>

<STRONG>PRIMARY/INTERMEDIATE</STRONG><BR>
<EM>Seminole Diary: Remembrances of a Slave</EM> by Dolores Johnson (Macmillan); 32 pages; $14.95<BR>
Libbie, a slave, tells of the peaceful coexistence of African-American slaves and the Seminole Indians. In the Seminole villages, runaway slaves found a haven of mutual respect.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> I recommend pairing off students and having them write poetry for two voices: one voice for the African-American and one voice for the Seminole Indian. Have the kids share their poems with the class.<P>

<EM>The Sad Night: The Story of an Aztec Victory and a Spanish Loss</EM> by Sally Schofer Mathews (Clarion); 40 pages; $16.95<BR>
In text surrounded by Aztec codices, the story of this ancient civilization is recounted. Told from the Aztec perspective, this book connects the past with a modern-day discovery.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> I have my class practice writing newspaper headlines from different perspectives. This book lends itself to four perspectives--Aztec, Spanish, past, and present.<P>

<EM>Hilde and Eli: Children of the Holocaust</EM> by David A. Adler, illustrated by Karen Ritz (Holiday House); 32 pages; $15.95<BR>
Children of the Holocaust are like any others: Hilde Rosenzweig loved to ride her tricycle and play with dolls; Eli Lax studied hard and loved animals.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> Discuss how the lives of the characters in this story compare or contrast with the lives of the children today or with the fictional account in the book <EM>Doesn't Fall Off His Horse</EM>(below).<P>

<EM>Doesn't Fall Off His Horse</EM> by Virginia A. Stroud (Dial); 32 pages; $14.99<BR>
Narrative prose and exceptional artwork trace this dangerous adventure back to the Oklahoma Territory of the 1890s. Readers experience the life of a Kiowa boy, as told by a very old man to his great-granddaughter.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> As a class, we often create a hands-head-heart chart. List what the Kiowa boy does in one column (hands), what he knows in the second column (head), and how he feels in the third (heart). Then ask: What are some generalizations we can make about life for a Kiowa boy?<P>


<STRONG>INTERMEDIATE</STRONG><BR>
<EM>Pink and Say</EM> by Patricia Polacco (Philomel); 48 pages; $15.95<BR>
Two young Union boys from very different backgrounds are caught up in the travesties of war in Confederate territory. This is a poignant Civil War story passed down through generations, including the generation of the author.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> My students and I brainstorm a list of questions characters might be asked in a magazine interview. Then I have each student choose a character and seven questions to answer about him in writing. Or I have students work in pairs, posing as an interviewer and interviewee.<P>

<EM>Steal Away Home</EM> by Lois Ruby (Macmillan); 176 pages; $14.95<BR>
History, drama, and mystery are interwoven in two overlapping stories: one of the Underground Railroad of the 1850s and the other of a young girl in Lawrence, Kansas, in the 1990s.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> After introducing kids to different kinds of graphic organizers, I ask them to draw a Venn diagram showing the events and characteristics of 1850s, those of the 1990s, and those the two eras share.<P>

<EM>Clouds of Terror</EM> by Catherine A. Welch, illustrated by Laurie K. Johnson (Carolrhoda); 48 pages; $11.95<BR>
This fictional account of an 1870s invasion by Rocky Mountain locusts of a Swedish-American family's farm in Minnesota is gripping and realistic. Central themes are life on a l9th-century prairie, economic hardship, family coping responses, and children's roles.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> One of our language arts goals is to write friendly letters. Ask students to write letters to make-believe relatives in Sweden about the experiences of each family member in the story.<P>

<EM>Stranded at Plimoth Plantation 1626</EM> by Gary Bowen (HarperCollins); 88 pages; $19.95<BR>
Via his journal entries and woodcuts, young Christopher Sears recounts the daily life of the Pilgrims of Plimoth Plantation in 1626 and 1627.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> I ask kids to imagine a Pilgrim as a busy executive with a tight schedule and then have them create a planner for him or her for a day. Kids verify the accuracy of the schedule using other resources we find in the library. I extend the activity by asking kids to schedule other days, such as the Sabbath, three days around the first Thanksgiving, and so on. Then I ask: What's similar to our lives today?<P>

<EM>The Shadow Children</EM> by Steven Schnur, illustrated by Herbert Tauss (Morrow); 96 pages; $14<BR>
The ghosts of Jewish children haunt a rural village in post-World War II France in this powerful and moving tale of a boy and his grandfather.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> Use a T-chart to separate fact from fiction.<P>

<STRONG>ADVANCED</STRONG><BR>
<EM>With Every Drop of Blood: A Novel of the Civil War</EM> by James Lincoln Collier and Christopher Collier (Delacorte/BDD); 228 pages; $15.95<BR>
In this first-rate novel, two young men are caught up in the Civil War: Johnny is on a bold mission to supply Rebel troops, while Cush, a Yankee, is a runaway slave. They form an unlikely alliance during the final days of the war.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> I feel that getting kids to look at things from more than one point of view is important. One way to do this for this novel is to have kids write journal entries from each boy's point of view. Kids fashion journals out of half sheets of paper. This seems to stimulate creativity, because staring at a whole sheet of blank paper can be intimidating!<P>

<EM>Under the Blood-Red Sun</EM> by Graham Salisbury (Delacorte/BDD); 192 pages; $15.95<BR>
As Japanese-Americans living in Hawaii, Tomi and his family face prejudice and hatred after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Father is taken to an internment camp and Grandfather disappears. Tomi discovers how people respond to crisis.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> My students spend a math period constructing a survey to see what members of the community know about Japanese-American internment. They pool their information; do simple statistics with mean, mode, and median; and create charts.<P>

<EM>The Captive</EM> by Joyce Hansen (Scholastic); 128 pages; $13.95<BR>
This novel chronicles the life of a young Ashanti boy from his captivity in West Africa to his life as a slave in Salem, Massachusetts, and then to freedom with African-American ship captain Paul Cuffe.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> I have students create symbols for the major events in the main character's life. I give them enough exposure to the time period so that their symbols are culturally accurate as well as intellectually on target. Then I have students organize the symbols into a pictorial time line.<P>

<EM>The Glory Field</EM> by Walter Dean Myers (Scholastic); 288 pages; $14.95<BR>
This novel is about the experiences of five generations of an African-American family on Curry Island, South Carolina. The book encompasses the Lewis family's joys and challenges, beginning with the first slave boat that landed on the island.<BR>
<STRONG>Teaching Strategy:</STRONG> It's fun for students to compose a five-generation newspaper. I divide the class into five groups, assign each group a generation, and cut a piece of notebook paper lengthwise for each student. Each student writes an article on his or her strip representing experiences and points of view of the generation. Kids use black felt-tip pens to write their final drafts, I tape the articles together, and we photocopy the newspaper.


<A NAME="pocahantas"></A>
<H3>Is Pocahontas Real?</H3>
<STRONG>Discovering Where History Stops and the Story Starts</STRONG><BR>
It's easy to discern fact from fantasy in a Disney movie--just wait until the animals break into song. Less than obvious is what's historically accurate and what isn't. Our students are faced with the same dilemma when we teach with historical fiction. How can we help them differentiate between make-believe and history, and recognize the interpretive nature of historical reporting? Here's what I do.<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Raise students' awareness.</STRONG> I alert kids that historical fiction and written accounts of history are different genres. I tell them: As you are reading throughout the year, see if you can find differences between these two kinds of books.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Bring in resource people.</STRONG> Invite experts into your classroom so kids have an opportunity to discuss their observations and explore questions. Remember, an expert can be a grandmother who was interned, an uncle who has traveled extensively, or a local lawyer who can tell your kids how trials really work.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Integrate skills across the disciplines.</STRONG> I fold reading practice--such as distinguishing between fact and opinion, and fiction and nonfiction--into social studies.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Investigate sources.</STRONG> When I read a book aloud to my class, I model how to examine the sources of information used by the author and illustrator. Author's notes are particularly valuable. When kids read independently, we frequently conference about the sources used. It's also critical to read more than one kind of resource so students have the opportunity to discover multiple perspectives.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Facilitate access to resources.</STRONG> To aid in student inquiry, I enlist the help of our public librarians who make an "all call" on books throughout the county. Given a couple of weeks notice, they frequently gather 30 to 40 books that I can keep for up to three weeks. In three years of using this resource, we haven't lost a book yet!<P>

<LI><STRONG>Observe illustrations.</STRONG> When possible, find photographs to compare with illustrations. Look for incongruities as well as confirmations, what's been included and/or left out, and so on.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Consult primary documents.</STRONG> I photocopy primary documents and we analyze them for reliability. We develop questions regarding the strengths and weaknesses of various sources, and identify possible biases and inaccuracies. We also talk about what distinguishes primary documents (written by the actual person) from secondary accounts (written by a historian interpreting events) from historical fiction (written by an author dramatizing the historian's interpretation).<P>

<LI><STRONG>Develop criteria.</STRONG> Help students create their own criteria for evaluating informational books and historical fiction. Also have students identify and compare specific characteristics. For example, the order of events can't change in biographies or history books, but made-up events can be inserted in historical fiction.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Test generalizations.</STRONG> Be alert for inaccurate assumptions your students make, such as "Kids in the past had it easier than we do today." Give these generalizations a litmus test: "Is Jeri's statement absolutely always true, absolutely always false, or somewhere in between? What evidence do you have?"<P>

<LI><STRONG>Encourage questions.</STRONG> Develop a classroom environment where no one knows all the answers and let's find out are the three words you say most frequently. Get kids comfortable with ambiguity so they know it's okay to have questions. For too many years we packaged social studies with a fancy wrapper, which has led to oversimplification.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Use graphic organizers.</STRONG> Help students analyze assumptions, scrutinize facts, and discern patterns through graphic organizers. Lists, diagrams, wheels, and charts help students assimilate information from diverse resources and encourage critical thinking.

<H2>Teaching Kids the Gentle Art of Persuasion</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF="../info/columnists.html#lindquist">Tarry Lindquist</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>


Learning to express ideas with clarity and to speak persuasively is a central goal in my social studies classroom. So I top off each unit with a critical thinking and speaking activity that calls for students to draw on the knowledge they've acquired and to resolve an issue. More specifically, I have students imitate real-life venues for expression, such as <A HREF="#talk">talk shows</A> and <A HREF="#senate">Senate hearings</A>. I've also developed strategies for <A HREF="#skills">assessing their skills</A> at persuasive presentation, and have discovered several <A HREF="#resources">useful resources</A> for making these simulations even more lively. I'd also like to hear <A HREF="#turn">what's happening in your classroom</A>.

<A NAME="talk"></A>
<H3>Talk-Show Citizenship</H3>
It's not hard to find a hot debate on television--be it the rights of adoptees on The Oprah Winfrey Show, or welfare reform on a policy program such as Crossfire. I capitalize on students' fascination with the best-known of these programs by having them stage mock versions of these shows.
<OL>
<LI>I ask kids to choose a talk-show format--such as three or four people of divergent viewpoints or one or several sources being questioned by a panel of skeptical journalists. Students may want to watch clips from shows such as Meet the Press or others to get a feel for the different formats.<P>

<LI>Students review in detail the problem or issue they'll be discussing on their show. (Recent topics my students have debated include homelessness, population growth, and poverty.) We also determine the purpose of the show--to find an answer, generate multiple solutions, air diverse opinions, or come to a consensus.<P>

<LI>I guide the kids away from framing issues in terms of pros and cons, and instead focus their perceptions on the balance between costs and benefits. In our increasingly complex world, issues are seldom clearly defined as pros versus cons.<P>

<LI>We do a random drawing to select a student host; volunteers then pose as guests who will represent a variety of opinions. Students think about the topic overnight but don't prepare scripts. My goal is to capture the spontaneity of live television debates and give kids practice in thinking on their feet. I tell the kids: The secret to good thinking on your feet is to know more than you need to know.<P>

<LI>My students learn how to present a reasoned point of view. While many talk-show guests are not particularly articulate or well-mannered, our goal is to be well-spoken, courteous, accurate, succinct, and respectful. Students practice writing and speaking with language such as "From my point of view. . .", "One consideration is. . .", "Some people feel. . .", and other appropriate phrases that they choose from the Reminder Chart that we keep hanging in the classroom.<P>

<LI>Before the video cameras roll (with peers doing the taping), we invite judges, lawyers, and other professionals who examine evidence and weigh arguments on the job to come in and model how they think through problems, as well as give examples of how they phrase their thoughts. Sometimes these guests watch a taping of our talk show and critique the class effort.
</OL>

<A NAME="senate"></A>
<H3>Simulating a Senate Hearing</H3>
We use this strategy to debate topics such as destruction of old-growth forests, endangered species, solid waste disposal, and immigration. Here's how:
<OL>
<LI>As a class, we decide on a topic, such as "The Endangered Species Act is outdated and should be rewritten," to be brought before the Senate committee. Then students identify the special-interest groups that, having a stake in the outcome, will want to lobby for their point of view; we randomly place kids in these groups. Four or five students are selected to play the roles of the senators, and one is chosen as chair of the proceedings.<P>

<LI>Together we watch proceedings on C-SPAN to get a feel for what takes place in a hearing, what proper procedure is, and so on. We discuss what we see and how we can reenact it.<P>

<LI>Each special-interest group (SIG) has ten minutes to present its point of view and offer a solution. While the groups prepare, the senators generate questions they'll ask during the presentations.<P>

<LI>Usually we have a social hour prior to the hearing during which SIG members informally discuss the issue with at least two senators. At that time, the lobbyists often show one-minute taped commercials they've created or act them out live. <P>

<LI>Put the table for the Senate committee at the front and chairs in rows--theater-style--for the presenters, and have flip charts, the overhead projector, and other presentation tools on hand.<P>

<LI>Once the chairperson strikes the gavel, the formal proceedings come to order. The chair greets all present and states the purpose of the hearing. Then the senators individually identify themselves and their constituencies, after which the chair asks one of the SIGs to begin its presentation. Committee members may interrupt the presenters at any time to ask questions or to clarify issues. A timekeeper ensures that no group takes more than the allotted ten minutes.<P>

<LI>Once each group has presented, the chair leads the senators in a discussion of what they have heard and what action they feel ought to be taken. Lobbyists may not interject comments. Finally, the chair restates the problem and announces the Senate's decision.<P>

<LI>To debrief, I like to have kids reflect on the process by writing: What I Did, What I Learned, How I Feel.
</OL>

<A NAME="skills"></A>
<H3>Assessing Skills</H3>
Because we usually videotape our hearings and talk shows, we can use them as in-class video portfolios. Throughout the year we use the videos to monitor progress in the art of expression and persuasion. Kids can take the tapes home to share with their parents. I slip a comment card in each video so parents can respond.

<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

You're probably aware of the call to integrate math and science. The "Benchmarks for Science Literacy: Project 2061" report, published last year by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, even said that the ideas and practice of science and mathematics are so closely linked that they can't really be taught well when separated.<P>

<H3>Three Golden Rules for Integrating Science and Math</H3>
As you think about ways to integrate science and math, keep these three ideas in mind:
<OL>
<LI> Plan lessons that use two or more of the <A HREF="#skills">skills</A> listed above. Work from the basic principle that both math and science are about problem-solving.<P>

<LI>Make hands-on activities a priority. When kids work with manipulatives, they gain the concrete experience that is so important to concept development.<P>

<LI>Make science and math personal for kids by introducing activities with anecdotes, questions, or demonstrations that involve kids' local environments, whether it's their homes or the lake on the edge of town.
</OL>

<A NAME="act1"></A>
<H3>Activity 1: What Color Are Your Eyes?</H3>
<STRONG>Concept:</STRONG> Individuals have varying eye color.<P>

<STRONG>Skills:</STRONG> predicting, collecting data, counting, graphing, computing and interpreting data.<P>

<STRONG>Materials:</STRONG> 2-inch-square pieces of white paper, assorted crayons, chart paper, a glue stick, masking tape<P>

<STRONG>Procedure</STRONG><BR>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Get personal.</STRONG> I like to begin science activities with a question, demonstration, or anecdote that connects to my students' lives. For this activity I tell them that when I was pregnant with my first baby, I predicted he or she would have brown eyes--just like Mom and Dad. Was I ever surprised to meet my blue-eyed son! Then I pass around a snapshot of my husband and me and our three blue-eyed children. I confide that people often ask, "Where did those blue eyes come from?" I tell the class we're going to explore that question.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Make predictions.</STRONG> Next, I invite students to create hypotheses to answer two questions. First, "Which eye colors are represented in our class?" It's important that kids establish the eye colors they think will be found, because this prompts them to make observations of one another's eyes. The second question is: "Which eye color will we find most frequently among this group?"<P>

<LI><STRONG>Form a living graph.</STRONG> I give each student crayons and a 2-inch-square piece of paper, and ask them to draw a picture of their eyes. I put a line of tape on the floor and invite the whole class to form a series of single-file lines according to eye color. Students note the length of each line and compare their predictions with the actual results.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Create an eye-catching chart.</STRONG> Now we convert our living graph into a bar graph. Along the bottom of a piece of chart paper, we list the eye colors found in our group. Students use a glue stick to post their drawings in the appropriate columns. I ask students how the results compare with their predictions and challenge them to state something they have learned from the graph.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Develop story problems.</STRONG> I invite students to write (or dictate) a story problem based on the data, and then compile the problems into a booklet for students to swap. Children are highly motivated to solve story problems that involve information they collected themselves. One first grader dictated: "Which eye color has the most?" A third grader posed: "We have 24 kids in our room. Eight of us have hazel eyes. How many of us don't have hazel eyes?"<P>

<LI><STRONG>Graph it again.</STRONG> Now I help students make a more abstract version of their graph by asking such questions as: What symbol could you use instead of your drawings? How could you convert the bar graph into a line graph? (Mark a dot at the top of each column of drawings and then connect the dots.)<P>

<LI><STRONG>Widen the net.</STRONG> I ask students what would happen if they collected more data on eye color, increasing the sample size. Would their results change? How could they find out? One teacher I know, Ted Smith of Liberty Valley Elementary in Danville, Pennsylvania, had his second graders survey the entire student body! They compiled their data on a hallway graph for all to see. Whether you poll a few grades or your entire school, this activity will get across the concept that increasing the sample size of any survey will give you a truer representation of the population.
</OL>


<A NAME="act2"></A>
<H3>Activity 2: Does Brown Always Rule?</H3>
<STRONG>Concepts:</STRONG> A person's eye color is determined by each parent's eye-color genes. Brown and hazel are dominant over blue.<P>

<STRONG>Skills:</STRONG> observing; predicting; comparing; collecting, recording, and organizing data; probability<P>

<STRONG>Procedure:</STRONG><BR>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Focus on family matters.</STRONG> As a take-home activity, I have students list or illustrate the eye colors of family members. Then I ask them such questions as: Does your eye color match your parents' eye color? Your grandparents'? Your siblings'? When students bring in their data, I again show them the snapshot of my family and ask, "Where did those kids get their blue eyes?" I then give them a simple lesson in genetics, as follows.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Discuss basic genetics.</STRONG> I explain that for every characteristic--from our eye color to the shape of our big toe--each parent contributes one gene. The gene may be strong (dominant) or weak (recessive). For example, with eye color, brown and hazel are dominant over blue, which is recessive. If even one of the two eye-color genes a person receives is brown or hazel, then his eye color is brown or hazel. But if a person receives a recessive gene (blue) from each parent--which was the case with my children--then that person will have blue eyes.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Chart those baby blues.</STRONG> On the chalkboard, I draw the matrix shown below and then plug in the Kepler family eye colors. (Since we have blue-eyed kids, my husband and I obviously both have a recessive gene.) As you can see, there was a one in four chance that each Kepler child would have blue eyes. How could students express that as a fraction? As a ratio?
</OL>

<A NAME="act3"></A>
<H3>Activity 3: How Can We See in the  Dark?</H3>
Children love to learn about the peepers of creatures--from a spider's set of eight to glow-in-the-dark cat eyes. In this activity, kids learn about their own night vision and compare it to nocturnal animals' keen eyesight.<P>

<STRONG>Concept:</STRONG> Animals possess varying abilities to see at night.<P>

<STRONG>Skills:</STRONG> observing, predicting, counting, classifying, making a table, computing,finding averages.<P>

<STRONG>Materials:</STRONG> 12 pairs of socks, including a variety of dark colors (black, navy, brown) and light colors (white, tan, pink).<P>

<STRONG>Procedure:</STRONG><BR>
<OL>
<LI>Present the challenge. I tell kids that their task is going to be to sort socks--long pause--in the dark! I ask students to write in the sock colors on a chart.<P>

<LI>Gather students in a circle. I place the mixed-up socks in the center of the group and then have the kids establish where we will place the socks once the lights are out.<P>

<LI>Lights out. Students go to work! I make sure each child has a chance to place a sock in what he or she thinks is the correct color pile.<P>

<LI>Find out the score. When all the socks are sorted, I turn on the lights just long enough to tally the number of socks correctly placed in each pile. Students record the number on the chart.<P>

<LI>Lights out again. Sitting in the dark, I tell kids we're going to try the sock sort again and ask them to predict the results. Some students may predict they will do better this time, noting prior experience in the dark. I deliberately spend ten minutes or so talking with the kids, so their eyes have time to adjust.<P>

<LI>Sort the socks. When children are finished, I turn on the lights and we record the results. We compare the two scores. Did the length of time spent in the dark improve their ability to see in the dark? Why? Were some colors easier to sort than others? Why is this so? (The lighter colors--which reflect more light--are easier to see than the darker ones.)<P>

<LI>Talk about nocturnal animals. Now that children have a sense of their own night vision, they can appreciate the eyesight of nighttime creatures. I have students list animals that they know have good night vision. Why might it be advantageous for these animals to see at night? I ask students to discuss their ideas and then explain that nocturnal animals' eyes reflect much more light than ours. Their eyes contain many more tiny cells called rods than the eyes of day animals. These rods allow them to see well at night. I ask kids: Thinking back to the socks, who do you think would do a better job of sorting in the dark--an owl or us?<P>

<LI>Launch a study of night animals. At this point kids are all set to investigate animal vision. There are many good resource books available: <A HREF="#resources">click here for a few of my favorites</A>. Use the principles you've learned here to develop math and science-linked vision activities of your own.

<H2>Study Life Cycles with Butterflies</H2>
<H3>Kids can use this butterfly unit to investigate changes in their own lives<P>
By <A HREF ="../info/columnists.html#kepler">Lynne Kepler</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

Nearly a dozen monarch caterpillars occupy the small aquarium each September. As each new school year begins, my three children gather caterpillars from the leaves of the milkweed plants that grow along the roadside, make a home for them, and watch them grow. Every year, my kids are astounded by the incredible change from caterpillar to striking, black-and-orange butterfly. And every year, I'm awed by the change and growth in my kids. Here you'll find fresh, hands--on investigations that compare butterfly and human life cycles-and help you connect math and science, too.<P>

<H3>HANDS-ON SCIENCE: FROM CATERPILLARS TO BUTTERFLIES</H3>

<STRONG>Concepts:</STRONG> Insects undergo dramatic changes throughout their life cycle. All living things change during their lifetimes.<P>

<STRONG>Skills:</STRONG> observing, predicting, measuring, communicating, comparing, and contrasting.

<A NAME="vocabulary"></A>
<H3>Vocabulary</H3>

<STRONG>caterpillar:</STRONG> the larval stage of a butterfly or moth<P>

<STRONG>chrysalis:</STRONG> the hard shell covering the pupa; shaped like an upside down teardrop<P>

<STRONG>larva:</STRONG> the second stage of metamorphosis, during which an insect is wormlike and has new wings<P>

<STRONG>pupa:</STRONG> the third stage of metamorphosis; encased by a chrysalis<P>

<STRONG>metamorphosis:</STRONG> a series of developmental stages often marked by body changes

<A NAME="finding"></A>
<H3>Finding the Caterpillars</H3>
The best way to find caterpillars is to locate their food source. Monarch caterpillars feed only on milkweed. Several species of this common wildflower grow throughout the United States. To find the yellow-black-and-white-striped caterpillars, lift the plant's leaves. Gently pull the caterpillars off and transport them in a ventilated jar to school. If you'd rather purchase caterpillars, see the resource box on the next page for ordering information.

<A NAME="making"></A>
<H3>Making the Habitats</H3>
To care for the caterpillars, you will need a container that allows them to get air and to move around. A small aquarium with a screen lid works well. If you wish to have groups of students make their own caterpillar habitats, here is an easy way to do it.
<OL>
<LI>For each group of students, gather two plastic 2-liter soda bottles (emptied and cleaned) and a small piece of window screening.<P>

<LI>Cut the top off around the shoulder of one of the bottles, as shown. (If working with younger students, cut the bottles for them.)<P>

<LI>To make a lid for the habitat, set the base of the second bottle in warm water and then pull it off. Cut a piece of wire screen to fit inside the lid. Tape the screen in place. This will give the caterpillars a place to attach themselves and keep them from escaping.<P>

<LI>Add the caterpillars and a few fresh, moist leaves-the kind your caterpillar eats-to the habitat. (If you order a butterfly kit, you'll get the food with it.) Replace the food supply as needed.
</OL>

<A NAME="activities"></A>
<H3>Activities Kids Love</H3>
It takes about two weeks for a caterpillar to become a chrysalis. Here are some investigations your students can do as you watch the caterpillars grow.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Make a bar graph.</STRONG> Ask students: How much do the caterpillars grow? Do they all grow at the same rate? To find out, students can measure the caterpillars using a piece of yarn. Cut the yarn to match the length of each caterpillar, then tape the yarn pieces to a sheet of 9-by-12-inch construction paper. Record the date on the paper next to the pieces of yarn. Students can do this every few days, creating a bar graph of the caterpillars' growth.<P>

<LI>Make a line graph. Invite older students to use rulers to measure the caterpillars' growth daily and record their data in a notebook. Students can determine the average daily growth rate of their caterpillars. They may also make a line graph noting any growth spurts or plateaus. Do the students notice any patterns?<P>

<LI>Keep daily diaries. How does a caterpillar change? Students can keep daily journals, describing in words and pictures the caterpillars'  changes. Once the caterpillars have become chrysalises, invite students to make a sketch in their journals of what they think the butterfly will look like, then make another sketch when the butterfly emerges. After the butterflies have emerged, move them to an aquarium to observe for a day or two before releasing them. Place a wet sponge in a dish so they have water to drink.
</UL>

<A NAME="circle"></A>
<H3>Extension Activity: Circle of Life</H3>
Discuss with students how the butterfly develops through four stages of metamorphosis-egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly). The adult barely resembles the larval stage in appearance or behavior. This is known as a complete metamorphosis.<P>

Invite students to compare the butterflies' growth and changes with their own growth and development. Ask them to bring in pictures of themselves as infants and toddlers. Using these photos and their caterpillar charts and diaries, students can create two circles of life-one for the butterfly and one for themselves. To make a circle of life, each student will need two sheets of white construction paper, a file folder, and a brass paper fastener. Here's how to assemble the circles.
<OL>
<LI>Glue two sheets of paper together along one edge. Mark and cut out a 1-inch window from the top sheet.<P>

<LI>Cut out a circle from the file folder. The diameter of the circle should just about match the width of the paper. Poke a small hole through the center of the circle.<P>

<LI>Have students paste their photos or caterpillar/butterfly drawings onto the circle, as shown.<P>

<LI>Insert the circle between the sheets of paper, leaving one edge of the circle-which will now function as the
 wheel-exposed. Adjust so that each picture shows up through the window when you turn the wheel.<P>

<LI>Using the paper fastener, fasten together the wheel and the paper, then glue the paper edges, leaving only the section with the wheel edge open.<P>

<LI>Students can share their circles with each other, narrating the changes seen through the window.<P>

<LI>Students can also use photographs of parents, grandparents, and so on to create more life-cycle wheels. Invite students to brainstorm what other kinds of life cycles they can depict.

<H2>10 Simple Centers to Connect Art and the Curriculum</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF ="../info/columnists.html#parks">Mary Parks</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

When I was in elementary school, my illustration for a book report was a much  more personal response to reading than anything I could write.<P>

Since all of our students learn and express themselves in various ways, we need to provide opportunities in our classrooms for all learners. Art centers are a great idea if you don't have a separate art period set aside in your daily curriculum. As you'll see below, these centers can also provide a neat way to integrate the arts throughout your curriculum. Here are ten art centers you can easily set up in your classroom this year to meet the needs of your tactile and visual learners and to develop art appreciation in all your students.<P>

<A NAME="tip"></A>
<H2>Art-Center Smarts</H2>
The hardest part about having an art center in your classroom is keeping it clean. Assign two students per week to be in charge of art-center cleanup, performing chores such as replacing supplies, wiping up spills, and keeping things in order.

<A NAME="easel"></A>
<H3>1. The Easel</H3>
If you do nothing but set up an easel area this year, you have brought the world of art into your room. In addition to the easel itself, all you need are paints; paintbrushes; clean aluminum cans or plastic containers for water; and some construction paper, newsprint, or old newspaper.<P>

Put just a few colors out at once, to avoid clutter and mess. Try having orange and black in the fall, blue and white for winter, red and yellow for spring, and shades of green during a study of the rain forest. Also try putting out other media such as chalk, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, and watercolors.<P>

Set up the easel by a sink if possible. This will make cleanup a lot easier. And don't forget to cover the floor around it with newspaper.<P>

<STRONG>Integrate:</STRONG> Have students name the one children's book illustrator they'd choose to illustrate their own writing, and explain their choices. Then give each child the opportunity to work in the style and medium of that illustrator to create a piece of art that best captures the spirit of their writing.

<A NAME="masks"></A>
<H3>2. Masks and Puppets</H3>
Recycled scraps are great for making masks and puppets. Use plain white paper plates as masks and brown paper bags as puppets. Have children decorate and glue yarn and pieces of paper to create their favorite characters.<P>

<STRONG>Integrate:</STRONG> As a class, find out how puppets and masks have been used in different cultures to remind people how to behave. Have your students create their own puppet show or mask-play about classroom rules.

<A NAME="draw"></A>
<H3>3. Quick-Draw Station</H3>
Most students love to draw but don't know where to begin. Tips  from how-to-draw books can help them get started. Gather how-to-draw books and drawing materials, such as paper and crayons, and your kids will draw objects they were not able to draw before. Some books to try: <EM>Draw Fifty Famous Cartoons</EM>; <EM>Draw Fifty Dogs</EM>; and <EM>Draw Fifty Cars, Trucks and Motorcycles</EM>, all by Lee J. Ames (Doubleday).<P>

<STRONG>Integrate:</STRONG> Since good drawings are built from basic geometric shapes-such as circles and rectangles-have kids build their visual math vocabulary by finding the shapes in a classroom object and drawing them.

<A NAME="prints"></A>
<H3>4. Stamp Prints</H3>
There are many rubber stamp kits on the market today. If students have their own, encourage them to share with the class. Kids can make their own stamps using potatoes and a plastic knife to carve images. Older students can make stamps with erasers by carving with a sharper knife. Use tempera paint as ink. <P>

<STRONG>Integrate:</STRONG> Have kids use letter stamps to create their own codes for classmates to decipher. Study African and Native American symbols and encourage students to design their own symbolic stamps to personalize their papers.

<A NAME="clay"></A>
<H3>5. Modeling Clay</H3>
Modeling clay can be used over and over again if it is properly cared for. Store clay in seal-tight containers-such as margarine tubs-to keep it fresh. For permanent sculptures use inexpensive air-dry clays.<P>

<STRONG>Integrate</STRONG>: Ask students to plan on paper a large public sculpture in honor of an important author or historical event, and then create a scale model in clay.

<A NAME="crayon"></A>
<H3>6. Crayon Rubbing</H3>
Use thick crayons with thin paper such as newsprint, typing paper, or tracing paper. Fill a shoe box full of items such as leaves, scraps of textured fabric, and coins that kids can pick and choose from. Encourage kids to bring their own items from home to share with the class.<P>

<STRONG>Integrate:</STRONG> Have students do rubbings of items they've picked to symbolize a book you've read together. Display the class's rubbings along with kids' explanations of their choices.

<A NAME="murals"></A>
<H3>7. Theme-Oriented Murals</H3>
Set up a large roll of newsprint, paint, chalk, and crayons on one side of your room. Place the paper on the floor or tack it to a bulletin board. <P>
<STRONG>Integrate:</STRONG> Have your class create a mural to go with your next science exploration-be it butterflies or volcanoes. Students should collaborate on an appropriate background first and then add details and labels as their knowledge grows.

<A NAME="collage"></A>
<H3>8. Paper Collages and Mosaics</H3>
Save and recycle scraps of construction paper, wallpaper, yarn, and such. Have kids use newspaper as a background sheet and create a fancy collage with the recycled scraps.<P>
<STRONG>Integrate:</STRONG> Invite students to create collage posters encouraging the community to recycle.

<A NAME="tangram"></A>
<H3>9. Tangram Kits</H3>
Tangram kits make it easy to integrate art and math. If you don't have a premade kit, kids can cut triangles and squares out of construction paper. They can then use grid paper to design their own geometric shapes. Challenge students to invent tangram challenges for one another involving symmetry and patterns.

<A NAME="music"></A>
<H3>10. Art and Music Appreciation</H3>
Display reproductions of famous paintings such as those by Claude Monet or Norman Rockwell. Along with the artwork, set up a listening station with a tape recorder and headphones. Provide samples of various styles of music, such as classical, rock, and jazz. Then create sheets for students to fill in as personal responses. Here are a few examples:
<UL>
<LI>The music made me feel __________
<LI>The artist is trying to say _________
<LI> This music ______ seems to go best with picture ______ because ______
<LI>Here's the poem I wrote about the picture ________ and music __________  together:  
</UL>

<A NAME="turn"></A>
<H3>Your Turn</H3>
Do you integrate the arts into your classroom teaching? What kinds of suggestions and activities would help you use the arts more?  Send your thoughts to <A HREF="mailto:kkykim@aol.com">KKYKim@aol.com</A>.<P>

<H2>Kids Phone Numbers Become Musical Masterpieces</H2>
<H3>By <A HREF ="../info/columnists.html#parks">Mary Parks</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

Music is all around us--to hear and to make. This group project uses math, science, and art to help kids explore the tones of music in their world, starting with their own phone numbers. Read on for <A HREF="#step">step-by-step instructions</A> for turning numbers into music; <A HREF="#more">music extension activities</A>; a <A HREF="#graph">number-graphing art activity</A>, and <A HREF="#resources">resources</A> for combining art, music, and the curriculum. Then we'd like to <A HREF="#turn">hear about your classroom</A>.<P>

<A NAME="step"></A>
<H3>Musical Numbers, Step By Step</H3>
<STRONG>Materials:</STRONG> Identical sets of ten tall glasses (the number of sets you need depends on the number of students), water, ruler, teaspoon, grease pencil.<P>

<STRONG>Tips for teachers:</STRONG> I suggest dividing a class of 30 kids into three groups with a set of glasses per group. If your students are very young, you may want to pour the water yourself. Don't forget to keep paper towels nearby to wipe up spills.<P>

<STRONG>Steps for Students: </STRONG>
<OL>
<LI>With your group, hold up a ruler to the side of a glass. Measure the height of the glass, then subtract 1 inch for room at the top.<P>

<LI>Divide this measurement by 10, and with a grease pencil draw lines to indicate the 10 sections on each glass.<P>

<LI>Fill the first glass with water up to the first section. Label this glass number 1 with the grease pencil.<P>

<LI>Then fill the second glass up to the second section. Label it 2. Fill the next glass to the third section and label it 3, and so on until the tenth glass is filled with water to the tenth section. Mark off the tenth glass with the numeral 0.<P>

<LI> After all the glasses are filled with appropriate amount of water, line them up in order from 1 to 0. <P>

<LI> With a teaspoon, gently tap the first glass near the rim and listen for the sound. Notice the tone, then tap the second glass. As the numbers get higher and the amount of water increases, you should hear the tones get lower.<P>

<P>Using a teaspoon, have one student tap his or her phone number on the glasses. For example, if the phone number is 555-1234, the student will tap the glass labeled number 5 three times, then go on to tap 1, 2, 3, then 4. Listen to the sounds and notice the notes being played. How does it sound?<P>

<LI>Give everyone a turn to play his or her own phone number. (Anyone who doesn't have a phone number can make one up.)
</OL>

<A NAME="more"></A>
<H3>More Music-Making</H3>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Soda-Bottle Orchestra.</STRONG> Have students bring in narrow-neck bottles, such as soda bottles. Have them blow across the openings to make tones. Help kids figure out that the shape and size of the bottle determines the sounds it will produce. Next, have them add water to the bottles, blow, and notice the difference in tones. Help students figure out that as they add more water to the bottle, the tone gets lower.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Glass Band.</STRONG> Set up five or six glasses, each filled with a different amount of water, on a table and ask for volunteers to be in the band. One at a time, have each student wet his or her index finger with water (vinegar works even better) and rub it along the rim of a glass. Notice the different tones. Then have the band play together. Can they play a song?
</UL>

<A NAME="graph"></A><H3>Graph Your Numbers</H3>
<STRONG>Materials:</STRONG> Construction paper, black marker, tempera paint (crayons optional), paintbrush, scissors.<P>

<STRONG>Steps for Students:</STRONG>
<OL>
<LI>On construction paper, plot your phone number as if on a graph. Play it on the glasses and listen to how the tones go up and down, just like the points on the graph.<P>

<LI>Connect the dots with a marker.<P>

<LI>Make a design with parallel lines.<P>

<LI>Describe what your phone number sounds like (happy, sad, scary, and so on) when you play it on the glasses. What color goes with the sound? Choose colors and paint the design.<P>

<LI>On white paper, write a few sentences describing your number graph. What does the sound make you think of? Why did you choose the colors you did? Attach it to your graph.
</OL>

<A NAME="resources"></A>
<H3>Resources</H3>
<H4>Books</H4>

<EM>Sound and Music</EM> by Barbara Taylor (Warwick, 1990).  Text and pictures guide young readers in making their own musical instruments and in  understanding the basic principles of music.<P>

<EM>Sound Science</EM> by Etta Kaner (Addison Wesley, 1991).  Many kid activities, plus explanatory text for teachers.<P>

<EM>Ty's One Man Band</EM> by Mildred Pitts Walter (Scholastic, 1980). Ty discovers that music can be made with a washboard, two wooden spoons, a tin pail, and a comb.

<H4>Software</H4>

<H2>Your In-Class Communication Center</H2>
<H3>Here's how one tool can make a breeze out of your most time-consuming tasks<P>
By <A HREF="#feil">Connie Feil</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

You've asked this question before: How can I best use that computer sitting at the side of my classroom? Someday, you've heard, the computer will be networked not only to your school media center, but to resources around the world. But for now, it's just you, the computer, and a classroom of eager students.<P>

How can you use that computer to make great teaching even better? A good place to begin is with the most common and familiar of all computer tools: the word processor. Here are three easy ways to make it work for you:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#homework">Homework Helper</A>
<LI><A HREF="#forms">Forms at Your Fingertips</A>
<LI><A HREF="#newsletter">Student Newsletter</A>
<LI><A HREF="#further">Ready to Go Further?</A>
<LI><A HREF="#turn">Your Turn</A>
</UL>

<A NAME="homework"></A>
<H3>Homework Helper</H3>
The Copy and Paste functions of your word processor make it easy to create a Homework Page that will help students stay on top of assignments and keep parents informed. With a dated homework checklist, older students can learn to better manage their work by reviewing assignments following an absence. All they have to do is turn on the computer and click on the homework file. With younger students, you can easily print out the checklist and send it home for parents and children to review together.<P>

The best way to accomplish this is to create a template with basic information-student name, subject, pages to read, and so on-and save it. If you keep your lesson plans on the computer, all you have to do to fill in the template each day is copy from your lesson plans and paste the information into the blank form. (Otherwise, just type in the information.) Save each day's information as a separate, dated file.

<A NAME="forms"></A>
<H3>Forms at Your Fingertips</H3>
Imagine being able to update your seating chart without crossing out names or starting from scratch. (Imagine how happy that will make the substitute, too!) You can use your computer to generate seating charts and other standard forms, with a professional appearance that will impress students, substitutes, and parents. Permission slips, certificates, room diagrams, agendas, outlines, and memos are just a few possibilities.<P>

Start by creating a form you know you'll use frequently throughout the year, such as letterhead. Open a new document and type in the information you wish to include. Experiment with fonts, type sizes, and graphic elements such as rules until you like the look. Save your original, make a copy of it whenever you want to write a letter, and then save the letter under a different file name.

<A NAME="newsletter"></A>
<H3>Student Newsletter</H3>
Want to give your students a chance to share their work with the world-including their parents-on a weekly basis? Your word processor has the answer. Just set up a class newsletter template, complete with headlines for information you will feature such as "Kids Pick Best Books" or "Math Puzzle of the Week." (All-in-one programs like ClarisWorks come with predesigned newsletter templates and an "assistant" to walk you through the process.) Divide the class into small groups, and make each group responsible for one section. Each day, have one group enter its information. At the end of the week, print out a copy, have students proofread and correct their work, and then roll the presses.<P>
<EM>Your In-Class Communication Center</EM> was created by TIES (Technology and Information Services), a non-profit agency that helps educators integrate technology. For information on TIES' technology and learning services, e-mail <A HREF="mailto:feil@ties.k-12.mn.us">Feil@ties.k-12.mn.us</A>

<A NAME="further"></A>
<H3>Ready To Go Further?</H3>
As you begin to see the potential in one piece of software like a word processing program, you'll want to find more meaningful ways to put other software to work. Mark Levin, a fifth-grade teacher at Carolina Day School in Asheville, North Carolina, whose students already publish a monthly school newspaper, wanted to do more with the technology they had. He and his students started a desktop publishing company called Generation 5 Publishers.<P>

Using <EM>The Print Shop Deluxe</EM> (Br&oslash;derbund) and other tools, Mark's students design charts, posters, name badges, book plates, programs, and other printed materials for the school community. "It's a wonderful experience in language arts and encourages attention to detail, too," says Mark. "With the right software, it's a piece of cake."<P>

If you're already using your computer to create the forms described in <A HREF="#forms">Forms At Your Fingertips</A>, you can easily begin to publish a wider variety of materials with your students-from distinctive stationery to stand-out signs. Want to open your own classroom publishing company? Gear up by creating sample materials for advertising purposes. <EM>Print Shop</EM> comes with sample layouts to help you get the best results. Design and circulate a flyer advertising the service and have students start filling those orders!<P>

<A NAME="turn"></A>
<H3>Your Turn</H3>
Do you have access to a computer for your teaching? What do you feel you need to learn most about technology? Send your thoughts to <A HREF="mailto:mickeyr@aol.com">MickeyR@aol.com</A>.<P>

<H2>Ease onto the Internet</H2>
<H3>Here's your teacher's guide to the Information Superhighway!<P>
By <A HREF="#buchberg">Wendy Buchberg</A></H3>
<STRONG>Posted 2/15/96</STRONG><P>

Just three years ago, I was a complete know-nothing when it came to computers. I knew my ineptitude was 
shortchanging me and my students, so I swallowed my technophobia and devoted a winter break to unlocking the mysteries of the computer. By the end of the vacation, I not only had mastered the basics, but I had connected myself to the much-touted information superhighway.  Here's what I've discovered along the way.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#internet">Internet 101</A>
<LI><A HREF="#need">What You'll Need</A>
<LI><A HREF="#speak">How to Speak Internet</A>
<LI><A HREF="#connect">Connect with Online Services</A>
<LI><A HREF="#destinations">8 Terrific Destinations</A>
<LI><A HREF="#turn">Your Turn</A>
</UL>

<A NAME="internet"></A>
<H3>Internet 101</H3>
Just what is the Internet? It's the telecommunications system that connects millions of computers. The Internet includes many avenues for retrieving and sending information, of which electronic mail (e-mail) is the simplest to use. Commercial online services such as America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy are part of the Internet. So are schools, libraries, organizations, government agencies, the military, and businesses.<P>

Since you've found the <EM>Instructor</EM> Web site, you probably know that the World Wide Web is the 
fastest growing part of the Internet. The Web is made up of thousands upon thousands of pages, or sites, 
complete with text, graphics, video, and sound. These pages are hyperlinked-connected throughout so you can easily point and click your way among them, following your own interests. Anyone can have a site on the Web. Many students, teachers, and schools have Web pages.

<A NAME="need"></A>
<H3>What You'll Need</H3>
Connecting to the Internet gets easier and less expensive all the time. Basically, you'll need:<P>
<UL>
<LI>a computer (not necessarily the newest, but you can never have too much speed and memory. To get 
started, though, your old Mac Plus or IBM compatible will be fine.)<P>

<LI>access to a phone line (Don't have a jack in your classroom? Try the library or make your first forays online from home.)<P>

<LI>an internal or external modem (Modem power is measured in bauds per second; to access Internet 
resources, a 14,400 or 28,800 baud modem is recommended.)<P>

<LI>access to a <A HREF="#connect">commercial online service</A> or a direct Internet connection 
(check with your media specialist); and<P>

<LI>Web browser software to tap into the World Wide Web (Most of the commercial online services offer this
 as part of your membership. If you have direct Internet access, you'll need to add a browser such as <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape</A> which is basically free to Internet users. Once you're
 online, you'll find a number of sources for downloading Netscape and other browsers.)
</UL>

<A NAME="speak"></A>
<H3>How to Speak Internet</H3>
Here are just a few of the words you'll see and hear on the Internet.<P>

<STRONG>FTP</STRONG> (File Transfer Protocol) allows you to access file archives on the Internet and then transfer them to your computer. To access an ftp site, look for ftp on the menu, open the window, then type in the ftp address.<P>

<STRONG>Gopher</STRONG> searches databases for the information you're looking for.<P>

<STRONG>Telnet</STRONG> lets you operate distant computers from your keyboard.<P>

<STRONG>URL</STRONG> (Universal Resource Locator) indicates a World Wide Web site. To access a URL address you need Web browser software.

<A NAME="connect"></A>
<H3>Connect with Online Services</H3>
<LI><A HREF="../../index.html"><STRONG>Scholastic Network</STRONG></A> (800) 246-2986

<P>
<H3>SIX STRATEGIES TO HELP STUDENTS MASTER BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS</H3>

<P>
A kiss hello...a wave good-bye...an airplane fading in the sky.
<P>
Our lives are marked by beginnings and endings. In the things we do every day, we look for starting and ending points. We hold those images-their sight, smell, taste, and feel-close. It's no wonder, then, that writers take such care to develop strong introductions and conclusions-introductions that grab readers and conclusions that leave them feeling satisfied.
<P>
The best leads and endings don't just happen; they are crafted. This can be a painstaking process that, as any experienced writer knows, becomes somewhat easier with practice. When we teach children how to generate leads and endings using their own drafts, and expose them to good models, they become better craftspeople. 
	<P>
If you take some time to make leads and endings the focus of your lessons, you may be surprised at how quickly students' overall writing skills improve.
<P>

<A NAME="read"></A>
<STRONG>l. Conduct read-alouds from favorite books.</STRONG> <BR>
Explore examples of leads and conclusions. Have students read the first sentence or paragraph to the whole class. As a group, discuss whether this opening makes you want to keep reading and why. Then read the whole story, paying special attention to the ending. How does it make students feel? 
<P>
Together, you may also want to create separate charts for beginnings and endings. Classify the beginnings you read according to whether they contain dialogue, a "climactic moment," helpful introductory information, or other categories you discover through reading. Use the second chart for endings, with categories such as summary statements, predictions, reflections about the events, and others inspired by the books. Later, in individual writing conferences, refer back to these charts to help students think about potential leads and endings.
<P>

<A NAME="share"></A>
<STRONG>2. Share your own work. </STRONG><BR>
Show three rough starts or finishes that you have written. Have the class decide which ones work best, and then talk about how you made your choices. 
<P>

<A NAME="choose"></A>
<STRONG>3. Have students choose a first draft and rework the beginning. </STRONG><BR>
Make sure students understand that the time to write stellar beginnings is after they've completed their first drafts. At that stage they can return to their original beginning and be merciless, hacking off as much as necessary to find a good lead. Tell them that even the most accomplished writers have to dig through a few bad sentences and paragraphs before they get to the good stuff. After your students have done this a few times-and learned the power of a strong introduction-they are more likely to make cuts willingly.
<P>
I have found three kinds of leads that work well, because students must use their own writing as a basis for developing them. Teaching these leads alleviates some of the anguish of making cuts, and puts students on the road to well-crafted writing.
<P>
It may help students in their revising if you share the following three kinds of great leads.
<P>
<UL><LI>The circular lead/close: Once a first draft is completed, a circular lead/close is easy to create. I have students look at their endings and ask them if they can begin with those closing words as well. This type of lead is a favorite of many students, since it brings their pieces full circle. It's a tidy way to begin and end. Eric Carle's <EM>The Grouchy Ladybug</EM>, with its opening and closing image of two ladybugs arguing, is a good example of this type of lead.
<P>
<LI>The dialogue lead: Who can forget E.B. White's classic lead from Charlotte's Web? "'Where's Papa going with that axe?' said Fern to her mother as they were setting the table for breakfast." Indeed, dialogue can be the stuff of sweet beginnings. Teach students to scan their writing until they reach the first quote, and then consider moving it to the start of the piece. If the first quote doesn't lend itself to a strong lead, encourage students to look for others that might.
<P>
<LI>The climactic lead: Writer Becky Rule says it's a good idea to pick up your readers by the scruff of their necks and drop them into the heart of a conflict. Every piece of writing has a climax, which doesn't always come at the very end. I ask students to find the point of greatest tension in their writing, and then to move those words to the beginning. For example, Thanksgiving stories are typical at this time of year, and most of them start out as repetitive, sentimental slog. But who wouldn't want to read Mary Comstock's holiday story after this opener? "The remains of Thanksgiving dinner sat like an abandoned wreck on the dining room table: she had eaten it all and the guests hadn't even arrived yet. This would have to stop." Mary's words promise humor and pathos. But it's that "abandoned wreck," the climax of the story, that gives the lead immediate energy.</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="promote"></A>
<STRONG>4. Promote listening for potential leads.</STRONG> <BR>
Have students pair up and talk about a story, plot, or incident they are working on in writing workshop. Ask the listener to note when his interest is piqued and to share those moments with the storyteller. Those points of intrigue are all potential leads.
<P>

<A NAME="endings"></A>
<STRONG>5. Take a look at endings that don't work.</STRONG> <BR>
With endings, I find it works best to teach students what not to do. There are countless wonderful ways to finish a poem, essay, or narrative, depending on your purpose and audience. But there are three kinds of horrible endings that rear their heads again and again in writing workshop. If you teach students to recognize these blunders in their writing, they are more likely to avoid them and craft more original closings.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unnecessary repetition: The first mistake involves not trusting that your writing says what you want it to say. When this happens, writers repeat their main point, bludgeoning it in the process. Students who have this tendency often just need to be reassured that they've done a good job in conveying their ideas earlier in the piece.
<P>
<LI>Uninspired chronology: Students also make the error of reverting to chronology, often ending their writing with the characters dying or falling asleep. If you ask students never to end their pieces with phrases such as "...and they all went to bed," you'll eliminate lots of abrupt conclusions.
<P>
<LI>The "Dallas Syndrome": This catchall ending is used when the writing is implausible, or contains loose ends that the writer can't tie up. In these instances, it's typical for students to conclude with passages such as, "It was all just a dream," or anything that provides an easy return from fantasy to reality. Local teachers dubbed this tendency the "Dallas Syndrome," a nickname inspired by the night-time soap opera in which the lame plot device was used in explaining the absence of Bobby for an entire season. One solution: Don't allow it.</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="encourage"></A>
<STRONG>6. Encourage kids to use one another's leads and conclusions.</STRONG> <BR>
This mini-lesson involves freeing writers from the burden of writing beginnings and endings. Have each student give a classmate just the first line of something he or she has been working on. The recipient has to write something starting or ending with that line. If the student likes what she writes, she deletes her classmate's line, and replaces it with something original. This activity reduces the struggle of finding leads or endings, or of being overly invested in them in first draft. 
<P>


<A NAME="revise"></A>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
<P>
<H3>ARE YOUR STUDENTS READY TO REVISE?</H3>

Fostering an awareness of good beginnings and endings may be developmentally more realistic, and therefore more effective, than demanding revision from primary students.
<P>
A first-grade teacher I know found that out the hard way. She was continually frustrated because her students could spot good leads, as well as extraneous words in their endings, but still opposed revising their work to bring them out. "I finally realized how hard physically it is for some of these kids to grip that pencil and put any words on the page-of course they refused to cut!" she explained. After much thought, she decided to have students underline or star strong potential leads and endings in their writing, using bright colored markers; she didn't require them to begin or close their pieces with those words.
<P>


<A NAME="assess"></A>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
<P>

<H3>A STARTING POINT FOR ASSESSMENT</H3>

Teri Beaver of the University of Northern Colorado Laboratory School has developed an innovative assessment tool, "The Author's Profile," which enables teachers to evaluate writing through a series of development scales. These are her categories for leads.
<P>
NONASSESSABLE: The piece begins without introduction.<BR>
PICTORIAL:  A beginning has been attempted in picture form.<BR>
EMERGING: A lead is written, but lacks connection to the story.<BR>
DEVELOPING: Beginning provides a better opening to the story. <BR>
PRACTICING: Beginning is complete enough to capture interest.<BR>
PROFICIENT: Beginning hooks and leads reader into the story.<BR>
ADVANCED: Beginning shows a unique style and purpose, hooking the reader and flowing expertly into the story.
<P>
Primary students would probably be working within the first three or four categories, with intermediate students at the upper end of the scale. For more information on the complete Author's Profile, contact Teri Beaver at 1811 42nd Ave., Greeley, CO 80634.

<P><CENTER>From playful puppets to Pepe the cricket, the story of Pinocchio
is an invitation to explore the letter <B>P</B>. Young children will enjoy
spotting all the things that start with this letter on the reproducible.
Invite them to share what they find. (If you have an overhead projector,
students can take turns circling their <B>P</B> pictures for all to see.
They'll love this moment in the spotlight.) Follow up by asking children
to share other things that start with <B>P</B>. Record their contributions
on chart paper and display. Let children use their words to make flap books.

In the spirit of <I>The True Story of the Three Little Pigs</I> (told from

work in groups to re-tell part of Pinocchio. </CENTER>
<P>Possibilities include: 
<UL>
  <LI>Retell the scene in which Geppetto, Pinocchio, and Pepe are swallowed
up by the sea monster from the sea monster's point of view.<P>
  <LI>Retell a scene in which Pinocchio gets into trouble-from Pepe the
cricket's point of view. <P>

Imagine how Pinocchio might have handled himself had he had a few lessons
in taking responsibility. Would he have fallen for Felinet's traps or followed
Lampwick's mischievous lead? In this activity, children gain experience
with expressive language development as they practice making real-life decisions.
</CENTER>
<P>What to Do 
<OL>
  <LI>Copy Reproducible 5, paste to sturdy paper, then cut apart the individual
cards. Place the cards in a bag. <P>
  <LI>Invite small groups of children to select scenarios from the bag to
act out.<P>
<I>- Follow up by discussing children's choices: </I><BR>
- How do you think each person in this situation feels? <BR>
- How did you decide what to do? <BR>
- What else could you have done? <BR>
- Has something like this ever happened to you? What did you do? <P>
  <LI>Extend the activity by having children complete Reproducible 6, which
offers a model for thinking through real-life decisions.

<P><CENTER>Puppetry encourages children's expressive language skills as
well as their creative abilities. Working with puppets also lets children
explore problems they might otherwise be reluctant to talk about, such as
conflicts among friends. Try these activities to bring puppets like Pinocchio
into your classroom. Help children create simple stick puppets by drawing
and cutting out characters and gluing them to straws or craft sticks. </CENTER>
<UL>
  <LI>Build a simple theater stage by draping a cloth over a desk. Students
can hide behind it, letting their puppets take center stage! <P>
  <LI>Help children build an understanding of their characters by writing
autobiographies for their puppets, then letting their puppets share them
with an audience.

reformed Lampwick accidentally knocking down a cart of logs. Like the good
boys they are now, they stop to help pick them up. But one rolls by Geppetto,
who is reminded of the log he carved Pinocchio from. Let students write
the script for a sequel to the movie, then direct dramatizations of their
screenplays. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Here's a real-life research project designed to help students learn how
far away frozen food favorites originate, and the distances they must travel
to reach their neighborhood markets. <P>
Start by using <A HREF="repro2.html">Reproducible 2</A> to review the steps
involved in the processing and distribution of frozen foods. Then have children
brainstorm ways they might discover the farthest point from which a frozen
product travels to reach the local supermarket. <P>
For example, students might bring in empty packages from foods consumed
at home and then contact manufacturers listed on the packages to discover
where the processing plants and farms are located. <P>
Have them use plastic pushpins to flag any cities on a large wall map (or
series of maps, if necessary). Then have children use yarn to connect the
pushpins and to calculate the mileage.

<IMG SRC="coolfoodart/cow.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="189" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To begin, assemble some children's books that each illustrate a step-by-step
process behind how something is made. One good choice for younger children
is How Teddy Bears Are Made by Ann Morris (Scholastic, 1994). <P>
A book better suited for older students is How a Book is Made by Aliki (Harper
Trophy, 1988). After reading and discussing the selections with the class,
hold up a few select packages or pictures of frozen food products. Ask children
to tell how they think each of the foods got into the packages. Then share
<A HREF="repro1.html">Reproducible 1</A> to illustrate the stages frozen
foods travel through when moving from &quot;farm to family&quot; or &quot;sea
to shelf.&quot; <P>
As a follow-up to this discussion, have students conduct additional research
so they can create booklets illustrating the specific sequence of steps
involved in processing a particular favorite frozen food product. (You might
suggest they begin by contacting the consumer information phone number featured
on the product packaging.) <P>
Younger children can make simplified versions of these booklets by drawing
and labeling a series of pictures illustrating their understanding of how
frozen foods move from farm to family.

<P>To help children better appreciate how frozen food, related events and
inventors helped revolutionize our available food supply, present students
with the items in the timeline below-only scramble them so they are not
in the correct order. After reading the list together, have children arrange
the events in order on a timeline crafted from a length of adding machine
tape. <P>
Work together to develop a line that spans the dates of the events noted.
(Help children conclude they needn't use an increment to indicate each calendar
year, but rather they can mark increments that span chunks of time.) <P>
Use stick-on notes to record and then post the various events in order on
the line. Suggest to students that they work in pairs or small groups to
learn at least one more fact about an event or inventor featured on the
line.

Compare commercial freezing methods with freezing foods at home<P>
<IMG SRC="coolfoodart/Veggie.gif" WIDTH="286" HEIGHT="193" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This experiment will help students to appreciate how quick-freezing methods
of food preservation affect foods differently than when those same foods
are frozen at home. Show students a variety of fresh vegetables, such as
broccoli and green peppers. Then show them packages of the same vegetables
that have been commercially prepared and frozen. Place both the fresh and
frozen vegetable specimens in a school freezer or take home and place in
your own freezer. <P>
After about seven to ten days, return the vegetables to class and let defrost.
Use a plug-in steamer or wok to cook each vegetable type. At each step of
the experiment, have children observe and report on the differences in color
and texture that exist between the foods that were quick-frozen and those
that were home- frozen. Explain that home-frozen vegetables freeze slowly,
allowing ice crystals to form inside that help destroy the walls (cells)
of the vegetables, making them limp and mushy. <P>
Quick-freezing methods do not allow such damaging crystals to form, so the
foods remain as firm, colorful, and flavorful as when first harvested. Repeat
the experiment using a variety of foods. Have students create graphs that
rate the comparative results for each food type.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL"> Who can forget Smokey the Bear's memorable message? Public service announcements (PSAs) such as Smokey's remind us of things we all need to think about--health, safety, literacy, the environment, and so on.<P>
What messages are important in your students' lives? Set students' imaginations to work by inviting them to create their own PSAs about some of these concerns. PSAs are great classroom projects. As students research important issues of local or global interest, then plan and produce their announcements, they'll make real-life connections across the curriculum and hone cooperative group skills in the process.
Two tools that can help students create powerful PSAs are <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kids/3dmovie.htm">Microsoft 3D Movie Maker</A> and <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kids/creative.htm">Creative Writer</A>. <P>

<FONT FACE="Arial"><OL><LI>Introduce the PSA concept. Share examples of PSAs from television, magazines, and radio. (If possible, prerecord TV and radio spots, and clip PSAs in magazines and newspapers.) Follow up by inviting students to collect and share examples of PSAs they spot.<P>

<LI>Have students brainstorm ideas for PSAs. Ask students to think about classroom activities, their own interests, and local and global issues. Again, bring students together to share ideas, and post a list of topics. (See <A HREF="#topics">Sample PSA Topics</A>.)<P>
<LI>Demonstrate <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kids/3dmovie.htm">3D Movie Maker</A> and <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kids/creative.htm">Creative Writer</A> (or ask a knowledgeable student to assist). This is a good time to introduce the tutorials in <EM>3D Movie Maker</EM>. Then allow students time to explore the products on their own to become familiar with the available options.<P>
<LI>Ask each group to choose a topic for a PSA (subject to your preapproval). Help students refocus if necessary.<P>
<LI>Invite students to sell the concepts to the executive producer (you). Students can use <EM>Creative Writer</EM> to develop "sell sheets" about their PSAs. This is a one-page document that can include the following:<P>
<UL><LI>rationale for the PSA<P>
<LI>description of the planned content and message<P>
<LI>description of the target audience</UL><P>

<LI>Let students present their PSA proposals to classmates. Invite classmates to provide feedback and share ideas. Groups can then refine their plans and storyboard their PSAs.<P>
<LI>Quiet on the set! Have groups use <EM>3D Movie Maker</EM> to turn their sell sheets into animated action. Continue to provide for ongoing feedback, problem solving, and sharing.<P>
<LI>It's a wrap! Celebrate students' achievements at a film festival, where students debut their PSAs in a theater setting, if possible. Use a TV with scan converter or LCD panel so the entire audience can see the PSAs. Who knows? You may find students have work worthy of airtime on your schoolwide video system, local cable channel, or maybe even the local PBS station!</OL></FONT>

<TD>One helpful feature of <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/Encarta">Encarta Encyclopedia</A>, <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/EWA">Encarta World Atlas</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/Bookshelf">Bookshelf</A> is the ease with which they allow students to copy materials from reference source to report document. Instead of taking notes by hand, they can quickly paste information with correctly attributed text, images, or sounds, leaving more time to organize research, work with ideas, and synthesize information.</TD></TR></TABLE><P><HR><P>

<OL><LI><STRONG><EM>Create a report document</EM></STRONG>.<BR>
Before students actually begin researching their topics, it's helpful to have them set up their report documents on <EM>Microsoft Works</EM>. This way they'll be ready to cut and paste information and images as they use the reference materials.<P>
<UL><LI>Launch <EM>Works</EM> or any word processing program and start a new document. For longer reports try <EM>Works'</EM> <STRONG>School Reports/Thesis TaskWizard&#153;</STRONG>. Under this choose <STRONG>Term Paper</STRONG> and follow the on-screen directions. This TaskWizard will create a template for a table of contents, illustrations, tables, and footnote styles.<P>
<LI>Enter information for a title page. Select <STRONG>File</STRONG> and <STRONG>Save</STRONG> your report. Now gather reference information!<P>
</UL>
<FONT SIZE=-1><STRONG>TIP:</STRONG>  Works <STRONG>Bibliography TaskWizard</STRONG> features guidelines for setting up a bibliography.</FONT><P><HR><P>
<LI><STRONG><EM>Meet Nadia Comaneci!</EM></STRONG><BR>
 Launch your Olympics investigation with <EM>Encarta Encyclopedia</EM>. Click <STRONG>Find</STRONG> and type <STRONG>Olympic Games</STRONG> in the PinPointer&#153; dialog box. The resulting list includes an article on the Olympic Games.<P>
<IMG SRC="pinpointer.gif" WIDTH=148 HEIGHT=106 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Gymnastics Article in Encarta">
In the Olympic Games article you can navigate quickly by selecting the <STRONG>Outline</STRONG> view. In the far left column pass your cursor over the <STRONG>Views</STRONG> arrow, select <STRONG>Main</STRONG>, <STRONG>Outline</STRONG>. To find out more about gymnastics, select <STRONG>Women in the Olympics</STRONG>. Within the article the word <STRONG>Gymnastics</STRONG> is highlighted in colored text. Click on it to jump to the gymnastics article, where you will see a picture of Nadia Comaneci. You can copy this, or any other image or text into a <EM>Works</EM> report by following these steps.<P>
<UL><LI>Move your cursor over the arrow in the upper-left corner of the image. Choose <STRONG>Copy Image</STRONG> from the menu.<P>
<LI>Return to your document. Select <STRONG>Edit</STRONG> and <STRONG>Paste</STRONG> the photo into the report.<P>
<LI>Often, images are not the correct size to use in reports. To resize a picture in <EM>Works</EM> (or <EM>Microsoft Word</EM>) click on the image. From the <STRONG>Format</STRONG> menu select <STRONG>Picture</STRONG>. Within this dialog box set the <STRONG>Scaling</STRONG> percentages.<P>
<LI>Go back to <EM>Encarta Encyclopedia</EM> and select the <STRONG>Copy Caption</STRONG> in the image frame. Follow the steps above to paste this information into your report. Images are embedded with a credit line and an appropriate footnote automatically inserts at the bottom of the page.<P>
</UL>
<FONT SIZE=-1><STRONG>TIP:</STRONG>  To enable text to flow around images, follow these steps: On the <EM>Works</EM> menu select <STRONG>Format</STRONG> and <STRONG>Text Wrap</STRONG>, then <STRONG>Absolute</STRONG>, and the text will evenly flow around the image.</FONT><P><HR><P>
<LI><STRONG><EM>Find the flag</EM></STRONG>.<BR>
One of the first things students like to do when they're researching a country is to look at the flag. You can find this, as well as the national anthem, using <EM>Encarta Encyclopedia</EM> or <EM>Bookshelf</EM>. Select <STRONG>Find</STRONG>, then type <STRONG>Romania</STRONG> into the text box. The country article will include a flag that can be easily copied into report documents. <P>
<FONT SIZE=-1><STRONG>TIP:</STRONG>  To easily extend research, try the following features. From <EM>Bookshelf</EM>, select the <STRONG>See Also</STRONG> button.  From <EM>Encarta Encyclopedia</EM>, choose the <STRONG>Related Articles</STRONG> button or scroll to the end of the article to access the <STRONG>Further Reading</STRONG> link. Select this link to access a bibliography of relevant print resources.</FONT><P><HR><P>
<IMG SRC="encartamap.gif" WIDTH=166 HEIGHT=129 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Map and Flag from Encarta">
<LI><STRONG><EM>Romania in detail</EM></STRONG>.<BR>
You'll find an amazing amount of information on Romania in <EM>Bookshelf's</EM> nine-volume reference library, including a brief biography of Nadia Comaneci (with photograph) in the <STRONG>Encyclopedia</STRONG>. 
<EM>Encarta World Atlas</EM> lets you explore Romania in greater geographic detail. Open the <STRONG>Places</STRONG> list in the <STRONG>Find</STRONG> menu. Type in the place where Nadia was born (<STRONG>Onesti</STRONG>). The selected name will appear first in the middle of the screen. Use the <STRONG>Locator's</STRONG> small globe icon to determine the exact latitude and longitude of Onesti. This map can also be copied from the <STRONG>Options</STRONG> menu. Select the <STRONG>Zoom</STRONG> tool to see the scale.<P><HR><P>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Lifestyles, customs, and courtesies</EM></STRONG>.<BR>
What would you be eating if you sat down to a traditional Romanian meal of mititei  and mamaliga? To access pictures and text on Romania's lifestyles, customs, and courtesies (or any other country's), choose <STRONG>Culturgrams</STRONG> from the E<EM>ncarta World Atlas</EM> <STRONG>Find</STRONG> menu and then type <STRONG>Romania</STRONG>. Under <STRONG>Lifestyle</STRONG> select <STRONG>Diet</STRONG> to discover what kind of food they eat. Choose <STRONG>Customs and Courtesies</STRONG> to learn what to say if someone sneezes (<EM>Sanatat&egrave;</EM>). Students will make more connections as they explore this section, for example, looking at sports and education. (What might Romanian kids their age be up to?) <P><HR><P>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Learn more!</EM></STRONG><BR>
A report on Olympic history-maker Nadia Comaneci and Romania is sure to generate excitement about the '96 Summer Games. Consult <EM>Bookshelf's</EM> <STRONG>1996 Almanac</STRONG> for lists of Olympic Games champions and sites for the winter and summer games. Within these lists you'll find names of many other Olympic athletes.<P>
In <EM>Bookshelf's</EM> <STRONG>Internet Directory 96</STRONG> you can link to nearly 5,000 World Wide Web sites by clicking on the address. (You must have an online service provider.) Check under <STRONG>Olympics</STRONG>, <STRONG>Sports</STRONG>, or <STRONG>Athletes</STRONG> to find great Web resources.<P><HR><P>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Organize, integrate, and synthesize</EM></STRONG>.<BR>
After copying and pasting information into the <EM>Works</EM> document, organize text and images to make the report flow. Remind students that when they summarize, paraphrase, and quote material from other sources, they need to accredit their sources. In some cases, a credit will appear with material students cut and paste. After students have their research framework completed they can synthesize the gathered facts and their interpretations into meaningful written reports.

"Let Us Sit Down and Tell Stories"<BR>
 --a Comanche proverb<P></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Native Americans who were here long before there was a United States are often associated with the notion of a natural ecology--a way of living that demonstrates a respect for the Earth and all its creatures. The manner and means by which they shared the ideas that guided their lives came through stories. Therefore, this Comanche proverb seems a fitting introduction to a story-time plan that celebrates the Earth and all its inhabitants.<P>

<A NAME="leopard"></A>
<H2>How The Leopard Got His Spots</H2>
Begin with a reading or retelling of Rudyard Kipling's classic <EM>How the Leopard Got His Spots</EM>. In this familiar story, set in Africa, some easy hunting goes awry for a man and his leopard friend, when the other animals develop camouflage patterns and colors.<P>

A good follow-up for all ages is Julius Lester's <EM>How Many Spots Does a Leopard Have? and Other Tales</EM>, illustrated by David Shannon (Scholastic, 1989). In this adaptation, the vain Leopard is not quite sure Rabbit's solution to counting his spots is right (dark ones and light ones), but since Leopard can't count himself, he also can't argue.<P>

Invite children to suggest their own solutions for counting Leopard's spots, then offer an alternative explanation by reading aloud the poem "Leopard" by Gretchen Kreps (for upper-grade students). (Note: You can find "Leopard" in the <EM>The Random House Book of Poetry for Children</EM>, selected by Jack Prelutsky (Random House, 1983). The poem begins:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>"Eons ago, when the earth was still yeasty,<BR>
The leopard, my love, was an unspotted beasty . . ."</EM><P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Younger children will enjoy <EM>Oscar's Spots</EM> by Janet Robertson (Bridgewater Books, 1993), a story about a leopard who doesn't want to be spotted anymore--until he gets his wish.<P>

<A HREF="http://198.105.232.5:80/catalog/products/Leopard/default.htm#top"><STRONG><EM>How the Leopard Got His Spots</EM> (Microsoft, 1995) on CD-ROM</STRONG></A> features a fine reading of the story by Danny Glover, with original music by Ladysmith Black Mambazo helping to set the scene. For children who wish to revisit the story on their own, there's a version that highlights the text and allows the listener to control the pace of the reading and double click on unfamiliar words. This interactive adventure also offers bountiful follow-up activities, inviting children to explore the animals, people, art, and music of Africa.<P>

Some of the words and music in <EM>How the Leopard Got His Spots</EM> may be new and interesting to students. Talk about differences in the languages and music of various peoples. Visit the World Music and World of Language InterActivities in <A HREF="http://198.105.232.5:80/catalog/products/Encarta/default.htm#top"><STRONG>Microsoft &reg Encarta &reg Encyclopedia</STRONG></A> and experience a unique way to learn.<P>

<A NAME="language"></A>
<H2>Language of Animals</H2>
Bridge the language of humans to the language of animals. Onomatopoeic speech is fascinating, especially when looking at the speech of the very same animal from one language to another. How is it that Swedish pigs say "n&ouml;ff, n&ouml;ff"  (pronounced "nerf, nerf") instead of "oink, oink?" <P>

<A NAME="ocean"></A>
<H2>An Aquatic Tour</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="diamond.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=9 ALT="diamond">Take an aquatic tour in <A HREF="http://198.105.232.5:80/catalog/products/Oceans/default.htm#top"><STRONG>Microsoft Oceans</STRONG></A> to match the sounds animals make to their pictures--not always an easy task! Hear whales sing in Oceans or <A HREF="http://198.105.232.5:80/catalog/products/ExpNat/default.htm#top"><STRONG>Explorapedia &#153; The World of Nature</STRONG></A>. Both provide fascinating introductions to the Earth's largest creature for older and younger children, respectively.<P>

<IMG SRC="diamond.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=9 ALT="diamond">You'll discover many more places to take this story-time plan. Before you exit <A HREF="http://198.105.232.5:80/catalog/products/Oceans/default.htm#top"><STRONG>Oceans</STRONG></A>, check out "Mysterious Relationships" to introduce symbiosis  and mutualism. (Click on "People and the Sea," then select "Science and Survival," and go to "Future of the Oceans.") Students will be awed by such discoveries as the cleaner wrasse, which eats parasites from the skin of the corral trout. Play the Hiding Out game to match animals such as the flat fish to their camouflaged natural habitats. Of course, the idea of camouflage will bring you right back to that leopard!</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="activities"></A>
<H2>Extension Activities</H2>
Opportunities for exploring areas of interest will present themselves in every step of your story plan. For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="diamond.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=9 ALT="diamond">Younger children can browse the savannah grasslands of Africa in <A HREF="http://198.105.232.5:80/catalog/products/ExpNat/default.htm#top"><STRONG>Explorapedia: The World of Nature</STRONG></A>  to meet some of Leopard's companions (and potential dinners!).<BR>
<IMG SRC="diamond.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=9 ALT="diamond">Groups of children can design and create their own symbiotic or camouflaged creatures. Hold a theater of the symbiotic absurd--have groups act out the relationships of their newly created creatures for classmates to describe.<BR>
<IMG SRC="diamond.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=9 ALT="diamond">Using <A HREF="http://198.105.232.5:80/catalog/products/Encarta/default.htm#top"><STRONG>Encarta Encyclopedia</STRONG></A>'s World Languages InterActivity, children can select one of 60 languages to call their own, then find folktales from related cultures to share. Consider making language the connecting link for a study of world history at any grade level.<BR>
<IMG SRC="diamond.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=9 ALT="diamond">Plan a storytelling festival. Children can meet in groups of five to six and share stories from the "old days." Or suggest story-starters for those times when freedom to tell anything is answered with nothing.  (The most trouble I ever got in was . . ..The weirdest thing my brother/sister/ mother/father/friend did was . . .) After children share stories in groups, invite a few volunteers to perform for a larger audience.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P><HR><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>What's your favorite food story? The familiar <EM>I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly</EM> is a great way to introduce a story-time plan about the human body. Where did that fly go? Using <A HREF="http://198.105.232.5:80/catalog/products/Msbocean/default.htm#top"><STRONG>Scholastic's The Magic School Bus &#153; Explores the Human Body</STRONG></A>, children can travel into Arnold's body to check for flies--and a lot more.<P>

You'll find a complete story-time plan on the human body, plus six other plans, in <EM>Multimedia StoryTime</EM>, a resource kit by Steven Herb that integrates story-time activities, books, and CD-ROMs. You can order <EM>Multimedia StoryTime</EM> (a 38-page resource guide and a videotape) through the American Library Association by calling 1-800-545-2433 and pressing 7. The cost is $14.95 plus shipping.

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Video, animation, sound, stills, text, graphics--all at once! How do I do this?" This was Gayle Spinell-Geller's overwhelming first impression of multimedia. Gayle, a media specialist at Coral Springs Middle School in Coral Springs, Florida, quickly realized that integrating multimedia CD-ROMs doesn't have to be "all of the above, all of the time. Like any other tool, you need to use it wisely to achieve goals and support curriculum. It's using the right part of 'all of the above' at the right time."<P>

To overcome that overwhelming first impression, and to help students navigate and make meaningful use of the richness and depth multimedia offers, Gayle recommends the following.<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="diamond.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=9 BORDER=0 ALT="diamond">Make sure your computer can handle the multimedia software you want to use.<P>
<IMG SRC="diamond.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=9 BORDER=0 ALT="diamond">Take time to get to know the product. What parts support your curriculum and can help you meet your goals? Microsoft creates and posts curriculum integration ideas and activity guides at its website: <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/k-12"><STRONG>http://www.microsoft.com/k-12</STRONG></A>.<P>
<IMG SRC="diamond.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=9 BORDER=0 ALT="diamond">Start with a familiar topic. For example, to enrich a unit on animals, you might share a "just so" story with children, then introduce a multimedia version, such as <A HREF="multimedia.html#leopard"><STRONG><EM>How the Leopard Got His Spots</EM></STRONG></A>. (See "<A HREF="lessonplan.html#leopard"><STRONG>A Story Time Lesson Plan</STRONG></A>.") After comparing the two versions, students can use a CD-ROM reference tool, such as <A HREF="http://198.105.232.5:80/catalog/products/Encarta/default.htm#top"><STRONG>Encarta Encyclopedia</STRONG></A>, to learn more about Rudyard Kipling, camouflage, Africa, etc. Your comfort level will increase with experience--until you're using CD-ROMs the way you would a favorite book. <P>

<IMG SRC="diamond.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=9 BORDER=0 ALT="diamond">Be sure to give kids time to explore CD-ROMs randomly, too, and have some fun. "Different kids take to different things," Gayle explains. "Multimedia appeals to all kinds of learners. It gives them a positive feeling."<P>

<IMG SRC="diamond.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=9 BORDER=0 ALT="diamond">Be very conscious of helping children move beyond just finding the facts. Encourage them to use a number of resources, look at similarities and differences, and put the information together in meaningful ways.<P>

Today, we publish nearly 40 magazines, spanning every curriculum area and grade level. These innovative, interactive 
learning materials fit naturally into your curriculum and reflect the best thinking about how children learn.
<BR>
In the 1996-97 school year, our magazines will put a greater emphasis on basic skills and higher-level learning strategies. 
We've also changed the way we produce our current-events magazines to make them more timely than ever before. 
And we have actually lowered or held prices on nearly every magazine we publish.<BR>

Most <I>troglobites </I> (cave creatures) are blind because, living in total darkness, they don't need to see. Some have no eyes at all. But most cave creatures do have a sharp sense of smell, taste, and touch. Biologist Thomas Kane, part of a team that discovered dozens of never-before-seen troglobite species in a Romanian cave, says the creatures use their antennae or legs to "see" by feeling their way around. Also, because they can't be seen by predators, Kane says, troglobites never needed to develop coloring for camouflage, so many are pale or white -- and some are so <I>translucent </I> (see-through) that you can see their blood flowing.<BR>

Fact.<BR>
<BR>
Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) based his classic novel on the story of real-life castaway Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned for four years on a deserted island west of Chile. Largely because of the success of <I>Robinson Crusoe</I>, Defoe became known as the father of the English novel. He is also considered the father of British journalism, as he started the country's first newspaper, <I>The Review.</I><BR>

A play based on the new film version of Robinson Crusoe appears in the September 6, 1996, issue of <I>Scope.</I>

By meteorite.<BR>
<BR>
About 16 million years ago, a comet or asteroid slammed into Mars. A piece of Mars flew off and made it all the way to Earth as a meteorite. It sizzled to a stop on an ice sheet in Antarctica, where a researcher found it in 1984.<BR>
<BR>
That rock was sent to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, where scientists could tell it was from Mars by the materials it was made of. Later, researchers studying the rock made a startling discovery: Microscopic fossils that could prove there was once life on Mars! The fossils look like tiny worms, each 100 times thinner than a human hair.<BR>
<BR>
If there was life on Mars, it seems more likely that there could be life all over the universe. But no one should be worried about an alien invasion any time soon. "I want everyone to understand that we are not talking about little green men," said Daniel Goldin, head of NASA. "These are extremely small."<BR>

The Hindu people of India are usually given credit for inventing the important concept of the number zero, although some evidence shows that other cultures may have used the zero earlier.<BR>
<BR>
Here's how the zero got to us: The numbers we use today (0, 1, 2, 3) were used by the Hindus more than 2,000 years ago. Later, Arab merchants used the Hindu numbers for business and shared them with the rest of the world. After Europeans encountered Arabs during the Crusades in the Middle Ages, they brought the number system back to Europe, where most people were still using the more difficult Roman numeral system (I, II, III). The Hindu-Arabic number system caught on, and sailed with explorers across the ocean to America.<BR>

False.<BR>
<BR>
Experts say smokeless tobacco is at least as harmful as cigarettes. Each "dip" of smokeless tobacco contains the same amount of highly addictive nicotine as three to four cigarettes. And most snuff users ultimately become hard-core smokers. But the gravest danger is oral cancer (cancer of the mouth), a hard-to-detect, often fatal disease. Of the 30,000 cases of oral cancer reported each year, 75 percent are linked to smokeless tobacco.<BR>
<BR>
But most of the 3 million children and teens - mostly boys - who use smokeless tobacco are unaware of the dangers.<BR>

Abigail Adams.<BR>
<BR>
President John Adams and his family were the first residents of the White House. When they arrived at the unfinished mansion, located near what was then a swamp and a forest, they had to light 13 fires just to get rid of the dampness. For lack of a better place, Mrs. Adams hung her laundry in the empty East Room, where state dinners are held today.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Junior Scholastic </I> will examine the historical role of the First Lady in its special Presidential inauguration issue, January 10, 1997.

Other candidates received 2,081 votes (1%).<P>For more than four decades, the Scholastic Student Vote has been a bellwether poll on the general election. Scholastic magazine readers have selected the winning candidate in each of the last eight Presidential elections.<P>"Young people accurately reflect the views of their parents and, historically, the Scholastic Student Vote has been a strong predictor of voting trends around the country," said David Goddy, editor-in-chief of Scholastic's classroom magazines.<P>Clinton also scored a resounding victory in the Electoral College vote. He carried 37 states for 450 electoral votes. Dole won 13 states and 88 electoral votes.<P>In the Student Vote, Clinton scored large victories in key states where he is expected to do well. For instance:<UL COMPACT><LI>California: Clinton 66%, Dole 32%<LI>New York: Clinton 69%, Dole 29%.</UL><P>In the Student Vote, Clinton also captured nearly all the Midwest, with strong victories in:<UL><LI>Michigan: Clinton 64%, Dole 33%<LI>Minnesota: Clinton 65%, Dole 32%<LI>Iowa: Clinton 62%, Dole 35%</UL><P>Clinton also did well in some Republican strongholds including:<UL COMPACT><LI>Florida: Clinton 52%, Dole 44% <LI>Texas: Clinton 50%, Dole 48%. Texas native Ross Perot captured only 2% of the vote.</UL><P>Dole's largest margin of victory was in his home state, Kansas, where he snared 57% of the vote to Clinton's 40%.<P>The Student Vote results are based on a nationwide vote by 322,367 students in grades 1-12 from over 11,000 schools across the country. Ballots were distributed to student subscribers of Scholastic's 32 classroom magazines, including <STRONG>Scholastic News</STRONG>, <STRONG>Update</STRONG>,  and <STRONG>Junior Scholastic</STRONG>. Students also were able to vote through Scholastic Network (http://scholastic.com), the online service for students, teachers, and parents.<P>Teachers applauded the Student Vote project. "This was a great opportunity for our students to give their views on the election process and to learn how government works," said Wendy Cochran, a third grade teacher at Park School in Cambridge, OH. "It's important for students to participate in projects like the election so they become informed and involved in our government."<P>Scholastic is a major multi-media company and is the world's leading publisher and distributor of children's books, classroom and professional magazines, and other educational products. Scholastic also publishes educational software and produces children's and family-oriented video and television programming. The company's international operations include Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France and Mexico.<P>For more information about the Scholastic Student Vote '96, contact Jay Hill at (212) 343-6940.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><A HREF="index.htm">Student Vote '96</A> | <A HREF="results.htm">Election Results</A> | <A HREF="eleccov.htm">Election Coverage &amp; Activities</A><BR><BR><HR WIDTH=75%><P><A HREF="/index.htm">Scholastic Place</A> | <A HREF="/place/signin.htm">Guest Book</A> | <A HREF="/place/custsvce/index.htm">Customer Service</A> | <A HREF="/place/directory.htm">Directory</A></CENTER><P><BR><IMG SRC="/place/placgrfx/redline.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=580 ALIGN=BOTTOM><BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Copyright &copy; 1996 by Scholastic Inc.

Now they will learn how the Food Guide Pyramid helps people to grow strong and healthy, and enables them to learn better.<p><b>What Students Do</b><br><ul><li>discuss the benefits of a healthy diet</li><li>measure serving sizes</li><li>play a Food Guide Pyramid game</li></ul><p><b>Skills Developed</b><br><ul><li>estimating and measuring serving sizes</li><li>drawing conclusions</li></ul><p><b>Materials</b><br><ul><li>Reproducible 4  </li><li>Reproducible 5.  </li><li>oaktag </li><li>dry and liquid measuring cups and spoons </li><li>ounce weighing scale</li><li>sampling of foods listed on servings reproducible</li><li>Parent Reproducible 3  </li><li>Parent Reproducible 4 </li><li>poster paper</li><li>Food Works video</li></ul><p>Before You Begin, work with the food service staff to make measuring cups, spoons, and a scale available to students for Activity 2. Samples of foods from each food group are also necessary for this activity.<p><b>Getting Started</b><br><ul><li>Review the conditions under which plants grow best and the benefits the plants get from the correct balance of soil, light, and water.</li><li>Now ask students to review the comparisons they were challenged to make between the needs of people and plants in Lesson 1. What benefits would they expect people to get from the correct balance of food, water, and exercise? </li><li>Students can make a wall chart of all the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. They could paint pictures of healthy people or make the chart into a poster to encourage others to lead healthy lifestyles.</li></ul><p>CHALLENGE students to think up one change they could make in their daily lives that would improve their health.<p><b>Activity 1  What Is A Healthy Diet?</b><br>	Distribute the Food Guide Pyramid, Reproducible 4.  Allow students time to read it and discuss it. Have them keep it to refer to in upcoming lessons.Explain that the Food Guide Pyramid represents a balanced diet to help people make healthy eating choices. Students may need some help deciphering the pyramid. The following information can be discussed with them: <br><ul><li>The Food Guide Pyramid shows what a balanced daily diet looks like.</li><li>Everybody has different needs. The pyramid provides a range of recommendations. Students should understand that their daily food consumption should include at least the minimum number of servings for each of the major food groups.</li></ul><br>	Review the food chain discussed in the previous lesson. Challenge students to determine which of the major food groups include foods from plants, which from animals. Which food groups does the pyramid recommend more servings from each day?<br>	Have students work in teams to figure out how many foods they can name for each food group. Inform them that the bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group is also known as the grain group because all these foods come from grains. Which food groups could they name the most foods for? Where did they place combination foods such as burritos? Have them list their favorite foods and try to place them in the pyramid.<p><b>Activity 2  How Much is a Serving?</b><br>	Review the "Munching at the Mall" segment of the Food Works video where the Food Guide Pyramid is <br>discussed and Zelda and Noah interview people about the number of servings theyÕve had from different food groups that day.<br>	Distribute Reproducible 5.  Have students look at the foods they brought into class and estimate how many servings of each they eat at a sitting. For example, if they eat cereal with milk for breakfast, they might estimate that they eat one serving from the grain group and one serving from the milk group.<br>	Divide students into teams and give each team some of the foods brought into class by your food service team. Students take turns using measuring spoons, cups, and scales to measure out serving sizes. Then, they return to the estimates they made earlier.<br>	Ask:<ul><li>Would you like to change your earlier estimates?</li><li>How does looking at a serving size help you estimate?</li><li>How can looking at serving sizes help you estimate the number of servings in combination foods?</li><li>Have students work in teams to make a serving-size poster showing full-scale drawings of serving sizes.</li></ul><p><b>Wrap It Up: Daily Diet Rummy</b><br><ul><li>Divide students into groups of five or six members. Make a copy of the Food Guide Pyramid reproducible, enlarged 200 percent, for each team. These will serve as each groupÕs game board and as a guide for creating playing cards.</li><li>Ask students to fold their oaktag into eighths and cut out each square. These squares will be the playing cards. Each team member chooses a food group and draws a different food from that group on their cards and a sweet on the eighth card.</li><li>When groups are done designing their cards, children shuffle them together and deal out five cards to each </li>player. Leftover cards become the draw pile. The object of the game is to collect enough cards to complete three rounds and build a pyramid.<li>Taking turns, students discard a card and draw a new one from the deck or from the discard pile. (As in regular rummy, students may pick up any number of cards from the discard pile to get one "buried" there.) A student completes the first round when he or she gets a full hand of foods from the grain group. Remind them that they should eat at least 6 servings from this group daily. The students then place a marker on the game board.</li><li>To complete the second round, they have to get 3 foods from the vegetable group and 2 from the fruit group.</li><li>To complete the final round and win the game, they have to get 2 foods from the meat group, 2 from the milk group, and 1 sweet.</li></ul><p><b>Lunchroom Link</b><br>Let students compare the proportions of each group found in weekly lunchroom menus to the Food Guide Pyramid. They can use math manipulatives to represent the proportions and create a "lunchroom pyramid."Students can invite food service staff to talk about how they create balanced menus. Students also can highlight their favorite combinations from the cafeteria menu for the week and distribute recommended menus to other classes. They should decorate their menus with catchy slogans about healthy lifestyles.<p><b>Taking It Further</b><br>View the Food Works video again, paying special attention to the "Eat Smart" music video at the opening and closing. Challenge students to create their own song urging others to use the Food Guide Pyramid to help them make food choices.Students can write the lyrics and decorate their song sheets with illustrations, perform their songs for other classes, or, if the equipment is available, record their songs or produce their own music videos.<p><b>Home Connection</b><br>In Parent Reproducible 3, Building Healthy Meals and Snacks, the Food Guide Pyramid is presented. Ask children to explain the pyramid to their parents. Distribute Parent Reproducible 4, Roots, Stems, Leaves, Fruits, Flowers, and Seeds, a page of fun parent/child activities based on the different parts of plants.</blockquote><p><hr width=200><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dear Reader:<P>
The story of Scholastic's 75 years parallels the changes in our society -- from the optimistic days of the 1920's, when Scholastic was founded with a single magazine, to the late 20th century, when the company became the largest children's book publisher in the world, as well as a leading educational publisher specializing in reading and technology.<P>
When M.R. Robinson, my father, started Scholastic with a single magazine and a single mission -- to bring the contemporary world into the classroom -- he did not know how hard he would have to work to earn the trust of teachers. Though they were slow to accept the idea of magazines in the classroom, my father remained focused on editorial excellence and eventually won their trust. Today, Scholastic's 50 magazines around the world, with a combined circulation of 10 million, form the basis of the company's reputation for excellence.<P>
The trust of teachers translated into ready acceptance of school book clubs and book fairs. Teachers used clubs and fairs to provide a variety of high-quality, inexpensive children's books, which motivated children to read more and learn more. Over the years, the support and trust of teachers, children, and parents have helped Scholastic become the largest publisher and distributor of children's books in the world.<P>
Building on the reputation of Scholastic's magazines and children's books, the company has created multimedia products -- video, television, and CD-ROM -- based on <I>Clifford the Big Red Dog</I>,&#160;  <I>The Magic School Bus</I>,&#160; <I>The Baby-sitters Club</I>,&#160; <I>Goosebumps</I>,&#160; and other Scholastic titles. The company has also become a pioneer in school-based educational software.<P>
And, as the new millennium approaches, Scholastic has strengthened its support of reading by introducing <I>Literacy Place</I>&#160; -- a new reading program designed to give children the skills they need for the 21st century -- and has expanded its horizons into new technology by creating <I>Scholastic Network</I>,&#160; the on-line service for schools.<P>
Scholastic has been able to expand only because we have won the support of teachers and schools, and the trust of children and parents.  <P>
We are proud of the many fine, innovative materials we have created--such as classroom magazines, book clubs, book fairs, and our new literacy and technology programs. But we are most proud of our reputation as &quot;The Most Trusted Name in Learning.&quot; <P>

<h2><i><b>Tire Recycling Company Seeks Partner for Worldwide Cooperation</b></i></h2>
We are about to start up a recycling plant, processing used tires by pyrolysis. From this we get gas, oil, steel, and carbon black. The caron black, (which by our process, obtains a higher quality) has been tested and approved by different rubber and plastics industries. Right now, we seek a partner (share holder, joint venture) to work with us in setting up the first plant as well as worldwide cooperation in the manufacturing and sale of our products. All of the finances and product outlets are ready for the first plant, which has a completely closed system and is environmentally clean. We can change any pile of tires into valuable products with good payback, guaranteed.

    <p>I am a graduate of an environmental science program at Centennial College in Scarborough, ON. I have been working at a 50 tpd windrow composting facility near Toronto, ON. since the end of my second year of school. I have essentially hit "the glass ceiling" at this facility. Composting economics being what they are, this company is unable to offer me advancement. I finished at the top of my class with a 4.3 GPA, and if your facility or company needs an enthusiastic, motivated composter with 80 hours of loader time under his belt.</p>

<h2><b><i>Management Position</i></b></h2>

    <p>I have been working at the Center for Plastics Recycling Research
for the past 11 years. Pioneering recycling research since 1985,
our activities were much closer to the industrial reality than to the
academic environment. With the recent closing of CPRR I feel it
is time to return to industry. My objective now is to obtain a
management position where I can use my engineering skills and
the experience I have accumulated in 19 years of professional work.</p>

<p>I have nineteen years of industrial and academic experience as a
mechanical /industrial engineer, eleven of which on the development
of plastics recycling technology, project coordination, and plant
management. Additional experience on systems engineering, plant
design, and production planning. I hold a M.S. degree in Industrial
& Systems Engineering from Rutgers University, I am an advanced
computer user, and I am fluent in English, Portuguese and Spanish.</p>

The impression you receive immediately as you look at his drawings, his characters, posters or projects is that of an artist gifted with great creativity and a rich reserve of technique, experience and culture.<p>

Born in Genova, Italy, in 1930 Marco Biassoni starts there his career as a graphical artist and illustrator. In 1961 He moves to Milano where he begins working in  TV advertising. He creates and produces numerous films especially animated ones, for TV commercials and creates original animated characters which give him wide recognition throughout Italy. <p>

Meanwhile he continues developing his work as a cartoonist and his strips appear in major daily newspapers as well as magazines, winning several prizes and recognitions. Indipendent, versatile and eclectic, Marco Biassoni remains lucid and coherent in his stile. In over 30 years of career he has never compromised to "fads" but maintained a perfect balance between imagination and reality, wit and irony. <p>
His drawings are immediate and incisive, reaching always the core: the result of a vast and mature experience in the art of communication.

These inspiring, majestic Watercolor Prints on (hard to find) Recycled Paper will grace your walls or serve as a unique gift.  We offer you Open Edition and Limited Edition prints from Winden's fine collection. 
<p>
The artist, William Winden, lives surrounded by the firs, cedars, maples and ground covers of Puget Sound which serve as the subjects of many of his paintings. &quot;<tt><i>Growing up and working in the Pacific Northwest I've been in the presence of the transcendent beauty, the turbulent power and, often, the fragility of the natural world, of which I am a part.  In my work, I try to create images which communicate these qualities of our environment to others</i></tt>.&quot; 
<p>
As always, our prices on the Internet are much lower than retail (if you can even find these in stores).

in hotel rooms. The container simplifies collection of recyclables while
making the recycling effort of the hotel more visible.</p>
