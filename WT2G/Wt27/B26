<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

   A.E. Staley Mfg. Co. and UPIU Local 7837, Decatur, Illinois

                         August 2, 1995
                             Chicago

     In August, 1993, the AFL-CIO Executive Council adopted a
resolution calling upon all AFL-CIO affiliates to render all
appropriate assistance to the members of United Paperworkers
International Union locked out by A.E. Staley Co. 

     This year, the UPIU members voted to reject Staley's latest
contract offer.

     Pepsi-Cola is one of Staley's single largest customers and
therefore is effectively subsidizing Staley's attacks on its
workers.  In response, the UPIU and its Local 7838 have designated
the weekend of August 25-27 as Action on Pepsi Weekend, and have
urged trade unionists to coordinate activities during that weekend
to publicize Pepsi's connection to the Staley lockout.

     The AFL-CIO urges Pepsi to use its discretion to replace
Staley as a supplier of corn sweetener for its soft drinks until
Staley ends the lockout and signs a fair labor agreement.

     The Federation renews its call for its affiliated unions to
render all appropriate assistance to UPIU in this dispute and urges
all affiliates and state and central labor councils to participate
in the UPIU-designated Action on Pepsi Weekend during the weekend of
August 25-27 and again during the Labor Day weekend.</pre>

<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                            Harry Wu

                         August 2, 1995
                             Chicago


     Harry Wu was arrested on June 19, 1995, by the Chinese
government and has since been charged with espionage.  A survivor
of 19 years in China's forced labor camps, known as the Laogai,
Wu has dedicated his life to exposing the Chinese government's
forced labor system.

     Harry Wu has long campaigned for the freedom of others. It
is our turn to campaign for his freedom.

     At great personal risk, Wu has returned to China three times
to document the human rights abuses in the Laogai. He is the
world's most important voice for those he calls the &quot;millions of
faceless and nameless ordinary people&quot; who are the victims of the
Chinese government's violation of its citizens' most basic human
rights.  

     Wu is a close friend of the AFL-CIO. In 1990, he prepared
and the AFL-CIO published the first map of Laogai camp locations
throughout China. The AFL-CIO Food and Allied Services Trades
Department has given him its special Worker Award.

     The AFL-CIO Executive Council calls upon President Clinton
and Secretary of State Christopher to do everything in their
power to obtain Harry Wu's immediate release. The Federation will
take part in a nationwide campaign to free Wu and urges all
affiliated unions to join with other groups in this grassroots
effort.</pre>

<pre>              Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                                  on

       A New Tack in the Campaign to Get Rid of American Workers

                            August 2, 1995
                                Chicago


      Congress shortly will be considering legislation specifically
designed to weaken the American domestic waterways transportation
system by gutting the existing cabotage law and opening up the
trade to foreign companies allowed to replace American workers with
imported, low-cost foreign workers not covered by any U.S. labor
laws. Of vital concern to all American workers is the precedent
such action would have, leading to an incursion of foreign
interests and foreign workers exempt from U.S. protections in all
forms of domestic transportation -- including rail, trucking and
air.

      These efforts to destroy the U.S. domestic transportation work
force are being led and funded by American companies with foreign
flag shipping interests and foreign corporations anxious to move
into the domestic transportation scene with foreign workers hired
from the world's most exploitable pools of labor. These forces
choose to ignore the fact that there are vital national security
and economic factors that have long ensured that transportation
within the physical confines of the United States has been in the
hands of American companies and U.S. workers.

      All American workers in domestic transportation are threatened
by any legislation which aims to replace workers earning U.S. wage
and benefit levels with workers from underdeveloped nations who
would be exempt from the nation's labor laws and protections.
Ironically, such legislation, if adopted, would signal every U.S.-
based company that they no longer need to go offshore to evade
American labor standards. Such legislation implies that in the not
too distant future, Congress will entertain the idea that exploited
foreign labor can be imported to the United States and made exempt
from U.S. laws.

      Recognizing that efforts to devalue America's cabotage laws
are nothing but a transparent attempt to reduce the standards of
all workers employed in America's domestic transportation systems,
the AFL-CIO registers its vigorous and absolute support for the
nation's existing cabotage laws.</pre>

                    The Oklahoma City Bombing

                           May 9, 1995
                        Washington, D.C.


     We join all Americans in expressing shock, outrage and sorrow
over the terrorist bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City and
the murder of 166 people.  This tragedy will long be remembered as one
of America's darkest moments.
     The heightened threat of anti-government terrorism has added to
the heavy burden that government employees must carry every day at
their jobs.  Even before the Oklahoma City incident, death threats
were directed at these workers by individuals who were venting their
anger over government programs.  The indications that the perpetrators
of this crime may have been inspired by one or more of the self-styled
&quot;patriot&quot; or &quot;militia&quot; groups now operating in many states greatly
increases this concern.
     Hate speech and violent actions against the government and its
employees have no place in our society.  We support America's
democratic institutions and we stand against the militant,
anti-government rhetoric that appears to have spurred the horrible
tragedy at the federal building in Oklahoma City.</pre>

<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

               Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act

                           May 9, 1995
                        Washington, D.C.


     The Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act is intended to provide
tariff and market access equivalent to NAFTA for products from the
Caribbean region.  In its current form, however, it would harm working
people in the United States and the Caribbean Basin.
     It would result in the loss of thousands of jobs in the U.S.
apparel industry.  And it would undermine the protections of Caribbean
Basin workers' rights that are now contained in several American trade
laws.
     The AFL-CIO strongly favors reform of our trade relationships
with the Caribbean Basin countries, but any legislation should promote
the interests of working people on both sides.
     It should set clear, enforceable workers' rights and labor
standards for any nation seeking NAFTA parity, including:
     - an initial review of its observance of internationally
recognized workers' rights, followed by annual reviews in which
private individuals and organizations can participate fully;
     - a system of sanctions that can target specific companies or
areas that are guilty of violating workers' rights;
     - guarantees that existing protections in the Caribbean Basin
Initiative and elsewhere in U.S. law for workers in the region will be
retained; and,
     - the ending of tariff preferences levels (TPL) in the CBI.
     The Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act in its present version
does not meet those objectives.  In five respects, it falls short of
what is needed.
     First, this Act would bring to an end the petitioning process in
the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which has helped to give
Caribbean Basin workers some leeway in organizing independent trade
unions.
     Second, a shift by these countries to the NAFTA framework, which
is the bill's main purpose, would mean a wholesale extension of all
the disadvantages contained in NAFTA.  There would be strong
protections for the rights of investors and multinational corporations
-- intellectual property protection, favorable treatment of foreign
investment, and the rest -- but the protections of workers' rights and
environmental standards would be a mockery.
     Third, this legislation confers automatic eligibility on all 27
nations in the Caribbean Basin, without reviewing whether they
currently comply with international standards for workers' rights or
even whether they meet any of the reciprocal obligations that Mexico
undertook in NAFTA.
     Fourth, the bill would manipulate tariff preference levels (TPL)
and allow non-CBI producers to increase their access to U.S. markets
through the back door.  This would create great incentives for fraud
and transshipment.
     Finally, the Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act would cut duties
on CBI imports and thus reduce tax revenues by more than $1 billion
over the next four years.
     The Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act now before Congress might
prove to be a bonanza for the wealthy, but it would be a disaster for
working people both there and here.  Congress should remedy its
defects or it should be defeated.</pre>

<title>Information Super Highway</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

                  The Information Superhighway

                          May 10, 1995
                        Washington, D.C.


     The development of the &quot;information superhighway&quot; -- a web of
communications networks, computers, databases and consumer electronics
-- is changing the way Americans live, work, learn and interact with
others.  This ongoing revolution in communications technology will
profoundly affect working Americans, their unions, their communities
and society as a whole -- for better or for worse.
     Because the lion's share of the new information infrastructure is
being developed by the private sector, its potential for good is
threatened by enterprises whose aim is to control the system in order
to maximize profits.  For this reason, government action must ensure
that it is the public interest and not these private interests that
prevails.
     There are already disparities in access to information and
technology.  Some private elementary schools require students to own
laptop computers, while public schools in poor neighborhoods can't
even afford to keep their libraries open.  Converging communications
industries are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in creating
and providing information for those who have ready cash to pay for
them.  But there are no clear federal policies aimed at ensuring
universal and affordable access to these increasingly vital services.
Without such policies, the information superhighway will certainly
exacerbate the gap between rich and poor by dividing the country into
&quot;information haves&quot; and &quot;information have-nots.&quot;
     Over the past 14 years, the revolution in the telecommunications
industry has produced the loss of a quarter-million high-wage,
high-tech jobs.  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the
number of jobs for computer and peripheral equipment operators, as
well as the number of typists, word processors, data entry keyers and
bank tellers, will decline by another 122,000 over the next decade.
While information processing jobs were once thought to be immune to
the pressures of international trade, the information superhighway's
expansion is not and will not be detoured by national borders.  Its
growth has already facilitated the export of U.S. jobs to low-wage
countries.
     Advances in communications technology have also taken a toll on
the individuals responsible for the content that travels on the
information superhighway.  The new technologies have increased the
unauthorized, uncompensated use of information, at home and abroad, at
the expense of the people who create and own it.
     Clearly, government policy for the information superhighway
should be directed at assuring that the workers who produce,
disseminate and deliver information do so under good wages, standards
and working conditions.  Federal law should guarantee that they have a
genuine voice on the job through independent trade unions and adequate
protection of their privacy rights.  Our copyright laws should be
vigorously enforced to protect against inappropriate use of
U.S.-produced information in both domestic and overseas markets.
     The AFL-CIO calls on the Clinton Administration and Congress to
take the actions necessary to assure that all Americans have
affordable access to a national information infrastructure -- in their
homes, at school, in the libraries or through community centers --
that reserves adequate space for the use of public, non-commercial
interests in order to ensure diverse programming, open networks and
quality information services.  And government at all levels should
strive to increase public access to its documents and services through
new communications technologies.
     The AFL-CIO encourages all affiliates, state federations and
local central bodies to explore ways that the labor movement can use
the new communications technologies to promote labor's historic vision
of a greater voice for working people on the job and in their
communities.</pre>

<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

              The International Labor Organization

                           May 9, 1995
                        Washington, D.C.


     Current congressional efforts to end all American government
contributions to the International Labor Organization are
ill-considered and would greatly harm the U.S. national interest.
     The American labor movement is justifiably proud of the ILO and
its accomplishments.  Largely the brainchild of Samuel Gompers, the
founder and first president of the American Federation of Labor, the
ILO was established at the end of World War I to promote peace by
working on behalf of social and economic justice.  It was and still is
the only international body in which worker and employer delegates
have an equal voice with government representatives in policy
determination.  Its unique supervisory machinery effectively focuses
attention on worker rights violations.  And, despite modest resources,
the ILO has made significant progress over the years in the struggle
against totalitarianism and for basic human and trade union rights.
     At a time when capital and technology move across international
borders with increasing ease, communities of working people are
becoming ever more vulnerable to the decisions of multinational
employers and to the ravages of a market uncontrolled by democratic
debate and decision.  To ensure that this new global economy benefits,
and does not exploit, the workers whose activism and sacrifices made
it possible, democratic governments must do all they can to ensure
that economic development is not achieved at the price of human
freedom.
     The ILO is uniquely qualified to serve in this endeavor because
its fundamental test of a society's worth is whether it provides human
beings -- be they employers, workers or anyone else -- the freedom to
band together to pursue their common interests.  While it's one thing
to espouse the rhetoric of progress, freedom and human rights, it is
wholly another to actually protect the right of ordinary working men
and women to decide for themselves -- through their own, independent
institutions -- how their societies will be fashioned.  This is a
challenge that has been met by the ILO many times over.  We expect no
less from our elected representatives when they decide the fate of

The Attack on Working Americans </h2>
<h3 align="center">February 20, 1995<br>
Bal Harbour, Fla. </h3>
<hr>
<p>Anti-worker interests are using their control of Congress and
numerous state houses to launch an assault on working American
families. Their broad legislative agenda would subvert workplace
democracy and undermine virtually every social and economic gain
the labor movement has ever achieved. </p>
<p>Republican economic policies created huge annual budget
shortfalls and vastly increased the national debt during the
1980s. Now, the new congressional majority wants to
constitutionally outlaw deficit spending by the federal
government at the price of the nation's future. Its leaders are
moving to sharply curtail, or to eliminate, a broad range of
government programs that help working people. And, they promise
to shower more money and license on the rich and powerful through
tax cuts for the well-to-do and widespread deregulation of
businesses. </p>
<p>Their obvious intent is to curtail government's role as an
instrument of human progress and as a means of maintaining a just
and decent society. Their goal is to place America's future in
the hands of unfettered markets, and not the American people. </p>
<p>Though it is cloaked in populist rhetoric, this agenda would
shift power away from elected government and hand it to
un-elected, privileged interests -- those who are best able to
flourish in a savage economy where market forces and the pursuit
of profit reign supreme. </p>
<p>In their rush to serve private interests at all costs, the
newly-ascendant powers in Congress scorn the genuine, ongoing
concerns of working Americans. </p>
<p>In the face of falling wages, evaporating benefits and
increasing job insecurity, they propose to relax wage and hour
regulations, repeal prevailing wage laws covering government
contracts and encourage precarious, contingent employment. </p>
<p>At a time when thousands of workers continue to die on the job
each year, they propose to Transform The Occupational Safety And
Health Administration From An Enforcement Agency Into A
&quot;Consultant.&quot; </p>
<p>While promising to protect the interests of older Americans,
they advance a Balanced Budget Amendment that, if enacted, would
leave no real choice but to reduce Social Security benefits. </p>
<p>Even though health care costs threaten to bankrupt millions of
working families, they propose to shift more costs to workers and
retirees through sharp cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. </p>
<p>While proposing to cut off welfare recipients and require them
to work, they damn government job creation and child care
initiatives. </p>
<p>They rail against crime and the deterioration of community
life, but slash the ranks of the public workers who dedicate
their lives to maintaining a safe and decent environment in our
streets and throughout society. </p>
<p>They pretend to embrace the ideals of past struggles for civil
rights, but propose to narrow the scope and weaken the
enforcement of anti-discrimination and affirmative action laws. </p>
<p>While giving lip service to American leadership in the world,
they move to diminish government's ability to promote peace and
expand democracy through modest assistance to struggling
countries. </p>
<p>They talk about &quot;job creation and wage enhancement,&quot;
but support the export of U.S. jobs to countries where
governments oppress and abuse working people. </p>
<p>And, while they speak of &quot;cooperation&quot; as the
essential key to the future of labor-management relations, they
seek to enhance the power of employers to create undemocratic,
company unions. </p>
<p>The American labor movement, which has struggled for more than
a century to create clearings of civilization in the jungle of
the marketplace, will vigorously oppose their efforts. </p>
<p>The vast majority of working Americans are proud of their
country and the high standards they've built over many years --
air and water that is cleaner, workplaces and products that are
safer, greater income and racial equality, and a system that
protects workers from destitution when they retire. They continue
to believe in a society dedicated to affording everyone the
chance to make a decent living, to have some measure of job
security and to provide their children with a good education and
opportunities for a better life. They want a voice -- a genuine
voice -- at their jobs. They continue to favor decent health care
for all of their fellow citizens. They know that their country
must actively pursue freedom, democracy and social justice in the
world, lest America's own standards be threatened. </p>
<p>This is where working Americans stand -- today, tomorrow and
far into the future. </p>

                     <a name="THE RUSH TO DEREGULATE">THE RUSH TO DEREGULATE</a>

     The Republican leadership in Congress is rushing forward with
legislation that would tear down the federal government's entire
regulatory system and roll back years of progress in protecting
health, safety and the environment. Promoted as necessary reforms
to make government regulation more efficient and less onerous, the
Republican proposals are ill-conceived, unworkable measures that
would create chaos and leave the public and workers without
important protections.

     The major anti-regulatory measures being advanced by House
Republicans are:

     The Regulatory Transition Act (H.R.450): Republicans have
     proposed a regulatory moratorium that would stop all federal
     rulemaking activity until the end of the year and delay the
     implementation of all rules issued since November 1994. This
     legislation would stop important new rules -- like the
     proposed OSHA ergonomics standard -- from moving forward. It
     would delay implementation of many important measures
     including the Family and Medical Leave Act rules issued in
     January 1995.

     The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act (H.R.9): This is a
     far-reaching measure that would make it much more difficult
     for the government to issue important safeguards. It gives new
     rights to regulated businesses at the expense of protecting
     workers and the public. Among other provisions, this bill
     would:

     _ Require extensive risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses
     for safety, health and environmental rules, thereby doubling
     the time and money needed to issue new measures. The bill
     overrides all existing health, safety and environmental laws.
     Standards would no longer be set at a level to protect health,
     but rather at a level where the costs of the rule did not
     exceed the benefits.

     _ Allow representatives of regulated businesses to sit on peer
     review panels and judge the scientific basis of proposed and
     final rules.

     _ Give extensive new rights to regulated parties to challenge
     rules or enforcement actions and to be compensated by
     taxpayers if restrictions resulted in more than a 10 percent
     reduction in the value of property.

     _ Set a cap on the total cost of rules that could be imposed
     on the private sector. New rules could only be issued if
     others were revoked, so government protection would be
     rationed among the nation's citizens.

     _ Give the Office of Management and Budget much broader
     authority to review and disapprove rules that are deemed to
     create unnecessary paperwork burdens. The bill overturns the
     Supreme Court's decision in Dole v. Steelworkers and allows
     OMB to review and disapprove requirements for information to
     be given to third parties, including toxic chemical
     information and the results of workplace exposure monitoring.

     Anti-regulatory legislation also has been introduced in the
Senate. Their proposals include a proposed regulatory moratorium
(S.219) and a variety of proposals (S.244, S.291, S.343) that 
require more regulatory analyses and reviews and permit a
Congressional veto of final rules. Though not as far-reaching as
most of the House proposals, these measures would make it much more
difficult for the federal government to issue important new
protections.</pre>

                    <a name="BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT">BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT</a>

     The proposed balanced budget amendment to the U.S.
Constitution is a $1 trillion pig in a poke that raises serious
questions, both economic and constitutional.

     Backers of this drive in both the House and Senate refused to
offer any details of just how they plan to come up with the
estimated $1.3 trillion in spending cuts needed to bring the
federal budget to balance by the year 2002, as proposed.  Twice
they voted down measures that would have required a detailing of
these massive cuts.

     A balanced budget amendment would assure a return to the boom-
and-bust economic cycles of the pre-Depression era by dismantling
the fiscal weapons needed to combat both unemployment and
inflation.  Recessions would be made more severe as such built-in
stabilizers as unemployment compensation and social welfare
programs would be choked off.  Legislation needed to create jobs
and stimulate the economy would be unlikely to secure the three-
fifths vote of Congress required by the amendment to approve
deficit spending.

     Cutting $1.3 trillion from the federal budget would throw the
U.S. economy into a deep recession or depression.  Major federal
programs would be wiped out and the economy would almost assuredly
go into a tailspin, with even higher levels of unemployment.

     A balanced federal budget would reduce revenues to the states,
forcing increased state and local property taxes.  A new study by
the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated state and
local governments could lose some $100 billion annually in federal
aid under the terms of the Republican plans.  While the GOP
promises not to raise federal taxes, a family of four in the 10
hardest hit states would see its state and local tax bill jump more
than $2,100 in order to maintain services now covered by the
federal aid.

     The amendment would eliminate Congress's ability to make
fiscal policy decisions by majority vote.  The three-fifths
``super-majority'' vote required to approve deficit spending is
rigid and politically unworkable.  It undermines the concept of
majority rule and gives control over the ``power of the purse'' to
a congressional minority.  The political will of the American
people -- determined by the election process -- would be
circumvented, with a 40 percent congressional minority would
dictate key policy decisions.

     A balanced budget amendment would cripple congressional fiscal
powers to fight recessions and inflation or otherwise maintain
national economic stability.  It would undermine representative
government by limiting its power and by distorting the fragile
system of constitutional checks and balances.  At the same time it
would result in the dismantling of 50 years of labor-backed,
progressive programs designed to achieve some measure of economic
and social justice for all citizens -- which may be the real hidden
agenda behind this amendment.</pre>

                            <a name="TAX CUTS">TAX CUTS</a>

     The AFL-CIO would support any measure that would bring greater
progressivity to the tax code and do so without reducing federal
revenues and increasing the deficit. We strongly oppose the tax
provisions of the &quot;Contract with America&quot; that would deprive the
nation of badly needed revenues while providing wealthy individuals
and corporations with massive, ill-deserved tax breaks.

     Real tax relief for working families could be paid for by
closing wasteful tax loopholes that mainly benefit corporations and
the wealthy.

     Republican tax cut proposals would result in $725 billion in
lost revenues over the next 10 years. More than 54 percent of all
the proposed tax cuts would go to taxpayers with incomes above
$100,000 per year, the richest 5 percent, according to Treasury
Department estimates.

     Beyond the enormous revenue loss and the inequitable
application of the cuts, the AFL-CIO has other serious concerns
about how the cuts would be financed and the net effect on working
families: if federal aid to education or student loans are cut at
the same time; if a family breadwinner who loses a job finds
federal retraining programs are cut at the same time; and if the
Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, causing an
economic slowdown, the elimination of jobs and increases in
mortgages and other loan payment.

     Among the tax provisions that primarily benefit corporations
and the wealthy, including the capital gains tax cut, &quot;neutral cost
recovery&quot; depreciation changes, the increased estate and gift tax
exemption, and most of the proposed IRA liberalizations, especially
the so-called &quot;American Dream Savings Account.&quot;

     The proposed cuts in capital gains taxes would cost $183
billion between 1995 and 2005. The dogged insistence by some that
deep cuts in capital gains taxes will not cause revenue loss is
sheer economic nonsense.

     Tax preferences accorded income from capital gains are
inherently unfair. They result in taxing the wages and salaries of
working people at a higher rate than the profits for the wealthy
from such transactions as the sale of stocks, bonds, real estate or
other property. It is a tax preference not available to most
working men and women who pay the lion's share of taxes and who
must meet their income tax obligations every payday. More than two-
thirds of all the benefits from capital gains tax preferences
accrue to taxpayers with annual incomes in excess of $200,000.

     Cutting capital gains taxes also will stimulate the tax
shelter industry, which is based heavily on schemes to convert
ordinary income into preferentially taxed capital gains. The huge
50 percent differential, plus indexing, would exclude almost two-
thirds of capital gains from taxation.

     The AFL-CIO is concerned that the proposal to phase out the
1993 increase in the taxable portion of Social Security benefits
received by upper income retirees would worsen the looming Medicare
financing crisis.</pre>

                         <a name=" MINIMUM WAGE"> MINIMUM WAGE</a>

     President Clinton has called for a 90-cent adjustment in the
minimum wage over the next two years.  The AFL-CIO supports this
adjustment.

     The minimum wage is now $4.25 per hour and has been at this
level since 1991.  The historic level of minimum wage, 50 percent
of average hourly earnings, calls for a minimum wage of $5.69
today.  Clearly a minimum wage of $5.15 two years from now is a
step in the right direction, but a modest one.  The high point in
purchasing power of the minimum wage, in 1968, translates to a
minimum wage of $6.29 per hour today.  

     The myth that an increase in the minimum wage will lead to a
loss of jobs is refuted by recent surveys.  In a series of studies,
economists Lawrence Katz and Alan B. Krueger found that the 1990
and 1991 increases in the minimum wage had no negative impact on
fast food industry jobs in Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania.  In fact, they discovered that employment
actually increased, rather than decreased.

     Their conclusions were based on interviews of managers at 400
fast food establishments since fast food, theory says, is one
industry most generally affected by minimum wage increases.  The
rise in employment could not, however, be credited to the
subminimum training wages, enacted as part of the 1989 bill.  The
Labor Department found that only 5 percent of businesses even used
the subminimum wage.

     Finally, increasing the minimum wage also serves to reduce
poverty and taxes.  When the minimum wage is too low, as it is now,
the burden on the working poor and public assistance programs
increases.  And this increases the burden on taxpayers.</pre>

                           <a name="HEALTH CARE">HEALTH CARE</a>

     Recent reports about declining average employer payments for
health benefits are certainly welcome news to employers and
employees alike. But they mask a wide disparity in costs between
big and small employers and continued cost-shifting from employers
to employees. Most significantly, they disguise the underlying
trend of health costs still rising at twice the rate of overall
inflation, a rate that is devastating family, business and
government budgets.

     The price Americans will have to pay for the success that
Republicans and anti-reform Democrats had in defeating health care
reform in the 103rd Congress is enormous.

     In the long-term, high health costs wreak havoc with the
country's economy. A recently released estimate puts the loss in
real GDP at half a percent over five years and 1.3 percent over 17
years; employment will be off by 1.7 percent in manufacturing
industries and by 1.9 percent in construction.

     In the short-term, high health costs devastate the health
coverage and wages of average-earner Americans. Falling real wages
continue to be the rule for working families -- despite impressive
improvements in productivity -- due in large measure to high health
costs. A recent study of private pension coverage by the AFL-CIO
Department of Employee Benefits shows that deteriorating retirement
income security also is directly related to excessive health care
costs. 

     American families are paying in another way for the failure of
the 103rd Congress to act against excess health costs. Employers
are adopting more and more aggressive managed care techniques as
they attempt to stem hemorrhaging balance sheets. 

     When done in a balanced manner and with proper consumer
safeguards, managed care has delivered significant savings while
maintaining and sometimes improving quality and consumer choice.
But the rush to managed care is now fueling an industry-wide
restructuring, with for-profit conglomerates controlling a larger
and larger number of facilities. Curbing the growth of employer
health costs has become the overriding, if not sole, objective in
managed care, and reports of problems with the quality of care are
widespread. 

      A sharp debate over efforts by state medical associations to
enact anti-managed care statutes is under way throughout the
country. There is a clear need for a coordinated effort to develop
consumer-oriented quality standards for managed care.

     Health programs, especially Medicare and Medicaid, are coming
under sharp attack in the new Congress. Recent statements by
Republican leaders target these programs for some $300 billion in
cuts over the next five years, amounts that would decimate health
coverage for the poor and the elderly.

     Labor's position on this question is the same as it was during
the health care reform debate of 1994: Medicare and Medicaid should
come under the same strong cost containment regimen as private
health coverage and any savings from these programs should be
reserved for extending coverage to those now without coverage. 

     A vigorous defense of Medicare also is necessary to protect
existing health plans from additional cost-shifting, which already
adds 20 percent to 40 percent onto health costs of existing
coverage.

     Medicare cuts also must be resisted as part of the overall
defense of Social Security. Republican proposals to means-test
Medicare are the forerunner of a large-scale attempt to undermine
the social insurance structure of Social Security. Scaling back
health care for retirees is a direct attack on the retirement
income security of average-wage Americans and a back-door assault
on the entire Social Security system.

     The best defense against these attacks lies in a spirited
renewal of last year's effort to win comprehensive health care
reform. The administration should press the case for reform and
challenge the new Congress to act in this session to preserve the
health coverage of working American families. No-loophole cost
containment, quality assurance and coverage for all Americans is
still within reach for our society, but the difficulty of the task
grows with each year we fail to muster the political will to act.

     While prospects look bleak for genuine reform because of the
opposition of the new congressional leadership, an opportunity
should be sought to press for expanding coverage for children,
pregnant women and the unemployed. Such improvements advance us
toward comprehensive reform. We will continue to support steps
which move the country toward labor's long-time goal of universal
coverage to quality, affordable care based on social insurance
principles.

     On the other hand, we oppose incremental steps, such as
insurance market reform, that would put further strain on existing
coverage. We also oppose those plans that offer nothing but the
illusion of reform, such as medical savings accounts. And we will
continue to oppose taxation of health benefits, which is an attack
on the real wages and living standards of working American
families.</pre>

                    <a name="FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS">FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS</a>

     Federal food assistance programs, such as food stamps, school
lunch and WIC (Women, Infants and Children), are facing a crisis. 
Despite their solid achievement of ending mass hunger and
malnutrition in the United States, efforts are under way to cripple
these programs.  
     Members of the House of Representatives, in particular, are
seeking to severely cut the food assistance programs, bring them
together with welfare in block grants to the states and strip food
stamps and other programs of their current entitlement status.

     A few of the results would be:

     _ A sharp increase in hunger and malnutrition among Americans.

     _ State authority to change programs as they see fit, so that
anti-hunger efforts vary from state to state.

     _ The shredding of the food safety net during recessions and
times of increased unemployment, since eligible recipients would be
aided only to the extent that Congress provides appropriations.

     The food stamp program, the largest of the food assistance
efforts, provided an average benefit of $69 per person per month or
76 cents per person per meal in 1994.  Some 97 percent of the
benefits went to households with incomes at or below the poverty
line and some 56 percent to households with incomes of only one-
half of the poverty line.

     Food stamps prevent hunger among family members of hard-
working Americans whose wages are so low that they are unable to
provide adequate nutrition.  According to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's 1993 survey, some 7,750,000 recipients were in
households that had income from wages, salaries or self-employment.

     Food stamps provide a temporary, but needed safety net.  One-
half of food stamp households leave the program within six months
and two-thirds leave within a year.

     Some 89 percent of food stamp benefits went to households with
children, or elderly or disabled family members.  In fact, children
were 52 percent of all recipients.

     The WIC program has helped improve the health of poverty-
stricken mothers and children.  For example, each dollar spent on
WIC's prenatal care saves as much as $4 in Medicaid costs.

     The current food assistance programs have proved their worth
in protecting the most vulnerable Americans against hunger and
starvation.

     The part of the GOP &quot;Contract with America&quot; that includes
welfare reform is euphemistically called the &quot;Personal
Responsibility Act of 1995.&quot;

     The proposal, introduced in the House as H.R. 4, would
basically change welfare programs from entitlements for individuals
who suffered deprivation and had minor-age children, or who were
disabled or elderly, to a block grant program to states that would
administer their own welfare programs.  In addition, funds would be
cut by $38 billion and no special allowance would be provided for
a new recession or regional disaster.

     The program would cut eligibility for various groups of
recipients, without providing any real alternative.  There is no
consideration of policies to achieve full employment; there are no
new job training funds; there are no safeguards that subsidized
temporary work assignments would not replace already existing jobs. 
There are no provisions for wage protection or equal pay and
benefits.

     The plan would severely cut Supplemental Security Income
(SSI).  The proposal prohibits alcohol and drug abusers from
receiving SSI and restricts participation of low-income disabled
recipients. 

     It would combine numerous programs that provide assistance to
children who have been abused and neglected -- or who are at risk
of being removed from their homes because of abuse -- and turn the
money over to the states in a lump sum.  Spending would grow over
the next five years, but the federal government would no longer be
required to support all low-income children in foster care or who
are being adopted.  States would no longer have to contribute in
this area.

     Unwed mothers under age 18 would be barred from receiving cash
assistance, as would
legal immigrants, with some exceptions for refugees and the very
elderly.  Further, any citizen who has received assistance in the
last 5 years would be ineligible.

     The AFL-CIO is deeply concerned that one method proposed to
finance a large portion of welfare reform will be the denial of
benefits to immigrants legally in the United States.  It is
unacceptable to finance a public policy aimed at reducing poverty
in the United States by creating and exacerbating poverty in U.S.
ethnic communities.

     Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) is the major
safety net program designed to alleviate child poverty.  It is
generally recognized that children are far better off if their
parents are working at decent jobs rather than receiving welfare
benefits.  However, the commitment to assist families in becoming
self-sufficient and moving off welfare should be coupled with a
commitment to avoid causing more suffering for poor children by
weakening or limiting AFDC.</pre>

<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

                          Trade Deficit

                        February 20, 1995
                        Bal Harbour, Fla.


     The 1994 manufactured goods trade deficit of $156 billion, an
all-time record, is dramatic proof that America's trade policies
are not working. Moreover, the 1994 merchandise trade deficit was
the second largest ever recorded.

     In the last ten years, the total of U.S. trade deficits has
exceeded $1 trillion. This persistent pattern has contributed
significantly to declining real wages and to increasing job
insecurity.

     Administration and congressional leaders of both parties show
eagerness to address the federal budget deficit. Yet the trade
deficit goes largely ignored except for efforts to increase exports
-- despite the certain knowledge that we cannot &quot;export&quot; our way
out of this huge deficit.

     Most of its victims are middle-income working people. It is
estimated that the manufactured goods trade deficit represents a
loss of some three million American jobs.

     U.S. trade policy has relied on unfettered trade and capital
mobility. In practice, that is little more than a rationale for
promoting the interests of multinational corporations.

     Meanwhile, most other countries manage trade and investment to
their own advantage, regardless of market dictates. The United
States is virtually the only country in the world that willingly
exposes its industrial base to unlimited erosion by imports.

     Some have argued that a strategy based on increasing American
exports would be enough to reduce the trade deficit. Indeed, the
defenders of NAFTA, GATT/WTO, most favored nation trading status
for China, and other so-called successes in trade policy have
relied on statistics on export growth to justify their position.

     The new trade deficit figures, which demonstrate that imports
have been growing faster than exports, show that this argument has
no relationship to the facts. 

     A vigorous American trade policy that defends the interests of
the great majority of people within our borders is long overdue.

     One element of such a policy should be extending international
trade rules to provide stronger protections for workers' rights.
The rules should be at least as strong as the rules that protect
property rights. They should ensure that working people of
developing and developed countries are not forced into a cutthroat
competition to the detriment of all.

     A good starting point for this framework would be effective
linkage of U.S. trade to International Labor Organization standards
on forced labor, employment discrimination, child labor, and the
right to organize and bargain collectively.

     In addition to workers' rights, a larger reorientation of
trade policy should include real trade reciprocity and trade
deficit reduction. Otherwise, the United States will experience
even more destructive trade deficits and greater loss of good jobs.                             </pre>

              Bribery in International Transactions

                        February 20, 1995
                        Bal Harbour, Fla.


     In many countries, commerce is routinely distorted and
compromised by widespread corruption. Bribes are often the price of
admission to business contracts or licenses.

     U.S. companies and their subsidiaries are properly subject to
the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it a crime to
bribe foreign government officials. Unfortunately, America's major
trading competitors not only fail to prohibit foreign bribery; some
even subsidize it by permitting their companies to treat bribes as
tax deductions.

     Because such corruption undermines economic progress and often
jeopardizes democratic institutions, the United States should act
with other major trading states in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) to combat bribery.

     The AFL-CIO urges the Clinton Administration to continue its
efforts to persuade other OECD nations to take effective steps
against bribery in international economic transactions. The AFL-CIO
joins with the Trade Union Advisory Committee to promote
implementation of the OECD Council's Recommendation on Bribery in
International Business Transactions, passed last May. Moreover, we
will encourage unions in other nations to press governments to act
effectively against corruption.</pre>

                        The Peso Crisis

                       February 20, 1995
                       Bal Harbour, Fla.


     The dramatic decline of the Mexican peso, which lost
approximately 50 percent of its value relative to the dollar during
the first year of NAFTA, illuminates the failure of an
international economic policy that relies solely on narrowly
defined free trade agreements and protections for international
investors.  It is an unwelcome vindication of those who counseled
patience and caution during the debate over NAFTA.

       To address its financial problems, Mexico will drastically
cut imports and boost exports. At the same time, the weaker peso
will make it cheaper for multinational corporations to produce for
export from Mexico, so their operations there will grow.
     
     What this means for U.S. workers is that they will lose more
jobs and the downward pressure on their wages will grow even
stronger. What it means for Mexican workers is a decline in their
standard of living, since the Mexican government will cap wage
increases at 7 percent while inflation is expected to exceed 20
percent.

     However, not everyone will suffer. International investors in
Mexican government bonds will enjoy the protection of an
international bailout package of $53 billion -- which includes a
$20 billion commitment from American taxpayers.

     These events demonstrate once again that economic integration
must be managed in a careful and prudent manner.  The interests of
workers should be a central concern.  Any future negotiations on
international trade and investment should be far  deeper and wider
than in the past. They should address capital markets and, most
important, internationally recognized labor rights and workplace
standards.</pre>

<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

                           Davis-Bacon

                        February 20, 1995
                        Bal Harbour, Fla.


     The Davis-Bacon Act remains an essential foundation of a
decent standard of living for those working in the construction
industry. The repeal of this legislation would have disastrous
consequences for construction workers, their industry, their
communities, and the federal government.

     Repeal would destabilize and disrupt the industry. This is the
experience in the states that repealed their prevailing wage laws,
known as &quot;little Davis-Bacon laws.&quot; These states have seen
increases in the number of cost overruns and expensive change
orders to rectify mistakes and shoddy workmanship.

     The opponents of Davis-Bacon claim that the government would
save money if the law were repealed. In fact, such a move would be
penny-wise and pound-foolish. Davis-Bacon repeal would not
necessarily lower the cost of federally funded construction. It
would, however, increase the budget deficit, since lower wages for
construction workers would result in an estimated decline of $1
billion in federal tax revenues.

     It is the construction workers themselves who would bear the
heaviest burden if Davis-Bacon were repealed. It is projected that
all construction workers, union and non-union, would lose an
average of $1,477 annually, or 5 percent of their yearly income,
and that loss would be felt in their communities.  Minority and
women construction workers in particular would be hurt by the
lowering of wages and the shrinking of training opportunities. 
Indeed, studies show that Davis-Bacon construction projects employ
a higher percentage of minorities than other projects, and states
that have repealed their little Davis-Bacon Acts have seen minority
participation in apprenticeship programs decline by more than one-
third.

     Part of the burden on workers would be non-economic. Davis-
Bacon repeal would put intense pressure on employers to cut corners
in safety and health protections. This would lead to an estimated
76,000 additional workplace injuries per year, representing more
than 675,000 lost work days.

     It is vital that the Davis-Bacon framework remain intact. The
AFL-CIO calls upon Congress to reject the effort to repeal it.</pre>

                    The Service Contract Act

                        February 20, 1995
                        Bal Harbour, Fla.


     Repeal of the Service Contract Act, an idea now being promoted
by some members of Congress, would reduce living standards for
hundreds of thousands of American workers while bringing little in
the way of savings to the federal government.  It should be
rejected.

     The Service Contract Act helps ensure the federal government
a stable contract work force by requiring that prevailing wages and
benefits be paid to the workers it covers.  Before its enactment 30
years ago, federal service contractors were winning bids by
lowering wages and reducing benefits.  Large numbers of workers on
government-contracted jobs -- janitors, housekeeping aides,
security guards and food service workers -- were earning minimum
wage and no benefits, resulting in massive employee turnover and
poor service to the government.  Meanwhile, federal radar and space
centers were losing the expertise of high-skilled technicians who
were continuously rotated in and out of contracted jobs.

     If the Service Contract Act is repealed, the government's
lowest-cost procurement mandate would again result in the awarding
of contracts to employers who pay less than a living wage.  Many of
the 600,000 workers now covered by the act would be unable to
support their families and would become an economic burden on their
communities.

     According to the Federal Procurement Data System, the total
value of all contracts covered by the Service Contract Act is
minimal in the context of the overall federal budget.  Repealing
the act would produce no significant savings.

     Clearly, the Service Contract Act is in the best interest of
the U.S. government, its contracted employees and the communities
where they live.  The AFL-CIO urges Congress not to repeal this
commitment against using taxpayer dollars to exploit workers and
depress their living standards.</pre>

         Thirtieth Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act

                        February 21, 1995
                        Bal Harbour, Fla.


     This year marks the 30th anniversary of one of the country's
most successful civil rights laws, the Voting Rights Act.  This
landmark legislation, and the success of subsequent efforts to
strengthen it, have played a critical role in curtailing the
discriminatory practices that once prevented millions of Americans
from exercising their right to vote because of their color or
ethnic background.

     But this commemoration should also serve as a reminder that
the struggle for voting rights continues and that the full
participation of all citizens in the country's political process
remains an unfulfilled goal.  The Voting Rights Act must continue
to be vigorously enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice, and
Congress must continue to extend and improve the Act.

     We urge strong enforcement of the new federal &quot;Motor-voter&quot;
law, which will make it easier for Americans to register to vote,
and rejection of the ludicrous assertion that participation in
democracy imposes an unfair financial burden on state governments.

     Finally, we urge our affiliated unions, state federations and
local central bodies to take part in next month's re-enactment of
the historic 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery March in Alabama, an event
which was lead by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and which launched
the campaign to pass the Voting Rights Act.</pre>

   Struggles at Staley, Caterpillar and Bridgestone/Firestone

                        February 21, 1995
                        Bal Harbour, Fla.


     Thousands of courageous trade unionists from three AFL-CIO
affiliates -- the United Paperworkers International Union, the
United Auto Workers and the United Rubber Workers -- are engaged in
long and bitter struggles with four manufacturing companies at
plants located in several states.  We continue to stand with them
and pledge to sustain the support of the entire labor movement
toward helping them go back to their jobs -- with their heads held
high -- under fair and decent contracts.

     Some 760 UPIU members have been locked out of the A.E. Staley
Manufacturing Co. for nearly two years, while about 14,000 UAW
members have been on strike against Caterpillar, Inc. since last
June and about 5,000 URW members are on strike nationwide at
Bridgestone/Firestone and Pirelli Armstrong.

     The conflicts have become the longest in each company's
history because, in each case, management has refused to engage in
good-faith efforts to settle them.  On a wide range of issues, the
employers have held to a hard line and demanded that union members
capitulate -- all in the name of &quot;global competitiveness.&quot;  Each
company has brought in scabs to continue production.

     The situation is especially critical for the local trade union
movement in Decatur, Illinois, where all three unions have large
locals.  Nearly 4,000 trade unionists -- seven percent of the
community's work force -- are off the job at local Staley,
Caterpillar and Bridgestone/Firestone plants.  We salute the AFL-
CIO Central Labor Councils in Decatur and nearby Peoria for their
active involvement in supporting the strikers with donations of
food, fundraising and media outreach.  We urge these councils, and
others across the country, to continue their good work on behalf of
the workers. 

     The AFL-CIO will continue to offer the services of our
Strategic Approaches Committee and other resources of the
federation to bring the support of the entire labor movement behind
the efforts of these three unions to settle their disputes.  The
federation and the Industrial Union Department will continue to
work, both at home and abroad, to bring pressure on these
multinational employers, wherever they do business, to negotiate in
good faith and settle these disputes.

     Our brothers and sisters at Staley, Caterpillar,
Bridgestone/Firestone and Pirelli Armstrong are on the front lines
of a broad attack on working people that has far-reaching
implications for union members throughout the country.  United in
solidarity, labor can win these struggles and build a better future
for all working people.  We call on all affiliates, state
federations and local central bodies to be active in these critical
struggles -- and to give desperately-needed material and financial
support to the strikers -- until these dedicated trade unionists
achieve justice and fair contracts from their employers.</pre>

     The AFL-CIO opposes S.295 and H.R.473, the misnamed Teamwork
for Employees and Management Act.  This legislation would negate
the National Labor Relations Act's prohibition of company unions
and again enable employers to create and dominate employee
organizations.

     The TEAM Act has nothing to do with teamwork.  Nothing in
the NLRA restricts the use of work teams or any other legitimate
form of employee involvement. Decisions of the National Labor
Relations Board make this clear.

     What the NLRA prohibits -- and what the so-called TEAM Act
would allow -- are illegitimate forms of employee involvement. 
The NLRA says that when employees deal with their employer with
respect to their wages or other terms of employment, the
employees have the right to independent representatives -- that
is, representatives who are accountable to the employees, and
only to them. 

     The Republicans' TEAM Act would take from working men and
women this right. Under this bill, non-union employers would be
free to create phony employee organizations and fake employee
committees and hand pick the &quot;leaders&quot; of these organizations. 
Employers would then be free to deal with these management-
anointed &quot;representatives&quot; as if they were the real voice of the
employees. 

     Indeed, even in workplaces in which the employees have
democratically elected a union to be their exclusive
representative, the so-called TEAM Act would allow employers to
create, fund, and deal with a rival, company-controlled entity. 
The bill thus provides management with a ready means of
undermining the union and destabilizing bargaining relationships.

     What this bill ultimately is about, then, is not teamwork
but control.  Management seeks what it has always sought:  the
freedom to &quot;involve&quot; employees in ways that do not threaten
management prerogatives.  The ultimate goal is what it always has
been: to stifle legitimate worker voice and to stave off genuine
worker organization.

     The AFL-CIO has a long and proud history of fighting here
and abroad for free trade unions -- unions controlled by their
members and no one else.  We have resisted government-controlled
unions in all their forms.  We fought to prevent political
parties from gaining control of unions.  And we will not allow
employer-controlled unions to be reborn in the United States.

     The AFL-CIO will work to prevent the adoption of the so-
called TEAM Act.  The economic crisis confronting the American
middle class will be solved by giving workers more of a voice in
the workplace, not by taking away their democratic rights.  We
call upon all who care about workplace democracy, and all who are
concerned about protecting the living standards of working
families, to join us in this struggle.</pre>

<title>Social Security</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

                         Social Security

                        February 22, 1995
                        Bal Harbour, Fla.


     Social Security is the foundation of retirement income for
working Americans.  It is also the primary source of health care
for the elderly and the principal insurance against family
impoverishment due to death or disability.  The AFL-CIO pledges
to continue defending Social Security's critical role in
providing economic security to working American families. 

     The recent erosion of private pension coverage has greatly
increased the reliance on Social Security for retirement income. 
Fifteen years ago, 45 percent of retirement income for average
wage earners came from Social Security.  Today that figure is 57
percent.

     Social Security is one of the most efficient of all major
insurance programs, public or private.  It has administrative
costs of less than one percent of benefits paid.  With the single
exception of Medicare, the system's trust funds will be solvent
until the retirement of the baby boom generation, some 20 to 30
years from now, when a large influx of beneficiaries will draw
down existing surpluses.  That problem can be solved the same way
it has been solved in years past -- through modest adjustments in
the premium and benefit structure.  It is important that the
Social Security Advisory Council, which includes representatives
of both business and labor, move forward in making
recommendations on these adjustments so that Social Security's 
sound financing can be assured.

     The only real problem for Social Security is caused by the
high health care costs that will soon drive the Medicare system
into insolvency.  But Medicare's cost problems are no different
from those faced by all health coverage plans.  The best solution
would be for Congress to enact a comprehensive health care reform
plan that includes genuine cost containment.  Unless and until
that happens, any efforts to reduce Medicare costs would hurt the
millions of older Americans who depend on that program to meet
their health care needs.

     Despite the success of Social Security in reducing poverty
among older Americans and working families, the system's trust
funds continue to provide a tempting target for members of
Congress who are trying to meet unrelated budget needs.  In order
to protect the system from those who would raid it for this
purpose, we urge the complete separation of the Social Security
trust funds from the unified federal budget.
     While applauding last year's creation of the independent
Social Security Agency, we urge the Clinton Administration and
Congress to recognize that personnel cuts at the agency are
putting enormous strain on the system.  We call on them to
maintain staff levels that are sufficient to provide quality
service.

     We oppose reducing benefits or extending the retirement
age -- steps that would harm all but the richest families. 
Further, we oppose any attempts to privatize the system or to
means-test benefits.  Such measures would violate the social
insurance principles that are the foundation of the system and
would likely result in its unraveling.

     We believe the American people, given the facts about the
strengths and advantages of Social Security, would strongly
support the system and join in defending it from those who would
weaken or dismantle it.  We call on the Clinton Administration
and members of Congress to vigorously defend the system from
ideological attacks and promote better public understanding of
Social Security -- particularly among young workers.  We pledge
our commitment to these aims, and will work with our affiliated
unions, employers and government officials to help assure the
long-term viability of the Social Security system.</pre>

<title>Red Cross</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

                     The American Red Cross

                        February 23, 1995
                        Bal Harbour, Fla.


     For many years, the American trade union movement has had a
close relationship with the American Red Cross. Working women and
men have donated money and blood, volunteered for American Red
Cross activities across the country, and played a major role in
disaster relief. The AFL-CIO has strongly supported the right of
employees of the American Red Cross and other charitable agencies
to union representation.

     During the massive reorganization and centralization of the
Red Cross's Blood Service in the last two years, that right has
been respected in many parts of the country. But in other areas, it
has been jeopardized.

     One area where problems have arisen is Cleveland. The local
Red Cross seeks to transfer job responsibilities that now belong to
members of its bargaining unit -- District 1199-OH of the Service
Employees International Union -- to personnel who have no union
representation. If that transfer were to take place, it would pose
a direct threat to employees represented by SEIU. 

     District 1199-OH has tried to resolve this dispute. It has
sought and received assistance from the Cleveland Federation of
Labor, the Ohio AFL-CIO, and the AFL-CIO Community Services
Department. Federal mediation is already underway. The next
meetings between union and management are scheduled for March.

     The American Red Cross should make certain that the Blood
Service reorganization does not jeopardize the work duties of its
unionized employees in Cleveland or any other area. Indeed, if the
Cleveland dispute is not equitably resolved, it could set a bad
precedent nationally for the erosion of workers' rights in an
organization whose success depends in large part on the help and
participation of working people. 

     In the past, the AFL-CIO has intervened on behalf of employees
of the Red Cross and other charitable agencies. In this case, the
Federation continues to give its full support to the SEIU members
and all other trade unionists affected by reorganization of the
Blood Service.

     The AFL-CIO will use its good offices as part of its ongoing
effort to reach a settlement in the Cleveland dispute -- a
settlement ensuring that employee rights are respected and their
job responsibilities are secure. In addition, the AFL-CIO will
consult with its affiliated unions that have members affected by
the Blood Service reorganization and will request another meeting
with the American Red Cross management.</pre>

<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

            Support for Major League Baseball Players

                        February 23, 1995
                        Bal Harbour, Fla.


     Members of the Major League Baseball Players Association are
on strike against their employers -- the owners of the 28 major
league teams in the United States and Canada.  Though their union
is not affiliated with the AFL-CIO, their determination to stand
together and achieve a fair settlement -- in the face of intense
employer opposition -- has earned the respect and support of union
members and working people everywhere.  We salute them and support
them in their struggle. 

     Like many trade unionists who are forced to strike, the
baseball players are standing together to preserve the hard-fought
gains of their forbears.  They are battling employer attempts to
assert arbitrary power.  They are seeking reasonable compromise
through the collective bargaining process.  And, like all too many
AFL-CIO trade unionists, their employers have brought in scabs to
continue operations.

     The AFL-CIO urges the team owners to negotiate in good faith
toward a prompt settlement of the strike.  We commend the players
for their extraordinary solidarity, and we salute the courage and
integrity of Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson and Baltimore
Orioles owner Peter Angelos for their refusal to participate in the
scabbing of America's pastime.</pre>

<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

                   Support For Federal Workers

                        February 23, 1995
                        Bal Harbour, Fla.


     The AFL-CIO joins federal workers and their unions in
resisting proposals that would mindlessly slash the federal work
force and reduce the ability of federal employees to administer
government effectively and efficiently.

     Thus far in his administration, President Clinton has already
greatly reduced the size of the federal work force, generating some
$64 billion in savings to taxpayers and many innovative ways to
improve service to the public.

     Now, the new leadership in Congress wants to use the
appropriations process to make much deeper reductions in the
federal work force. If they succeed, federal agencies will have
even greater difficulty meeting the basic needs of citizens and, as
a result, the public's disillusionment with government would grow.

     We urge the Clinton Administration not to engage in a bidding
war with the Republicans in Congress over the number of jobs to cut
from the federal payroll.  To do so would imitate the worst
elements of the &quot;downsizing&quot; craze that has swept many U.S.
industries.  Setting arbitrary ceilings on federal employment would
ignore the productivity and efficiency issues that are so critical
to maintaining the services that working Americans expect their
government to provide.

     Instead, any further efforts to streamline government should
be carried out in full consultation with federal employees and
their unions and through a rational process that evaluates the
effectiveness and continued viability of federal programs.

     We believe the American people want not smaller but better and
more efficient government.  There will be no real progress toward
that aim without the full participation of federal employee unions
in the decision-making process.  We urge Congress and the
Administration to allow the current partnership between the federal
government and its employees to continue to improve government in
a way that preserves the integrity and viability of the federal
work force.</pre>

<title>Immigration</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

               Immigration and the American Dream

                        February 23, 1995
                        Bal Harbour, Fla.


     The shining American dream still draws immigrants to the
United States, but many citizens are wondering whether that dream
is still alive for themselves and their children.  Unfortunately,
their legitimate concerns about the future are being exploited by
politicians and hate-mongers who are determined to make immigrants
the scapegoats for a wide variety of economic and social problems.

     The facts are these:  immigrants are not the cause of
America's declining wages and the export of good jobs overseas. 
Immigrants are not responsible for the &quot;downsizing&quot; that is
sweeping through many U.S. industries and throwing millions of
Americans out of work.  And immigrants cannot be blamed for the
fraying of the country's social fabric that so many Americans
perceive with uneasiness and alarm.

     Throughout its history, the United States has been enriched by
the contributions of new citizens.  Our country should continue to
welcome legal immigrants and provide a haven to refugees fleeing
terror and oppression in their native lands.

     At the same time, U.S. citizens have the right to set
reasonable, orderly methods by which immigrants are received and
refugees given sanctuary.  American workers, in particular, have
the right to expect that their government's laws governing entry
and legal residence be respected by others -- an expectation that
the overwhelming majority of immigrants honor and accept.  But such
laws and policies should be developed and enforced in the context
of accurate information and democratic principles, not in a climate
of phony statistics, bitter myths and political hypocrisy that has
fueled anti-immigration initiatives such as California's
Proposition 187 and the national effort to deny government benefits
to legal immigrants.

     Government and academic studies have shown repeatedly that
immigrants, with and without documents, enter the United States
because they want to work -- not to collect welfare benefits and
rip-off the U.S. health care system.  To deny public assistance to
law-abiding, legal immigrants who may find themselves in temporary
difficulty is undemocratic, unfair and contemptible.  To deny
illegal immigrants what few services they may obtain -- like
emergency medical care -- or to throw schoolchildren onto the
streets and deny them immunization against communicable diseases,
is heartless and dangerous.

     We recognize that illegal immigration is a genuine problem,
particularly for the states along our borders and shorelines. 
Rather than commit to foolish policies at the behest of political
opportunists and anti-immigrant firebrands, we urge the federal
government to address the problem with fairness and compassion and
in the spirit of our nation's heritage as a land of peace, freedom
and opportunity for all.

     The federal government has a responsibility to help affected
states by deterring unauthorized entries and helping state and
local governments cope with the impact and costs of growing
immigrant populations.  Vigorous wage-hour and safety law
enforcement in all workplaces will take away from rogue employers
the unfair advantages they gain from hiring and intimidating
undocumented workers.  Such enforcement must be accompanied by
protections to stop employers from discriminating against citizens
and documented workers in their hiring practices or from harassing
workers because of their skin color, names or accents.

     These policies would go a long way toward addressing the
difficult issues stemming from legal and illegal immigration.  The
program of quick fixes and harsh rhetoric offered by the anti-
immigration demagogues is not only harmful to the debate, but would
take the country in the wrong direction.  We strongly oppose their
efforts and pledge to work for immigration policies that reflect
the American tradition of justice, dignity and equality.</pre>

<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

                  Borg-Warner Security Services

                        February 23, 1995
                        Bal Harbour, Fla.


     Since ancient times, the Olympic Games have represented the
highest ideals of fair play and honorable competition. Thus, it is
ironic and unfortunate that the Atlanta Committee on the Olympic
Games (ACOG) -- the agency managing the 1996 Summer Olympics -- has
contracted with the Borg-Warner Security Corporation to provide
security at the Olympics.

     Borg-Warner is a business empire including companies whose
shameful employment policies make a mockery of the Olympics'
values. The employees of its subsidiary, Pony Express Courier
Corporation, have voted in three dozen locations to be represented
by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), yet Pony
Express adamantly refuses to bargain with the Teamsters to reach a
settlement. Indeed, the company's tactics are shown in the more
than 100 charges of unfair labor practices pending against it
before the National Labor Relations Board. 

     This behavior is part of a larger pattern that appears in some
other areas of the Borg-Warner group. For example, in congressional
hearings, Pony Express's abuse of the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit has
been documented. And the American Civil Liberties Union brought
suit to challenge Borg-Warner's pre-employment testing of its
personnel for their political views.

     Such a record should not be allowed to compromise the good
name of the Olympics. The AFL-CIO calls on ACOG to insist that
Borg-Warner Security Corporation ensure the right of its own and
its subsidiaries' employees to representation in the workplace. If
Borg-Warner does not respond to that appeal, ACOG should sever its
relationship with that company and reopen bidding for the contract
to provide security at the 1996 Summer Olympics.</pre>

<p align="center"><font size="3">AFL-CIO sues on behalf of
120,000 unemployed workers<br>
Oakland A's ticket clerk at center of case that could affect many
states</font></p>
<p align="left">San Francisco, Jan. 15, 1997 -- The AFL-CIO today
filed a<br>
class action suit against a California state agency on behalf of
at<br>
least 120,000 unemployed workers for whom $230 million in<br>
unemployment insurance benefits are delayed or denied.<br>
<br>
The suit charges that California law violates federal law<br>
requiring unemployment insurance to be paid as soon as possible
and<br>
has forced thousands of workers onto welfare.<br>
<br>
Besides the AFL-CIO, the plaintiff in the suit is Khadijah<br>
Jacob, an Oakland A's ticket clerk who, after being laid off, was<br>
deprived of unemployment insurance even though she had earned<br>
enough to qualify for benefits.<br>
<br>
Under California law, benefits can be delayed for as long as<br>
seven months after a worker is laid off due to an anachronistic<br>
provision of the insurance code that keeps the state from<br>
considering a worker's most recent earnings in calculating<br>
benefits. The provision stems from an era when technology did not<br>
permit prompt processing of claims.<br>
<br>
Currently, benefits are based on earnings within a one-year<br>
base period that ends anywhere from four to seven months before
the<br>
date a worker files a claim. For example, if a worker becomes<br>
unemployed and files a claim this month, the claim would be based<br>
only on wages earned from July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1996.<br>
Thousands of workers -- particularly low-wage workers, seasonal<br>
workers and women -- need these earnings counted to qualify for<br>
benefits. Yet, they must wait to receive benefits until
California<br>
counts recent wages, which can mean a seven-month delay.<br>
<br>
Benefits are not retroactive and the applicant would have to<br>
still be unemployed to receive benefits. If not, benefits are
lost.<br>
<br>
That is basically what happened to Jacob. <br>
<br>
Under the law, her entire earnings with the A's were excluded.<br>
She was forced onto welfare while looking for a new job.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not want to receive welfare,&quot; said Jacob. <br>
<br>
A 1996 report by the state's unemployment insurance agency,<br>
the California Employment Development Department, showed that<br>
121,824 California workers are either denied unemployment
insurance<br>
or have benefits delayed due to the law. The cost to workers in<br>
lost benefits was estimated at $92.7 million and $140 million in<br>
benefits were delayed.<br>
<br>
The state could eliminate the delays by using a one-year base<br>
period that includes recent wages for workers.<br>
<br>
The agency's own report estimated that denying and delaying<br>
benefits costs taxpayers $40.9 million in unnecessary welfare<br>
payments because 28,800 of the workers are forced onto welfare.<br>
Welfare benefits are paid by taxpayers; unemployment insurance is<br>
funded by businesses. <br>
<br>
&quot;In the absence of good jobs and when much of the country's<br>
social safety net is under attack, unemployment insurance is the<br>
minimum workers deserve,&quot; AFL-CIO Executive Vice President
Linda<br>
Chavez-Thompson said. &quot;Unemployment insurance is intended to
go to<br>
workers quickly to allow them to seek other employment, to offer
a<br>
bridge between jobs without having to rely on welfare and to<br>
protect community businesses from losing consumers. Delays shift<br>
the cost from business to taxpayers.&quot;<br>
<br>
At least 10 states' unemployment insurance laws count a<br>
worker's recent earnings, minimizing delays. The AFL-CIO suit
could<br>
be seen as a bellwether for other states that have a system
similar<br>
to California's.</p>

<p align="center">Statement by John Sweeney<br>
President, AFL-CIO<br>
on the General Strike in South Korea</p>
<p align="left">December 27, 1996<br>
<br>
Today, the AFL-CIO stands in solidarity with Korean workers as<br>
they bravely confront the assault on their basic,
internationally-<br>
recognized worker rights.<br>
<br>
On December 26, the ruling New Korea Party using completely<br>
undemocratic methods reminiscent of Korea's former military<br>
government, adopted a new labor law which turns back the clock on<br>
democratic reform and fundamentally undermines workers' rights.
In<br>
seeking to justify its outrageous actions, Korea's political<br>
leaders assert that the changes were needed to bring the
country's<br>
labor laws in line with global labor practices, including those
in<br>
OECD countries. This is a cynical and transparent attempt by the<br>
Korean government to deceive the world about its &quot;solemn<br>
commitment&quot; to reform its labor code.<br>
<br>
By taking this action Korea has openly demonstrated its<br>
contempt of OECD member countries which accepted in good faith<br>
Korea's commitment to bring its labor laws into conformity with
the<br>
standards of the International Labor Organization, including<br>
freedom of association and collective bargaining. Furthermore,
the<br>
undemocratic methods used by the government and ruling party to<br>
achieve their objectives are an affront to the democratic<br>
sensibilities of all workers.<br>
<br>
We strongly urge the Korean president to veto this poorly<br>
considered piece of legislation which neither upholds
international<br>
standards nor honors Korea's workforce. We call on the Korean<br>
government to respect its international responsibilities, along<br>
with its solemn commitment to the OECD, and bring key elements of<br>
its labor law into compliance with ILO standards on freedom of<br>
association through democratic means and with the full<br>
participation of Korea's working men and women.</p>

<p>Statement by AFL-CIO John J. Sweeney on the Nomination of
Alexis Herman to be U.S. Secretary of Labor<br>
<br>
Alexis Herman is a wonderful choice for secretary of labor. <br>
She knows and understands working families' concerns, and we look<br>
forward to working closely with her to put their interests at the<br>
top of the national agenda. At a time when so many working men
and<br>
women are struggling against declining pay and growing disrespect<br>
from corporate America, we believe Alexis' experience -- growing
up<br>
in the rural South, advancing the interests of working women and<br>
minorities, and dealing with the issues of a changing workforce
--<br>
will be a tremendous asset. Few are as skilled at organizing<br>
public support for the causes she champions. Over the years, she<br>
has had an excellent relationship with me and other union
leaders. <br>
In recent weeks, I have met and talked with her a number of
times,<br>
and I know she is committed to putting together a strong team to<br>
fight for good jobs, justice and dignity for America's working<br>
families.</p>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
For Information: Deborah Dion 202-637-5036<br>
December 19, 1997</p>
<p align="center">MORE LABOR VICTORIES ROLL IN<br>
NEARLY 4000 WORKERS WIN HUGE VICTORY AFTER<br>
YEAR-LONG BATTLE WITH YALE UNIVERSITY</p>
<p>Washington, December 19 -- A week after 312 workers, their<br>
supporters and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney were arrested at a<br>
massive demonstration at the campus, employees at Yale University<br>
have reached a tentative agreement with the university. <br>
The agreement between Locals 34 and 35 of the Federation of<br>
University Employees and Yale University offers a six-year pact<br>
which includes extraordinary job security, pension improvements,<br>
part-time workers protection and increased health care benefits. <br>
The victory over the university's corporate-like agenda to<br>
slash pay and benefits by outsourcing jobs comes as the AFL-CIO<br>
begins implementing a $30 million program to organize new workers<br>
and on the heels of several similar victories. <br>
Last week, 2,500 state of Maryland workers won union<br>
representation, joining 7,800 corrective workers who also won<br>
union representation this year. In November, 3,000 workers won<br>
union recognition at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. In October, 170<br>
women workers at Richmark, a Boston-area curtain maker, quickly<br>
won union recognition after public pressure from revitalized<br>
labor movement brought the company to terms.<br>
&quot;The Yale victory sends a strong message to Corporate<br>
America that _America's Working Families Are Back' and that<br>
united, workers can beat back corporate profiteers at rich<br>
institutions, on Wall Street and in corporate board rooms all<br>
across this nation,&quot; said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney.<br>
&quot;By reaching agreements with its employees over job<br>
security, Yale has set a standard for other institutions and<br>
organizations where workers are organizing to improve their<br>
lives,&quot; he added.<br>
For the past year bitter negotiations for new contracts for<br>
Yale's unionized workers had broken down over university demands<br>
for the right to subcontract much of the on campus work,<br>
following the nationwide push by corporate America to replace<br>
full-time jobs with contingent, low-wage, no-benefit labor. <br>
Yale faced action by the National Labor Relations Board for<br>
&quot;interfering with, restraining and coercing Yale employees,<br>
discriminating against employees for union activity, and refusing<br>
to bargain in good faith&quot; with the two campus unions
struggling<br>
to keep their jobs at the university.<br>
&quot;We all have cause to celebrate today, thanks to the courage<br>
and determination of our membership and the heroic efforts of the<br>
clergy, elected officials and community activists throughout the<br>
region,&quot; said Local 34 President Laura Smith. &quot;When you
add up<br>
all the elements, these contracts offer the best job security<br>
provisions in the country.&quot;</p>

<p align="center">STATEMENT BY JOHN J. SWEENEY<br>
PRESIDENT, AFL-CIO<br>
ON THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION'S<br>
NEW COMMITMENT TO CORE LABOR STANDARDS</p>
<p>December 12, 1996<br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO welcomes the decision of the trade ministers in<br>
Singapore that for the first time commits the World Trade<br>
Organization's members to the observance of core labor standards. <br>
<br>
These standards, which are understood to include freedom of<br>
association, the right to organize and bargain collectively, non-<br>
discrimination in the workplace and a prohibition on exploitative<br>
child labor, are essential if the international trading system is<br>
to raise living standards for working people around the globe. <br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO is encouraged by the broadening consensus for<br>
further work on these issues by the WTO. <br>
<br>
We appreciate the outstanding efforts of acting U.S. Trade<br>
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, which were key to progress in<br>
the important area of worker rights. More remains to be done. We<br>
continue to believe that the condition of workers should be an<br>
integral part of trade relationships.<br>
<br>
We, together with trade unions around the world will continue<br>
to challenge governments and employers to live up to these basic<br>
labor standards by all the means at our disposal.</p>

NEWS MEDIA ADVISORY<br>
<br>
Strawberry workers, UFW president, to visit East Coast leaders<br>
<br>
Washington, Oct. 10, 1996 -- United Farm Workers President Arturo<br>
Rodriquez and California strawberry workers will visit key<br>
religious, political and community leaders in six East Coast<br>
cities in November.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the trip is to solidify support for 20,000<br>
strawberry workers, who are seeking basic rights such as clean<br>
drinking water and bathrooms, a living wage and protection from<br>
sexual harassment in the fields.<br>
<br>
The workers_ struggle is one of the largest union organizing<br>
campaigns in the U.S. It is a joint project of the UFW and the<br>
AFL-CIO.<br>
<br>
The trip will begin a week after a broad-based coalition of<br>
dozens of groups that support the strawberry workers meets in<br>
Washington. The workers believe 5 cents is not too much to ask<br>
for fairness -- a California study showed that for 5 cents more<br>
per pint of berries, workers' pay rates would increase by at
least 50<br>
percent. But, so far, the $650 million-a-year strawberry industry<br>
isn_t interested.<br>
<br>
Below is the tentative schedule for the workers.<br>
* Nov. 18: Philadelphia<br>
* Nov. 19: Baltimore<br>
* Nov. 20: Newark<br>
* Nov. 21: New York City<br>
* Nov. 22: Boston<br>
* Nov. 23-24: Washington<br>
<br>
News conferences will be held in each city and there may be<br>
opportunities for individual interviews with the workers and<br>
Rodriguez. More details will be announced as the event<br>
approaches.</p>

<title>PR 10/11/96 REPUBLICANS TRY TO SILENCE THE VOICE OF
WORKING FAMILIES</title>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Denise Mitchell 202-637-5340<br>
Deborah Dion 202-637-5036<br>
<br>
REPUBLICANS TRY TO SILENCE THE VOICE OF WORKING FAMILIES<br>
<br>
In a desperate attempt to silence the voice of working<br>
families and hide from the voting records of Newt Gingrich and<br>
the Republican Congress, the National Republican Congressional<br>
Committee is airing shamefully dishonest commercials around the<br>
country.<br>
<br>
What the Republican ads say: &quot;The big labor bosses in<br>
Washington are spending big money spreading big lies to buy their<br>
control of Congress.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reality Check: Spending by big business overwhelms the AFL-CIO's<br>
campaign. Corporate interests are -- and always have been -- far<br>
outspending labor in all areas of the political arena, including<br>
PAC and individual campaign contributions and so-called
&quot;soft&quot;<br>
money contributions, as well as in voter education. According to<br>
the most recent analysis by the non-partisan Citizen Action,<br>
between January 1, 1995 and May 31, 1996, corporate interests<br>
gave roughly 4 times as much in PAC contributions to House<br>
members as labor PACs. (It's the Money II: An Analysis of 1995-<br>
1996 Campaign Contributions to House Members, Citizen Action,<br>
8/1/96)<br>
<br>
In fact, business has historically outspent labor in PAC giving<br>
to all federal candidates by about three to one. Corporate PAC<br>
giving rose 26% between 1987-1988 and the last cycle -- twice the<br>
rate of increase of Labor PAC giving (13%).<br>
<br>
What the Republican ads say: &quot;Here in Arizona, they're<br>
running ads in favor of Steve Owens.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reality Check: The ads educate the public on both candidates'<br>
positions. The purpose of the AFL-CIO voter guide ads is to<br>
educate workers about congressional candidates' positions on<br>
issues that are central to working families' lives. The ads do<br>
not urge the viewer to either vote for or against either<br>
candidate. Instead, the guides lay out each candidate's position<br>
on the issue in question in a fair and evenhanded manner.<br>
The AFL-CIO's voter guides are covered by a new section of FEC<br>
regulations that specifically allows corporations and unions to<br>
make treasury money expenditures for election-related<br>
communications to the public so long as those communications<br>
don't &quot;expressly advocate&quot; the election or defeat of a
clearly<br>
identified candidate. The new regulations allow a corporation or<br>
labor organization to do a &quot;general voter guide consisting
of two<br>
or more candidates' positions on campaign issues...&quot;provided
that<br>
the voter guide does not &quot;expressly advocate&quot; the
election or<br>
defeat of a candidate and is prepared without &quot;contact&quot;
or<br>
&quot;coordination&quot; with candidates (11 C.F.R. 114.4
(c)(5)(1)).<br>
<br>
What the Republican ads say: &quot;The big labor bosses are tax
&amp;<br>
spend liberals. They fought welfare reform. Stopped term limits.<br>
Blocked a balanced budget.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reality Check: Working families deserve a voice. The AFL-CIO has<br>
been speaking out on issues of importance to working families.<br>
Newt Gingrich and the Republican Congress have launched an<br>
unprecedented attack on basic protections that America's working<br>
families have a right to expect -- including retirement security,<br>
workplace safety and environmental protection. Working families<br>
deserve the opportunity to fight back. The AFL-CIO's campaign has<br>
been successful in passing an increase in the minimum wage and<br>
largely derailing the Republican effort to make enormous budget<br>
cuts in programs such as Medicare, education and health care.</p>

TO BOSTON AREA NEWS MEDIA, NATIONAL LABOR REPORTERS<br>
<br>
John Sweeney to Richmark: We will fight you and those like you<br>
Sweeney, community leaders demand companies accept workers'<br>
choice<br>
<br>
Washington, Oct. 7, 1996 -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney<br>
will join Boston area workers and community leaders Tuesday in a<br>
march on Richmark International, a company where employees report<br>
sub-minimum wages, unaffordable health insurance, no sick pay and<br>
monitoring of bathroom breaks.<br>
When workers at the curtain company tried to improve their<br>
conditions by organizing -- a majority of employees supported the<br>
Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees --<br>
several were fired. A sympathy walk-out erupted Sept. 23. A<br>
strike continues.<br>
&quot;Unfortunately this is not new,&quot; said Sweeney.
&quot;What is new<br>
is that the AFL-CIO and workers aren't accepting it anymore. When<br>
employers ignore their employees' legally-protected right to work<br>
to improve their conditions, we'll be there. We're starting with<br>
Richmark in Everett, Massachusetts.&quot;<br>
Sweeney said it is ironic that corporate America preaches<br>
individual responsibility, but that when employees take<br>
responsibility businesses fire them.<br>
&quot;Richmark workers, like thousands of other workers in the<br>
nation, are trying to improve their lives, their families and<br>
their communities. It is wrong for the big foot of business to<br>
try and crush them. From here on out, organized labor says to<br>
Richmark and companies like them: We will fight you whether it's<br>
in Everett or Birmingham, Akron or Spokane.&quot;<br>
The workers and community leaders in Everett will attempt to<br>
meet with company officials and demand that they respect the<br>
choice of their employees.<br>
<br>
WHEN, WHERE: Everett City Hall, 484 Broadway, 11:30<br>
a.m. Tuesday, Oct. 8, followed by march on Richmark, 329 Second<br>
St., Everett.</p>

<title>PR 09/27/96 -- AFL-CIO Compares Candidates on TV &amp;
Radio with Voter Guides</title>

<br>
AFL-CIO COMPARES CANDIDATES ON WORKING FAMILY ISSUES IN<br>
NEW SERIES OF TV &amp; RADIO VOTER GUIDES<br>
<br>
Washington, Sept. 27 -- As part of a stepped-up effort to raise<br>
issues of importance to working families and provide information
to<br>
voters, the AFL-CIO today launched a new series of TV and radio<br>
voter guides in 24 congressional districts.<br>
&quot;The electronic voter guides are one more step in the AFL-<br>
CIO's continuing effort to raise the issues that are central to
the<br>
lives of working Americans and to shine a light on Congress' and<br>
candidates' records with respect to those issues,&quot; said
AFL-CIO<br>
President John Sweeney.<br>
The non-partisan voter guides highlight issues like education<br>
and retirement security that grew out of the 29 America Needs a<br>
Raise town hall meetings the AFL-CIO held this year, as well as<br>
polling and focus groups of AFL-CIO members and non-union
workers.<br>
&quot;We have been speaking for working families all this year,
not<br>
just for our members but for all working families,&quot; Sweeney
said.<br>
&quot;We plan to continue to lobby officeholders and would-be<br>
officeholders to adopt positions on issues like education, health<br>
care and retirement security that are good for working
people.&quot;<br>
The electronic voter guides were tested under the coordination<br>
of Peter D. Hart Research Associates, an independent research
firm.<br>
Voters who viewed preliminary versions of the spots and completed<br>
questionnaires overwhelmingly concluded that the guides
&quot;provided<br>
information they didn't know,&quot; &quot;dealt with issues that
will be very<br>
important in this year's election,&quot; provide information that
seems<br>
&quot;believable and accurate,&quot; and is &quot;fair in how it
describes the two<br>
candidates and their positions.&quot;<br>
The electronic voter guides urge listeners to call an 800<br>
number to receive a copy of the AFL-CIO's written voter guide<br>
comparing information on these same elected officials' votes as<br>
well as their challengers' position on additional issues
important<br>
to working families.<br>
According to another poll conducted by Geoff Garin of Peter D.<br>
Hart Research Associates, AFL-CIO members support the AFL-CIO's<br>
issues oriented educational campaign by an overwhelming majority,<br>
and by a margin of six to one members say they want their union
to<br>
be involved in speaking out on political issues.<br>
Additionally, 84 percent of AFL-CIO members say they approve<br>
of voter guides that compare positions of candidates, compared to<br>
12 percent who disapprove.<br>
The voter guides are part of the 13.1 million member AFL-CIO's<br>
continuing outreach program to America's working families.</p>

            AFL-CIO &amp; 9to5 LAUNCH NEW EFFORT TO BRING<br>
           VOTING MESSAGE TO LOW-INCOME WOMEN WORKERS<br>
<br>
      HUNDREDS OF GOTV ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR OCTOBER 4-11<br>
<br>
Washington, D.C. -- Low-income working women will play a pivotal<br>
role in this year's elections, and that is the message behind<br>
hundreds of voter registration/GOTV activities planned for the week<br>
of October 4-11 -- the last week in most cities to register to<br>
vote. The unprecedented effort, Working Women Vote, is sponsored by<br>
the new AFL-CIO's Working Women's Department and 9to5, National<br>
Association of Women, a nonpartisan organization.<br>
<br>
     The centerpiece of this campaign is reaching out to women<br>
voters -- in grocery stores or shopping malls, at day care centers,<br>
in union halls and at union worksites, during their lunch hours --<br>
places where women spend most of their time. Voter<br>
registration/GOTV events will be held in about 100 selected<br>
communities with about 10,000 women activists participating<br>
nationwide.<br>
<br>
     According to the political pundits, the women's vote will be<br>
the deciding factor in this year's election. Women are concerned<br>
about &quot;pocketbook issues&quot; like Medicare, pension, education, wages<br>
and family leave -- and the impact of these issues on their lives<br>
and their families.<br>
<br>
     &quot;These women are union members and their best friends. White<br>
collar and blue collar women. No-collar, no-income women who cook,<br>
clean and care for the kids so the husband can work two jobs.<br>
Retired, and just plain tired. They've been left out the political<br>
process,&quot; said AFL-CIO's Working Women's Department head Karen<br>
Nussbaum.<br>
<br>
     &quot;Working women have a lot at stake in this election,&quot; Ellen<br>
Bravo, 9to5's executive director, said. &quot;We have to mobilize our<br>
power, organize to influence the agenda and determine the outcome.&quot;<br>
<br>
     In February, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney established the<br>
first-ever Working Women's Department within the AFL-CIO. Sweeney<br>
appointed Nussbaum, former U.S. Department of Labor Women's Bureau<br>
Chief to direct it. Nussbaum and the Working Women's Department is<br>
charged with injecting the concerns of working women into every<br>
major program at the AFL-CIO and to develop programs that speak to<br>
working women.<br>
<br>
     A list of cities and events will be released next week.</p>

More than 50 cities support strawberry workers as thousands rally<br>
<br>
Sept. 16, 1996 -- In more than 50 cities across the nation<br>
today, a coalition of workers, labor unions, clergy and<br>
community leaders spoke up for 20,000 California strawberry<br>
workers.<br>
Monday's activities come the day after 6,000-7,000 workers<br>
and supporters marched in Watsonville, the heart of California<br>
strawberry country.<br>
The strawberry workers are trying to improve their lives by<br>
organizing with the United Farm Workers. <br>
Supporters from Anchorage to Denver to Miami met with<br>
supermarket managers seeking pledges on behalf of basic rights<br>
for the workers. In Los Angeles, city council members were to<br>
sign a pledge of support and vowed to push for an official<br>
resolution of support. In Miami, supporters took the message to<br>
dozens of supermarkets. <br>
The workers are seeking basic rights: clean drinking water<br>
and bathrooms in the fields, a living wage, health insurance, an<br>
end to sexual harassment, and protection from arbitrary firings<br>
and reward for years of loyalty.<br>
The average pay for the workers is about $8,000 a year. For<br>
only 5 cents per pint, the $650 million-a-year California<br>
strawberry industry could greatly improve conditions for the<br>
workers.<br>
That's what it could cost to increase workers' pay rates by at<br>
least 50 percent and in some cases as much as 100 percent,<br>
according to a California study.<br>
&quot;Is 5 cents for fairness too much to ask? We don't think<br>
so,&quot; AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez Thompson said<br>
of the campaign, which is one of the largest current union drives<br>
in the U.S.<br>
A partial list of cities where supporters were expected to<br>
turn out: Albany, Ga.; Albany, N.Y.; Albuquerque; Anchorage,<br>

<br>
Backers of strawberry workers speak up<br>
Thousands to march, supporters on the move in dozens of cities<br>
Their question: &quot;Is 5 cents for fairness too much to ask?&quot;<br>
<br>
Washington, Sept. 12, 1996 -- Thousands of workers and their<br>
supporters will speak up for struggling California strawberry<br>
pickers Sunday and Monday.<br>
<br>
On Sunday, several thousand workers are expected to march in<br>
Watsonville, Calif., the heart of strawberry country.<br>
<br>
On Monday, hundreds of supporters in hometowns from Alaska to<br>
Alabama will be on the move. They'll visit supermarkets across the<br>
nation and ask store managers to tell the California strawberry<br>
industry they support better conditions for the workers. In<br>
Richmond, they'll deliver fresh drinking water to grocery customers<br>
to draw attention to the conditions of field workers. In Los<br>
Angeles, city council members will back the workers.<br>
<br>
Strawberry pickers, who are trying to organize with the United<br>
Farm Workers, earn an average of $8,000 a year. According to a<br>
California study, doubling their pay rates would cost<br>
the $650-million-a-year industry only 5 cents per pint of berries.<br>
<br>
The pickers work in pesticide-treated fields for as many as 12<br>
hours a day. Workers face on-the-spot firings, sexual harassment<br>
and the lack of clean drinking water and health insurance.<br>
<br>
As part of one of the largest union organizing campaigns in<br>
the country, the workers are struggling for five basic rights:<br>
* A living wage<br>
* Protection from arbitrary firings and rewards for their<br>
years of loyalty<br>
* Clean drinking water and bathrooms in the fields<br>
* Health insurance<br>
* An end to sexual harassment in the fields.<br>
<br>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                            For information:<br>
                                     Denise Mitchell 202/637-5340<br>
<br>
                    Statement by John Sweeney<br>
                        AFL-CIO President<br>
          on President Clinton's Health Care Initiative<br>
<br>
President Clinton's decision to create a national commission on<br>
health care quality is good news for health care consumers. It is<br>
a concrete step that, by protecting consumers in the often<br>
confusing and coercive health care situation of today, should<br>
lessen their anxiety and make their lives a little easier.<br>
<br>
Like the health care legislation signed by the president last<br>
month, this action is a modest but meaningful step that carries<br>
through on a significant part of the president's health care reform<br>
initiative of 1993, consumer protection.<br>
<br>
For average wage workers and their families, like the 40 million<br>
plus whose health benefits are bargained by the unions of the<br>
AFL-CIO, it is a welcome step by their government.</p>

<h2 align=center>AFL-CIO RELEASES NEW TV AND RADIO ADS<br>
AIMED AT 27 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS<br>
WHO VOTED TO SLASH MEDICARE</h2>
<h3 align=center>New commercials take issue with Republican leaders' false<br>
claims on Medicare votes </h3>
<p>CHICAGO, August 28 -- New television and radio commercials produced by the AFL-CIO 
issuing stern warnings to members of Congress who voted to slash Medicare -- and who are now 
denying it -- will begin airing in 27 cities around the country today. Released this morning at a press 
briefing in Chicago, the new spots call on 27 House Republicans to change their votes and protect 
Medicare in upcoming budget deliberations. </p>
<p>&quot;We're running the spots at this time because the Republicans in Congress are running shamefully 
dishonest television commercials around the country falsely claiming Medicare benefits would 
increase under their proposals,&quot; said AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney, &quot;and because another 
key Medicare vote may come up this Fall.&quot; </p>
<p>Last November, every House Republican but one voted for budget proposals that would have cut 
$270 billion out of Medicare over the next seven years. By allowing Medicare funding to fall well 
below increases in healthcare costs and the eligible population, the Republican budget would have 
cost the average Medicare recipient an additional $400 in premiums in the year 2002. </p>
<p>&quot;It's pretty scary when you remember that this budget also included a tax cut primarily benefiting the 
rich and big corporations,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;And it all would have become law had it not been 
greeted by massive public opposition -- generated in large part by an all-out AFL-CIO campaign 
-- and a veto by President Clinton.&quot; </p>
<p>The new ads were produce din response to a recent series of Republican-sponsored commercials 
claiming that Republicans in Congress are trying to &quot;save&quot; Medicare and that they had actually 
voted to increase Medicare benefits. They ask voters to call their representatives in Congress and 
tell him or her &quot;we know the truth about his/her vote to cut our Medicare benefits. Another vote is 
coming. This time, we'll be watching.&quot; </p>
<p>The ads are part of a campaign launched by AFL-CIO unions this year to educate and mobilize 
working families around issues such as Medicare, pensions, and the minimum wage. The campaign, 
which involves grass-roots mobilization as well as television and radio advertising, was funded in 
March when AFL-CIO unions voted to allocate 15 cents per member per month from existing 
resources to the effort. </p>
<p>Ever since, Republican leaders in Congress in partnership with business interest groups have 
retaliated by inundating TV and radio stations with intimidating letters and phone calls threatening 
legal action, and by intensifying a coordinated disinformation campaign falsely charging the 
AFL-CIO with acting illegally and against the wishes of its members. </p>
<p>Contrary to Republican allegations, recent polls show that union members support the AFL-CIO 
education campaign by a more than six to one margin. &quot;Members want their unions to represent 
their interests in the political and legislative arenas,&quot; said Geoff Garin of Peter D. Hart Research 
Associates, who conducted a poll of union members in early August. </p>
<p>&quot;Our campaign is about issues that matter to working families,&quot; said Sweeney. &quot;It's not about 
Democrats or Republicans. It's about fair wages, health care, retirement security and education. 
And it's about holding elected leaders accountable to the women and men who put them in office.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;And it's working,&quot; he added. &quot;As an example, we were a major factor in the recent passage of the 
minimum wage increase. We ran extensive ads, and in the end, half of the members of Congress we 
named in the ad voted for the increase.&quot; </p>
<p>To help bring declining living standards into the forefront of the national agenda, the AFL-CIO 
conducted 30 &quot;America Needs A Raise&quot; town hall hearings around the country this spring. In 
addition, Sweeney, who will speak before the democratic convention later this evening, recently 
authored a new book called America Needs A Raise published by Houghton Mifflin for release on 
Labor Day. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO is the nation's umbrella labor organization, representing 13.1 million union members 
nationwide.</p>

<body>
<p>LABOR DAY STATEMENT BY THE AFL-CIO<br>
John J. Sweeney, President<br>
Richard Trumka, Secretary-Treasurer<br>
Linda Chavez-Thompson, Executive Vice President<br>
August 29, 1996<br>
<br>
Working families and their unions celebrate Labor Day 1996<br>
with less money in their paychecks and less faith in their<br>
employers and their government, but more determined than ever to<br>
make America work for people who work.<br>
<br>
Our rebounding economy presents a cruel paradox; corporate<br>
profits are up, the stock market is up, executive compensation is<br>
way up, but the wages of millions of workers are not. Over the
past<br>
20 years, American workers rose to the challenge of global<br>
competition and increased our productivity 24 percent. But it<br>
didn't help the workers -- real wages went down 15 percent.<br>
<br>
To meet the challenge of decreasing incomes, more family<br>
members are going to work. Parents are working longer hours and<br>
worrying constantly about choosing between their work and their<br>
families. With employers downsizing, outsourcing, cutting
benefits<br>
and raiding pension funds, workers are angry and anxious.<br>
<br>
They are not, however, plunging into pits of apathy or fits of<br>
apoplexy. They're getting involved in unions and in politics as<br>
they haven't in years, and they are changing the way America
works.<br>
<br>
The victories on the picket lines have been stunning: 25,000<br>
machinists talking Boeing to the ground, 12,000 supermarket<br>
butchers and clerks stamping Safeway's ticket, 5,000 janitors<br>
cleaning up in San Jose, and 35,000 telephone workers taking Bell<br>
Atlantic to the bank without a strike.<br>
<br>
We're also winning again in Washington. By speaking out<br>
forcefully, and with President Bill Clinton backing us up, we<br>
canceled the &quot;Contract on America,&quot; passed a minimum
wage increase<br>
no one thought would even come to a vote, and forced the radical<br>
right to abandon a play to pay for tax breaks for the rich with<br>
massive cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, college loans, and<br>
environmental protections.<br>
<br>
With working families hurting as never before, our unions are<br>
responding as never before. We had an inspiring &quot;Union
Summer,&quot; as<br>
1,500 young students and workers took our message into organizing<br>
campaigns around the country. And the 30 town hall meetings we<br>
sponsored drew thousands of workers eager to proclaim
&quot;America<br>
Needs a Raise&quot; and put working family needs at the top of
the<br>
national agenda.<br>
<br>
This Labor Day, working Americans are looking to their unions<br>
to be a bigger force, to fiercely champion their values and their<br>
interests. They want us to get after the greedy corporations who<br>
force them to choose between being underpaid and unemployed. They<br>
want us to help them support politicians who will listen to them<br>
and their concerns. And they want us to build an economy that
works<br>
for everyone and not just the rich.<br>
<br>
As First Lady Hillary Clinton says, &quot;it takes a village to<br>
raise a child.&quot; American workers are rediscovering that it
takes a<br>
union to get a raise.<br>

Building to protest corporate greed and the ever-growing wage gap<br>
between the rich and the rest of America. Sweeney will tell<br>
corporate America and Congress that the labor movement is ready
to<br>
respond as never before to the pressures on working families by<br>
stopping the assault on working families and restoring respect
for<br>
workers and their contributions.<br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO offices are located in Wacker Hall at the Hyatt<br>
Regency Chicago. Wacker Hall is in the East Tower of the Hyatt in<br>
the lower level (Exhibition Level). The AFL-CIO will also have a<br>
space in the United Center Media Tent (TBD).<br>
<br>
If you would like to set up interviews with John Sweeney, Richard<br>
Trumka, Linda Chavez-Thompson or any of the AFL-CIO delegates<br>

MEDIA ADVISORY TO ASSIGNMENT EDITORS, REPORTERS<br>
FOR LABOR DAY <br>
<br>
ORGANIZING, MOBILIZING AND REAWAKENING HOPE<br>
Some items to consider in Labor Day coverage<br>
<br>
What has changed in a year in organized labor? American<br>
workers and their unions are starting to win again. <br>
From the successful push for a higher minimum wage to<br>
contract wins covering thousands of workers, the benchmark of<br>
what is possible has risen.<br>
John J. Sweeney won the AFL-CIO presidency on Oct. 25, 1995<br>
in the federation_s first contested election with a series of<br>
promises: massive restructuring of the federation; organizing new<br>
members at an unprecedented pace; a labor leadership that looks<br>
more like America_s work force, and a movement that speaks out<br>
for working families.<br>
To be sure, American workers are still struggling. In<br>
Detroit, newspaper workers, on strike for more than a year, need<br>
a contract. Hundreds of Bridgestone-Firestone workers are still<br>
waiting to get back the jobs the company took from them when they<br>
went on strike. For most employees real wages continue to<br>
stagnate, while bank accounts for the rich are bloated. <br>
But, after decades of decline in organized labor, many would<br>
say those conditions now inspire mobilization, not<br>
demoralization.<br>
As you prepare stories for Labor Day, here are some ideas<br>
and themes you may want to consider:<br>
<br>
* Labor has a new face, one that more closely resembles the<br>
backgrounds of the fastest growing segments of the work force. Of<br>
51 AFL-CIO vice presidents, 14 are women or people of color. A<br>
woman and a Hispanic -- Linda Chavez-Thompson -- is executive<br>
vice president.<br>
<br>
* The federation has recruited the best and the brightest,<br>
from Karen Nussbaum, who left the U.S. Labor Department to head a<br>
new working women_s effort in the labor movement, to David Chu,<br>
one of the country_s top researchers, who will lead strategic<br>
research.<br>
<br>
* Organizing new workers is the top priority. Funding for<br>
the Organizing Institute, known for turning out aggressive,<br>
enthusiastic organizers, has increased. The federation funded a<br>
new Organizing Department with $20 million. The initiatives are<br>
bearing fruit -- for example, the AFL-CIO and the United Farm <br>
Workers have begun the largest current organizing drive in the<br>
U.S., aiming to improve the lives of 20,000 strawberry workers.<br>
<br>
* The change in the AFL-CIO has rippled throughout the labor<br>
movement. Contract battles that not long ago might never been<br>
fought are being won. The word concessions isn_t in the contract<br>
for 35,000 Boeing workers -- their strike won improved pay and<br>
benefits, and job protections.<br>
<br>
* Aiming to transform the AFL-CIO from a Washington-based<br>
institution to a grassroots movement, the federation is<br>
revitalizing the country_s more than 600 central labor councils<br>
and training hundreds of community activists. Their role is <br>
becoming instrumental in organizing and political activism.<br>
<br>
* In the America Needs a Raise campaign, the federation held<br>
hearings in 30 cities, bringing to the forefront the anxieties<br>
and anger of working Americans. To further communicate their<br>
fears and show that the labor movement offers solutions, the<br>
federation president has penned a book, _America Needs a Raise._<br>
It will be released by Houghton Mifflin on Labor Day.<br>
<br>
* By becoming a voice for working families, the AFL-CIO has<br>
unleashed long-sleeping power. With targeted broadcast<br>
advertisements through its information departments, the<br>
federation has helped lead the fight against cuts in Medicare<br>
and Medicaid and the battle to raise the minimum wage.<br>
<br>
* Concrete change is leading to real change in the way<br>
Americans view organized labor. About 62 percent of Americans<br>
have a positive view of unions, according to a July Newsweek<br>
poll. More importantly, young people are even more positive -- 68<br>
percent are open to unions.<br>
<br>
<br>
TRANSFORMING AN INSTITUTION<br>
When the first new leadership in 17 years arrived at AFL-CIO<br>
headquarters last October, the infrastructure was antiquated.<br>
Computer systems, for example, were operating on outdated<br>
software that stymied internal communication.<br>
Things are getting in line. Federation officials believe the<br>
AFL-CIO is well on its way to becoming what they envisioned: an<br>
agile fighting machine for working families. Labor_s new faces<br>
are key to the massive restructuring of the AFL-CIO that will<br>
change its direction and build a vital force to represent<br>
America_s workers.<br>
In addition to leaders like Chavez-Thompson, others have<br>
joined the federation leadership. William Lucy, a top AFSCME<br>
officer and leader of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, is<br>
now a vice president. So is Arturo S. Rodriguez, president of the<br>
revitalized United Farm Workers.<br>
Nussbaum isn_t the only key Clinton administration official<br>
lured to the movement. Steve Rosenthal, former associate deputy<br>
secretary at the U.S. Labor Department, was attracted as the<br>
federation_s political director.<br>
A new Corporate Affairs Department, designed to fight bad<br>
employers in boardrooms as well as the streets, is gearing up<br>
under Ron Blackwell, former chief economist for UNITE! David Chu,<br>
one of the top researchers in the country, will soon direct the<br>
Strategic Research division of the Corporate Affairs department.<br>
Bill Patterson, the top union activist on using the power of<br>
pensions and stock ownership for the good of working people, will<br>
lead the Center for Worker Ownership and Governance. Nancy Mills,<br>
who headed a large health care local union, is acting as head of<br>
a new Center for Workplace Democracy in the Corporate Affairs<br>
Department. <br>
The International Affairs unit is shifting toward<br>
representing workers in a global economy and protecting worker<br>
rights in trade agreements. Barbara Shailor, a top aide at the<br>
International Association of Machinists, has joined the<br>
federation staff as International Affairs director.<br>
New General Counsel Jonathan Hiatt is focusing the Legal<br>
Department on pro-active legal strategies to aid organizing and<br>
bargaining, rather than appellate litigation.<br>
The federation_s new Organizing Department is up and running<br>
under Richard Bensinger, the former director of the Organizing<br>
Institute.<br>
The Public Affairs Department has shifted to pro-active<br>
outreach under a new assistant to the president, Denise Mitchell.<br>
Field offices are focusing on organizing and building<br>
community alliances under the director of Field Mobilization,<br>
Marilyn Sneiderman. The number of field offices have been reduced<br>
from 12 to four, while a coordinator if being placed in every<br>
state.<br>
The Education Department has launched a new program of<br>
economics education under a new director, Bill Fletcher, and<br>
assistant to the president, Robert Pleasure.<br>
<br>
ORGANIZING TO SPREAD THE BENEFITS OF THE UNION MOVEMENT<br>
Organizing unorganized workers is the top and most urgent<br>
priority of the new AFL-CIO.<br>
To prepare the field for organizing and sustain hope in the<br>
years to come, 1,500 young people participated in Union Summer.<br>
As labor movement interns, they worked on organizing campaigns<br>
from California to South Carolina and 20 cities in between. They<br>
offered a new perspective to the labor movement and many will be<br>
back, in the trenches for future generations of workers.<br>
Expectations for Union Summer were surpassed. More than<br>
3,000 people from 45 states applied for the internships.<br>
In a few short months, the interns have had some remarkable<br>
achievements. In Los Angeles, they helped restaurant workers win<br>
union recognition. In Michigan, they helped drug store workers<br>
win a union contract. In St. Louis, they helped put a living wage<br>
referendum on the ballot.<br>
In their first two months, the interns distributed more than<br>
150,000 leaflets, made about 5,000 visits to workers in their<br>
homes, visited 1,500 work sites, helped organize 235 protests and<br>
rallies and organized workers who speak 10 languages, from<br>
Spanish to Tagalog.<br>
Their enthusiasm is vital in the current political and legal<br>
environment that aims to thwart workers at nearly every turn.<br>
Gains in the past year are real, but many battles are just<br>
beginning.<br>
The AFL-CIO, with its new Organizing Department, and the<br>
United Farm Workers have mounted the largest organizing campaign<br>
in the U.S. today. Together, they will bring the benefits of a<br>
union to as many as 20,000 strawberry workers in California.<br>
It is a David and Goliath struggle. The workers are poor,<br>
earning an average of $8,000 a year for 10, 11 and 12 hour<br>
workdays without basic dignity. The industry is rich, with a near<br>
lock on the $650 million-a-year business. The campaign is moving<br>
into high gear this month.<br>
Joint strategic organizing campaigns planned for the coming<br>
months will cut across entire industries, such as health care,<br>
and regions, such as the South. They will present a united front<br>
of affiliated unions, the AFL-CIO and allies from other<br>
progressive groups. They will be supported by a multi-million<br>
dollar organizing fund.<br>
Not all will be joint projects. Affiliated unions have<br>
begun more organizing work on their own. For example, UNITE! aims<br>
to organize thousands of nursing home workers in Florida. The<br>
United Food and Commercial Workers and the Service Employees<br>
International Union are doing the same throughout the country.<br>
<br>
<br>
REAWAKENING A VOICE<br>
Mobilizing working people like never before has paid off.<br>
Central Labor Councils across the country are being<br>
strengthened and organized to build grassroots campaigns<br>
politically, and in organizing drives, such as the one among<br>
strawberry workers.<br>
Unions are regaining confidence at the bargaining table. In<br>
addition to the Boeing workers, more than 100,000 rail workers<br>
won contracts this month that increase pay, improve benefits and<br>
protect jobs. It is the first time in a decade that a national<br>
rail agreement has been reached without a strike or government<br>
interference. The unions succeeded because they were unified and<br>
the AFL-CIO was behind them.<br>
The America Needs a Raise campaign sponsored 30 town hall<br>
meetings across the nation. The hearings gave workers, whether<br>
they made the minimum wage or were well-paid, a chance to speak.<br>
Those who testified ranged from established families in Chicago<br>
to immigrants in Los Angeles, from flight attendants in Atlanta<br>
to a construction company executive in New York.<br>
Labor spoke up politically, as well, and did it loudly.<br>
Before the right wing Congress elected in 1994 could<br>
dismantle a half-century of social advancement, the AFL-CIO<br>
unleashed the power of its base. Much to the credit of labor,<br>
anti-worker and anti-family legislation failed.<br>
Among labor_s successes are beating back the TEAM Act,<br>
helping enact a minimum wage increase, exposing right-wing plans<br>
to cripple Medicare and Medicaid, enact education cuts, and<br>
telling Americans about a plan to let corporations raid the<br>
country_s pension plans. The federation stopped efforts to gut<br>
OSHA, defeated national _right-to-work_ legislation and beat back<br>
efforts to undermine wage standards and overtime protections.<br>
Newt Gingrich and his gang have been put on the defensive.<br>
Labor accomplished its legislative successes through<br>
effective media campaigns, inspiring members to speak out, and<br>
by raising issues important to working families independent of<br>
candidates and holding candidates accountable on those issues.<br>
The political front continues with this fall_s elections.<br>
The union movement has put 131 coordinators in 86 Congressional<br>
districts, is training 2,500 activists and recruiting more than<br>
10,000 union members to volunteer on political campaigns.<br>

Statement by<br>
AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney<br>
on the Signing into Law of the<br>
Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Care Bill<br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO applauds President Clinton's signing into law the<br>
Health Care Availability and Affordability Act, also known as the<br>
Kennedy-Kassebaum health care bill. At a time when far too many<br>
Americans do not have health care insurance and even those who do<br>
are worried about losing that coverage when they change or lose<br>
their job, this is a step in the right direction.<br>
<br>
While this legislation does not address the still serious and<br>
unmet need for broad health care reform, it has achieved what<br>
appears to be possible to accomplish in this Congress -- it<br>
provides insurance portability, a much needed remedy to the
problem<br>
of insurance loss that too often comes with a job change or<br>
unemployment. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill also makes important<br>
progress in addressing the problems of Americans who have been<br>
excluded from coverage because of pre-existing conditions.<br>
<br>
We regret that the law that is being signed today includes<br>
provisions for 750,000 families to enroll in Medical Savings<br>
Accounts, but we suspect that this experiment will only validate<br>
concerns that MSAs will be used primarily by the wealthy and the<br>
healthy to the disadvantage of the overall insurance system.<br>
<br>
It is our fervent hope that, with a Congress more sympathetic<br>
to the needs of working families, this new law will be the<br>
foundation for additional reform in the areas of quality, access<br>
and affordability.</p>

<br>
<br>
Statement by<br>
AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney<br>
on the Signing Into Law of the Minimum Wage Increase<br>
<br>
President Clinton's signing of this fair increase in the minimum<br>
wage is a victory for America's working families, both for those<br>
who depend upon it to survive and for those who kept the pressure<br>
on the Gingrich/Dole Congress until the Republican leadership was<br>
forced to do the right thing and finally bring it up for a vote.<br>
<br>
This modest increase in the minimum wage is a small, but<br>
important step in our nation beginning to address the wealth and<br>
wage gap that increasingly divides us into two societies -- the<br>
privileged few and the rest of us. We cannot continue down that<br>
path and remain a healthy society.<br>
<br>
The minimum wage is not a poverty program. It is intended to<br>
establish a wage floor so that a person working full time, year<br>
round, can achieve and maintain a minimal decent standard of<br>
living. This overdue increase -- 90 cents an hour over two years
--<br>
will help lift the lives of the more than 11 million Americans
who<br>
currently earn less than $5.15 an hour. This is a raise they've<br>
earned, their employers can afford and the American people<br>
overwhelmingly support.</p>

<h2 align="center">President Clinton's Veto of<br>

<p>The AFL-CIO commends the president for his wise veto of the
so-called Team Act. Under the guise of &quot;cooperation,&quot;
this damaging and unnecessary piece of legislation would have
given management the say-so over who speaks for workers on issues
such as wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment
-- an unfair infringement on employee rights. There is no need
for the so-called Team Act because current law is clear and
allows real labor- management cooperation, which can only take
place when employees have the right to choose their own
representatives.</p>

Union of North America (LIUNA) are nothing more than retaliation
for the new voice that America's unions are creating for working
families. This isn't the first time that the Gingrich Republican
House leadership has tried to silence those who speak out against
them -- but their bully tactics will not fool the public or deter
us from exposing their attacks on working families. </p>
<p>These hearings are an ugly and gross abuse of government
authority. It is only the latest chapter in the organized smear
campaign against union leaders by the House Republican leadership
- - an attempt to divert public attention away from the
Republicans' core agenda: cutting Medicare and education, giving
tax breaks to the wealthy, and reducing environmental and
workplace safety protection. </p>
<p>Laborers President Arthur Coia has been an acknowledged leader
in fighting for change, for a stronger labor movement, for real
health and safety on the job, for more aggressive organizing, and
for cleaning up corruption wherever he could find it. Coia and
the Laborers union should be applauded for their bold actions to
crack down on the last vestiges of mob control in their union --
not witch-hunted because of past problems and their current
opposition to Gingrich's attacks on working families. </p>
<p>These hearings are not legitimate legislative activity. They
are a naked political payback <strong>-- conducted at taxpayer
expense -- </strong>to try to punish all of America's unions for
telling it like it is on Medicare, tax cuts for the rich and the
minimum wage. </p>
<p>In contrast to our use of private money to protest their cuts
in Medicare, worker safety and college loans, Subcommittee
Chairman Bill McCollum's use of tax dollars to underwrite the
House leadership's private vendetta campaign against America's
unions is a clear abuse of congressional power.</p>

<h2 align="center">Statement by AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney<br>
on the </h2>
<h1 align="center">Subcommittee on Human Resources and
Intergovernmental Relations<br>
Hearing on Union Activities</h1>
<p>This week, the Gingrich House Republican campaign against the
interests of working families moves to a new stage: show trials
at taxpayer expense. </p>
<p>Today's hearing is part of an organized smear campaign against
union leaders by the House Republican leadership -- an attempt to
divert public attention away from their core agenda: cutting
Medicare, tax cuts for the wealthy, and reduced environmental and
workplace safety protection. </p>
<p>This hearing isn't legitimate legislative activity. It's a
naked political payback to punish America's unions for telling it
like it is on Medicare, tax cuts for the rich and the minimum
wage. We've stood up to bullies before -- and we will again. This
kind of harassment won't fool the public and will only make us
more active in shining a light on congressional attacks against
working families. </p>
<p>Subcommittee Chairman Chris Shays of Connecticut is using
taxpayer money to attack unions, in contrast to our use of
private money to protest their cuts in Medicare, worker safety
and college loans. </p>
<p>If anyone's ethics should be investigated, it's the Republican
leadership's. While the AFL-CIO has run a fully public issues
education campaign on how Congress is performing on the issues
that matter most to working families, the Republican House
leadership has unleashed a private vendetta campaign against
America's unions -- an abuse of Congressional power at taxpayer
expense.</p>

<h1 align="center">More than 1,000 Rank-and-File Union Members<br>
Expected At U.S. Capitol on Tuesday and Wednesday </h1>
<h2>Workers Coming To Tell Their Senators:<br>
Pass A Clean Minimum Wage Increase;<br>
Vote No on Team Act and Right-To-Work</h2>
<p>WASHINGTON--More than 1,000 union members from around the
country will come to Washington, Tuesday, July 9, and Wednesday,
July 10, to urge their senators to pass a clean minimum wage
increase and to defeat the so-called Team Act and a national
right-to-work bill. </p>
<p>The two days' grassroots lobbying activities will begin
Tuesday at 11 a.m., when the members of a dozen different unions
take part in a minimum-wage press conference and rally led by
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and Sen. Edward Kennedy on the
west steps of the Capitol. </p>
<p>After lobbying their home-state senators, union members will
join supporters for a minimum-wage vote watch in the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee Room, 430 Dirksen Senate Office
Building, where they will be available for interviews. </p>
<p>Lobbying activities will continue on Wednesday, as union
members urge their lawmakers to vote against the so-called Team
Act, which would take away workers' right to choose their own
representatives to deal with their employer; and against passage
of a national right-to-work bill that would undermine unions by
allowing employees to receive union representation, wages,
services and benefits without paying union dues.</p>

<title>PR 06/28/96 Town hall meetings</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
<meta name="FORMATTER" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<p>AFL-CIO News -- June 28, 1996 </p>
<h1 align="center">Town hall meetings elevate debate on wages</h1>
<h2 align="center">By David Kameras</h2>
<p>The AFL-CIO completed a series of 29 town hall meetings with
another round of powerful testimony plainly showing the
challenges facing today's workers. </p>
<p>At the meeting in San Jose, Calif., Imelda, a Mexican
immigrant, told of how she once provided care for an 82-year-old
woman who lives by herself. But earning $4.25 an hour two hours a
day and being eight months pregnant, she had no one to attend to
her daughter and is now out of work. </p>
<p>&quot;When I used to take care of this woman, my work
reflected compassion and quality, but this doesn't seem to mean
anything in the labor market,&quot; she told the gathering, which
included AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson. </p>
<p>Billie Anne Martin, a single mother now off welfare and
employed as a county eligibility worker, said one of her
paychecks goes for the rent, the rest to necessities, and even
that is threatened by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's bill to
contract out government work. </p>
<p>&quot;The safety net of the American working class and the
meager benefits for the disadvantaged are being slowly carved
away,&quot; she said, noting that a local center that houses
disabled children is being closed by the year 2000. &quot;I'd
like to know where these children are going to go and what kind
of benefits they're going to receive.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;When we see where CEO salaries in the last 15 years have
increased by 514 percent, and workers' wages haven't even kept
up, and with the average CEO of a Fortune 500 company now making
over 149 times what the average worker makes, I think it's time
to take from the hands of the greedy and put it back into the
hands of the needy,&quot; added Ray Biosa, a member of Service
Employees Local 715, which represents public workers in Santa
Clara County. </p>
<p>On June 12, Atlanta was burning again, this time with the
fires of indignation over lost jobs and frustrated dreams, as
Chavez-Thompson continued the federation's quest for more
evidence that America Needs A Raise to present to recalcitrant
lawmakers. </p>
<p>When Susan Clayton, a Flight Attendants local president,
joined now-grounded ValuJet Airlines, &quot;little did I know I
would end up a slave laborer, helping to line the pockets of
those people who started the airline with gold.&quot; </p>
<p>When not fired for union activities, workers, who were hired
through a temp agency owned by the CEO's daughter and ex-wife,
were forced to work excessive shifts for substandard pay and buy
uniforms from an owner's son-in-law, who &quot;stated we would
all be replaced with Coke machines and vending machines if he had
his choice,&quot; Clayton said. &quot;He said we can strike until
we starve.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Thank God for unions, because with the union, we're able
to fight back and work on getting a fair contract,&quot; she
said. </p>
<p>The Rev. Sandra Robinson, director of the Georgia Citizens
Coalition on Hunger, reminded the meeting that many of the people
on public assistance are workers, including &quot;single men who
have become homeless because they are being exploited by labor
pools, because they are being paid minimum wage, and then they're
being deducted for helmets, and deducted for boots, and deducted
for transportation, and deducted for a $2 baloney sandwich, and
then at the end of the day, they don't have enough to take care
of their own human needs.&quot; </p>
<p>At a June 13 meeting in Pittsburgh, AFL-CIO Secretary-
Treasurer Richard L. Trumka heard 51-year-old Sandra Israel tell
how her age prevents her from finding new employment after losing
her job of 15 years. &quot;I am a black American woman standing
here asking you to join in, that we don't have to take a
$5-an-hour job.&quot; </p>
<p>Bea Sutton is a licensed practical nurse who was permanently
replaced by a nursing-home facility operated by notoriously anti-
union Beverly Enterprises after protesting unfair labor
practices. </p>
<p>&quot;Fighting a large corporation like Beverly is really
tough, but we get more determined every day that we are going to
win,&quot; she said. &quot;This is not just a Beverly worker
fight. This is a fight to maintain the dignity, the rights and
the respect for all workers. We cannot allow the large
corporations to continue to put profits before people.&quot; </p>
<p>Tom Pegler stayed home for two years to take care of his
children so that his wife could get off welfare and go to school.
But then she became too ill to work, a child became ill as well,
and he went back to work double-time. &quot;It's very, very hard
to work two minimum-wage jobs and be able to be home with your
sick family,&quot; he noted. </p>
<p>&quot;The answer to low wages is high wages,&quot;
Steelworkers President George F. Becker said. &quot;So why don't
we have high wages? Well, when 85 percent of the work force in
America is unorganized, </p>
<p>85 percent of the wages and the salaries in America are
unilaterally set by companies whose best interest is to keep it
as low as the marketplace will allow it to be.&quot; </p>
<p>House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and two Massachusetts GOP
congressmen were in Boston June 18 for a $1,000-a-plate dinner
with their corporate backers when the final town hall meeting was
being held there, and Trumka invited them &quot;to give up that
dinner and come to listen to Boston's working families'
struggles. This will enable you to take these stories back to
Congress before voting on more cuts in programs that hurt working
families to give another tax break to the rich and special
interests.&quot; </p>
<p>Had they attended, they would have heard from: </p>
<ul>
    <li>A Chinese immigrant who, after seven years of working
        12-hour days, six days a week in restaurants, now works
        in a community association trying to change working
        conditions. </li>
    <li>A 13-year transit worker who is the sole supporter for a
        disabled husband and three children, and two paychecks
        away from homelessness. </li>
    <li>A service worker who works up to seven days a week to
        raise her four children on $5.25 an hour. </li>
    <li>A Steelworker locked out of Commonwealth Gas for turning
        down a contract calling for more than 50 concessions
        dictated two weeks after $3 million was given to
        management personnel, made possible by a record $54
        million in profits. </li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately in our nation in recent years, we have
seen a split between the privileged and the rest of us,&quot;
said the Rev. Edward Boyd of the Boston Labor Guild. He called
for confronting the nation and its leadership &quot;to understand
what is at stake here -- not only bread on the table, but a
spiritual bread, that spirit of mutual concern and mutual sharing
that is at the heart of our life.&quot;</p>

</pre>
<h2 align="center">AFL-CIO WILL JOIN IN SUPPORT OF<br>
BRAZILIAN WORKERS' GENERAL STRIKE </h2>
<p>On June 21, 1996, the AFL-CIO and affiliated unions will
demonstrate in solidarity with the general strike called for by
the three principal labor confederations of Brazil to protest the
anti- worker policies of the Brazilian government. Demonstrations
will be held at the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, D.C. from
noon to 1 p.m., the Brazilian consulates in Boston, Miami, Los
Angeles, and San Francisco and the Brazilian mission to the U.N.
in New York. </p>
<p>Brazilian workers are seeking fair wages, the establishment of
decent retirement benefits, a forty-hour work week, enforcement
of labor laws, job creation, fair wages, land reform, and social
and economic policies that protect workers. A recent Gallup poll
found 81 percent of Brazilians in support of this general strike. </p>
<p>Brazilian workers face the same attempts at out-sourcing and
privatization, downsizing, union-busting and downward pressure on
wages and working conditions that workers in the U.S. confront. </p>
<p>&quot;Just as American laws and lawmakers fail to protect
American workers' jobs, the Brazilian government pays only lip
service to current laws designed to provide workplace fairness in
Brazil. Brazilian workers need a raise, too,&quot; said AFL-CIO
President John J. Sweeney.</p>

                                                       (202)637-5318
</pre>
<h2 align="center">Statement by John J. Sweeney<br>
President, AFL-CIO</h2>
<h2 align="center">On a hearing on the so-called Workers Right to
Know Act<br>
by the House Economic and Educational Opportunities<br>
Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations</h2>
<p>Today, the House Republican leaders are doing what they always
do when they find themselves out of step with the voters - -
holding harassment hearings as a smokescreen to keep the truth
from billowing out. </p>
<p>These hearings were not called to examine the right of union
members to spend part of their dues money on issue-based
political education. They were called as part of an orchestrated
assault on America's unions in retaliation for our new vigilance
and vitality on behalf of U.S. working families. </p>
<p>Working families are hurting as never before: they've seen
their incomes decline 15 percent in the last 20 years, while
productivity, profits, executive salaries and the stock market
increased. America's unions are responding as never before with a
legislative and political education program to elect men and
women who will stand up for working families and then hold them
accountable once they're in office. </p>
<p>That's why right-wing politicians and lobbying groups are
conducting a vicious campaign against the AFL-CIO and its 13.1
million members: we're exposing the voting records of elected
officials who support the transfer of wages and wealth from
working families to the wealthy and big corporations. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, when we announced our plan to wage an
unprecedented education campaign to expose the attacks of this
Congress on working families, the Republican House leaders
instructed the Chamber of Commerce to form a new facade called
the <strong>Center for a 21st Century Workplace,</strong> to
combat our efforts through paid and free media. </p>
<p>When we purchased television and radio adds to tell working
families how their elected officials voted against their
interests, the House Republican leaders tried to intimidate
stations running our ads. Exaggerated reports to the contrary,
they failed: 107 stations decided the commercials were fair and
accurate, five stations took them off -- including two stations
with blanket policies against any sort of advocacy advertising. </p>
<p>When it was obvious our efforts were beginning to have an
effect, the head of the Republican Party launched an aggressive
fundraising campaign by advancing the <strong>big lie</strong>
that the AFL-CIO has spent $40 million on ads since last August.
How big? The actual amount is one-tenth of that. </p>
<p>We are committed to ethical campaign contribution practices.
Not one of the 13.1 million men and women whose unions are
affiliated with the AFL-CIO is required to allow his or her dues
money to be spent on political education or legislative action.
Workers who join unions are already protected by more financial
disclosure requirements than are members of any other
organizations or corporation, including members of the American
Medical Association, the American Bar Association, the Chamber of
Commerce or stockholders in corporations. </p>
<p align="center">Instead of hosting a hearing on a <strong>workers'
right to know</strong> bill, Mr. Gingrich should draft and
present legislation giving doctors, lawyers, businessmen and
shareholders the right to <strong>say no.</strong></p>

<h3 align="center">Remarks by John J. Sweeney<br>
President of the AFL-CIO</h3>
<h1 align="center">&quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; Rally</h1>
<h2 align="center">Wall Street<br>
June 6, 1996</h2>
<p>The following is a text of the remarks AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney delivered at a noon rally today on Wall Street. </p>
<p>What a great crowd! What a great day in New York! What a great
day for America! This is it. We are here. Main Street comes to
Wall Street and we will be heard: AMERICA NEEDS A RAISE. </p>
<p>This is a great day and a great crowd because of the hard work
and dedication of Brian McLaughlin and all the unions the New
York City Labor Council. It's a great day and a great crowd
because of the commitment and compassion of Ed Cleary and all the
members of the New York State AFL-CIO. And it's a great day for
America because of the incredible job done by all the New York
religious and community leaders who planned and hosted our town
hall meetings in all five boroughs of this great city and we
should recognize them at this time. </p>
<p>In the past six weeks, &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; has
travelled to 20 cities across our country. We've listened to
testimony from working and retired and unemployed and disabled
women and men in Birmingham, Los Angeles, Columbus, Portland,
Maine and Portland, Oregon, Billings, Denver, Seattle,
Louisville, Washington, DC, Detroit, Nashville, Chicago, Las
Vegas, Boston, Houston, Trenton, Baltimore, Albuquerque and the
five boroughs of New York. </p>
<p>From the West Coast to the East Coast, we've heard the same
story, from workers who make $12,000 a year to workers who make
$50,000 a year, to workers who make zero dollars a year, from
white collar, to blue collar, to new collar to no collar:
&quot;We're working harder and harder for less and less and
AMERICA NEEDS A RAISE!&quot; </p>
<p>Answer this, Wall Street: if corporate profits are up 200
percent and executive compensation is up 400 percent, why are
working family incomes DOWN 12 percent? Answer this, corporate
America: if productivity is up 24 percent and the Dow Jones is up
401 percent, why are working families running out of money,
running out of credit and RUNNING OUT OF HOPE? </p>
<p>Answer this, American government: if family values are what
this election year is all about, why don't we value working
families, why are moms and dads having to work three jobs just to
stay even, why do workers have NO TIME LEFT OVER for their kids
and their parents? </p>
<p>I'll answer them all: because for the past 20 years Wall
Street and corporate America have been putting profits before
people. </p>
<p>Because for the past 20 years, the politicians we send to
Washington have been pandering to the rich and the big
corporations and pounding on the middle class and the poor. </p>
<p>Because for the past 20 years, 97 percent of the income
increase in our country has gone to the top 20 percent of wage
earners. </p>
<p>Because for the past 20 years, American workers have been
worked like mules and treated like dogs, left out and shut out of
decisions affecting their jobs, and because they've been fired,
laid off, riffed, outsourced, temporarily replaced, permanently
replaced, downsized, right-sized, marginalized and OSTRACIZED
from the very society they built with their sweat and blood. </p>
<p>That's long enough. We've had enough. AMERICA NEEDS A RAISE! </p>
<p>Here's our challenge to Wall Street: stop jacking up the
stocks of companies who gain short-term profits from laying off
long-term employees, stop rewarding CEOs who run their companies
into the ground by running workers into the unemployment line. </p>
<p>Here's our challenge to corporate America: start exporting
products instead of jobs, start consulting your employees when it
comes to productivity, quality and competitiveness, start paying
them enough to afford the goods and services they produce. </p>
<p>Here's our challenge to American government: stop raising
taxes on the middle class and the working poor, stop giving tax
breaks to the wealthy and the big corporations, stop the Wall
Street wizards who are gambling away our future, and STOP
STALLING AROUND ON THE MINIMUM WAGE! </p>
<p>Our message to business: low wages are bad business and they
are bad for business --- put some confidence in our ideas, put
some dollars in our pockets and we'll put you on the map ANYWHERE
IN THE WORLD! </p>
<p>Our message if you don't: With our bodies and our brains,
American workers and their families will rise up and take back
from you what you have taken from us! </p>
<p>That's a promise, that's a contract, that's a commitment: </p>
<p align="center">American workers are hurting as never before
and America's unions are responding as never before. Millions of
Americans need a living wage. Millions of Americans need a job.
AMERICA NEEDS A RAISE, AMERICA DESERVES A RAISE. And, bu God, we
are going to agitate and educate and march and strike until
American workers and their families GET A RAISE! Thank you and
Godspeed .....</p>

<h3 align="center">New poll finds 68 percent want a clean vote on
minimum wage now </h3>
<h1 align="center">Stop Voting To Block A Minimum-Wage Increase,<br>
AFL-CIO Ads Tell Congress This Week</h1>
<p>WASHINGTON, May 20--The AFL-CIO this week is airing two new
ads calling on Congress to increase the $4.25 minimum wage as
part of its expanding program to educate the public on key policy
issues. A vote could come this week. </p>
<p>The TV and radio ads begin running today in 27 districts where
House members have repeatedly voted to block a minimum-wage
increase. The ads cite members of Congress who have voted to
block increases as many as five times. They also contrast
skyrocketing corporate profits and executive salaries and the 30
percent raise Congress gave itself to the plight of working
families, who have lost ground since the last minimum-wage
increase five years ago. </p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to inform working families about what
Congress is doing about increasing the minimum wage and how they
can make their voices heard,&quot; said AFL-CIO President John J.
Sweeney. </p>
<p>Bolstering its efforts, the AFL-CIO pointed to a new Peter D.
Hart Research poll, conducted May 14-16, that found 68 percent
support for considering a minimum-wage increase with a
&quot;straight up-or-down vote now,&quot; compared to 26 percent
approval for &quot;consider later on as part of a larger
package.&quot; On the basic question of whether to increase the
minimum wage, 84 percent of Americans say yes, according to a
March CBS/New York Times poll. </p>
<p>The spots also call on members of Congress who &quot;voted to
cut Medicare and college loans, all to give a big tax break to
the rich,&quot; to &quot;stop playing political games and start
voting for working families for a change.&quot; </p>
<p>The ads will run in districts in California, Connecticut,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine,
Michigan, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Washington and Wisconsin.</p>

<h1 align="center">Vote Now To Raise the Minimum Wage,<br>
New AFL-CIO Ads Tell Congress </h1>
<p>WASHINGTON, April 30 -- The AFL-CIO this week is expanding its
program to educate union members and the public on key policy
issues with two new ads calling on Congress to vote immediately
to increase the $4.25-an-hour minimum wage. </p>
<p>The radio ads, scheduled to run today through Friday in 29
districts where House members recently voted twice to block
minimum-wage increases, pointedly note that corporate profits and
executive compensation &quot;have gone through the roof,&quot;
and members of Congress voted themselves a 30 percent pay raise,
while working families have lost ground since the last
minimum-wage increase, five years ago. </p>
<p>&quot;There is no excuse for any further delay. Congress
should act now and schedule a straight up-or-down vote to give
working families the raise they deserve and have earned,&quot;
said AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney. &quot;The AFL-CIO will
continue to inform the American public about those members of
Congress who don't believe that working families deserve a living
wage.&quot; </p>
<p>Running in 21 states, the ads point out that these same
members of Congress twice voted to block minimum-wage increases
after they had voted to cut Medicare and college loans to give
tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy. The spots also note
that 84 percent of registered voters support raising the minimum
wage. </p>
<p>The spots close by urging viewers and listeners to call a
toll-free number and tell their member of Congress to &quot;stop
the games, stop the gimmicks, and raise the minimum wage.&quot; </p>
<p>Radio ads will run in districts in Arkansas, California,
Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine,
Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, New Jersey,
North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and
Wisconsin.</p>

<h1 align="center">Gore, Reich, Sweeney and Workers<br>
Look At Job Safety 25 Years After Passage of OSHA<br>
At The Department of Labor </h1>
<p>In observance of the 25th anniversary of the Occupational
Safety &amp; Health Act, a Department of Labor ceremony with Vice
President Gore, AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney, Secretary of
Labor Robert Reich, and injured workers and their family members
is scheduled for Friday, April 26, at 10 am at the Department of
Labor Auditorium, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. </p>
<p>Vice President Gore will issue a statement on the OSHA law and
will ask for a recommitment to safe jobs and to improve workplace
safety and health protections. President John J. Sweeney and two
workers will also make statements. </p>
<p>Worker Speakers: </p>
<p>James Duriett, a New York construction worker who fell off a
scaffold and suffered serious head and other injuries; and
Shirley Smith, a North Carolina poultry worker who suffers
repetitive strain injury. </p>
<p>Also: Official Release of AFL-CIO Report on 25 Year Health and
Safety Record </p>
<p>Since the passage of the OSHA law, the U.S. has made
significant progress in improving workplace safety, particularly
in industries where government enforcement and standards have
been focused. OSHA has passed standards to protect workers from
significant hazards such as confined spaces, asbestos and
bloodborne diseases. The agency has inspected millions of
workplaces and penalized employers who fail to comply with the
law. But last year alone, 6,588 workers lost their lives on the
job and an estimated 50,000 more died because of workplace
diseases. And some in Congress want to weaken job safety laws. </p>
<p>The anniversary of the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act
coincides with the AFL-CIO's 8th annual Workers Memorial Day on
April 28, a day where workers and their unions remember
colleagues killed, injured or made ill on the job. Events are
scheduled in hundreds of communities.</p>

<h1 align="center">AFL-CIO to Release Report Detailing 25 Years<br>
of Worker Safety and Health</h1>
<p>Washington, April 24 -- The AFL-CIO will release a new report
on the status of job safety 25 years after the enactment of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act during a 2 p.m. press briefing
Thursday, April 25, at its headquarters at 815 16th St. N.W. </p>
<p>The report documents the injury and fatality reductions that
have occurred since the OSHAct went into effect, shows which
industries have become safer under the law, details current
upward trends of injury rates and costs in some industries and
shows emerging problems. </p>
<p>It also shows that the nation's commitment to worker safety
and health pales in comparison with the commitment to protect the
environment and to address other public safety and health
concerns, while states' worker compensation systems remain
woefully inadequate. </p>
<p>The briefing marks the first event of nearly 200 planned in 37
states to mark the 8th annual commemoration of Workers Memorial
Day. Among other events, AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney will
rally with workers in Milwaukee and Madison, Wis., on April 27,
Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson will join workers
in Alton, Ill., and St. Louis for a service on April 28 and
Secretary- Treasurer Richard L. Trumka will address a Los Angeles
breakfast April 29.</p>

<h1 align=center>Union Card Makes a Difference for 
Working Women<br>
Labor Takes Women's Issues on the Road</h1>
<p>Washington, April 18--AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney announced his commitment to 
women workers by establishing a first ever AFL-CIO Working Women's Department. The 
department is headed by former U.S. Department of Labor Women's Bureau Director Karen 
Nussbaum. </p>
<p>Karen Nussbaum intends to make the Working Women's Department a very pro-active 
high-visibility department by working closely with and listening carefully to the problems and needs 
of working women in America. Karen begins the department's activities next week by scheduling a 
series of meetings with women's organizations and union groups in Atlanta, Chicago, Portland, OR, 
Boston and New York City. </p>
<p>Of the 100 million women 16 and older in the United States, 60 million are in the labor force. 
&quot;Most women work because of economic need,&quot; states Nussbaum. In 1992, nearly two-thirds of 
America's working women were single (25 percent), widowed (4 percent), separated (4 percent) 
or had spouses whose earnings were less than $17,500 (17.7 percent). Women that work in union 
jobs earn on average $145 more each week and have better job security, training and promotional 
opportunities, health care and pension plans. </p>
<p>Karen Nussbaum is available for interviews to discuss important and timely issues affecting women 
in the workforce and her plans for the Working Women's Department at the AFL-CIO. Please 
contact Karla Garland at 202/637-5376 to arrange an interview or request additional information. </p>

<h1 align=center>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney To 
Congress:<br>
Vote Now to Increase Minimum Wage </h1>
<p>WASHINGTON, April 17--This afternoon, AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney sent a letter to 
all members of the U.S House and Senate urging Congress to vote without delay for a 
long-overdue raise for America's minimum-wage workers. </p>
<p>Earlier today, 14 House Republicans introduced a bill that would increase the minimum wage to 
$5.25 an hour over the next two years. This action came two days after the AFL-CIO finished 
airing a wave of radio and TV ads in 30 House districts highlighting a March 28 House vote against 
considering a minimum wage increase. </p>
<p>&quot;The AFL-CIO intends to make the stagnation of wages for America's workers, particularly 
minimum-wage workers, an issue that cannot be ignored,&quot; Sweeney wrote the lawmakers. </p>
<p>&quot;There should be no more delay. Congress needs to act now without the procedural maneuvers 
that have kept working Americans from getting the raise they deserve and have earned. </p>
<p>&quot;In light of today's action in the House, combined with the clear 55-vote majority in the Senate in 
support of a minimum wage increase, it is incumbent on every member of this Congress who 
supports American working families to insist your leadership schedule a floor debate and final 
legislative action on this issue.&quot; </p>
<p>April 17, 1996 </p>
<p>Dear Representative: </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO urges Congress to vote now to increase the minimum wage. There should be no 
more delay. It is clear that there is an emerging bi-partisan majority in the house for such an 
increase and there is already a 55-vote majority in the Senate. It is now time to pass legislation that 
will provide some relief to America's lowest-paid workers. </p>
<p>The minimum wage workforce is largely adult and comprised mostly of women, minorities and 
single heads of households; its wages support families as well as the economy. The value of the 
minimum wage has declined to its lowest level in 40 years. At a time when workers are struggling 
more and more with declining living standards, American families desperately need this raise. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO intends to make the stagnation of wages for America's workers, particularly 
minimum wage workers, an issue that cannot be ignored. Congress needs to act now without the 
procedural maneuvers that have kept working Americans from getting the raise they deserve and 
have earned. </p>
<p>With bi-partisan support growing in the Congress and the support of 84% of the American public it 
is incumbent on every member of this Congress who supports American working families to insist 
that a floor debate and final legislation action be taken on this issue now. </p>
<blockquote>

<h3 align="center">Statement by John J. Sweeney<br>
President of the AFL-CIO</h3>
<h2 align="center"><br>
On President Clinton's<br>
Retirement Savings And Security Act </h2>
<p>President Clinton's Retirement Savings and Security Act is a
positive step toward making the promise of retirement income
security a reality for all Americans. If enacted, this proposal
would help stop the erosion of private pension coverage in
America and would improve the retirement prospects of millions of
working families. </p>
<p>One of the most pressing concerns for working Americans today
is income security during their retirement years. Unfortunately,
the same forces that have caused falling real-wage levels for
most Americans during their working years increasingly threaten
the retirement security they deserve and have earned. </p>
<p>The decrease in private pensions -- along with the erosion of
health care coverage -- is one of the biggest problems in the
worsening economic situation of America's working families.
Coupled with reckless proposals now being advanced to radically
restructure and privatize Social Security, the erosion of
pensions threatens to destroy retirement security for tens of
millions of working Americans. </p>
<p>We need to halt the erosion of pensions and health coverage,
as well as the decline in real wages, before we can reverse
what's happening in America now and make the economy work for
working families again. A country can't grow rich by making its
people poor. If work is to become valued once more in America, we
must re-establish our social compact -- by which working families
receive affordable health coverage, secure and adequate pensions,
and incomes that rise when the economy is successful. </p>
<p>Historically, in America, such a social compact has been made
essentially by employers and workers. But, government clearly has
a positive role to play and must use its ability to create the
climate and legal structures to encourage and make these goals
possible.</p>

<p align="center"><em>The vote against raising $4.25 an hour
minimum wage keeps millions of workers stuck below poverty line! </em></p>
<h1 align="center">AFL-CIO LAUNCHES NEW WAVE OF RADIO AND TV ADS<br>
CITING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS <br>
WHO VOTED <em>AGAINST </em>RAISING MINIMUM WAGE</h1>
<p>Washington, April 9 -- Taking the next step in its
wide-ranging program to educate the American public on key public
policy issues, the AFL-CIO today unveiled new television and
radio ads focusing on Congress' recent votes opposing a raise in
the minimum wage. </p>
<p>The spots, scheduled to begin running today in 31 districts
where House members voted against a minimum wage increase,
pointedly note that the vote follows similar votes by the same
members to cut Medicare and college loans while providing tax
cuts to corporations and the wealthy. </p>
<p>&quot;We haven't had an increase in the minimum wage since
1991, and the value of today's $4.25 an hour rate is about to dip
to a forty year low in terms of real value,&quot; said AFL-CIO
President John J. Sweeney. &quot;Today's minimum wage amounts to
a salary of $8800 a year, while the poverty line for a family of
four is more than $15,000. I think we have a responsibility to
inform Americans about those Members of Congress who don't
believe working families deserve a livable wage.&quot; </p>
<p>Running in districts held by both Democrats and Republicans,
the ads point out that &quot;back in 1991, the minimum wage was
four dollars and twenty five cents an hour. Since then, corporate
profits and executive salaries have soared. But working families
have lost ground. And the minimum wage is still just four twenty
five an hour.&quot; </p>
<p>The spots close by urging viewers and listeners to call a
toll-free number and, &quot;tell (Congressman) to raise the
minimum wage and start voting for America's working
families.&quot; </p>
<p>TV ads will run in districts in Arkansas, California, Indiana,
Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska,
New York, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Washington
and Wisconsin. Radio spots will air in Connecticut, Illinois,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio and Texas.</p>

IMPOSE STREET JUSTICE </h1>
<h2 align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda

issued the following statement in response to the<br>
police beatings of two suspected undocumented<br>
Mexican immigrants near Riverside County.<br>
</h2>
<p>&quot;The recent police beatings of two Mexican immigrants in
Los Angeles has hit close to home for the labor movement.
America's unions have all too often felt the brunt of police
batons when they rained down on janitors peacefully marching in
Century City and on peaceful drywall construction workers
protesting throughout Southern California.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Our movement will not tolerate this type of police
brutality nor will we excuse officers because the situation is
volatile and fraught with emotion. This is not a question of
immigration rights, but of basic civil and human rights.&quot;</p>

<title>PR 04/02/96 Political Endorsements</title>
<meta name="FORMATTER" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<h2 align=center>1996 AFL-CIO Principles for Political Endorsements</h2>
<p>The AFL-CIO and its unions are committed to seeking out and supporting candidates who pledge 
themselves to restore respect for workers and just rewards for work, and to defending programs 
working families depend on - from Medicare, to Medicaid, to education, college loans and 
environmental protections. </p>
<p>We want the candidates we support to stop tax giveaways to big business and the wealthy, reverse 
job-destroying trade policies that benefit only multinational corporations, and preserve workers' 
health and safety protections as well as wage and working standards guaranteed by Davis-Bacon, 
the Service Contract Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act. </p>
<p>And we want to endorse office-seekers who will fight to restore the minimum wage and guarantee 
affordable, high-quality health care for everyone, who will stand up for policies to protect the rights 
of workers to freely organize and join unions and insist on job- creating low-interest rate policies 
instead of job-destroying high- interest rate policies from the Federal Reserve. </p>
<p>We know our selection of political leaders is more important than ever before and that we have 
critical choices to make this year at many levels - elections for school boards, city and county 
government, state legislatures, the United States Congress and for the highest office in our country. </p>
<p>Over the past several months, we've been talking with our members through meetings, polls and 
focus groups, and we know they want to be more involved in making endorsements and supporting 
candidates. They want us to make decisions based on issues that relate to them and their families, 
not on the personalities or political party affiliations of candidates. They want us to give them 
information, not voting instructions. And they want us to be <em>watchdogs</em> over officials once we elect 
them. </p>
<p>With these clear directions in mind, we decided to poll our members before making an 
endorsement in the most critical race of this election year, the contest between incumbent President 
Bill Clinton and Senator Bob Dole. </p>
<p>Between March 12 and 14, Peter D. Hart Research conducted in-depth interviews with 829 
workers and retirees who belong to our unions. The results show that President Clinton has broad 
and growing support among our members - 69 percent of them said they approve of the job he is 
doing and 60 percent say they support him for re- election (while only 28 percent do not). Senator 
Dole, by contrast, fares poorly with our members. Only 22 percent say they will support him and in 
a head-to-head contest with President Clinton, Clinton gets 67 percent of their votes. </p>
<p>Even more important, our members told us they support the idea of an <a href="../wip96/wip0326.html">endorsement of President 
Clinton</a>. Two-thirds of them say they would approve if - <em>the labor unions that are a part of the 
AFL-CIO</em>, including <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/affiliat.htm">your union</a>, endorsed Bill Clinton for re-election because they have concluded 
that Clinton is the best candidate on the issues that affect union members and working families. </p>
<p>The records of President Clinton and Senator Dole are clear on those issues, and they present 
starkly different visions for American workers and their families. </p>
<p>President Clinton spent a major part of his first term fighting for national health care reform and he 
sent Congress a fair, comprehensive health plan that would have guaranteed quality, affordable care 
for all Americans. Senator Dole helped shoot it down. </p>
<p>Senator Dole voted for a plan to finance tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations through cuts 
of $270 billion in Medicare and $170 billion in Medicaid, a proposal calling for increased costs for 
beneficiaries and turning over Medicaid to the states with no strings attached. </p>
<p>President Clinton vetoed the proposed $270 billion in Medicare cuts and $170 billion in Medicaid 
cuts. He opposes tax breaks for the rich. He supports federal guarantees of health care for the 
elderly and continued administration of Medicare and Medicaid by the federal government. He 
supports legislation sponsored by Sens. Kennedy and Kassebaum guaranteeing health coverage for 
workers who lose or change jobs. </p>
<p>When it comes to preserving wage standards, there is no comparison between the two candidates. 
President Clinton has proposed an increase in the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour; Senator Dole is 
against increasing the minimum wage and voted against even bringing it up for a vote. President 
Clinton has promised to veto any bill that materially impacts Davis-Bacon or the Service Contract 
Act; Senator Dole voted to weaken Davis-Bacon and to exempt certain communities from 
prevailing wage requirements. </p>
<p>In the area of education, President Clinton made it easier to borrow for college, opened Head Start 
to more preschool children and sponsored a School-to-work initiative and National Service. </p>
<p>Senator Dole wants to cut college loans as well as the Safe and Drug-free Schools program and he 
wants to abolish the Department of Education. </p>
<p>President Clinton has pledged to fight to preserve and protect Social Security and to prevent 
employers from being able to dip into employee pension funds; Senator Dole voted against the 
guarantee that Social Security funds not be raided to balance the budget. </p>
<p>President Clinton has promised to veto any legislation that would inhibit or cripple <a href="http://www.osha.gov/">OSHA</a> and he 
has consistently opposed Congressional attempts to weaken environmental protections; Senator 
Dole wants to dismantle OSHA and called for a moratorium on further regulation, including rules on 
workplace ergonomics hazards and TB. </p>
<p>President Clinton supported the AFL-CIO Workplace Fairness Bill to end the use of <em>permanent 
replacements</em> to break strikes. When the bill failed, he signed an executive order banning the use 
of federal contractors who have employed replacement workers. Senator Dole voted to kill the 
Workplace Fairness Bill. </p>
<p>Both candidates, it should be noted, supported the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA), which the AFL-CIO, its unions and our members vigorously opposed. It should be 
noted that President Clinton did seek, unsuccessfully, to have more worker and environmental 
protections included in the bill. </p>
<p>America's working families have never faced a greater challenge - or had a greater opportunity to 
make a difference politically. We see our friends and neighbors losing jobs, homes and dignity, or 
struggling with little success to keep up with higher prices on steadily eroding wages. We see our 
aging parents, our disabled loved ones and the poor threatened by proposed federal budget cuts at 
a time when they are already struggling to afford housing, clothing, food and medical treatment. 
And we see a future for our children in which they have little hope of earning as much or enjoying 
life as much as we have. </p>
<p>Against this bleak backdrop, we know our choice of political leaders is more important than ever 
before and nowhere is the choice more critical or more clear than between the candidates running 
for President. </p>
<p>We support the re-election of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.</p>

<body>
<h1 align="center">1996 AFL-CIO Issue-based Grassroots
Legislative and Political Program</h1>
<p>Over the past 20 years, tremendous shifts have taken place in
the political, social and economic strata of our country, nearly
all of them detrimental to workers and our families. </p>
<p>Taking the low road through a murky deregulated economy,
American corporations chose to compete in a new world marketplace
by squeezing more productivity from fewer and less
well-compensated workers. A succession of conservative occupants
of the White House gave away billions of dollars worth of tax
breaks to big business and the wealthy. And at every level of
government, reactionary, anti-worker politicians seized the
levers of authority and began systematically unravelling the
cloak of economic and social justice arduously woven over the
past 50 years by workers, our unions and our allies. </p>
<p>The result has been one of the largest transfers of power and
money in the history of the United States. Over two decades,
productivity went up 24 percent, executive compensation increased
360 percent and corporate profits soared. But real earnings for
workers declined 12 percent and the number of Americans with
health insurance coverage and pensions at work declined
dramatically. Over 97 percent of the increase in household
incomes went to the richest 20 percent. Today, the top fifth of
households in our country get half the nation's income and
control 85 percent of the wealth. The rest - <em>80 percent of
all households</em> - split the other half of total income and
share 15 percent of the nation's wealth. </p>
<p>Working families are pressured as never before. More family
members are working longer hours just to stay even, and parents
have less and less time to spend with our children. Loaded with
debt and threatened by downsizing, outsourcing and a growing pool
of low- wage, no-benefit contingent labor, American workers are
frustrated, anxious and angry. If they aren't out of work, they
are out of hope, and you don't have to be an economist to realize
that's a prescription for disaster in a nation that survives
through optimism. </p>
<p>Incredibly, it is against this national backdrop that
conservative members of Congress have launched a broad assault
against federal laws and agencies which enhance wages and income
security, protect worker health and safety, create and improve
jobs, and defend the rights of workers to form and join unions: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Under the guise of <em>reform,</em> they have targeted
        Davis-Bacon, the Service Contract Act and the Fair Labor
        Standards Act, OSHA, MSHA and the National Labor
        Relations Board for virtual repeal. </li>
    <li>Using as justification a budget deficit they created,
        they are bent on decreasing funding for Medicare,
        Medicaid, and federal and postal retiree benefits, while
        increasing health care costs for the elderly, the
        disabled and the poor. </li>
    <li>With no pretense at fairness, they want to widen the wage
        and wealth gap by giving more tax breaks to the wealthy
        and the giant corporations, while slashing job training,
        welfare, nutrition, education and housing programs. </li>
    <li>And in order to perpetuate their control over workers and
        our families, they are determined to cripple worker
        organizations by crippling workers' rights, limiting
        transportation union bargaining rights, denying public
        access to union organizers, restraining advocacy
        organizations getting federal funds, legalizing company
        unions and passing a national right-to-work law. </li>
</ul>
<p>The AFL-CIO and its unions are equally determined to reverse
the flow of money and power that has working families mired in a
wage and wealth sinkhole now big enough to swallow our entire
economy. And we are committed to countering the politics and
policies of elected officials who oppose the interest and welfare
of working families. That's why we're responding as never before
to rejuvenate our unions and build a strong, new nationwide
movement of workers and our families. As the only organizations
expressly representing the interest of working Americans, we're
organizing an unprecedented effort to educate and mobilize
working-class Americans around the issues that affect us and our
children's future. </p>
<p>This is an extraordinary moment in our nation's history and
the unions of the AFL-CIO have decided to assess themselves $.15
per member, per month for a 12-month period beginning in May 1996
to fund an extraordinary response. The assessment is not an
increase in the amount of dues members pay. Rather, it is an
increase in the share of existing union funds devoted to
education, training and mobilization to fight for the issues
important to those members. </p>
<p>We will use the money to: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Strengthen local unions, state federations and central
        labor councils by providing increased training,
        coordination and staff. </li>
    <li>Create standing grassroots action committees in every
        Congressional district, with a goal of recruiting and
        training at least 10,000 activists. </li>
    <li>Establish a National Labor Political Training Center to
        train staff as well as rank-and-file organizers and
        coordinators. </li>
    <li>Employ new techniques of advertising, direct mail and
        free media to educate workers and their families and
        motivate them to lobby elected officials. </li>
    <li>Register and mobilize voters around worker issues and get
        them to the polls in record numbers. </li>
    <li>Judge candidates by their positions on issues, not by
        whether they are Democrats or Republicans or
        Independents, and hold them accountable once we have
        elected them.

<h2 align="center">UNION SURVIVAL STRATEGIES FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST
CENTURY</h2>
<h3 align="center">Jonathan P. Hiatt<br>
General Counsel, AFL-CIO</h3>
<p align="center">Lee W. Jackson, Esq.<br>
O'Donnell, Schwartz &amp; Anderson</p>
<p>In his acceptance speech after being elected President of the
AFL-CIO last October, John Sweeney stated that &quot;we begin
today to build a new AFL-CIO that will be a movement of, by and
for working Americans.&quot; President Sweeney went on to pledge
that &quot;we're going to spend whatever it takes, work as hard
as it takes, and stick with it as long as it takes to help
American workers win the right to speak for themselves in strong
unions&quot; -- &quot;to organize every working woman and man who
needs a better deal and a new voice.&quot; &quot;Our
commitment,&quot; President Sweeney concluded, is to
&quot;revitalize the labor movement at every level and to . . .
change its face to represent the faces of all American
workers.&quot; </p>
<p>The need for a revitalized labor movement could not be more
apparent. Forty years ago, one in three private sector workers
belonged to a labor union; today the figure is closer to one in
ten. Numerous studies have found that the decline in the level of
union representation has been a major cause of what Lester Thurow
terms a &quot;surge in inequality&quot; in the United States -- a
surge which threatens the social fabric on which our society is
based. </p>
<p>Any discussion of the challenges facing the labor movement, as
it begins to fulfill the commitment stated by President Sweeney,
must necessarily begin by reviewing the challenges facing, and
the problems besetting, working men and women. When all is said
and done, what the labor movement must do is nothing more -- but
nothing less -- than to find ways to enable America's workers to
respond effectively to what is happening to them in the workplace
and in the larger society. </p>
<p>More specifically, to serve working Americans in the coming
century, the labor movement must develop strategies that respond
to two trends which together are wreaking havoc on the lives of
so many working men and women. </p>
<p>The first is the growing gap -- indeed the chasm -- in the
earnings of American workers. As the Dunlop Commission observed
in its Fact Finding Report, our labor market is
&quot;bifurcating&quot; into &quot;an upper tier of high wage
skilled workers and an increasing `underclass' of low paid
labor.&quot; This &quot;underclass,&quot; it should be noted, is
not some small minority of the workforce (as the term may
suggest); rather the underclass actually includes all workers
whose formal education ended with high school. Those workers
actually comprise a majority of the workforce! </p>
<p>The wages of high-school educated workers has been in a free
fall for the past two decades; in fact, since 1974 the average
wage of males with a high school education or less has declined
by more than 20%, and the proportion of such workers who work
full-time for poverty-level wages has doubled. Largely as a
result, one in five full-time, full-year workers today earns
below the poverty level -- a 50% increase since 1979. </p>
<p>Even these statistics, disturbing as they are, understate the
depth of the problem working Americans will face in the coming
century. Workers entering the labor market face an even more
serious plight. For example, the entry-level wage for male high
school graduates has declined by over 30% since 1973 and now
stands at under $7.00 per hour, or under $15,000 for a full-time,
full- year employee. It is hardly surprising that the Dunlop
Commission found that the ability of these younger workers
&quot;to form families and buy homes has been compromised by
their labor market plight.&quot; And it is likewise not
surprising that in a recent poll 80% of the public expressed
concern about whether their kids would be able to find good jobs. </p>
<p>Largely as a result of this collapse in the earnings of the
high school educated, the richest 10% of families in the United
States now earn almost six times as much as the poorest 10%. As
the Dunlop Commission observed, that is &quot;by far the
widest&quot; gap among industrialized countries -- twice the
level in much of western Europe. And male workers in the bottom
10% in the United States now earn barely half of what their
counterparts in Europe earn. </p>
<p>In a report otherwise marked by its unquotable prose, the
Dunlop Commission sounded a haunting warning: &quot;A healthy
society cannot long continue along the path the U.S. is
moving.&quot; </p>
<p>At the same time that the labor market has been bifurcating
along educational lines, a second and closely related division
has been taking place -- one that in large part explains the
growing income gap: the division between what are referred to in
today's lingo as the &quot;core&quot; and the
&quot;periphery.&quot; </p>
<p>There was a time, not so very long ago, when the work of firms
was done by employees of the firm. In this bygone world, firms
were places within which employees were able to develop stable
jobs and long-term careers. And within the context of these
firms, it was possible to stabilize wages, to establish
standardized employee benefits, and to otherwise develop a set of
expectations and understandings built around the employment
relationship. </p>
<p>For more and more working men and women, such a stable, long-
term employment relationship with decent wages and benefits has
become an unobtainable dream. Increasingly, firms view hiring as
a last resort, and define only a narrow set of functions as those
worth being performed by permanent, full-time employees --
&quot;the core.&quot; Workers outside the core are deemed
&quot;peripheral&quot; and as their jobs are eliminated through
downsizing and the like, firms are finding ways to have the exact
same functions performed through a variety of
&quot;contingent&quot; arrangements which negate or minimize the
firm's legal and social obligations owed to those performing
these services for the firm. </p>
<p>These peripheral workers may be &quot;retained&quot; as
independent contractors. They may be hired as disposable
employees, either on a temporary or part-time basis. Or their
services may be secured through the intermediary of a temporary
help agency, an employee leasing firm, or a service contractor
whose service consists principally of selling the labor of
&quot;peripheral&quot; workers. </p>
<p>Estimates of the number of employees caught up in these
various forms of contingent relationships vary widely, depending
upon how contingent work is defined. But by any estimate a large
and growing number of workers lack the kind of stable attachment
to a firm which in the past has been the hallmark of the
employment relationship. </p>
<p>The net effect of these two developments -- the bifurcation of
the labor market between high wage and low wage workers, and
between core and peripheral workers -- has been to divide the
workforce into four identifiable segments. Representing each
segment raises its own set of challenges for the labor movement,
and for labor law. </p>
<ol>
    <li>The Core, Skilled Workforce -- There is, of course, a
        corner of the labor market -- a shrinking corner, to be
        sure -- in which labor unions can function in the way our
        labor laws contemplate and in the ways unions have
        functioned for the past six decades. Here, skilled
        workers -- principally professionals and technicians but
        also some skilled craftspersons -- perform core functions
        for firms to which they are attached on a more-or-less
        permanent basis. 
        <p>Within this universe, the workforce can be organized
        into unions on a workplace-by-workplace basis. And
        because these workers possess skills that their employers
        need, bargaining can take place on a more-or-less equal
        footing, as the law envisions, with individual employers
        or on a multi-employer basis with groups of employers in
        common industries. </p>
        <p>This is not to say that it is, can be, or will be
        business as usual for the labor movement in reaching out
        to these skilled, core employees. Today's workers are,
        without doubt, different from the workers of prior
        generations. They have different needs and different
        aspirations. And that is especially true of the more
        highly educated workers. </p>
        <p>The challenge facing the labor movement, as we seek to
        organize and represent these workers, is to demonstrate
        that labor organizations are democratic institutions
        which provide the means through which the workers can
        advance their interests as they define their interests. </p>
        <p>Of particular importance here, if we are to succeed in
        organizing the skilled, core workforce, is the need to
        show that unions provide a vehicle through which these
        workers can secure the kind of relationship they want
        with their employer -- a relationship which, as
        Professors Freeman and Rogers found in their Worker
        Representation and Participation Survey, is characterized
        by &quot;cooperative relations with management and,
        within those relations, a significant measure of control
        and independence over how their [the employees']
        interests are represented.&quot; We must show that unions
        can help these workers win a voice not only with respect
        to the terms and conditions of their employment but also
        with respect to the work they do and the quality of the
        products and services they produce. </p>
        <p>The labor movement has been hard at this task for some
        time. We recognize, as President Sweeney said in a recent <a
        href="../speech95/sp1215.html">speech to the National
        Press Club</a>, that &quot;we can no longer afford the
        luxury of pretending that productivity, quality and
        competitiveness are not our business.&quot; Indeed, two
        years ago the AFL-CIO issued a white paper which declared
        that it is &quot;incumbent upon unions to take the
        initiative in stimulating, sustaining and
        institutionalizing a new system of work
        organization&quot; -- a system &quot;which alters in the
        most basic ways the manner in which work is organized,
        businesses are managed, and labor and management treat
        each other.&quot; </p>
        <p>And this is not simply rhetoric. Throughout the
        manufacturing sector -- in auto, steel, rubber, glass,
        and apparel to name a few examples -- and increasingly in
        the service and public sectors, unions and employers,
        through collective bargaining, are forging strong
        labor-management partnerships dedicated to achieving
        world class standards of productivity and efficiency
        through, democratic, participatory work organizations. In
        fact, there is mounting evidence that these new work
        systems are most effective, and most durable, when
        developed and nurtured through the collective bargaining
        process. </p>
        <p>The labor movement is committed to continuing these
        initiatives, particularly as we seek to serve the segment
        of the labor market populated by skilled, core employees.
        But there is reason to fear that the law may stand in the
        way. </p>
        <p>The threat to employee participation does not arise,
        as many in the management community would have it, from
        the definition in section 2(5) of the National Labor
        Relations Act of the term &quot;labor organization.&quot;
        To the contrary, the <a
        href="http://www.doc.gov/nlrb/homepg.html">NLRB's </a>decision
        in General Foods Corp, 231 NLRB 1232 (1977), and its more
        recent decision in Vons Grocery, 320 NLRB No. 5 (Dec. 18,
        1995), make clear that all employers, union and non-union
        alike, are entirely free to implement participatory
        management systems and to involve their employees fully
        in the work of the firm without creating employer-
        dominated &quot;labor organizations&quot; within the
        meaning of sections 2(5) and 8(a)(2). Despite the
        overheated rhetoric surrounding the so- called TEAM Act
        now pending in Congress is, that bill has little if
        anything to do with facilitating teamwork and everything
        to do with allowing non-union employers to establish
        employer-controlled systems of in-plant representation as
        a substitute for the independent representation which
        labor unions offer. </p>
        <p>The real impediment to employee participation and
        labor- management partnership lies not in the Act's
        definition of what constitutes a &quot;labor
        organization&quot; but rather in the definition of who
        constitutes an &quot;employee&quot; and what constitutes
        a &quot;mandatory subject of bargaining.&quot; </p>
        <p>In order for participative work systems to take root,
        the more experienced workers within a firm must be
        willing to assume increased responsibility for directing
        those with less experience, and the employee group as a
        whole must be willing to assume some of the
        decision-making responsibilities previously vested in
        management. But last year's <a
        href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/supct.table.html">Supreme
        Court decision</a> in NLRB v. Health Care &amp;
        Retirement Corp., ___ U.S. ___, 62 L.W. 4371 (May 23,
        1994), when coupled with the Supreme Court's earlier
        decision in NLRB v. Yeshiva University, 444 U.S. 672
        (1980), raise the possibility that employees who assume
        mentoring functions, or who accept a delegation of
        &quot;managerial&quot; authority, can become
        &quot;supervisors&quot; or &quot;managers&quot; and
        thereby jeopardize their right to continued
        representation. Indeed in Health Care &amp; Retirement
        Corp. the Court entertained (without deciding) the
        possibility that the entire nursing complement of a
        nursing home, including even the LPNs, were supervisors,
        and in Yeshiva the entire faculty of a university was
        held to be managers. </p>
        <p>The threat that this line of cases poses to the
        continued development of labor-management partnerships is
        obvious, and is illustrated by College of Osteopathic
        Medicine and Surgery, 265 NLRB 295 (1982). There, the
        Board granted a petition filed by the employer to
        &quot;clarify&quot; a unit by &quot;exclud[ing] all
        employees who are currently included therein.&quot; Id.
        at 295. The grounds for removing all the employees from
        the unit and denying them the protection of the Act was
        that they had obtained through the process of collective
        bargaining authority sufficient to render them managerial
        employees under Yeshiva. In other words, the Board held
        that employees can utilize their statutory rights so
        effectively that they deprive themselves of such rights. </p>
        <p>College of Osteopathic Medicine underscores the
        importance of carefully limiting the sweep of the
        managerial and supervisory exclusions so that the
        movement towards employee participation and decentralized
        decision-making does not end up costing erstwhile
        employees their statutory rights. The Board has begun to
        wrestle with at least some of these issues in the wake of
        Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp., holding in Providence
        Hospital, 320 NLRB No. 49 (Jan. 3, 1996) and ten Broeck
        Commons, 320 NLRB No. 65 (Feb. 2, 1996), that, on the
        specific facts of those cases, the nurses in question
        were not supervisors. Undoubtedly, these issues will have
        to be carefully sorted out in the coming months and years
        if labor and management are to be able to continue down
        the partnership path and to find ways, through collective
        bargaining, to offer professional and technical employees
        the opportunity to maximize their contribution to their
        employers. </p>
        <p>The trend towards labor-management partnerships also
        requires a rethinking of the scope of mandatory
        bargaining under sections 8(d) and 8(a)(5) of the Act.
        Current case law is premised on an outmoded understanding
        of the division of labor within industry, one in which
        management planned and labor executed. In that world,
        labor's interests were essentially limited to the terms
        under which they labored, and the scope of bargaining
        could therefore be narrowly circumscribed. But in the
        world of work teams and labor- management partnerships,
        labor has a much broader range of interests, one that
        transcends &quot;terms and conditions&quot; narrowly
        defined. Here, the ordinary flow of influence from the
        NLRA to parallel public sector laws may be reversed as
        law formed in the public sector, where pressure for an
        expanded scope of bargaining from teachers and other
        organized professionals has been great, could be imported
        into the private sector. </p>
    </li>
    <li>The Skilled, Peripheral Workforce -- While many
        professional and technical employees are fortunate enough
        to enjoy stable employment relationships, there is a
        large and growing number of skilled workers whose
        worklife looks quite different. Voluntarily or
        involuntarily, these workers have become part of what is
        now commonly referred to as the &quot;contingent
        workforce.&quot; 
        <p>Consider, for example, the phenomenon with which every
        reader of The Legal Times or The National Law Journal is
        undoubtedly familiar: the growing number of temporary
        help agencies offering the services of lawyers. These
        agencies operate under clever- sounding names like
        Attorneys Per Diem. But the reality is that these
        agencies are largely populated by law school graduates
        unable to find permanent employment -- unable to join the
        &quot;core&quot; -- and doomed to work on a contingent
        basis for some indeterminate period. </p>
        <p>The same trend is apparent in the health care
        industry, where nurses and even LPNs now find themselves
        employees of agencies rather than the hospitals or
        nursing homes for whom they regularly perform services. </p>
        <p>Or consider what is happening within the broadcast
        industry. Increasingly, television stations --- whose
        lifeblood is camera work -- are ceasing to employ
        cameramen/women; instead, camera crews are retained on a
        daily basis as independent contractors. Writers, too, are
        no longer employees; they are freelancers. Even
        announcers are now being hired -- or &quot;retained&quot;
        -- by the day, as contract workers. </p>
        <p>Whether termed &quot;consultants,&quot;
        &quot;free-lancers,&quot; &quot;temporary
        employees,&quot; or &quot;agency employees,&quot; these
        are contingent workers. But unlike the workers who are
        more often thought of under this rubric -- and whose
        plight is discussed below -- these workers at least share
        a common occupation or calling. They compete only with
        others in the same occupation or calling. And that opens
        the door for the labor movement to reach out to these
        individuals by creating new forms of unionism -- unionism
        which is centered not on the workplace but on the
        occupation. Such unionism is destined to become an
        important part of the landscape of the twenty-first
        century. </p>
        <p>The precise functions of an associational (or
        occupational) union are not difficult to envision.
        Indeed, the building trades unions provide a useful
        model. </p>
        <p>An occupational union can serve as the vehicle through
        which continuing education and training takes place just
        as the building trades have provided the vehicle for
        craft training. An occupational union can assist with the
        monitoring and enforcement of health and safety,
        anti-discrimination, and other employment- related public
        rights. And perhaps most important of all, like a
        building trades union, an occupational union can provide
        job search services and a hiring hall to marry members
        with work assignments. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the legal impediments to this form of
        unionism are, at present, formidable. The NLRA
        presupposes stable employment relationships. Organizing
        under the Act takes place among employees of an employer
        working within a defined bargaining unit. Outside of the
        building and construction industry -- for which specially
        statutory provisions were enacted in 1959, see NLRA '
        8(f), 29 U.S.C. ' 158(f) -- where occupational unionism
        exists today it largely operates in the shadows of the
        NLRA. </p>
        <p>If this form of unionism is to flourish, the law must
        be adapted to conform to the present realities. Doing so
        will require more than simply expanding 8(f) to cover
        other industries, for decisions of the NLRB interpreting
        that section have drained it of most of its vitality. </p>
        <p>The Board has held, for example, that while a union
        which represents construction workers can negotiate an
        agreement requiring a contractor to obtain workers from
        the union's hiring hall, the employer can effectively
        negate that agreement at any time by creating a separate
        legal entity to do the very same work with non-union
        labor. And the Board has likewise held that at the
        termination of such a contract, the employer is free to
        discontinue recognizing the union (or to hold the threat
        of doing so over the union's head in negotiation for a
        renewal agreement). The net effect of these decisions is
        to leave section 8(f) as a mere permission for union
        representation in the construction industry but to deny
        construction workers any enforceable right to secure such
        representation. </p>
        <p>Thus, to provide skilled, contingent workers with the
        legal protections they deserve, section 8(f) must not
        only be extended to other industries but also made
        stronger and more effective. </p>
    </li>
    <li>The Unskilled, Core Workforce -- While their numbers
        continue to shrink, there are still industries which
        employ a stable complement of unskilled, low-wage
        workers. Hotels, for example, employ bellmen, and maids;
        restaurants employ busboys, dishwashers, and waiters;
        nursing homes employ nurses aides; even some garment
        manufacturers employ seamstresses (although the garment
        industry norm is quite different). 
        <p>In the main, these workers have a far more
        conventional agenda than their more highly-educated and
        better-paid brothers and sisters. Partnership is nice,
        but bread is essential. They want a union first and
        foremost to improve their economic lot. </p>
        <p>These low-wage workers are, understandably enough,
        highly receptive to organizing; in the Freeman-Rogers
        survey, for example, an absolute majority of such workers
        said they would vote for a union tomorrow if given the
        chance and in the absence of employer opposition. And in
        theory, at least, the NLRA is tailor-made for these
        workers since, on paper, the Act affords them the right
        to organize and bargain collectively. </p>
        <p>The reality, of course, is entirely different.
        Low-wage, unskilled workers are the principal victims of
        the demonstrated failings of the National Labor Relations
        Act. The battle over labor law reform in 1977-78, and
        over the striker replacement legislation in 1992-94, were
        at bottom battles over whether these workers would as a
        practical matter be afforded the opportunity to improve
        their lot through organizing and collective bargaining. </p>
        <p>Because the unskilled workers know that there are
        others capable of doing their work (and know how
        difficult it would be to find another job), these workers
        are most easily intimidated by the illegal firings that
        the Dunlop Commission conservatively estimated occur in
        one out of every four organizing drives. They are equally
        terrorized by talk about what could happen to their job
        if they choose to organize -- talk which is, remarkably
        enough, entirely lawful. </p>
        <p>Perhaps most troubling of all, these unskilled workers
        are completely vulnerable to what has become an integral
        part of the anti-union campaign: the permanent
        replacement threat. What is the point of organizing, they
        wonder, if the employer is hell-bent on avoiding a
        contract at all costs (or at least a contract which
        offers any improvements for the employees) and if the
        employees' only recourse is the strike which the employer
        can break through the use of permanent replacements? Why
        run the risks? </p>
        <p>It seems quite clear that these considerations explain
        why so many organizing drives which begin with solid
        majority support for unionization end in defeat. And
        these considerations explain the vehemence of the
        opposition to the labor law reform proposals of 1977-78,
        to the striker replacement bill, and even to recent
        efforts by the General Counsel of the NLRB and the Board
        itself to expedite representation elections. </p>
        <p>In light of the impotence of the current law in
        protecting low-wage workers and their growing frustration
        over their declining wages, inexorably workers will take
        their cause to the streets with increasing frequency to
        respond to employers determined to suppress the exercise
        of the workers' associational rights. Their plight must,
        and undoubtedly will, become the civil rights issue of
        the next decade or more. </p>
        <p>At the same time, a principal challenge facing the
        labor movement in serving these unskilled workers will be
        to develop new means of asserting economic pressure
        against recalcitrant employers so that organizing and
        bargaining are not exercises in futility. We must enhance
        and expand our capacity to exert workplace and non-
        workplace pressure through a variety of methods that are
        generically referred to as strategic campaigning. These
        strategies will raise legal issues of at least five
        types. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, the line between protected and unprotected
                strikes -- and between permanent and temporary
                replacements -- will continue to be tested as
                workers seek to refashion their work stoppages in
                order to shield themselves from permanent
                replacement. The Board has clearly held that a
                strike is protected no matter how short, Polytech
                Inc., 195 NLRB 695, 696 (1972); that two strikes
                are protected, Robertson Industries, 216 NLRB 361
                (1975), enf'd 560 F.2d 396 (9th Cir. 1976); and
                that a series of short strikes are protected so
                long as they do not arise out of a plan
                repeatedly to strike regardless of the existence
                of new provocation, see Union Electric Co., 219
                NLRB 081 (1975); Blades Mfg. Corp., 144 NLRB 561
                (1963), enf. denied, 344 F.2d 998 (8th Cir.
                1965). How far these decisions reach in
                protecting short and intermittent strikes remains
                to be seen. 
                <p>Similarly, questions will arise as to the
                whether a replacement work can properly be deemed
                &quot;permanent&quot; if he/she has yet to
                complete the probationary period or met other
                conditions that the employer would normally
                require as a prerequisite of acquiring true
                permanent status. Issues will also be raised as
                to the duty of employers to immediately reinstate
                strikers who unconditionally offer to return to
                work after a short strike, since the Board's
                decisions on whether an employer's agreement to
                retain temporary employees for a set time period
                is grounds for delaying reinstatement are
                contradictory, Compare Harvey Manufacturing,
                Inc., 309 NLRB 465 (1992), with Pacific Mutual
                Door Co., 278 NLRB 854 (1986). And the Board's
                holding that employers are entitled to a five-day
                grace period to reinstate unfair labor practice
                strikers after a short strike lacks reasoned
                justification. See Drug Package, 228 NLRB 108
                (1977). </p>
            </li>
            <li>Second, strategic campaigns will continue to
                challenge the antiquated notion that lenders,
                suppliers, or customers of an employer are
                somehow &quot;neutral&quot; with respect to a
                labor dispute involving that employer and should
                be shielded from economic pressure. It is only in
                the twisted vision of the labor law that each
                employer is an island unto itself; no business
                can survive today if it in fact operates in that
                fashion (as Apple Computer is proving so well).
                And no rule of labor law is more divorced from
                reality than the rule treating the parent or a
                corporate affiliate of the primary employer as a
                &quot;neutral&quot; in disputes involving that
                employer. </li>
            <li>Third, access issues will continue to arise as
                workers seek to go beyond the strike and make
                common cause with workers and consumers with
                common interests at other workplaces or places of
                business. Although Lechmere, Inc. v. NLRB, 502
                U.S. 527 (1992), dealt only with the access
                rights of nonemployee organizers seeking to
                induce others to exercise their section 7 right
                of self- organization, the decision is proving to
                have much greater sweep. 
                <p>Thus, in Leslie Homes, Inc. 316 NLRB 123
                (1995), enf'd sub nom Carpenters District Council
                v. NLRB, 68 F.3d 71 (3rd Cir. 1995), and
                Loehmann's Plaza, 316 NLRB 1160 (1995), enf'd sub
                nom. Food and Commercial Workers v. NLRB, ___
                F.2d ___ (D.C. Cir. 1996), the Board held that
                workers seeking to exercise their own section 7
                right to handbill or engage in other concerted
                activity have no right of access to the property
                of an employer with whom the workers have no
                employment relationship so long as that property
                has been neutrally closed to all other forms of
                solicitation. On the other hand, in United States
                Postal Service, 318 NLRB No. 56 (1995), the Board
                recently held that employees of the Postal
                Service who worked at one location were not
                &quot;strangers&quot; to other locations of the
                Postal Service but rather should be treated like
                off-duty employees under Tri-County Medical
                Center, 222 NLRB 1089 (1976), for purposes of
                access to those other locations. Workers and
                their unions will continue to test the limits of
                these decisions in other contexts. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Fourth, as employers increasingly seek to break
                strategic campaigns by resort to the state (and
                federal) courts, issues are certain to arise as
                to the scope of protection under Bill Johnson's
                Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731 (1983),
                for workers and unions who are being subject to a
                torrent of lawsuits alleging libel, slander,
                tortious interference with contract, and a
                variety of other state torts. The standard for
                finding such lawsuits to be unfair labor
                practices is most fully articulated in Makro,
                Inc. (Loehmann's Plaza), 305 NLRB 663 (1991), but
                it remains far from clear. </li>
            <li>Finally, as workers seek to use strategic
                campaigns to secure recognition for their
                designated representative outside the traditional
                representation processes, the Board's holding in
                Majestic Weaving Co. of New York, 147 NLRB 859,
                enf. denied on other grounds, 355 F.2d 854 (2d
                Cir. 1966), will come under increasing scrutiny.
                Negotiations over a non-Board recognition
                procedure often spill over to discussing the
                terms of a future collective bargaining
                agreement, should the union demonstrate majority
                support. Under Majestic Weaving, however, this is
                an unfair labor practice. It is illogical to
                allow such discussions if the union already
                represents some employees of the employer, for
                example in an &quot;additional store&quot;
                clause, but not if the union has no foothold with
                the employer. Compare Houston Div. of Kroeger,
                219 NLRB 388 (1975), with Majestic Weaving. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Unskilled, Peripheral Workforce -- By far the
        greatest challenge facing the labor movement in the
        coming century, is to find ways to advance the interests
        of unskilled, peripheral (or contingent) workers. Lacking
        stable employment, these workers are in the most
        desperate economic straits. Yet precisely because they
        lack a stable employment relationship, they are orphans
        of the law with no ready means of advancing their
        interests. 
        <p>The unskilled, peripheral workforce actually is
        comprised of three discrete sub-groups, each raising its
        own set of legal issues. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) Independent Contractors -- In a number of
                industries, employers have proven quite adept at
                exploiting the common law definition of
                &quot;employee&quot; to create large new classes
                of &quot;independent contractors.&quot; For
                example, by taking money from taxicab drivers
                rather than giving money to them, taxicab
                companies have succeeded in virtually eliminating
                employees from the taxicab industry and
                transforming almost all cab drivers into
                independent contractors. The trucking industry
                has followed a similar course. And this trend has
                gone so far that one Seattle cleaning contractor,
                after submitting the lowest bid to clean downtown
                office buildings, proceeded to sell
                &quot;franchises&quot; for the right to clean
                floors of downtown office buildings for $4,000 to
                $7,000 a floor -- transforming low-wage janitors,
                mostly immigrants from Central America and Asia,
                into &quot;independent contractors.&quot; 
                <p>Plainly, the time has come to reexamine the
                line the common- law -- and, derivatively, the
                NLRA -- draws between employee and independent
                contractors. The Dunlop Commission's
                recommendation in this regard -- that
                &quot;economic realities&quot; should be
                determinative of the extent of labor law
                protection and that &quot;workers who are
                economically dependent on the entity for whom
                they perform services generally should be treated
                as employees&quot; -- merits far more attention
                than it has received. </p>
            </li>
            <li>(b) Temporary and Part-time Employees -- Even
                more difficult problems are posed by the
                itinerant workers who move from workplace to
                workplace and by part-time employees who
                regularly work for one, two or even three
                employers. The temporary workers often are
                treated as employees -- for an hour, a day,
                perhaps a week. And the part-timers are
                &quot;fortunate&quot; enough to have multiple
                permanent employment relationships, each of which
                keeps the employee below the level at which
                various employment benefits (such as health care
                or even sick leave) kick in. 
                <p>If these workers are to be protected -- and if
                the incentive to transferring more and more work
                to temporary and part-time employees is to be
                curbed -- it can only be through the enactment of
                state and federal labor standards regulating the
                use of temporary and part-time employees and
                imposing obligations on firms which use such
                employees. Representative Schroeder has
                introduced a bill which would take some small
                steps forward in this direction. </p>
            </li>
            <li>(c) Intermediary Contractors -- Different
                questions are raised, and different measures are
                needed, to protect unskilled workers who find
                steady employment with an intermediary contractor
                which essentially sells labor, for these workers
                enjoy the form -- but not the substance -- of
                legal protection under the NLRA. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The building service industry provides a useful case
        in point. There was a time when building maintenance was
        done by employees of the building owners. The janitors
        enjoyed stable jobs working for &quot;their&quot;
        building. And employees of a particular building could
        organize and bargain collectively with &quot;their&quot;
        owner. </p>
        <p>In most cities, this is no longer the case. Today,
        building owners use cleaning contractors to preform
        maintenance services. These contractors sell little more
        than the labor of the janitors they employ. And the
        process of competitive bidding for the service contracts
        drives the janitors' wages and benefits down to the
        lowest common denominator. </p>
        <p>In theory, of course, the employees of a cleaning
        contractor could organize a union. But if the janitors of
        a contractor were to organize, the contractor's client --
        the building owner --- could, under current law,
        terminate the contract (and effectively terminate the
        employees) simply because the employees had so voted.
        Indeed, it is not uncommon when janitors begin to
        organize for the identity of their employer to suddenly
        change or for the employer, and the employees, to be
        terminated. </p>
        <p>Moreover, even if the janitors of a cleaning
        contractor were to succeed in organizing they would win
        the right to bargain only with the individual cleaning
        contractor. And even if the building owner were willing
        to suffer a unionized contractor, as a practical matter
        the contractor would have no capacity to agree to
        increase wages or benefits for the janitors without
        jeopardizing his cleaning contract. </p>
        <p>The labor law's traditional answer to this dilemma is
        to tell the union to organize all of the employees and
        firms within the industry, i.e. all the cleaning
        contractors. But because building maintenance is an
        unskilled occupation, the potential labor supply is
        virtually limitless. And because, in this new world of
        intermediate contractors, the employers are no longer the
        owners of capital but uncapitalized intermediate firms,
        the supply of potential employers is equally without
        limit. </p>
        <p>It is for this reason that in <a
        href="http://www.seiu.org/">SEIU's</a> Justice for
        Janitors campaigns attention has been focused on capital
        -- the building owners -- rather than solely on the
        contractors themselves. The owners effectively determine
        the wages of the janitors through the contracting
        process. And whereas wages and benefits negotiated with
        the contractors can be readily circumvented by the
        introduction of new contractors, the owners have the
        capacity to establish and maintain stable labor
        standards. </p>
        <p>Our current labor laws, as construed to date by the
        NLRB, see things quite differently. Even though the
        owners effectively control the wages of the janitors, the
        Board has adopted an unnecessarily narrow concept of
        &quot;joint employer&quot; which generally enables
        building owners to escape any bargaining obligation with
        respect to the employees of a contractor. </p>
        <p>The Board has likewise adopted a restrictive
        interpretation of ' 8(a)'s prohibitions so as to leave
        owners free to terminate contracts based upon the
        protected activity of the contractor's employees. Yet at
        the same time the NLRB has applied an indefensibly broad
        definition of &quot;neutral&quot; for purposes of the
        secondary boycott laws so as to immunize the building
        owners from picketing, even while occasionally
        acknowledging that the statute does not require such
        treatment. See, e.g., Teamsters Local 560
        (Curtin-Matheson Scientific, Inc.), 248 NLRB 1212 (1980). </p>
        <p>Each of these doctrines ought to be reconsidered in
        light of the economic realities of the relationship
        between capital and intermediate employers which sell
        little other than labor. The notion that building owners
        or other client firms are &quot;wholly unconcerned&quot;
        about disputes between the workers and their contractor
        employers when the client firms can terminate a
        contractor precisely to nullify its collective bargaining
        agreement with a union, see NLRB v. Burns International
        Security Services, Inc., 406 U.S. 272 (1972), or to bring
        in a nonunion contractor as it is privileged to do, see
        Local No. 447, United Ass'n of Journeymen and Apprentices
        of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (Malbaff
        Landscape), 172 NLRB 128 (1968), makes no sense. In other
        words, as employers disorganize themselves, often in
        order to evade responsibilities imposed on direct
        employers, the definition of who is the
        &quot;employer&quot; and the restrictions on secondary
        pressure must correspondingly be refashioned. </p>
        <p>Indeed, if the employees of these intermediate
        contractor firms are, in fact, to enjoy organizational
        rights, those employees should enjoy at least one
        additional right: the right to preferential hiring in the
        event their employer's contract is terminated and a new
        contractor is brought in to do the work. The District of
        Columbia has enacted such a law (which was held by the
        D.C. Circuit in Washington Serv.Contractors Coalition v.
        District of Columbia, No. 94-7143 (D.C. Cir., May 12,
        1995), not to be preempted by the NLRA), and President
        Clinton has, by Executive Order No. 12,933, 59 Fed.Reg.
        53559, established a like requirement for contracts
        covered by the Service Contract Act. These provide useful
        models for other jurisdictions to follow. </p>
        <p>Other legal doctrines will also need to be reexamined
        if the contract workforce is to enjoy a realistic right
        to organize and bargain collectively. For example, even a
        revamped doctrine of joint employment would be of little
        utility so long as the Board continues to adhere to the
        rule that where employees are represented by more than
        one employer, all employers must consent to inclusion of
        their employees in a single unit. See, e.g., Flatbush
        Manor Care Center, 313 NLRB No. 73 (1993). This rule
        traces back to Greenhoot, Inc., 205 NLRB 250 (1973),
        where the proposed unit consisted of the employees of a
        property management company working at buildings owned by
        14 separate entities. In Greenhoot, the Board found the
        unit inappropriate on the grounds that all 15 employers
        did not consent to what the Board characterized as a
        multi-employer unit. The extension of this holding to
        cases like Flatbush Manor where only two employers are
        involved, one the supplier of temporary employees to the
        other, is dubious. </p>
        <p>Similarly, if contract workers are to be able to
        organize, the Board will have to pay careful attention to
        the application of Lechmere in situations in which
        employees of a contractor seek access to the property of
        the contractor's client. In Southern Services, Inc., 300
        NLRB 1154 (1990), enf'd, 954 F.2d 200 (11th Cir. 1992),
        the Board held that an employee of a cleaning contractor
        had the right to engage in solicitation and distribution
        protected by Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U.S.
        793 (1945), in Coca Cola's world headquarters where she
        worked on a full-time basis. But as important as it is,
        this decision did not make clear whether the holding
        would have been the same had the janitor worked at the
        building only every other night or for only part of each
        night or had she attempted to solicit Coke employees
        rather than those of her employer. As the number of
        service contract and other contingent workers multiplies,
        so too will the variations on the fact pattern in
        Southern Services. </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p align="center">* * * </p>
<p>Clearly, the necessary changes in the law and culture will not
come easily or quickly. But, transcending all forms of these
labor market segments is a set of concerns that arguably should
spur a search for common ground between labor and management. </p>
<p>The proliferation of automated technologies, together with the
continuing impact of foreign competition with cheap labor
markets, has led some to predict that over the next quarter
century, we will witness the elimination of the blue collar, mass
assembly-line worker from the production process. </p>
<p>Moreover, the theory that those losing jobs in the
manufacturing sector will be generally absorbed into the service
sector is losing currency as it is becoming clear that service
jobs are, themselves, not invulnerable either to off shore
outsourcing (e.g., telephone operators, data processors) or to
automated technology (e.g., bank tellers, office secretaries). </p>
<p>Nor is it realistic to expect the new &quot;knowledge
sector&quot; to absorb more than a fraction of the unemployed and
underemployed casualties of this transformation. As a result, the
widening gap between the haves and have nots will only continue
to grow. </p>
<p>As the trend accelerates, certain possibilities for a labor-
management accommodation emerge. For one thing, although
corporations may be enjoying short-term gains from present wage
stagnation, downsizing, outsourcing and casting off of permanent
employees, the longer term effects include a workforce with
considerably diminished consumer purchasing power. In some
industries, corporations are already acknowledging the adverse
effects of this trend. </p>
<p>Furthermore, as employers are contributing into pension funds
on behalf of fewer and fewer &quot;employees,&quot; the forced
savings pool that has for many years constituted a primary
financing source of capital investments in our economy, will
gradually be depleted. </p>
<p>At the same time as employers are coming face-to-face with the
disadvantages of the union-free environment they have so long
sought, employers are also rediscovering the contributions to
productivity, quality and efficiency that can be gained from a
truly empowered workforce with an independent voice in the
workplace. </p>
<p>All of this should lead an enlightened management to place
less currency on resisting unionization and other legitimate
forms of independent employee representation, and to join labor
in advocating strong labor standards and effective labor law for
all four of the labor market segments that exist today and will
exist tomorrow.</p>

<h2 align=center>AFL-CIO WELCOMES REPUBLICAN RETREAT <br>
ON JOB SAFETY BILL</h2>
<p align=center>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney issued the following statement in response to Cass 
Ballenger's announcement reported in today's Charlotte Observer that the North Carolina 
Representative has shelved his job safety overhaul proposal (H.R. 1834): </p>
<p>Ballenger's announcement that he is abandoning his efforts to overhaul the nation's job safety laws is 
a victory for American working families. Local union activists should take pride in today's 
announcement. It has been their efforts to hold Washington accountable that stopped this legislation 
to cut safety and health protections for 100 million American workers. </p>
<p>Extreme measures to strip workers of their rights and to weaken the government's ability to enforce 
safeguards have no public support. The only proponents of this legislation are business lobbyists 
and their Republican allies. </p>
<p>This should not be viewed as an end to Republican and employer attempts to weaken job safety 
protections. Equally damaging measures in the Senate (S.1423) and Republican-sponsored budget 
cuts still pose significant threats. The AFL-CIO, its member unions and workers across the country 
will continue fighting these efforts all the way to the November elections.</p>

<h2 align="center">Statement by Richard L. Trumka<br>
Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO<br>
On The Need To Raise The Minimum Wage</h2>
<p>Last night on television, after Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole announced that the battle for the Republican nomination was
over, he said the battle for America's future was beginning. </p>
<p>By his refusal to schedule a vote on legislation raising the
minimum wage, Senator Dole has made it clear that his definition
of America's future doesn't include working families, who are
under attack as never before. His vision doesn't include workers
at the bottom of the economic ladder, who hold down full-time
jobs, but can never lift themselves out of poverty on a minimum
wage that pays just $8,500 a year. </p>
<p>The wage and wealth gap is a huge problem and the least we can
do is raise the minimum wage. Working families today are
pressured as never before and, while executive pay and corporate
profits are reaching all time highs, the minimum wage is at a
40-year low and hasn't been increased since 1989. </p>
<p>Bob Dole is the nominee who said in New Hampshire that he
didn't realize that jobs and the economy were that important. Now
that he realizes it, he should let us do something about it,
starting with this modest increase in the minimum wage. There are
steps we can take, but Senator Dole doesn't want us to take them.
Last year, 51 senators agreed that the Senate should get the
chance to vote on increasing the minimum wage. Let America's
working families have that vote.</p>

<body>
<h3 align="center">STATEMENT BY AFL-CIO PRESIDENT JOHN J. SWEENEY<br>
ON THE RECENT TERRORIST BOMBINGS IN ISRAEL </h3>
<p>I want to express my deepest condolences to the people of
Israel in the aftermath of the horrible series of bombings in the
last week that have taken so many innocent lives. </p>
<p>The American people have stood with Israel in many difficult
times through its short but troubled history these past 47 years,
and we will continue to do so as Israel wrestles with momentous
challenges and choices in pursuit of a secure and peaceful life
in a dangerous neighborhood. </p>
<p>This is a day for mourning, but in the days ahead crucial
political decisions will be made. The U.S. must do everything
possible to help Israel combat the scourge of international
terrorism. We must not allow radical extremists to hijack the
hope for peace that millions long for and for which so many,
including Yitzhak Rabin, gave their lives. </p>
<p>It's difficult to see it on a day like this, but history
ultimately is on the side of the peacemakers. Unfortunately, the
road to peace in the Middle East is a rough one that requires
those of us who believe in it to struggle and fight to bring it
about. Let us pray that day will come soon.</p>

<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO Streamlines Its Field Operations, Taps
Household Intl. to Handle Credit Card </h3>
<p><strong>UNION MEMBERS GET A BETTER CREDIT CARD DEAL,</strong> <strong>LABOR
GETS $375 MILLION OVER NEXT FIVE YEARS</strong> <strong>FOR
ORGANIZING AND OTHER NEW SWEENEY PROGRAMS</strong> </p>
<p>Miami, February 22 --- The AFL-CIO Executive Council completed
its work here today by radically changing and streamlining its
organizational structure and negotiating a new credit card
arrangement which gives its members a better deal while providing
the 13 million member federation an estimated $375 million new
dollars for organizing and other new programs over the next five
years. </p>
<p>&quot;It's a better deal for our members and its sends a good
portion of what are now the bank's profits back into our movement
so we can help build a more secure future for working
Americans,&quot; said AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney as he
announced approval to negotiate a final agreement with Household
International to switch the AFL-CIO's 2 million credit card
holders from the Bank of New York. </p>
<p>Unless the Bank of New York matches the offer from Household,
the changeover will take place February 28, 1997. </p>
<p>Under the Household proposal, the $375 million will come out
of program revenues in the form of royalty payments on
outstanding receivables, with the card rate staying at prime plus
5 percent, which currently translates into a 13.5 percent
interest rate. This rate is more than 4 percent below the
national average and compares to 17.4 percent for cards issued
members of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and
16.4 percent for members of the American Nurses' Association. </p>
<p>The Household proposal, Sweeney said, includes a &quot;grace
period&quot; card for members who pay their balance each month
and a &quot;secured card&quot; for union members with past credit
problems. Union members who owe money on other credit cards will
be able to transfer their balances to their new card and pay the
prime rate for as long as it takes to pay off the balance. </p>
<p>&quot;Household's experience as a consumer finance company
lending money to workers and their families allows the company to
approve qualified members other lenders might reject,&quot; he
said. </p>
<p>Winding up a grinding week of work, the 54-member council
matched its financial coup by approving a streamlining of its $11
million per year field operation and naming 39-year-old Teamster
education director Marilyn Sneiderman to head it. Twelve regional
offices across the country will be condensed into four to six
regions and overlapping structures will be eliminated. </p>
<p>The Council also consolidated the economic research and
employee benefits Department into a new public policy department. </p>
<p>Negotiations over the credit card, which is managed by the
federation's &quot;Union Privilege&quot; arm, have been going on
for the past fifteen months. Three bids were received, including
one from the Bank of New York. </p>
<p>&quot;We accepted the bid from Household --- an acknowledged
leader in the credit card industry --- because it maintains our
rate, pays us millions of dollars in royalties and carries
union-sensitive elements such as union neutrality, a loan program
for striking workers and buy/build union provisions,&quot;
Sweeney said, noting it is the first time the labor federation
has been able to negotiate such an agreement into one of its
benefit programs. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO receives only minor administrative costs under its
current arrangement with the Bank of New York. Sweeney said the
labor federation was able to negotiate a better deal because its
card now has a 10-year history. </p>
<p>&quot;Household was willing to share a good deal of its
program revenues because union members have proven to be the best
credit card customers in the industry,&quot; said Hans Morris of
Smith Barney, which along with the Auremma Consulting Group was
hired to guide the negotiations on behalf of the AFL-CIO.
&quot;They use their cards, they are loyal, and they pay their
bills on time.&quot; </p>
<p>Morris said the AFL-CIO members have a delinquency rate that
is half the national average. </p>
<p>Household International, through its subsidiaries, is a major
provider of consumer financial services in the United States,
Canada and the United Kingdom. Its primary businesses include
HFC, the nation's oldest consumer finance company, and Household
Bank, one of the largest issuers of private label and general
purpose credit cards in the United States. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Executive Council of the AFL-CIO
reviewed plans for a national organizing drive to rebuild its
membership base, named Karen Nussbaum, now head of the Women's
Bureau at the Department of Labor, to head a new working women's
program for labor, announced a campaign to &quot;close the
gap&quot; between rising corporate profits and dwindling worker
incomes and launched a comprehensive political and legislative
counterattack against &quot; the radical right-wingers in
Congress.&quot;</p>

</pre>
<h3 align="center">Statement by John J. Sweeney, President,
AFL-CIO, on the federal appeals court decision to overturn
President Clinton's executive order on the permanent replacement
of striking workers: </h3>
<p>Today's decision by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
to overturn President Clinton's executive order barring federal
contracts to employers who permanently replace their workers is
simply wrong as a matter of policy and of law. This ruling serves
those employers who want to wage war on workers, and hurts the
rest of us -- working families, communities, fair employers, our
nation. </p>
<p>Until President Reagan fired the air traffic controllers in
1981, it was almost unheard of for employers to punish workers
for exercising their right to strike. Everyone understood that
doing so was wrong. </p>
<p>Now, three judges appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush have
declared that firing strikers is right, and that even the
President of the United States cannot refuse to do business with
federal contractors who throw out their experienced, skilled
employees and replace them with workers who often are poorly
prepared. </p>
<p>We will fight against this decision -- and every attack on
American working families.</p>

<h3 align="center">Statement by John J. Sweeney President,
AFL-CIO On the Election of Ron Wyden to the U.S. Senate January
31, 1996 </h3>
<p>Working families and their unions made the difference in
electing the first Democratic senator from Oregon since 1962. We
put together an unparalleled political effort -- recruiting 500
union members as volunteers, dedicating 35 union staff to the
Wyden campaign full time, providing information about both
candidates' records to voters and working intensely to boost
voter turnout through more than 230,000 phone calls and 350,000
pieces of mail. In some counties, union member turnout was as
much as 11 percent higher than overall turnout levels. </p>
<p>Wyden wore the union label on his lapel and won, overcoming a
$1.1 million spending disadvantage favoring Gordon Smith as well
as historically higher turnout by Republican voters in special
elections. His election reverses Oregon's turn toward Republican
politics in 1994, when Republicans gained control of both houses
of the state legislature for the first time in 40 years. </p>
<p>The Oregon race provides a vital first chapter in a new
textbook on politics we're going to write this year, as we
recruit and train activists to build the core of a powerful new
grass-roots movement to improve the lives of American working
families.</p>

<h3 align="center">Unions Petition Justice Department to Save
Detroit Riverfront Newspaper Plant </h3>
<p>Washington, D.C. -- The AFL-CIO and striking Detroit Newspaper
unions today petitioned Attorney General Janet Reno to require
the newspapers to maintain Detroit's Riverfront newspaper
printing plant intact until she has ruled on whether the
newspapers still enjoy Joint Operating Agreement antitrust
immunity. Alleging that the Riverfront Plant is being considered
for closure or reduction in capacity, the petition asks Reno to
require the newspapers to maintain the plant as a separate and
competitive production facility until the antitrust issue is
resolved. </p>
<p>The supplemental petition amends the AFL-CIO's anti-trust
complaint to the Department of Justice made last August 15th
which alleged that Gannett Company's Detroit News and Knight
Ridder Inc.'s Detroit Free Press had forfeited their antitrust
immunity in 1992 by filing an anti-labor amendment to their Joint
Operating Agreement without public comment or the permission of
the Attorney General. </p>
<p>&quot;We will not allow Gannett and Knight Ridder to close or
downsize the Riverfront Plant and block a remedy by the Justice
Department,&quot; said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. &quot;The
Detroit Newspapers abused their monopoly for the purpose of
unionbusting, and that plant is necessary to preserve
competition.&quot; </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO's special counsel for the case, Donald Baker,
said: &quot;The Detroit Newspapers were granted a special license
to do what other competitors go to jail for -- collectively
setting the prices in newspapers and advertising. We believe they
lost that immunity and must now compete in compliance with the
Sherman Act. To do that, they need competitive printing capacity
and therefore the Riverfront Plant must be preserved
intact.&quot; </p>
<p>The petition also asks Reno to require the newspapers to
respond to the unions' original complaint. More than five months
have transpired since it was filed, during which more than 2,000
workers have remained on strike against unfair labor practices by
the newspapers.</p>

<h3 align="center">Sweeney Announces Sweeping Changes at AFL-CIO,<br>
Names Richard Bensinger to Top Organizing Post;<br>
Allison Porter to Head Organizing Institute<br>
</h3>
<p><b>Washington, DC, January 24</b> -- AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney today announced sweeping structural and program changes
for the 13 million-member labor federation, and named 45-year-old
Richard Bensinger to head a new Organizing Department charged
with leading a turnaround of the organization's long membership
slide. Bensinger, a former regional organizing director for the
Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU), has been
head of the AFL-CIO's highly successful Organizing Institute for
the past five years. He is succeeded in that post by Allison
Porter, 35, who has been deputy director of the institute since
its founding. </p>
<p>The announcements came at a special one-day meeting of the
federation's governing Executive Council three months after
Sweeney's election as president. </p>
<p>``Today marks an historic turning point for the AFL-CIO,''
Sweeney said, noting that 70 representatives from 20 different
unions served on five work groups that analyzed AFL-CIO
departments and programs for the past two months and today laid
out for the Executive Council their plans for new programs and
structural changes. </p>
<p>Creation of the new Organizing Department, which will oversee
the work of a greatly expanded Organizing Institute and
administer a $20 million organizing fund, was a key plank in
Sweeney's election platform at the AFL-CIO convention in New York
last October. Among the department's chief assignments are a
drive to improve federal and state laws and regulations governing
organizing of workers and development of a long-term program for
organizing the South and the Sun Belt. </p>
<p>In the political arena, Sweeney said that in 1996 the labor
movement will build a permanent base of at least 100 union
grassroots political and legislative activists in each
congressional district, train all field staff for political
action and flood 2,500 union activists and staff into
congressional districts for ``get-out-the-vote'' efforts during
the last six weeks of the 1996 campaign. The federation will also
create a new media fund to ``give air cover for our ground war,''
he said. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO will proceed full-speed with another key component
in the Sweeney platform by establishing a National Labor
Political Training Center to develop union campaigners, create
educational materials for members, work with affiliates and
provide polling, research and message development. </p>
<p>Sweeney also announced the start-up of a new Center for
Strategic Campaigns, which will help unions apply economic
leverage in organizing drives, bargaining campaign and strikes,
and a Worker Ownership and Governance Institute to assist unions
with employee buyouts, coping with corporate restructuring
schemes and monitoring union pension fund investment managers. He
said the AFL-CIO International Affairs Department will be
reorganized to help American workers and unions deal with the
impact of the global economy. </p>
<p>The federation's communications functions will be consolidated
and strengthened to project a ``compelling new public face for
unions.'' A four-division public affairs structure will fold in
the resources and staff of the existing Labor Institute of Public
Affairs as an ``electronic and other media'' component. Media
outreach and speechwriting and public message functions will be
beefed up and all AFL-CIO publications, including the bi-weekly
AFL-CIO News, will be revamped. To communicate quicker with its
leadership as well as key external audiences, the AFL-CIO this
week began publishing a two-page faxed update called ``WORK in
Progress.'' </p>
<p>Finally, a ``union education and training' work group
recommended a series of new programs designed to educate workers
in the ``political economy'' and to train leaders for work in
organizing, political action and strategic campaigns. </p>
<p>In addition to announcing the results of the work groups,
Sweeney briefed the Executive Council on ongoing reviews of the
federation's field structure and legal department, which has been
charged with becoming much more active in providing legal support
for organizing, strategic campaigns and regulatory and
legislative efforts. He also named Laborers' Union President
Arthur Coia chair of the Executive Council's committee on
organizing, AFSCME President Gerald McEntee chair of the
political action committee and Food and Commercial Workers
President Doug Dority chair of the public affairs committee.</p>

SAFETY AND HEALTH PROBLEM </h3>

</pre>
<p>Statement of AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney on the industry
backed National Coalition on Ergonomics' analysis of OSHA's draft
ergonomics rule: </p>
<p>The analysis released by the industry coalition is the latest
effort in its ongoing campaign to use power, money and
distortions to keep the government from protecting workers from
crippling repetitive strain injuries and illnesses. This is not
about science. It's about industry trying to rid itself of all
regulations and gut job safety protections. </p>
<p>Last summer, the Coalition - led by the American Trucking
Association and UPS - stopped the public rulemaking on OSHA's
ergonomic standard by lining up right-wing Republicans to block
publication of the proposed rule. Now, with the public frozen out
of the process, they've bought their own scientific analysis and
are claiming that ergonomic injuries and illnesses are not a
serious workplace safety and health problem in need of
regulation. </p>
<p>This is one of the grossest distortions of the truth and
demonstrations of corporate irresponsibility seen in a long time.
By employers' own reports, ergonomic injuries and illnesses
account for more than one-third of all serious workplace injures
and illnesses - over 730,000 in 1993 - and the numbers are
increasing. The trucking and courier industry - which is a leader
in this coalition - reports some of the highest rates and numbers
of ergonomic injuries and illnesses. For these employers to claim
that there is no problem and no need for an OSHA regulation to
control ergonomic hazards is simply incredible. Are they trying
to tell the hundreds of thousands of workers who are disabled by
these injuries each year that their pain and suffering doesn't
exist and that ergonomic hazards don't need to be controlled? </p>
<p>Many employers like Ford, GM, Chrysler, IBP, Masland
Industries and others have recognized that ergonomic injuries and
illnesses are a serious problem and have instituted comprehensive
control measures to prevent them. It's shameful that UPS, the
American Trucking Association, the National Association of
Manufacturers and others in the Coalition have decided to spend
millions of dollars to stop OSHA from protecting American workers
instead of acting responsibly to help to control ergonomic
hazards.</p>

<h3 align="center">Statement on Government Shutdown by John J.
Sweeney, president, AFL-CIO: </h3>
<p>Federal employees do not deserve to be treated as pawns by
House Republicans, who continue to hold current government
functions hostage in order to force long-term cuts in education,
Medicare, Medicaid and other programs that serve working families
- while they award massive tax breaks to the rich. </p>
<p>The American public must ask whether members of Congress, with
salaries of $133,600, care that thousands of federal employees
cannot pay their bills and feed their children without a
paycheck. Meanwhile, job safety and health hazards go unchecked,
children's toys are not inspected, federal housing loans are not
processed and applications for college loans and grants are
sitting on federal workers' desks. </p>
<p>To help federal workers, the AFL-CIO has worked with the
American Federation of Government Employees to create a $5
million fund to provide federal workers with low- or no-interest
loans. </p>
<p>Congress should act responsibly, in the interests of the
American taxpayers who pay their salaries and the federal
employees who do the real work of administering national
programs.</p>

<h3 align=center>JOB INJURY REPORT SHOWS SOME PROGRESS, BUT SERIOUS 
PROBLEMS REMAIN </h3>
<p>Peg Seminario, director of the AFL-CIO Department of Occupational Safety and Health, made the 
following comment on the annual report on occupational injuries and illnesses released today by the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics: </p>
<p>The 1994 BLS Annual Survey on Workplace Injuries and Illnesses contains mixed news for 
American workers. </p>
<p>The reported reduction in the workplace injury rate shows some progress in improving worker 
protection. The most significant progress was in the construction industry, which reported the 
greatest decrease and its lowest injury rate in 20 years. </p>
<p>At the same time, the number and rate of cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) caused by poor job 
design and repetitive motion continue to increase at alarming rates. In 1994, more than 332,000 
cases of CTDs were reported, an increase of 800 percent over the last decade. </p>
<p>In many high-hazard industries like meatpacking, foundries and auto assembly, overall injury and 
illness rates remain unacceptably high -- and they are increasing in some sectors. </p>
<p>Today's BLS report underscores the desperate need for an OSHA ergonomics standard to prevent 
crippling repetitive motion injuries and illnesses and for OSHA to do more to focus its efforts in 
highhazard industries. </p>
<p>It also shows that efforts of Republicans in Congress to stop OSHA's ergonomics standard and to 
slash OSHA's budget and enforcement program are wrongheaded and will leave millions of 
American workers without much needed protection.</p>

Calif. Assoc. of Public Hospitals
Hears Blunt Union Proposals .....
</pre>
<h3 align="center">IN HIS FIRST SPEECH TO A HEALTH CARE GROUP AS
AFL-CIO PRESIDENT, JOHN SWEENEY SAYS UNIONS MUST BE &quot;FULL
PARTNERS&quot; IN RESTRUCTURING </h3>
<p>WASHINGTON, DC, December 11 --- Last Friday in his first
speech to a health care organization since his October election,
John Sweeney, the new president of the AFL-CIO, laid out a set of
guidelines for labor-management cooperation in hospital
restructuring in the kind of blunt terms that have come to
characterize his leadership of the 13 million member labor
federation. </p>
<p>&quot;I can't think of a place where management needs labor as
a partner more than in public health,&quot; he told the
California Association of Public Hospitals in San Francisco. </p>
<p>&quot;Our unions know that we face drastic cuts in funding, no
matter how successful we are at lobbying, and we know that means
we all face tough choices. But we will not sit silent seeing
families ripped from their roots while many of the experts who
got us into this mess in the first place exclude us from the
decisions affecting our future.&quot; </p>
<p>Calling for health care workers to be treated as &quot;full
partners&quot; in developing proposals for hospital
restructuring, he said principles guiding labor would be in the
best interest of public hospitals as well as workers and
consumers. &quot;We want serious consideration of alternatives to
privatization and closures, such as the creation of public health
authorities,&quot; he said, after predicting that 1.7 million
health care workers stand to lose their jobs if Republican cuts
in Medicare and Medicaid are adopted. </p>
<p>&quot;We want restructuring proposals to recognize the rights
of health care workers and their unions, as well as the right of
unorganized workers to unionize without management interference
or coercion. And we want communities, as well as workers and
their unions, fully involved in deciding strategies and tactics
for the actual restructuring plans.&quot; </p>
<p>Sweeney coupled his guidelines with a re-statement of labor's
commitment to public health. &quot;We cannot and must not allow
the violent forces now battering our health care system to damage
our mutual commitment to the mission of public health,&quot; he
said. &quot;And that mission is to provide high quality medical
care to everyone who needs it, no matter how poor they are, no
matter how old, no matter how sick, no matter what color and no
matter what their immigration status.&quot; </p>
<p>Sweeney, who for 15 years was president of the Service
Employees Union, which represents 475,000 health care workers,
used the recent Los Angeles County fiscal crisis as an example of
the difficulties faced by unions representing health care
workers. </p>
<p>&quot;Early on, we offered to cooperate and we were willing to
help get federal and state relief if worker and consumer issues
could be addressed. Unfortunately, the county manager tried to
close us out of the decisions and we had to spend weeks and weeks
in the streets and in the media to get our concerns
addressed.&quot; </p>
<p>Sweeney said that after elected county officials took control
and created a special task force, union needs were addressed and
he was able to successfully press the Clinton Administration for
help. But, he said, the county is now being unreasonable in
making the union re-sign its own members in 29 clinics that are
being privatized as a part of the Los Angeles County
restructuring plan. </p>
<p>&quot;To preserve bargaining rights for the workers who are
our members, you made us go door-to-door and have them sign union
cards. We signed up a majority in six of the first seven clinics.
Now we ask that you sit down with us and help figure out a way to
continue union representation without having to drain our
treasury and exhaust our organizers.&quot; </p>

<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO CONDEMNS SENATE JOB SAFETY BILL THAT
EXEMPTS THREE-QUARTERS OF EMPLOYERS FROM INSPECTIONS </h3>
<p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 AFL-CIO President John Sweeney today
condemned Senate bill, S.1423, that would weaken the nation's job
safety laws, citing a new finding that 73 percent of the nation's
employers would be exempt from Occupational Safety and Health
Administration inspections under the Republican Senate plan. </p>
<p>Senate Democrats released statistics indicating that 3 out of
every 4 U.S. employers would automatically be exempted from
generally scheduled OSHA inspections. OSHA uses such inspections
to target the nation's most hazardous workplaces. </p>
<p>``This bill would let even hazardous employers off the hook,
denying the benefits of OSHA protections to some forty million
workers,'' he said. Sweeney called the bill ``bad public policy''
because it would weaken safety and health protections for workers
who need them the most. </p>
<p>Many exempted employers are in some of the nation's most
dangerous industries. ``This means that even employers in very
hazardous areas like meatpacking, shipbuilding, foundries and
construction would be exempted without demonstrating a true
commitment to improving job safety and health conditions,''
Sweeney noted. </p>
<p>``These provisions destroy the foundation of America's job
safety law. Inspections and strong enforcement have led to
significant decreases in job fatalities and injuries in areas
where OSHA has focused its resources. This progress would be
reversed and more workers would be killed or injured,'' he said. </p>
<p>The Senate bill requires OSHA to exempt employers if the
workplace has been reviewed by a state consultant or other third
party, or if the workplace has had no fatalities in the last year
and has fewer lost work days due to injuries than the average for
the employer's industry. Employers would also be exempted if they
have fewer than ten employees and are in so-called ``safe''
industries or if they operate a farming operation. </p>
<p>The statistics cited by Democratic senators include only those
employers exempted based on the number of employees and the lost
workday injury rates. Thousands more employers would be exempt
under the third party certification criteria. </p>
<p>AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez Thompson, in her
testimony opposing the bill last week, noted that the bill would
``drastically limit worker rights and protections, change the
basic structure of the OSHA law, and redefine the government's
role in overseeing workplace safety.'' </p>

<h3 align="center">New AFL-CIO Leadership Launches National
Campaign to Defeat Republican Budget Cuts Grass-roots Action and
Tough Ads Drive Effort </h3>
<p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 --- Buoyed by a national poll showing the
vast majority of Americans oppose the Republican budget, the
AFL-CIO today launched a million-dollar advertising and
grass-roots lobbying campaign to &quot;hold members of Congress
individually and jointly accountable for the choices they are
making.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;All across the country, polls show, Americans rejected
Newt Gingrich's budget-cut-for-tax-trade-giveaway,&quot; AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney told a news conference. &quot;And they
flatly rejected the notion of a budget compromise for the sake of
compromise.&quot; </p>
<p>Sweeney unveiled a new series of television and radio
commercials targeting members of Congress who voted for the
Gingrich budget Clinton is expected to veto this week. The
commercials will air over the next week in 22 congressional
districts, backed up by additional national television ads. </p>
<p>The labor federation last week sent more than one million
pieces of mail to active members and retirees in the targeted
districts, asking them to call their representatives and mail a
card indicating their support to the president. Phone calls will
be made to more than hal a million households to follow up on the
direct mail. </p>
<p>Grassroots political action taking place in a total of 55
congressional districts in 30 states will include local press
conferences, leafletting, phone banks, letter-writing campaigns,
rallies, community meetings and visits to congressional offices. </p>
<p>&quot;This new campaign follows an effort that has already
yielded 82,000 calls to Congress from mid-October to midNovember,
and almost 270,000 calls since mid-February&quot; Sweeney said. </p>
<p>The GOP budget bill passed by Congress and now on the
president's desk cuts Medicare by $270 billion and raised
Medicare premiums for seniors by $500 a year. The Medicare cuts
will be used for a tax break that will primarily benefit people
who already make more than $100,000 a year. </p>
<p>Sweeney said that a poll conducted two weeks ago for the
AFL-CIO by Peter Hart Research showed the majority of Americans
are more likely to trust President Clinton and the Democrats on
budget issues. And they believe Republicans, he said, are
promoting the wrong kind of change by cutting programs such as
Medicare, Medicaid and student loans. </p>

<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT
CHAVEZ-THOMPSON CONDEMNS SENATE JOB SAFETY BILL </h3>
<p>In her first appearance before Congress as AFL-CIO executive
vice president, Linda Chavez-Thompson condemned Senate attacks on
the nation's job safety laws. </p>
<p>Testifying before the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, Chavez-Thompson said that recently introduced
legislation to overhaul the Occupational Safety and Health Act
would &quot;drastically limit worker rights and protections,
change the basic structure of the OSHA law and redefine the
government's role in overseeing workplace safety.&quot; </p>
<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Reform and Reinvention Act
(S. 1423) was introduced by Sens. Nancy L. Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and
Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) The bill would take away workers' rights to
have OSHA investigate serious workplace hazards, shift OSHA's
focus away from enforcement toward voluntary compliance and
exempt large numbers of employers from safety and health
inspections. </p>
<p>&quot;Workers in this country still suffer a terrible toll of
workplace injury and death,&quot; Chavez-Thompson said.
&quot;Each year, more than 55,000 workers die from job hazards, 7
million are injured and 60,000 permanently disabled.&quot; Noting
that the legislation fails to respond to the significant dangers
workers face, Chavez-Thompson said &quot;this Congress has
instead decided to respond to those in the business community who
have raised objections to the OSHA law. In our view, business's
interests -- not workers' interests or the national interest --
are driving the legislative agenda.&quot; </p>
<p>In urging senators to reject the bill, Chavez-Thompson
responded to characterizations of S. 1423 as a moderate measure.
This bill &quot;is by no means a moderate proposal. The
provisions of S. 1423 go right to the heart of the only
protections that workers have . . . they weaken OSHA enforcement,
limit workers' rights (and will result) in more workplace
injuries, illnesses and deaths, and less safety and health
protections for workers.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The bill breaks the promise made 25 years ago to the
workers of this country that the government would assure safe and
healthful working conditions. Workers in this country need more
protection, not less.&quot;<br>

Research Associates, Inc. conducted for the AFL-CIO. President
Bill Clinton, they say, should reject any budget that gives tax
breaks to corporations, cuts Medicare, Medicaid and education, or
allows employers to take money out of pension funds for other
purposes. </p>
<p>Americans in every age group, educational category, and region
of the country are now more likely to trust President Clinton and
the Democrats over the Republicans on the budget. Women are
especially likely to hold this view, favoring President Clinton
and the Democrats by a 53 to 28 percent margin. </p>
<p>Americans reject the Republican contention that they are doing
what is necessary to get government under control. By a margin of
58 to 36 percent, they believe Republicans are &quot;going too
far with this budget&quot; amd advancing &quot;the wrong kind of
change,&quot; rather than &quot;making the tough decisions needed
to get government under control and put our fiscal house in
order.&quot; This view is held even by southerners (55 to 42
percent), men (53 to 41 percent), and upper income voters (54 to
43 percent). Independents fall away from Republicans on this
question by a margin of 58 to 28 percent. </p>
<p>The poll, conducted November 15 - 19, shows that Americans do
not favor a compromise at any price. For a series of Republican
budget proposals, they were asked if &quot;President Clinton
should accept this provision in order to get the budget
passed.&quot; </p>
<ul>
    <li>Eighty-six percent say President Clinton should reject a
        budget if it includes the Republican proposal that allows
        corporations to take money out of their employees'
        pension funds for other purposes. </li>
    <li>Eighty-one percent say Clinton should reject a budget if
        it includes the Republican proposal that gives large new
        tax breaks to big corporations and wealthy individuals.
        Even Republicans, by a 63 to 27 percent margin, say
        Clinton should reject a budget that includes these
        breaks. </li>
    <li>Seventy-three percent say the President should reject any
        budget that makes major cuts in Medicaid, and 71 percent
        say he should reject a budget if it contains major
        Medicare cuts. Adults under age 35 are as likely to feel
        this way about Medicare cuts as other members of the
        public. </li>
    <li>Seventy-two percent say President Clinton should not
        accept any budget that cuts the student loan program, and
        71 percent say he should reject a budget if it makes
        major cuts in federal support for public education. </li>
    <li>Sixty-five percent want the President to reject any
        budget that reduces enforcement of occupational safety
        and health protections. </li>
    <li>By 59 to 29 percent, Americans say the President should
        reject the budget if it weakens his order to prevent
        government contractors from permanently replacing
        striking workers. And by 54 to 33 percent, they say he
        should reject a budget if it includes the Republicans_
        proposals to weaken laws against unfair labor practices
        by employers. </li>
</ul>
<p>The poll surveyed a representative cross section of 801
Americans age 18 or older; the margin of error is +3.5%.</p>

<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO President Announces More Key Staff
Changes </h3>
<p>WASHINGTON, NOV. 16 -- New AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
announced today that Steve Rosenthal will be the federation's new
political director, beginning December 1. Rosenthal is currently
associate deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor, where
he is a key advisor to Labor Secretary Robert Reich on
labor-management issues. He served previously as deputy political
director at the Democratic National Committee, with
responsibility for the party's nationwide 1992 coordinated
campaign. For 12 years, he held key positions in the labor
movement with the Communications Workers of America, getting his
start in state and local political work. </p>
<p>``Steve will head up the AFL-CIO's political work, with
responsibility for implementing the political goals laid out in
our platform for change,'' said Sweeney. Reinvigorating the grass
roots capacity of the AFL-CIO by ``building a powerful,
progressive national movement of working people'' was one of the
highest priorities of Sweeney's successful insurgent campaign to
lead the 13 million member labor federation. </p>
<p>Rosenthal rounds out the top government affairs team which
includes Gerald Shea, who will serve Sweeney as assistant to the
president for government affairs, and Peggy Taylor, AFL-CIO
legislative director. </p>
<p>``Steve Rosenthal will be a valuable asset in the new
leadership's mission to revitalize the nation's union movement,''
commented Secretary Reich.</p>

<p>We condemn Republican Congressional leaders for using Federal

the wishes of the American people. And we commend President
Clinton for standing firm against massive cuts in Medicare,
Medicaid, student loans and other vital programs: 61 percent of
the voters want him to reject the Republican budget. The AFL-CIO
will support the locked-out workers with every resource at our
command and we will resist this attempt at budget blackmail with
every weapon at our disposal. </p>

<h4 align="center">First Washington appearance by new AFL-CIO
Executive Vice President<br>
Linda Chavez-Thompson is Wednesday, Nov. 8, across from the White
House. <br>
</h4>
<h3 align="center">Chavez-Thompson Leads Rally Against Proposed
GOP Budget </h3>
<p>Linda Chavez-Thompson, the AFL-CIO's new executive vice
president and the first person of color to hold an executive
office at the 13-million-member AFL-CIO, will make her first
Washington appearance at a noon rally on Wednesday, Nov. 8, in
Lafayette Park. She will lead the crowd in voicing support for
President Clinton's commitment to veto the proposed GOP budget. </p>
<p>Chavez-Thompson was elected a top officer of the labor
federation last month, part of the AFL-CIO's new leadership team
that also includes President John J. Sweeney and
SecretaryTreasurer Richard Trumka. The team was elected following
a sixmonth campaign to bring ``a new voice for American
workers.'' </p>
<p>Sweeny, Trumka and Chavez-Thompson are working to rebuild the
labor movement through major organizing initiatives, the creation
of a powerful grassroots political movement of working people and
diversifying the leadership. </p>
<p>At the budget rally, other speakers will include Democratic
House Leader Richard Gephardt; Marion Wright Edeleman, president
of the Children's Defense Fund; and leaders from consumer,
farmer, senior, Latino and other organizations. </p>
<p>Working people, seniors, students and others would be hit hard
under the Republican budget plan, which cuts Medicare by $270
billion, slashes job safety and health, cuts education and other
programs working families rely on, all to give a $245 billion tax
cut to the wealthy.</p>

<h3 align="center">New AFL-CIO President Criticizes Senate
Failure on Minimum Wage Resolution</h3>
<p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney today expressed outrage at
the U.S. Senate's failure to muster the 60 votes needed to
provide for consideration of a resolution calling for debate and
a vote on raising the minimum wage by the end of this legislative
session. </p>
<p>``The Senate's failure to even allow a vote on increasing the
minimum wage while rushing to give a $224 billion tax break to
large corporations and wealthy individuals speaks volumes about
whose side they're on,'' said Sweeney, who was elected president
of the AFL-CIO Wednesday, at the labor federation's convention in
New York. </p>
<p>Working families have suffered a steady loss in real wages
over the past decade. Minimum wage workers today earn less as a
percentage of average hourly earnings than at any time in the
last 40 years. </p>
<p>``America needs a pay raise,'' said Sweeney. ``Instead they
got the cold shoulder from most Republicans in the Senate.'' </p>
<p>``The more than 13 million members of AFL-CIO unions will know
who voted against even considering an increase in the minimum
wage. This vote will be a cornerstone of the massive coordinated
political education campaign I will have the federation launch
next year.'' </p>
<p>The Clinton administration is committed to increasing the
$4.25 federal minimum wage by 90 cents over two years to $5.15. </p>

<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO to Congress: Don't Break Promise to
Seniors </h3>
<p>With the House of Representatives moving toward a vote on
Medicare, the AFL-CIO is reminding Republican members of Congress
that working people oppose the GOP's plan to slash Medicare and
raise premiums for seniors. Television and radio ads aimed at 36
members of Congress go on the air today in 18 markets and will
run through October 19. The ad also will be aired on CNN, for a
total buy of nearly $1.2 million. </p>
<p>The ads feature Ron Collins, a telephone worker, who notes
that the Republican plan will cut Medicare by $270 billion and
raise annual premiums for seniors by some $500, all to give a
$245 billion tax break to the rich. Both the television and radio
ads encourage working families to use the AFL-CIO's toll-free
number to call their congressional representative and make
certain their voices are heard. </p>
<p>The television and radio ads complement the grassroots
activities of local union members, including phone banks,

<h1 align="center">AFL-CIO: Workers Shut Out Under ``Team Act'' </h1>
<p>AFL-CIO President Tom Donahue issued this comment following
the House vote on the Teamwork for Employees Act: </p>
<p>We applaud the 202 members of the House of Representatives who
stood up to the Republican leadership and voted to reject the
so-called ``teamwork in the workplace'' offered by the GOP.
Despite a 1990s label, this is actually an attempt to bring back
the company unions that historically many employers used so well
to block workers' rights on the job. </p>
<p>Today's vote means that the veto promised by President Clinton
will be sustained should the bill reach his desk. </p>
<p>Under this bill, a company can set up the employees'
organization, pick the employees' representatives, set the
agenda, determine the outcome, and finally, abolish the
organization if and when the outcome isn't to the employer's
liking. </p>
<p>This kind of thinking doesn't fool anyone. Without changing
existing labor law, employers and workers already can take full
advantage of all forms of employee involvement, partnership and
teamwork. The only thing current law doesn't allow is employer
domination of employee representatives.</p>

          New AFL-CIO TV Ads Answer GOP Medicare Plan;<br>
                Coalition Ads Attack Program Cuts<br>
<br>
     The AFL-CIO will air a new round of television ads blasting<br>
the Republican Medicare plan for raising costs and cutting benefits<br>
for working families in order to fund a tax cut for the rich. <br>
<br>
     The two ads are set to air on CNN and five Washington, D.C.,<br>
TV stations beginning Saturday, Sept. 16.<br>
<br>
     The spots are part of a series of ads that appeared in<br>
selected congressional districts over the past four congressional<br>
recesses, spotlighting the Republican Congress's plans to cut<br>
programs that working families rely on so they could pay for a tax<br>
cut that primarily benefits the wealthiest Americans. <br>
<br>
     The ads will air through Sept. 24 on CNN's Daybreak, Daytime,<br>
Inside Politics, Moneyline, Crossfire and Larry King Live programs,<br>
as well as on local Washington, D.C. stations. <br>
<br>
     This $250,000 media buy supplements the nearly $2.5 million<br>
the federation has spent this year on media ads as part of its<br>
Stand UP for America's Working Families campaign to focus attention<br>
on the need for good jobs, good wages, health and safety and a real<br>
voice on the job.<br>
<br>
     Also airing now are ads sponsored by the Save America's<br>
Families Coalition which demonstrate the impact of Medicare cuts on<br>
a family confronting the cost of caring for an elderly parent. The<br>
spots are part of a $2 million multimedia campaign by the group of<br>
labor and public-interest organizations aimed at illustrating the<br>
devastating financial and emotional effects of major proposed<br>
budget cuts in Medicare, education, occupational health and safety<br>
and other programs.</p>

<h2 align="center">AFL-CIO Urges Public-Sector Partnerships</h2>
<p>Workers in the public sector are ready for a new kind of work
system based on partnership with state and local governments,
AFL- CIO President Tom Donahue told the Labor Secretary's Task
Force on Excellence in State and Local Government Through
Labor-Management Cooperation today. </p>
<p>Such partnerships are the best way to improve the quality and
cost-effectiveness of public-sector services, Donahue said,
pointing to the AFL-CIO's landmark 1994 report advocating the
revolutionary new work systems. </p>
<p>But excellence in delivering public services cannot be
achieved without first harnessing the knowledge and expertise of
front-line workers, which is best done when workers choose an
independent representative, Donahue said. He called it a
&quot;disgrace&quot; that 26 states that deny all or some of
their public employees -- about 5.4 million workers -- &quot;the
basic democratic right&quot; to select their own representatives
to deal with their employer. </p>
<p>&quot;Today's workers are hungry for a new way of dealing with
their employers,&quot; Donahue said, but &quot;the labor movement
has not kept up with the changing workforce and has not
sufficiently adapted to the new workplace. </p>
<p>&quot;It is the responsibility of the AFL-CIO to help this
generation -- and to develop a new generation -- of labor leaders
who are prepared to function in a very different environment
requiring expertise and skills quite different from those
required in the past,&quot; he said. </p>

</pre>
<h2 align="center">Donahue Blasts House Proposal on Trade
Benefits</h2>
<p>In the best display of chutzpah so far this session, the
Republican-controlled House Ways and Means Committee is voting on
a proposal to abolish benefits for workers who lose their jobs
because of trade, so it can provide tariff relief for
multinational corporations operating outside the United States. </p>
<p>The committee will vote on eliminating benefits for workers
under both the North American Free Trade Agreement trade
adjustment assistance program and the TAA program established in
1962, in order to extend two programs that reward corporations
with tax breaks for moving jobs overseas -- the Generalized
System of Preferences and the Caribbean Basin Economic
Development Act. </p>
<p>In a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, Labor
Secretary Robert B. Reich and White House chief of staff Leon
Panetta, AFL-CIO President Tom Donahue called on the Clinton
administration to work hard against the proposal, because
``workers deserve better treatment.'' </p>
<p>``It is difficult to understand how anyone could support a
proposal that provides tariff relief for U.S. and foreign
multinational corporations, thereby causing the loss of tens of
thousands of U.S. jobs, and then pay for these corporate tax
breaks by killing programs specifically designed to assist
American workers victimized by those corporate actions,'' Donahue
wrote. </p>
<p>He noted that TAA benefits were adopted some 33 years ago
because ``no matter what position one has on trade, everyone
agrees that U.S. workers have been, and will continue to be,
adversely affected by trade.'' </p>
<p>Donahue also pointed to the Labor Department's certification
of 35,000 workers in the past 18 months who lost their jobs
because of NAFTA as evidence that workers' interests are being
harmed, and added that another 35,000 have applied for benefits. </p>

August 24, 1995                                          at 803/244-0997<br>
<br>
              Workers in S.C. Protest Attack on Job Safety<br>
<br>
     Workers from South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia<br>
gathered outside the Pickens County (S.C.) Administration Building<br>
this afternoon to protest proposed legislation that would dismantle<br>
the nation's job safety laws.<br>
<br>
     Three members of the U.S. House of Representatives -- Reps.<br>
Cass Ballenger (R-N.C.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Charles<br>
Norwood (R-Ga.) -- held a hearing in Pickens today on Ballenger's<br>
legislation, H.R. 1834, which seeks to change the emphasis of the<br>
Occupational Safety and Health Administration from enforcement to<br>
consultation, strip away worker rights and weaken safeguards to<br>
protect workers.<br>
<br>
     Ron Hayes of Fairhope, Ala., testified before the committee<br>
about the need for strong job safety protections. His knowledge was<br>
gathered first-hand after the death of his 19-year-old son,<br>
Patrick, who was sucked into corn and suffocated while working in<br>
a silo.<br>
<br>
     &quot;Patrick was a hard worker and a good employee,&quot; Hayes told<br>
the panel. &quot;He did as his supervisors told him -- and he was killed<br>
for it. I am still haunted by the pain I saw in Patrick's face when<br>
-- after five-and-a-half hours -- the rescue crews finally pulled<br>
his body out of the bin.<br>
<br>
     &quot;Patrick's company thought they could get away with breaking<br>
the law because OSHA already had so few inspectors to enforce<br>
health and safety protections -- protections that are supposed to<br>
save lives,&quot; Hayes said. &quot;When businesses are allowed to take that<br>
chance, people die.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Hayes urged the lawmakers to strengthen job safety and health<br>
agencies, not weaken them through legislation such as H.R. 1834 and<br>
the House-passed Labor, Education and Health and Human Services<br>
appropriations measure.<br>
<br>
     Working men and women across the country are using a national<br>
media campaign to focus attention on Republican members of Congress<br>
for their attacks on job safety protections, Medicare and other<br>
programs that assist working families. Television ads that are part<br>
of a million-dollar buy are running in the Greenville-Spartanburg,<br>
S.C., area.</p>

<title>PR 08/22/95 Workers to Protest Congressional Attack on Job Safety</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<p>PRESS ADVISORY CONTACT: Barbara Kelley, 803/244-0997<br>
August 22, 1995 or G.O. Smoak, 803/798-8300<br>
<br>
Workers to Protest Congressional Attack on Job Safety<br>
<br>
Workers from three southern states will converge on a<br>
congressional hearing in Pickens, S.C., Aug. 24 to say that pending<br>
legislation to weaken job safety provisions is not acceptable.<br>
<br>
Three members of a U.S. House Economic and Educational<br>
Opportunities subcommittee will conduct the hearing. They are Reps.<br>
Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Rep. Charles Norwood (R-Ga.) and panel<br>
Chairman Cass Ballenger (R-N.C.), the author of H.R. 1834, &quot;The<br>
Safety and Health Improvements and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995.&quot;<br>
Workers from all three states will attend the 2 p.m. hearing<br>
Thursday at the Pickens County Administration Building in Pickens,<br>
S.C.<br>
<br>
Ballenger's H.R. 1834 would undercut the nation's job safety<br>
laws by changing the emphasis of job safety agencies like OSHA from<br>
enforcement to consultation, by stripping away worker rights and by<br>
weakening safeguards that protect workers.<br>
<br>
Each year, more than 55,000 Americans die because of workplace<br>
hazards, while 7 million more are injured. Where such agencies as<br>
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration have focused<br>
their resources, the number of deaths and injuries has fallen. The<br>
message to the hearings is that America's workers seek to extend<br>
safety and health protections, not weaken them. <br>
<br>
Ron Hayes of Fairhope, Ala., will testify on the death of his<br>
19-year-old son, Patrick, who was &quot;walking the corn&quot; in a huge<br>
grain elevator while machinery was engaged beneath him. He was<br>
sucked down and suffocated in the corn. Hayes has formed a national<br>
organization of family members of workplace victims.<br>
<br>
Working men and women across the country are using a national<br>
media campaign to focus attention on Republican members of Congress<br>
for their attacks on job safety protections, Medicare and other<br>
programs that assist working families. Television ads that are part<br>
of a million-dollar buy are running in the Greenville-Spartanburg,<br>
S.C., area.<br>
###<br>

Mestrich in the AFL-CIO Department of Occupational Safety and<br>
Health at 202/637-5210, or Colleen O'Neill in the AFL-CIO<br>

<title>PR 08/21/95 Action Update</title>

<body>
<p>                                    AFL-CIO Action Update<br>
                                    Monday, Aug. 21, 1995<br>
<br>
       LEGISLATIVE -- At a news conference this morning, AFL-CIO<br>
President Tom Donahue unveiled a series of television and radio ads<br>
-- a media buy totaling nearly $1 million -- targeting Republican<br>
legislators who have voted to slash worker protections and programs<br>
to instead serve their wealthy business benefactors. <br>
<br>
       In the ads, Ron Hayes, whose 19-year-old son was killed on the<br>
job, laments that the House has slashed job safety and health<br>
protections and many other programs that working families count on.<br>
Hayes was at the news conference with Donahue this morning.<br>
<br>
       The ads will run in 26 targeted congressional districts, many<br>
of which will feature press conferences by local union leaders held<br>
simultaneously with the Donahue event, the biggest expansion yet of<br>
the federation's Stand UP campaign. The ads will continue for two<br>
weeks, then move onto national and Washington, D.C., media as the<br>
lawmakers return after Labor Day. <br>
<br>
       The ad concludes: ``Tell Congress to stop pandering to big<br>
business and the rich and stand up for America's Working<br>
Families.'' <br>
<br>
<br>
       SOLIDARITY -- Donahue sent letters to retail chains that are<br>
still advertising in the Detroit News-Free Press scab paper,<br>
warning the advertisers that the AFL-CIO will organize leafleting<br>
at their outlets telling customers about their complicity with the<br>
union-busting efforts of management. The AFL-CIO also petitioned<br>
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to declare that the joint<br>
operating agreement for the News and Free Press is illegal and not<br>
protected from antitrust challenges. In asking for the Justice<br>
Department investigation, Donahue called the JOA ``an illegal<br>
price-fixing cartel.''<br>
<br>
<br>
       DIVERSITY -- AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Barbara Easterling,<br>
the pioneering first woman of American labor who is herself Exhibit<br>
A in diversity, will be among the featured speakers at an Oct. 20-<br>
21 conference in New York City, the first ever joint session for<br>
federation support groups. AFL-CIO President Tom Donahue launched<br>
the conference on Aug. 2, his first full day as president of the<br>
AFL-CIO in order to emphasize the priority he puts on full<br>
participation by women, people of color and youth. The session will<br>
be held in New York Oct. 20-21 in advance of the AFL-CIO<br>
convention. Also addressing the groups -- which include the Asian<br>
Pacific American Labor Alliance, the A. Philip Randolph Institute,<br>
the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, the Coalition of Labor<br>
Union Women, FRONTLASH and the Labor Council for Latin American<br>
Advancement -- will be Lenore Miller, chair of the civil rights<br>
committee; John Sturdivant, chair of the committee on full<br>
participation; and Linda Chavez-Thompson, an AFSCME vice president<br>
and a vice president of the federation.<br>
<br>
<br>
       POLITICAL ORGANIZERS -- Next week is the launch of a critical<br>
phase of Susan Washington's vital work in arming union sisters and<br>
brothers with the tools they need to be more effective in lobbying<br>
and political action. Washington, who has an extensive background<br>
in union education, was tapped by Donahue to put together the team<br>
needed to fulfill Donahue's goal to ``intensify AFL-CIO political<br>
efforts, including training 500 grass roots labor lobbyists over<br>
the next 12 months.'' Washington starts Aug. 27-28, with AFL-CIO<br>
staff, and she expects to devise the model program through<br>
consultation with affiliate staff -- directors of education,<br>
legislative and COPE departments -- as well as with the retiree<br>
groups and other activists well noted for making the program go in<br>
the past. <br>
<br>
       ``From New England, from Colorado and from Iowa, we've got the<br>
makings of a model program,'' Washington says, ``what we need now<br>
is to add the unique experiences of our affiliates who now have<br>
very effective grass-roots action programs.'' Washington says the<br>
first step is a manual that organizes everyone's best<br>
recommendations, and then it's into the field <br>
<br>
       In appointing Washington, Donahue said the program she's<br>
spearheading &quot;will be the most intense political effort in the<br>
history of the federation -- and I am determined that it will be<br>
the most successful. Make no mistake about it, if we falter here,<br>
all else falters.&quot;          <br>
<br>
<br>
       TOM on TV  -- Donahue is preparing to meet Service Employees<br>
President John Sweeney, who is running for AFL-CIO president at the<br>
October convention, in a joint appearance before a California AFL-<br>
CIO conference on Thursday, Aug. 24. Joint appearances also are<br>
scheduled on National Public Radio Aug. 30, Meet the Press (NBC)<br>
Sept. 3 and MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour (PBS) on Sept. 4.<br>

<br>
Remarks of AFL-CIO President Tom Donahue on labor's congressional<br>
recess campaign against the Republican attack on working families: <br>
<br>
Since January, the Republicans in Congress have launched an<br>
all-out assault on America's working families -- attacking jobs,<br>
wages, health and safety, and the right to a real voice on the job.<br>
<br>
This month, this GOP attack reached a new level with the House<br>
of Representatives vote on funding for the Departments of Labor,<br>
Education and Health and Human Services. In this bill, Republicans<br>
slashed proven health and safety protections that save lives; they<br>
cut college loans for more than 4 million middle-class families;<br>
they cut back elementary and secondary education; they stripped<br>
workers of fundamental rights on the job. <br>
<br>
And they're not through yet. Republicans are plotting a raid<br>
on Medicare -- the program that retired workers and their families<br>
count on -- to the tune of some $270 billion. And where will all<br>
these so-called savings go? To help pay for a $245 billion tax<br>
break that primarily benefits big business and the wealthy, those<br>
who earn more than $200,000 a year.<br>
<br>
Stand UP for America's Working Families is the AFL-CIO's<br>
national effort to expose these Republican votes against workers<br>
and their families, and in favor of their rich friends. It's our<br>
campaign to let the American people know the truth about what the<br>
Republicans are doing in Washington, and what else they have<br>
planned. <br>
<br>
Union activists now are out working in some three dozen<br>
congressional districts, trying to meet with their member of<br>
Congress, joining town hall meetings, and taking to the streets and<br>
sidewalks, when necessary, to stand up to the actions of this<br>
Republican Congress. <br>
<br>
Backing up these activities, the AFL-CIO has placed television<br>
and radio ads in 26 targeted congressional districts. The ads tell<br>
members of Congress when they voted to cut health and safety,<br>
education and Medicare, they attacked working people back home.<br>
Union activists and supporters in those districts are holding<br>
events and news conferences like this one this week, to make sure<br>
the Stand Up message is clear. <br>
<br>
A $1 million media campaign is complementing the grassroots<br>
work of union members and their families. This message to member of<br>
Congress: to stop their attack on working families -- will be heard<br>
both in home districts starting today and nationally after Labor<br>
Day when Congress returns. <br>
<br>
And over the next 15 months, working men and women will<br>
continue to hold their elected officials accountable for every<br>
vote, for every position, for every attack on working families.<br>
<br>
####<br>
<br>
Statement of Ron Hayes<br>
AFL-CIO Press Conference<br>
August 21, 1995<br>
<br>
On October 22, 1993, my son Patrick went to work, but he never came<br>
home. That day, Patrick was crushed to death in the silo where he<br>
worked.<br>
<br>
My son was just 19 years old when he died.<br>
<br>
Before he died, Patrick said that his supervisors at the mill would<br>
sometimes tell him to do things that were unsafe and illegal. And<br>
on the day he died, Patrick was told to ``walk down the corn'' --<br>
to go to the top of the bin and scrape the kernels off the sides of<br>
the silo while an augur at the bottom slowly sucked the corn down.<br>
``Walking down the corn'' is extremely dangerous -- and it's<br>
against the law.<br>
<br>
Patrick was a hard worker and a good employee. He did as his<br>
supervisors told him -- and he was killed for it. I am still<br>
haunted by the pain I saw in Patrick's face when -- after five and<br>
a half hours -- the rescue crews finally pulled his body out of the<br>
bin.<br>
<br>
Patrick's company thought they could get away with breaking the law<br>
because OSHA already had so few inspectors to enforce health and<br>
safety protections -- protections that are supposed to save lives.<br>
<br>
When businesses are allowed to take that chance, people die.<br>
<br>
But the Republicans in Congress just voted to cut enforcement of<br>
health and safety laws even more -- to cut inspections and scrap<br>
some protections altogether. They're telling businesses that it's<br>
okay to gamble with workers' lives.<br>
<br>
But it is not okay that more than six thousand people like Patrick<br>
die at work every year.<br>
<br>
We need to make health and safety protections stronger -- not<br>
weaker. We don't need to cut OSHA -- we need to improve OSHA so<br>
that safety laws are properly enforced. That's the only way big<br>
businesses will understand that they cannot get away with breaking<br>
the law and risking people's lives.<br>
<br>
My son is gone forever -- but Congress can still save lives. They<br>
can stop cutting inspections and enforcement, stop making health<br>
and safety protections weaker -- and start protecting working<br>
people like Patrick Hayes.<br>
<br>
###<br>
<br>
FACT: The Republican assault on working families<br>
<br>
The Republican leadership in Congress is using the budget<br>
process to slash worker protections and programs that benefit<br>
working families to pay for a huge tax giveaway to the rich and big<br>
corporations.<br>
<br>
The budget resolution passed by Congress in July calls for<br>
cuts of $180 billion in Medicaid and $270 billion in Medicare, as<br>
well as $10 billion in student loans. The appropriations bill for Labor <br>
and Health and Human Services, passed by the House before the August <br>
recess, includes:<br>
<br>
* A one-third cut in Occupational Safety and Health<br>
enforcement. About half of the federal inspectors would face<br>
layoffs, and 50,000 more workplace injuries and deaths could occur<br>
each year.<br>
<br>
* A 12 percent cut in activities to prevent illegal<br>
sweatshops, child labor violations and violations of wage-and-hour<br>
laws.<br>
<br>
* A 30 percent cut in funding for the National Labor Relations<br>
Board, which could force closure of half the NLRB regional offices<br>
and increase dramatically the time it takes to resolve disputes. In<br>
addition, the bill seeks to prevent the board from seeking<br>
injunctions against the most blatant violations of the law.<br>
<br>
* A 7.5 percent cut in the Pension and Welfare Benefits<br>
Administration, which guards the pensions of more than 200 million<br>
Americans.<br>
<br>
The beneficiaries of these cuts in worker programs and<br>
protections are the well-to-do and big business. Tax legislation<br>
passed in April provides 28 percent of its benefit to the<br>
wealthiest Americans. It includes:<br>
<br>
* A reduction in capital gains taxes that would provide 58<br>
percent of the benefit to families making $200,000 a year or more.<br>
<br>
* A $500-per-child tax credit that would be available to<br>
families who make up to $250,000, who are among the wealthiest 10<br>
percent in America.<br>
<br>

<br>
####<br>
Appropriations and spending bills passed by the Republican-dominated<br>
House of Representatives do serious damage to programs that working<br>
families rely on -- like job safety and health, Medicare and education. <br>
<br>
Occupational Safety and Health<br>
<br>
House Republicans are slashing the workplace health and safety<br>
programs that benefit citizens in every state by voting for big cuts in<br>
funds for federal job safety agencies. <br>
<br>
In Illinois, for example, the number of federal inspectors who will<br>
be able to remain on the job drops from 78 to 52. With that lower number<br>
of inspectors, it will take 205 years for each workplace to be inspected<br>
just once. In New Jersey, workers will have to wait 199 years for a<br>
workplace inspection; Nebraskans will be waiting an unthinkable 280 years.<br>
The outlook for other states is equally grim.<br>
<br>
Medicare <br>
<br>
Retirees and working families will certainly see their out-of-pocket<br>
Medicare costs shoot up if the House appropriations action stands. The<br>
GOP's seven-year budget plan will cost each beneficiary an average $2,825<br>
over that period. Florida retirees will take the biggest hit -- an whopping<br>
$4,400, but seniors in California and Massachusetts will also at least<br>
$4,000 in out-of-pocket costs.<br>
<br>
This shifting of costs to retired workers and families is wrong. The<br>
Medicare programs needs some serious adjustments, most health care experts<br>
agree, but tough federal cost controls on private and public health care<br>
costs are the only real solution.<br>
<br>
Our nation must pull together to repair our health care system, and<br>
not allow industry special interests to dictate the direction that reform<br>
will take.<br>

AFL-CIO's Fight for America's Working Families<br>
<br>
AFL-CIO President Tom Donahue will meet with reporters Monday,<br>
August 21, at 10 a.m., in the AFL-CIO lobby, 815 16th St., N.W.,<br>
Washington, D.C., on the latest round in labor's campaign for<br>
America's working families.<br>
<br>
The campaign, in full swing for the August congressional recess,<br>
includes a $1 million media buy complementing the &quot;back home&quot; lobbying<br>
of union members in some three dozen congressional districts. The ads<br>
will be shown at the Donahue news conference.<br>
<br>
A mix of television and radio ads go on the air in 26 of those<br>
36 congressional districts beginning Monday, August 21 and continue<br>
for two weeks.<br>
<br>
In one of the ads, Ron Hayes, whose 19-year-old son was killed<br>
on the job, tells viewers that a recent House funding vote slashes<br>
job safety and health protections and many other programs that<br>
working families count on. The message continues: &quot;tell Congress<br>
to stop pandering to big business and the rich and stand up for<br>
America's Working Families.&quot;<br>
<br>
Members of Congress will hear that same message when they<br>
return to Congress after Labor Day, with ads placed nationally and<br>
in Washington, D.C.<br>
<br>
Union legislative action committees will meet with their<br>
senators and representatives or will join in town meetings over the<br>
recess to spotlight recent congressional actions that will cut job<br>
health and safety, Medicare and education in order to help finance<br>
a $245 billion tax cut that mostly benefits the wealthy.<br>
<br>
Stand UP for America's Working Families is the AFL-CIO's<br>
national effort to focus attention on the need for good jobs, good<br>
wages, health and safety and a real voice on the job.</p>

<title>PR 08/16/95 AFL-CIO's AFL-CIO Asks Reno to Pull Detroit Antitrust Protections</title>

August 16, 1995                                           of the AFL-CIO<br>
                                                          at 202/637-5010<br>
<br>
        AFL-CIO Asks Reno to Pull Detroit Antitrust Protections <br>
<br>
     The AFL-CIO and the unions representing Detroit newspaper<br>
employees today petitioned Attorney General Janet Reno to declare<br>
that the joint operating agreement for the Detroit News and Detroit<br>
Free Press is not protected from antitrust challenges. <br>
<br>
     In announcing the petition, AFL-CIO President Tom Donahue said<br>
the Justice Department's Antitrust Division has also been asked to<br>
investigate and take action against the two newspapers' joint<br>
operating agreement which amounts to an illegal price-fixing<br>
cartel.<br>
<br>
     The original Detroit joint operating agreement was approved by<br>
Attorney General Edwin Meese in 1988. But that agreement was<br>
significantly amended in 1992 and the new agreement has not been<br>
approved by the Attorney General. <br>
<br>
     The newspapers are relying on the amended agreement to justify<br>
their attempt to break the strike of their employees by publishing<br>
joint daily and weekend editions.  <br>
<br>
     The 2,600 employees of the News and Free Press have been on<br>
strike since July 13 after negotiations failed to produce a new<br>
agreement.<br>
<br>

<title>PR 08/15/95 AFL-CIO Announces National Campaign Against Detroit Papers</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<p>For Immediate Release Contact: Candice Johnson at the AFL-CIO<br>
August 15, 1995 202/637-5010, and George Curtin <br>
in Detroit at 313/965-1478.<br>
<br>
AFL-CIO Announces National Campaign Against Detroit Papers<br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO Strategic Approaches Committee announced a<br>
nationwide campaign against the Detroit newspapers and their parent<br>
companies, Gannett and Knight-Ridder. <br>
<br>
The campaign will draw on resources from the AFL-CIO and all<br>
of the federation's affiliated unions to coordinate activities in<br>
support of striking Detroit newspaper workers.<br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO program includes:<br>
<br>
* Ensuring strike benefits for all striking workers through a<br>
$1 million fund created by the AFL-CIO and affiliated unions.<br>
<br>
* Initiating a nationwide campaign targeting six companies<br>
that continue to place advertisements in the struck newspapers --<br>
J.C. Penney, Lord &amp; Taylor, Target, Home Depot, Hudsons, and<br>
Montgomery Ward. <br>
<br>
AFL-CIO President Tom Donahue has written these companies<br>
informing them that if they continue to advertise in the Detroit<br>
papers, union members nationwide will be alerted that these<br>
companies are attacking the Detroit unions by continuing to<br>
advertise in a scab-produced paper. <br>
<br>
* Solidarity activities at Gannett and Knight-Ridder<br>
operations nationwide. <br>
<br>
* A Labor Day mobilization in the Detroit area. <br>
<br>
``On Labor Day weekend in Detroit, we plan to send a clear<br>
message to Gannett, Knight-Ridder and to every employer just like<br>
them that we will not tolerate corporations which make record<br>
profits but set out to destroy the living standards of workers and<br>
their families,'' said Mine Workers President Richard Trumka, chair<br>
of the Strategic Approaches Committee.</p>

<title>PR 08/09/95 Easterling becomes Secretary-Treasurer</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>                         BARBARA J. EASTERLING<br>
<br>
                     Secretary-Treasurer, AFL-CIO<br>
<br>
<br>
      Barbara J. Easterling was elected Secretary-Treasurer of the<br>
AFL-CIO in August 1995, thereby becoming the first woman to hold a top<br>
post at the federation.  Easterling, 62, is also the first woman to<br>
serve as Secretary-Treasurer of the Communications Workers of America,<br>
having held that office from April 1992 to August 1995.  Before that,<br>
she served seven years as an elected Executive Vice President of the<br>
CWA.<br>
<br>
      As AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, Easterling is the federation's<br>
chief financial officer, managing all of its financial matters and its<br>
day-to-day operations.  Her duties also include conducting a complete<br>
review of AFL-CIO staff operations, recruitment and development with an<br>
eye toward increasing and insuring diversity.  Easterling is also<br>
assisting President Thomas R. Donahue in efforts to increase the AFL-CIO<br>
s commitment to organizing American workers, to institute reforms in the<br>
decision-making and governing processes of the AFL-CIO and to create the<br>
most intense grassroots political effort in the history of the<br>
federation.<br>
<br>
      Easterling serves as a member of the executive committee of the<br>
Postal, Telegraph and Telephone International (PTTI) and as the elected<br>
Secretary-Treasurer of the Regional Organization of Workers-Continental<br>
Branch of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).<br>
<br>
      Strong Union Principles: Easterling is proud to have brought to<br>
her union career the strong principles of trade unionism she learned as<br>
a child growing up in a Polish family of coal miners and rubber workers<br>
in Akron, Ohio.  Launching her career as an operator at Ohio Bell, she<br>
incorporated those principles into her own life by the time she joined<br>
CWA Local 4302 in Akron.  Easterling served the local as steward,<br>
Secretary and Vice President before accepting an appointment by Ohio<br>
governor John Gilligan to serve as Chief of the Ohio Labor Division in<br>
early 1970.<br>
<br>
      In 1973, she left state government to become a full-time CWA staff<br>
representative and later was promoted to Administrative Assistant to the<br>
Vice President of District 4.  In 1980, she was summoned to Washington,<br>
D.C., to serve as an Assistant to the President of the union -- a<br>
position she held until her election as Executive Vice President in<br>
1985.<br>
<br>
      As Secretary-Treasurer of CWA, Easterling was responsible for<br>
managing the finances and physical facilities of CWA.  She served as a<br>
member of the union's three-member executive committee as well as the<br>
strategic planning and budget committee, which allocates CWA's resources<br>
and sets program goals.  In addition to these constitutional roles, she<br>
also carried out key assignments in the areas of international affairs<br>
and oversaw the government relations and political affairs departments.<br>
<br>
      Honors and Activities: Easterling has received a broad range of<br>
honors and accolades during her union career, reflecting her wide range<br>
of interests.<br>
<br>
      She was inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame in 1985 and<br>
received the prestigious Women's Equity Action League award in 1986.  In<br>
1992, she was honored by the Midwest Labor Press Association (an<br>
affiliate of the International Labor Communications Association of the<br>
AFL-CIO) as recipient of the association's Eugene V. Debs award.<br>
Previous recipients of the Debs award have included Hubert Humphrey,<br>
Lane Kirkland and the presidents of various international unions.<br>
<br>
      Easterling is an at-large member of the Democratic National<br>
Committee, Vice Chair of the National Alliance to End Homelessness,<br>
Trustee of the National Planning Association (NPA), vice chair of the<br>
NPA's Global Economic Council, and has been a leader in the fight to<br>
raise money for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation.  She also serves on the<br>
board of directors of the National Democratic Institute for<br>
International Affairs and served on the executive boards of the AFL-CIO<br>
s Department of Professional Employees and the Industrial Union<br>
Department.</p>

<title>PR 07/19/95 Clinton Affirmative Action Stand Praised </title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                          CONTACT: Richard Womack<br>
July 19, 1995                                           of the AFL-CIO<br>
                                                       at 202/637-5270<br>
<br>
                Clinton Affirmative Action Stand Praised<br>
<br>
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland made the following comment on<br>
President Clinton's statement on affirmative action:  <br>
<br>
      President Clinton has taken a welcome step in reaffirming the<br>
use of affirmative action to further equal rights and equal<br>
opportunity for all Americans. The AFL-CIO's support of effective<br>
affirmative action -- particularly in the employment context -- is<br>
longstanding and unequivocal. <br>
<br>
      One of the fundamental principles of the American society is<br>
opportunity for all -- a nation where honest, hard working people<br>
can get a job for which they are qualified and provide for their<br>
families, without fear of being denied their livelihood or stymied<br>
because of race, gender, national origin, disability or religious<br>
beliefs.<br>
            <br>
      Our society has not yet attained the ideal of being color<br>
blind or gender neutral. The hard reality is that a long history of<br>
discrimination cannot be made to disappear in a few short years.<br>
And, the equally hard reality is that for the foreseeable future,<br>
affirmative action programs are necessary and essential to<br>
correcting the failures of the past and improving the prospects for<br>
the future.<br>
<br>
      We urge the Congress to follow the President's example and not<br>
allow  government to compromise the progress that has been made and<br>
can be made by weakening its critical affirmative action role.</p>

<title>PR 07/12/95 Budget Cuts Show Contempt for Workers, AFL-CIO Says </title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>For Immediate Release                            Contact: Rex Hardesty<br>
July 12, 1995                                             202/637-5010<br>
<br>
<br>
          Budget Cuts Show Contempt for Workers, AFL-CIO Says<br>
<br>
<br>
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Tom Donahue made the following comment<br>
on budget cuts by the House appropriations subcommittee:<br>
<br>
      House Republicans today once again demonstrated their contempt<br>
for working men and women.<br>
<br>
      At a time when wages and benefits are falling and when workers<br>
need a real voice on the job more than ever, the House<br>
Appropriations Subcommittee took a meat cleaver to the budget of<br>
the National Labor Relations Board, the agency charged with<br>
enforcing the legal rights of American workers to form unions.<br>
Worse still, in the guise of appropriating, the Republicans voted<br>
to stall the Labor Board's program of seeking injunctions for<br>
workers whose rights are violated.<br>
<br>
      While tens of thousands of workers are killed or maimed each<br>
year as a result of occupational accidents or occupational diseases<br>
and millions of workers are injured on the job, the House<br>
Republicans voted to slash spending on enforcement of the<br>
Occupational Safety and Health Act by one-third.<br>
<br>
      And at a time when education and training is more and more<br>
urgent for the workers of today and tomorrow, the House Republicans<br>
voted to kill or starve critical educational and training programs.<br>
<br>
      The crisis confronting America's middle class is caused by too<br>
much corporate power -- not too little. The solution lies in giving<br>
workers more of a voice in the workplace, not in taking away their<br>
democratic rights.<br>
<br>
      The AFL-CIO will continue to fight the Republican attempts to<br>
destroy the laws and programs on which working families depend.<br>
Neither we, nor the working men and women we represent, will forget<br>
the culprits who have struck this blow at working Americans.</p>

<title>PR 06/28/95  AFL-CIO Launches July 4 Lobbying, Media Campaign </title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>For Immediate Release                        Contact: Bill Wagner<br>
June 28, 1995                                        202/637-5334<br>
<br>
<br>
        AFL-CIO Launches July 4 Lobbying, Media Campaign <br>
<br>
Secretary-Treasurer Tom Donahue made the following announcement on the AFL-CIO's Stand<br>
UP Campaign:<br>
<br>
<br>
     Today, the AFL-CIO continues our effort to give voice to the working men and women<br>
whose interests are being abused in the current Congress. This part of the campaign to Stand<br>
UP for America's working families is timed to the Fourth of July recess when members of<br>
Congress will be at home.<br>
<br>
     The campaign began with the seating of the 104th Congress and has included intensive<br>
back home lobbying efforts in the previous recesses in April and for Memorial Day. Those<br>
efforts focused on a smaller number of districts and this is our biggest media effort to date.<br>
<br>
     The Fourth of July effort is in 30 congressional districts, where workers and their<br>
unions will seek meetings with members of Congress to discuss the issues with them. They<br>
will also conduct rallies, pass out leaflets and do all they can to focus attention on their needs.<br>
<br>
     Our TV and radio advertising starts today and will continue through July 8 on TV and<br>
radio -- using local TV stations, national cable TV and local radio. The ads carry a very direct<br>
message: the current Republican majority in Congress continues to be willing to pay for tax<br>
breaks for the rich by cutting the programs working families need if they're to be able to hold<br>
on to a part of the American dream -- programs like college loans, health and safety, job<br>
training, school lunches and medicare.<br>
<br>
     And working Americans will be delivering that same message in face-to-face meetings<br>
with Members of Congress who agree to meet with them.<br>
<br>
     Health and safety provides probably the best example of the distorted priorities of this<br>
Congress. Last November, working Americans did NOT vote to dismantle the job safety<br>
protections provided by the Occupational Safety and Health Act -- protections which cut<br>
workplace fatalities by more than half and cut injury and illness incidence a third in past 20<br>
years. Yet, a dismantling of OSHA is exactly what was proposed last week in the a bill<br>
introduced in the House by Representative Cass Ballenger of North Carolina. <br>
<br>
     While this is the newest and biggest of the efforts thus far in the AFL-CIO's campaign<br>
to Stand UP for America's working families. But the idea behind this Fourth of July effort is<br>
by no means new -- and it's a continuation of our efforts to insure that members of Congress<br>
have ample opportunity to hear from working Americans in their districts -- and not just from<br>
the corporate lobbyists.<br>
<br>
     The Stand UP Campaign resulted from a lot of self-examination by the Federation and<br>
our affiliated unions following last November's election. Through extensive meetings with local<br>
leadership, member polls and focus groups, we took the gauge of union members.<br>
<br>
     Many hours of discussion with union presidents and staff and all of that led to the<br>
conviction that we needed a major overhaul of our grassroots operations. The Stand UP<br>
campaign is our vehicle for reaching that goal, a grassroots campaign to hold onto a piece of<br>
the American dream for millions of working families who are already having a tough time<br>
making ends meet.<br>
<br>
     The Campaign uses home-district meetings with members of Congress and phone calls<br>
from worksites, using cellular phones and our 800 number routing system to the Capitol, to<br>
enable union working families to make their views known. To date, over 21,000 calls have<br>
been logged on our 800 number, and some 1500 union members from 60 different unions have<br>
participated in 92 meetings. Our field staff and the staff of affiliates provide the coordination<br>
and other work necessary to a successful Fourth of July effort.<br>
<br>
     The ads have been placed in 20 districts, with TV ads in six regional areas and radio<br>
in 12 markets that cover 14 congressional districts. In all, ads cost about $500,000.<br>
<br>
     The TV ads will run on local stations in Eureka, Calif.; Terre Haute, Ind.; Tulsa, Okla.;<br>
Chattanooga, Tenn.; Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas and Casper-Riverton, Wyo.<br>
<br>
     Like the local TV ads, the radio ads are customized to carry the name of the member<br>
of Congress with the AFL-CIO 800 number to the Capitol. The 12 radio markets covering 14<br>
congressional districts are Bridgeport, Conn., Atlanta; Chicago and Peoria, Ill.; Boston; Las<br>
Vegas; Rochester/Buffalo, N.Y.; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Rural Ohio Radio; Portland, Ore.;<br>
Philadelphia and Seattle.<br>
<br>
     The other districts with coordinated union member activity are in Alabama, Minnesota,<br>
Mississippi, South Carolina, Virginia and two districts in California not covered by Eureka TV.</p>

<title>PR 06/26/95 AFL-CIO Observers Find Haiti Elections Honest, Fair </title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              CONTACT: James Parks<br>
June 26, 1995                                          or Michael Byrne<br>
                                                         of the AFL-CIO<br>
                                                           202/637-5010<br>
<br>
          AFL-CIO OBSERVERS FIND HAITI ELECTIONS HONEST, FAIR<br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO issued the following statement, based on reports from seven union observers to<br>
the June 25 elections in Haiti:<br>
<br>
     Despite some initial confusion and disorganization, the Haitian legislative and municipal<br>
elections are honest and fair.<br>
<br>
     Because Haiti has very limited experience with democratic voting, it would be unfair<br>
and inaccurate to judge its elections by the same standards as those in the United States or<br>
Europe, which have longer histories of free elections.<br>
<br>
     The difficulties in the elections -- late openings, missing ballots, etc. -- were the result<br>
of inexperience, not sabotage or incompetence. The lack of widespread violence also is to be<br>
commended.<br>
<br>
     The 50 percent turnout, by any standard, is a good one and demonstrates the<br>
determination of the Haitian people to be free.<br>
<br>
     Haiti, only a few months ago, was in the grips of a repressive military regime and<br>
suffered from a lack of infrastructure and basic necessities. To have been able to conduct an<br>
election at all in such a short time is a minor miracle.<br>
<br>
     As Haiti becomes more experienced with democratic elections, the kind of problems that<br>
occurred June 25 may be expected to decrease.<br>
<br>
     The U.S. labor federation also commends the Haitian pollworkers, many of whom<br>
worked beyond what was expected, to make this election a success.</p>

<br>
                KIRKLAND TO RETIRE; DONAHUE ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY<br>
<br>
      Following is a statement by AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland<br>
announcing his retirement, effective August 1.<br>
<br>
      Also following is a letter from AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer<br>
Thomas R. Donahue to the presidents of affiliated unions announcing<br>
his intention to stand for election as president of the 13.4<br>
million-member organization.<br>
<br>
                                     # # #<br>
<br>
<br>
                      LANE KIRKLAND ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT<br>
<br>
 Lane Kirkland, President of the AFL-CIO, today made the following statement:<br>
<br>
      I intend to retire as President of the AFL-CIO on August 1, at<br>
the opening of the Executive Council meeting scheduled for that date.<br>
At that time, I will recommend to the Council the election, in<br>
accordance with the AFL-CIO Constitution, of Secretary-Treasurer<br>
Thomas R. Donahue as President of the AFL-CIO for the remainder of the<br>
term for which I was elected.<br>
<br>
      This decision stems from my own personal preferences, as well as<br>
my duty to do my best to see that the future direction of the AFL-CIO<br>
will be in the hands of one who places the solidarity and best<br>
interests of labor as a whole above other considerations.  To this<br>
end, I have persuaded Secretary-Treasurer Donahue to reconsider his<br>
own plans to retire and to withdraw his notice to that effect, and he<br>
has agreed to do so.<br>
<br>
      Tom Donahue has been an able and committed partner in the<br>
development of the programs of constructive change undertaken by the<br>
AFL-CIO during our terms in office.  To those who seek continuing<br>
change, his election will represent the appropriate measure of change.<br>
To those concerned with the preservation of the integrity of the<br>
AFL-CIO as a value shared by all affiliates, it will mean continuity.<br>
<br>
      Service in the cause of free and democratic trade unionism is a<br>
privilege; and I am secure in the conviction that I have been faithful<br>
to it.  A life spent in that service is a happy one and I regret<br>
nothing.<br>
<br>
      When talking of goals yet unmet, an old seafarer comrade-at-arms<br>
used to say: &quot;Tomorrow is also a day.&quot;  I call upon my successors to<br>
make good use of that bright day.<br>
<br>
                                     # # #<br>
<br>
                                    June 12, 1995<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To:   Members of the Executive Council<br>
      Presidents of National and International Unions <br>
<br>
Dear :<br>
<br>
      I have determined to become a candidate to succeed Lane Kirkland<br>
as AFL-CIO President.  It is my hope and desire to pull together the<br>
broadest and most diverse support within the labor movement.  The<br>
purpose of this letter is to begin in earnest the process of<br>
generating that support.<br>
<br>
      Lane advised me at the beginning of last week that he had<br>
decided to step down as AFL-CIO President.  The reports of his<br>
decision have appeared in the press and it is his intent to make a<br>
public announcement to that effect today.  Given Lane's decision I<br>
have had telephone conversations with over 65 general presidents of<br>
our 80 affiliated unions to advise them that I was considering my<br>
candidacy.  Those conversations convinced me there is an over-whelming<br>
sentiment for unity in the Federation.<br>
<br>
      By any measure, the era that Lane's retirement will bring to a<br>
close has been immensely productive: it encompasses the unification of<br>
the labor movement through the reaffiliation of the United Automobile<br>
Workers, the Mine Workers, the Teamsters, and the Longshoremen's and<br>
Warehousemen's Union; the creation of the Organizing Responsibilities<br>
Procedure, the Labor Institute for Public Affairs, the Organizing<br>
Institute, the Strategic Approaches Committee, the Union Privilege<br>
Benefit Program, the grassroots Legislative Action Committee<br>
structure, the comprehensive communications program adopted last year,<br>
and more.<br>
<br>
      I am proud to have had an active role in this record of<br>
accomplishment.  And, I am particularly proud to have been part of a<br>
process that opened up the Federation to all of its constituents; a<br>
process that has stimulated the best thinking of our affiliates and<br>
has mobilized their talents and energies.  These initiatives were not<br>
the product of a distant leadership or any narrow group but of the<br>
labor movement as a whole.<br>
<br>
      In a world that is rapidly changing, we've done our best to meet<br>
the new conditions of work and workers. By any measure, more needs to<br>
be done. The unifying theme I see -- in what no doubt appears to the<br>
public to be simply internal political disagreement -- is an<br>
intensified commitment to progressive change in all our institutions<br>
in order to better represent all union members.<br>
<br>
      That certainly is welcome; it, indeed, comes none too soon. We<br>
face the most formidable challenges as we strive to find the means to<br>
fulfill the labor movement's historical role as the authoritative<br>
voice of America's working people.<br>
<br>
      My first priority at the Federation has been to mobilize a<br>
consensus for creative innovation. I am confident that all of you who<br>
joined with me in our project on the changing nature of work and its<br>
consequences and in the extensive committee work that made all our new<br>
programs operational realities, would second that assessment. Each one<br>
of these efforts has been hard going because the problems that must be<br>
overcome are hard problems that do not yield easy answers. But it is<br>
my conviction that we have now reached the point of agreement to go<br>
forward in our task of creating an ever more dynamic, more diverse and<br>
more self-sufficient labor movement. While most of the work must be<br>
the prime responsibility of individual unions, the Federation must<br>
play a catalytic role.<br>
<br>
      The one sure means of squandering this possibility is to fall<br>
into factionalism. I see no disagreements on principle that divide us.<br>
The working men and women who depend on this movement and the millions<br>
more who seek a genuine voice on the job require that we make a common<br>
cause.<br>
<br>
      I believe I can be a significant factor in that process. I<br>
therefore seek your support.<br>
<br>
      Thank you and with every good wish,<br>
<br>
                                                Fraternally,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
                                                Secretary-Treasurer</p>

June 2, 1995                         AFL-CIO Department of Information<br>
                                                          202/637-5010<br>
<br>
               AFL-CIO Information Now Available on the Internet<br>
<br>
       The AFL-CIO today introduced LaborWEB, the federation's<br>
new &quot;home page&quot; on the Internet's World Wide Web.<br>
<br>
       Through this new &quot;web site,&quot; AFL-CIO information on<br>
workers and their unions is now available to any of the 30<br>
million computer users worldwide who tap into the Internet.<br>
<br>
       The URL address for the new site is<br>
http://www.aflcio.org/<br>
<br>
       &quot;This is a great new way of bringing labor's message to<br>
a huge and ever-expanding number of people,&quot; said AFL-CIO<br>
President Lane Kirkland.  &quot;Some 35 percent of American<br>
families have a computer in the home, and computer access at<br>
the worksite is growing.&quot;<br>
<br>
       &quot;Clearly, the Internet is becoming an important medium<br>
for disseminating information, and the workers we represent<br>
have to be part of it,&quot; said Kirkland.<br>
<br>
       LaborWEB enables anyone with a computer, modem and<br>
access to the World Wide Web to connect with the AFL-CIO<br>
home page and receive the federation's latest press<br>
releases, policy statements, boycott lists and a variety of<br>
other information.  The home page includes links to other<br>
labor-related web sites.<br>
<br>
       LaborWEB also includes a section devoted to the AFL-CIO<br>
Organizing Institute and its recruiting and training<br>
programs for union organizers.  Computer users who access<br>
this section will have the opportunity to download an<br>
application for the Institute's three-day training sessions. <br>
Anyone interested in forming a union at his or her workplace<br>
will be able to provide organizing leads to the Institute<br>
directly from the web site.<br>
<br>
       LaborWEB is the latest in the AFL-CIO's continuing<br>
efforts to use on-line communications to advance the labor<br>
movement's historic goals.  The federation also sponsors<br>
LaborNET on CompuServe, a private forum for union members<br>
that enables them to retrieve up-to-date information from<br>
the AFL-CIO and to communicate with each other.  Since the<br>
beginning of the year, the number of subscribers to LaborNET<br>
has tripled to more than 1,200.</p>

<title>PR 05/16/95 Statement on the National Performance Review's Reinventing OSHA Report </title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>For Immediate Release                      Contact: Colleen M. O'Neill<br>
May 16, 1995                                              202/637-5010<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO made the following statement upon the release of the<br>
National Performance Review's Reinventing OSHA Report:<br>
<br>
<br>
      The AFL-CIO endorses the goal of the National Performance<br>
Review's Reinventing OSHA Report -- to improve worker safety and<br>
health by making OSHA a more effective agency.<br>
<br>
      We welcome President Clinton's pledge to protect the nation's<br>
job safety laws and programs from attacks by the Republican<br>
Congress.<br>
<br>
      We particularly support those initiatives designed to focus<br>
OSHA's attention on the most serious hazards and the most dangerous<br>
workplaces, and to address continuing safety and health problems,<br>
such as ergonomic hazards.<br>
<br>
      The NPR document outlines new initiatives aimed at enhancing<br>
health and safety through incentives for employers. There's nothing<br>
wrong with promoting voluntary compliance, but it is important to<br>
remember that under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, it's<br>
not OSHA's job to be the friend of employers -- it's to protect<br>
American workers from serious hazards through promulgation of<br>
effective standards and strong enforcement of the law.<br>
<br>
      Initiatives directed at voluntary compliance will only work<br>
when coupled with meaningful standards and enforcement efforts.</p>

May 10, 1995                                           202/637-5017<br>
<br>
<br>
              AFL-CIO SUPPORTS CLINTON ON JAPAN TRADE<br>
<br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO issued the following statement on the Clinton<br>
administration's move to impose trade sanctions over Japan's<br>
restrictive trade policies on autos and auto parts. <br>
<br>
     The AFL-CIO applauds the Clinton administration's tough stance<br>
with Japan. After months of trade talks, it is now time for<br>
results.<br>
<br>
     In order to reach a results-oriented agreement with Japan, it<br>
is necessary now to move forward with the Sections 301 and 304 case<br>
against restrictive policies and practices of Japan, which deny<br>
U.S. access to the Japanese auto parts replacement and accessories<br>
market.<br>
<br>
     American workers in a wide range of industries and occupations<br>
would benefit from the reduction of the U.S. deficit in automotive<br>
trade with Japan and the elimination of discriminatory practices by<br>
Japanese companies directed at U.S. firms.<br>
<br>
     Union members in the rubber, glass, steel, aluminum, textile,<br>
machine tool, chemical, electrical, electronics and other<br>
industries would directly benefit from increased access to the<br>
Japanese auto market for competitive American products. Unionized<br>
workers in other industries, including entertainment,<br>
telecommunications, construction, aerospace and paper, would gain<br>
additional jobs if the Japanese market were truly open and<br>
discrimination against U.S. producers was ended.<br>
<br>
     Ambassador Kantor was correct when he said, &quot;Japan remains<br>
unwilling to take the steps necessary to bring genuine market<br>
access and concrete results in a sector in which Japan has a $37<br>
billion trade surplus with the U.S.&quot;<br>
<br>
     If the auto trade deficit with Japan is reduced substantially,<br>
President Clinton's effort to establish equity in the bilateral<br>
trading relationship could create many thousands of American jobs.</p>

<title>PR 05/09/95 Hatian Labor Rep Wins Red Cross Award</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                          CONTACT: James B. Parks<br>
May 9, 1995                                             of the AFL-CIO<br>
                                                       at 202/637-5022<br>
<br>
                HAITIAN LABOR REP WINS RED CROSS AWARD <br>
<br>
      Georges Exceus, labor's representative in Haiti and one of the<br>
heroes of the Haitian democracy movement has been named to receive<br>
the American Red Cross 1995 International Humanitarian Service<br>
Award.<br>
<br>
       A Haitian-American from Miami, Exceus, 42, returned to his<br>
native land to direct the Port-au-Prince office of the AFL-CIO's<br>
American Institute for Free Labor Development, arriving three weeks<br>
before the 1991 coup that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand<br>
Aristide.  <br>
<br>
      After sending his wife and young son back to Miami, Exceus<br>
ignored death threats and constant danger for almost four years, he<br>
managed somehow to get food, clothing and shelter for persecuted<br>
unionists and their families -- and all too often, to arrange for<br>
medical treatment and even funerals for the victims of torture and<br>
murder.<br>
<br>
      ``I was tempted to leave many times. But there was so much to<br>
do, always one more life to save. I was on a mission,'' Exceus<br>
said.  <br>
<br>
      Exceus has hidden hundreds of people from the military over<br>
the past three years and, under the auspices of the AFL-CIO, found<br>
scarce hot food, medicine and hospital services for untold numbers<br>
of suffering Haitians. <br>
<br>
      A former organizer for the Clothing and Textile Workers,<br>
Exceus will receive the award at the Red Cross national convention,<br>
May 20-22 in Tulsa, Okla.</p>

<p>PRESS ADVISORY                       CONTACT: Michael Byrne<br>
May 5, 1995                                  of the AFL-CIO<br>

<br>
             ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN TREND IS CLEAR<br>
<br>
<br>
     While seasonal adjustment may account for some of<br>
the dramatic 0.3 percent rise in April unemployment, &quot;the<br>
direction is clear,&quot; said AFL-CIO economist Markley<br>
Roberts. &quot;There is an economic slowdown under way and it<br>
is reasonable and logical to see in this the continuing<br>
bite of Federal Reserve slow-growth, anti-inflation<br>
policies.&quot;<br>

<title>PR 05/05/95 `Come Shop With Me' Puts Consumers on Alert </title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>For immediate release                           Contact: Muriel Cooper<br>
May 5, 1995                                            at 202/637-5010<br>
<br>
<br>
              `Come Shop With Me' Puts Consumers on Alert<br>
<br>
      Shoppers are being warned that the pretty sweater from China<br>
they're considering buying for Mother's Day may have been made by<br>
a child forced to work long hours. <br>
<br>
      ``Come Shop With Me,'' a national education campaign by<br>
congressional, labor and consumer supporters, wants shoppers to<br>
look carefully at the products they're buying -- and the practices<br>
they may indirectly be supporting -- when they shop for Mother's<br>
Day and other gifts. <br>
<br>
      A news conference set for 3 p.m., Tuesday, May 9, Rayburn<br>
House Office Building,  Room HC-8, will highlight the miserable<br>
wages and conditions endured by working women, men and particularly<br>
children to produce many of the brand-name products sought after in<br>
the United States and elsewhere.<br>
<br>
      Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) will be joined by Evelyn Dubrow<br>
(Ladies' Garment Workers) and Jean Hervey (Clothing and Textile<br>
Workers), who head the ``Come Shop With Me'' campaign; Patricia<br>
Scarcelli, Coalition of Labor Union Women; and Linda Golodner,<br>
National Consumers League. <br>
<br>
      They will spotlight presents traditionally given for Mother's<br>
Day -- clothing, roses, shoes -- and will supply the not-so-pretty<br>
facts behind those skirts from India and flowers from Columbia. The<br>
campaign is intended to expose company practices that earn billions<br>
in profits at the expense of millions of workers, and children.<br>
<br>
      The year-long ``Come Shop With Me'' educational campaign began<br>
during the 1994 Christmas shopping season, focusing then on the<br>
labor practices of four well-known corporations -- NIKE, Mattel,<br>
Dole and Van Heusen.</p>

<p>                         AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Tom Donahue<br>
               Panel on Wealth at the &quot;Facing the 21st Century&quot; Symposium<br>
                              National Planning Association<br>
                              Washington, D.C., May 5, 1995<br>
<br>
<br>
       I am delighted to be here. It is a special pleasure being on<br>
a panel with Jerry Jasinowski and Bob Reich.<br>
<br>
       You may think of the three of us as somewhat disparate, so let<br>
me begin by noting that today, all three of us appear in the great<br>
tradition of Karl Marx.<br>
<br>
       It is not that we believe in the dictatorship of the<br>
proletariat. Rather, it goes back to a story told by Harold<br>
Macmillan about Marx -- actually, about Marx's wife. She reportedly<br>
complained that it would be nice if her husband would talk less<br>
about wealth and instead make more of it.<br>
<br>
       On this panel, the three of us are doing like Karl. We're here<br>
to talk about wealth and no one is being paid for it. What better<br>
site to do it than Washington's fanciest hotel.<br>
<br>
       The logical starting point for a discussion like ours is to<br>
see how the great, the profound, and the noble have viewed wealth<br>
through the ages. <br>
<br>
       I am happy to share some of their insights with you.<br>
<br>
       The Duchess of Windsor was the first to note that you cannot<br>
be too rich or too thin.<br>
<br>
       But some centuries before that, Horace said, &quot;He is not poor<br>
who has enough of things to use. It is well with your belly, chest,<br>
and feet, the wealth of kings can give you nothing more.&quot;<br>
<br>
       Clearly, Horace was not exactly a role model for the Duchess.<br>
<br>
       A publication called &quot;Off the Wall Street Journal&quot; said, &quot;The<br>
Pluto-American Anti-Defamation League said it will bring pressure<br>
to bear on media to upgrade the image of incredibly rich people.<br>
The newly-formed group, which hopes to combat negative portrayals<br>
of incredibly rich people on television and in print, cited the<br>
crucial role that incredibly rich people have played in American<br>
history, and hopes to restore incredible richness as a `positive<br>
aspect of American life.'&quot;<br>
<br>
       Franklin P. Adams described the life of wealth in a poem:<br>
<br>
       The rich man has his motorcar,<br>
       His country and his town estate,<br>
       He smokes a fifty-cent cigar<br>
       And jeers at Fate.<br>
       He frivols through the livelong day,<br>
       He knows not Poverty her pinch.<br>
       His lot seems light, his heart seems gay,<br>
       He has a cinch.<br>
       Yet though my lamp burns low and dim,<br>
       Though I must slave for livelihood --<br>
       Think you that I would change with him?<br>
       You bet I would!<br>
<br>
       Hilaire Belloc, in a comment that presaged trickle-down<br>
economics, noted, &quot;Lord Finchley tried to mend the 'lectric light<br>
himself; it struck him dead and serve him right; it is the business<br>
of the wealthy man to give employment to the artisan.&quot;<br>
<br>
       On a more serious note, Henry George warned, &quot;So long as all<br>
the increased wealth which modern progress brings goes but to build<br>
up great fortunes, to increase luxury and make sharper the contrast<br>
between the House of Have and the House of Want, progress is not<br>
real and cannot be permanent.&quot;<br>
<br>
       Andrew Carnegie, citing a modern-day problem, wrote in &quot;North<br>
American Review,&quot; &quot;The problem of our age is the proper<br>
administration of wealth, so that the ties of brotherhood may still<br>
bind together the rich and poor in harmonious relationship.&quot;<br>
<br>
       The great Catholic churchman Cardinal Gibbons, in that same<br>
magazine two years later, condemned an economic system in which<br>
&quot;the well-being of the car-horse is more solicitously watched over<br>
than that of the driver.&quot;<br>
<br>
       Lyndon Johnson said in a speech in 1964, &quot;The challenge of the<br>
next half-century is whether we have the wisdom to use [our] wealth<br>
to enrich and elevate our national life -- and to advance the<br>
quality of American civilization.&quot;<br>
<br>
       With 30 years of that half-century gone by, it would be hard<br>
to make the case that we have met the challenge.<br>
<br>
       We should probably give the last word to Sophie Tucker. She<br>
said, &quot;I've been rich and I've been poor. Rich is better.&quot;<br>
<br>
       Our symposium is about looking ahead to the 21st century and<br>
wealth in that era; but let me move in the opposite direction and<br>
talk about something that happened more than a half-century ago.<br>
<br>
       When I was a 10-year-old kid in the North Bronx, there was a<br>
magnificent event that took place over on Long Island, the opening<br>
of the 1939 New York World's Fair. Today, it is hard to convey the<br>
excitement and optimism that surrounded it.<br>
<br>
       Most of the exhibitions were about the future.<br>
<br>
       Visitors to the Westinghouse Building could see a<br>
demonstration of Electro, the walking, talking robot. And in the<br>
RCA Building, they could watch &quot;picture radio&quot;  (this was before<br>
people were using the word &quot;television&quot;).<br>
<br>
       I went with my young friends to the General Motors exhibition,<br>
where we got to ride in a car -- quite an event in those days. We<br>
all fought to see who would ride in the front.<br>
<br>
       Along the road, I remember the driver telling me that in the<br>
future, cars would have only a front seat and they would be wide<br>
enough to seat eight people side by side. This made a very deep<br>
impression on me. I think I was probably 16 before I realized that<br>
this guy had to be kidding.<br>
<br>
       Of all the exhibitions at the Fair, the most ambitious, and<br>
certainly the most expensive, was called Futurama. It aimed to<br>
portray what the United States would be like in 1960.<br>
<br>
       No one had ever seen anything quite like it. You could take a<br>
simulated airplane ride over the imaginary American landscape of<br>
the future, with huge suspension bridges and highway systems full<br>
of underpasses and overpasses.<br>
<br>
       You were told that the city of 1960 would have &quot;abundant<br>
sunshine, fresh air, fine green parkways, recreational and civic<br>
centers -- all the result of thoughtful planning and design.&quot;  <br>
<br>
       And as you were leaving the exhibition, you would get a button<br>
that read, &quot;I Have Seen the Future.&quot;<br>
<br>
       Unfortunately, that button was a bit inaccurate. Today, with<br>
our perfect 20/20 hindsight, we can know where the visionaries of<br>
the Fair were somewhat right, and also where they were<br>
spectacularly wrong. <br>
<br>
       The cautionary lesson is obvious. When people make firm<br>
predictions about the 21st century, you should be very kind to them<br>
and simply write down the predictions so they can be checked later.<br>
<br>
       In fact, the 21st century for us is probably something like a<br>
Rorschach ink blot. Each of us sees in it what we want to see, and<br>
what we hear today has a lot more to do with 1995 than with 2005 or<br>
2055.<br>
<br>
       With that reservation in mind, let's turn to the two questions<br>
that this panel has been asked to address. Let me try to address<br>
wealth in America and its distribution rather than income levels,<br>
which Bob Reich has outlined so well.<br>
<br>
       The first question is: &quot;What is the outlook for the U.S.<br>
standard of living in the 21st century?&quot;<br>
<br>
       This is a very good question. Like all such questions, it is<br>
very hard to answer. It is a bit like asking what yesterday's<br>
weather was in the United States. It was one thing in Fairbanks,<br>
Alaska, another thing in Denver, something very different in Miami<br>
Beach -- and a combination of all of those in Washington, D.C.<br>
<br>
       The point is that if the 21st century is much like 1995, then<br>
the standard of living will be one thing for the poorest fifth of<br>
the population, quite different for the middle class, and vastly<br>
different for the wealthiest part of the population.<br>
<br>
       If we can make one very reliable prediction in our symposium,<br>
it is this. If things continue in the direction they are going now,<br>
then in the 21st century, the United States will have the greatest,<br>
the most flagrant inequality in standards of living of any major<br>
industrialized country in the world.<br>
<br>
       This fact and this trend are tremendously important. They<br>
change what we are as a country. They go to what we value the most.<br>
<br>
       We believe in equality. We take it very seriously and we<br>
always have.<br>
<br>
       There are a thousand examples of it throughout our history. In<br>
the &quot;Federalist Papers,&quot; that great conservative hero Alexander<br>
Hamilton wrote, &quot;Happy it is when the interest which the government<br>
has in the preservation of its own power coincides with a proper<br>
distribution of the public burdens, and tends to guard the least<br>
wealthy part of the community from oppression.&quot;<br>
<br>
       Yet we are now becoming the most unequal of nations. In fact,<br>
there is a Twentieth Century Fund report published last month<br>
called &quot;Top Heavy&quot; that indicates we are already there and it is<br>
only getting worse.<br>
<br>
       The report notes that in 1989, the last year for which we have<br>
figures, the top 1 percent of wealth holders controlled 39 percent<br>
of total household wealth. And if you focus on financial wealth,<br>
the richest 1 percent owned 48 percent of the total.<br>
<br>
       It wasn't always this way. Beginning in 1929 (maybe even<br>
earlier, although we don't have reliable statistics before then)<br>
and going up to 1979, something very healthy happened in this<br>
country. In absolute terms, everyone got richer -- but in relative<br>
terms, the rich got poorer and the poor got richer. We became more<br>
equal.<br>
<br>
       Yet in the 1980s, and especially from 1983 to 1989, America<br>
started moving backwards. The share of the richest 1 percent of<br>
wealth holders went up by 5 percentage points, while the wealth of<br>
the bottom 40 percent had an absolute decline.<br>
<br>
       Indeed, during that period, just about all of the absolute<br>
gains in real wealth in America accrued to the richest 20 percent<br>
of wealth holders.<br>
       In &quot;Top Heavy,&quot; Professor Edward Wolff of New York University<br>
compares what is happening here to other nations. Let me quote its<br>
conclusions: &quot;In the early part of this century... America appeared<br>
to be the land of opportunity, whereas Europe was a place where an<br>
entrenched upper class controlled the bulk of wealth.<br>
<br>
       &quot;By the late 1980s, the situation appears to have completely<br>
reversed, with much higher concentration of wealth in the United<br>
States than in Europe. Europe now appears the land of equality.&quot;<br>
<br>
       I would submit that for a country with our values, this<br>
represents a terrible historic failure. There is no law of nature<br>
that makes it inevitable. We know one of the biggest reasons why<br>
this happened in the 1980s: marginal tax rates for the rich and the<br>
very rich were cut.<br>
<br>
       The Clinton administration's budget bill of two years ago<br>
increased the rates for the very rich, but those rates are still<br>
much lower than they were at the beginning of the 1980s.<br>
<br>
       In a sense, the bonanza that the rich enjoyed in the 1980s was<br>
a huge, wild experiment that ended in disaster. And the disaster<br>
resonates not only in our economic life. It rubs salt into all<br>
sorts of social and political wounds. <br>
<br>
       One of the ways we can sensibly prepare for the 21st century<br>
is to clean up the mess that we created in the last decade.<br>
Personally, I would prefer to tax the wealthiest 1 percent at least<br>
at the rates of 1980. It would be even better to go back to the<br>
progressive structure during the administration of the notorious<br>
revolutionary socialist, Dwight D. Eisenhower. <br>
<br>
       But I also realize that in today's political climate, it is<br>
too much to hope for such change. One splendid and more viable<br>
proposal offered by Professor Wolff is a wealth tax similar to<br>
those in Germany, Switzerland, France, and the Scandinavian<br>
countries.<br>
<br>
       According to &quot;Top Heavy,&quot; if such a tax excluded the first<br>
$100,000 of wealth, it would not even touch some two thirds of all<br>
American households. But even a modest tax of wealth above that<br>
level, similar to that of Switzerland, would be enough to have<br>
generated some $40 billion in tax revenue in 1994.<br>
<br>
       The fact is that the 1981 tax cuts brought a stunning shift of<br>
wealth, a shift of over $1 trillion in ten years from 99-1/2<br>
percent of the American people to the wealthiest 1/2 of 1 percent,<br>
people with net worths of over $10 million.<br>
<br>
       I would go much farther than Professor Wolff. I believe we<br>
need to consider a wealth tax on that 1/2 of 1 percent to get back<br>
the $1 trillion and to halt the ongoing transfer of $170 billion<br>
per year to the same 1/2 of 1 percent.<br>
<br>
       The transfer was not the fault of the wealthy. It was nothing<br>
they did. We did it to them. We forced the trillion dollars on them<br>
as part of the Reagan administration's 1981 supply-side tax cut.<br>
<br>
       They didn't really ask for the money. They certainly didn't<br>
need it. The only real effect it had on them was to give their<br>
accountants more figures to add up.<br>
<br>
       The clearest way to see this is to look at the actual numbers.<br>
The top 1/2 of 1 percent now holds about $7 trillion, or about 1/3<br>
of our total wealth of $21 trillion. If we were able to take back<br>
our $1 trillion, we would leave them with $6 trillion. That is<br>
still more than twice the $2.5 trillion they had before Reagan.<br>
<br>
       The fact that the top 1/2 of 1 percent now own a third of our<br>
total wealth is worth more than a passing gasp. History shows that<br>
whenever their share of our wealth rises that high, we are in for<br>
a disaster. In 1929, when their share rose to about that level, the<br>
Great Depression began.<br>
<br>
       This redistribution of our wealth from the middle class to the<br>
very wealthiest 1/2 of 1 percent still goes on. This year, the<br>
transfer will be about $170 billion. To take back the $1 trillion<br>
without stopping the $170 billion annual drain would be like<br>
bailing out the boat but not fixing the hole in the bottom.<br>
<br>
       Now, the last time I checked, tax increases on anyone at all<br>
are not politically popular this year. I'm not sure how many<br>
candidates for 1996 are planning campaigns around the theme, &quot;Make<br>
the rich pay their fair share.&quot;<br>
<br>
       Perhaps someone should have as a theme, &quot;Make the very, very<br>
rich with $10 million or more give us back what we gave them.&quot;<br>
<br>
       For a variety of very good reasons -- to reduce the colossal<br>
disparity among our standards of living, to keep the public sector<br>
from emaciation, to reduce the federal budget deficit, to make our<br>
nation more equal in fact as well as in theory -- such a wealth tax<br>
and an increase in marginal tax rates on the 1/2 of 1 percent to<br>
counteract the continuing transfers to them of $170 billion per<br>
year would be one of the best, most moral legacies we could leave<br>
our children for the next century.<br>
<br>
       So in the end, the answer to the question, &quot;What is the<br>
outlook for the U.S. standard of living in the 21st century,&quot; is<br>
that if we do nothing, it will be very bleak for poor and working<br>
people, and just fine for the affluent, particularly for the<br>
richest 1 percent -- for a time.<br>
<br>
       And that is precisely why we should do something.<br>
<br>
       The second question before our panel is, &quot;Are there tradeoffs<br>
between wealth creation, wealth distribution, and other noneconomic<br>
goals?&quot;<br>
       The answer is that there have been such tradeoffs in the past,<br>
there are today, and unless the world is transformed in ways we<br>
can't imagine, there will be tradeoffs like that in the next<br>
century.<br>
<br>
       It is no secret that market-based capitalism can do a lot of<br>
things very well. As economists from Karl Marx to Milton Friedman<br>
have suggested, it is the greatest engine of prosperity in human<br>
history.<br>
<br>
       It is also not a secret that when it is left to its own<br>
devices, it does other things badly or not at all, like ensuring<br>
social equality, protecting the environment, correcting the<br>
imbalance of power between employer and employee, guaranteeing<br>
universal education, encouraging a sense of community, and<br>
providing security for the poor and the needy.<br>
<br>
       The sad truth is that we can't have it all. We either temper<br>
and restrain the workings of the market to pursue social goals, or<br>
we don't.<br>
<br>
       Unfortunately, this is not the kind of issue that can be<br>
solved by a hand calculator or the latest software. It is in the<br>
realm of philosophy, ethics, or possibly religion.<br>
<br>
       I suspect that if you ask the three of us on this panel where<br>
and how to make the tradeoffs, you will get at least three<br>
opinions, probably more.<br>
<br>
       And as persuasive as each of us is, it is highly unlikely that<br>
any one of us could change the minds of the other two.<br>
<br>
       If we frame the issue as marking the perimeter of the<br>
government's role in a capitalist economy -- and we should frame it<br>
that way -- then this is a season when private wealth creation will<br>
win out against government programs almost every time.<br>
<br>
       But happily, the cycles of history are constantly moving,<br>
sometimes when nobody notices. The time will come when we can once<br>
again make our society more equal, when we can make those tradeoffs<br>
that make it possible for the middle class and the poor to make<br>
their lives more secure and comfortable. It may be in the next<br>
century, but it is not too early to start discussing what should be<br>
done when the time is ripe.<br>
<br>
       John Stuart Mill, when he was a young man, believed that the<br>
world was becoming &quot;more improved; more eminent in the best<br>
characteristics of Man and Society; farther advanced in the road to<br>
perfection; happier, nobler, wiser.&quot;                   <br>
<br>
       These days, as we look to the 21st century, we cannot be<br>
nearly as confident of that as Mill was.<br>
<br>
       Maybe nothing is inevitable -- and if it is, we probably don't<br>
have the slightest idea what it could possibly be.<br>
<br>
       But we can make our best guess. We can think seriously about<br>
what we can do to leave things a little better for our children and<br>
grandchildren, how we can make their lives happier and safer and<br>
more humane. And that will require our finding the ways to ensure<br>
a more equitable distribution of wealth, and of the comfort and<br>
power and security that are its companions.<br>
<br>
       Thank you.</p>

<p>For Immediate Release                    Contact: Colleen O'Neill<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland issued this statement following<br>
President Clinton's remarks to the White House Conference on Aging:<br>
<br>
<br>
     President Clinton is exactly right that Medicare reform can<br>
only be undertaken in an atmosphere of comprehensive health care<br>
reform. He has steadfastly pursued that goal, only to be obstructed<br>
by the same forces who now cite a Medicare `crisis' as reason to<br>
cut Medicare while they enact tax cuts for the wealthy.<br>
<br>
     Medicare has problems -- senior health care is eroding, long-<br>
term care and prescription drugs are not covered and costs for the<br>
two are spiralling ever higher. Funding should go where it's<br>
needed, to correct those problems and assure seniors, the disabled<br>
and others access to proper care.<br>
<br>
     The AFL-CIO will continue to fight to protect Medicare. We<br>
will continue to resist any effort to punish the middle class for<br>
the nation's failure to face up to its health care problems.<br>
<br>
                               ###<br>

May 1, 1995                                                       at 202/637-5010<br>
                                              After May 2, 202/483-3000 Room 2174<br>
<br>
                     Labor Delegates Join Conference on Aging<br>
<br>
      Some 200 trade unionists are among the 2,200 delegates to the fourth<br>
White House Conference on Aging, which opens May 3 at the Washington<br>
Hilton.<br>
<br>
      Labor delegates will focus on countering the widespread misinformation<br>
on Social Security and Medicare and demonstrating the inter-generational<br>
support for Social Security programs. <br>
<br>
      They also will be carrying the message that Americans overwhelmingly<br>
support Social Security and Medicare and reject Republican attempts to<br>
tamper with Medicare in order to fund tax breaks for the wealthy.<br>
      <br>
      On May 2, beginning at 10 a.m., union delegates will be joined by<br>
seniors, students and others in a symbolic ``passing of the torch'' from the<br>
National Archives to the U.S. Capitol. Following the torch ceremony will be a<br>
10:30 a.m. news conference with Dr. Arthur Flemming and leaders of Save<br>
Our Security, on the east steps of the Capitol.<br>
 <br>
      Past conferences on aging have produced landmark programs, with the<br>
work of delegates contributing to the enactment of Medicare, Medicaid and<br>
the Older American Act in 1961; the Supplemental Security Income Program<br>
and other achievements in 1971; and recommendations leading to the Social<br>
Security Reform amendments in 1981.<br>
<br>
      Individual interviews with delegates and union officers can be arranged<br>
through Colleen O'Neill, AFL-CIO Information Department. Beginning May 3,<br>
contact her at 202/483-3000, Room 2174 at the Washington Hilton.</p>

<title>PR 04/27/95 Memorial Service in Oklahoma City </title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>       Remarks of AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Tom Donahue<br>
                Memorial Service in Oklahoma City<br>
                         April 27, 1995<br>
<br>
     I come today to speak on behalf of the 13 million working men<br>
and women who are the AFL-CIO, on behalf of America's working<br>
families who our unions represent -- and for them, to attempt to<br>
speak the emotions that have flooded through them in the past eight<br>
days.<br>
<br>
     But there are no words with which one describes the horror,<br>
the sorrow, the shock, the anger, the plain misery that all of<br>
America feels at the killing of so many decent men, women, and<br>
children who until eight days ago had whole lifetimes ahead of them<br>
to enjoy their work and families.<br>
<br>
     I am incapable of the full expression of the sympathy we want<br>
to offer to their families and friends.<br>
<br>
     No words are adequate. But by our presence here today, we mean<br>
to convey to the families of those who died here our desire to<br>
share the pain of their loss and our hope that somehow that<br>
knowledge, that sense that others share their grief, may help to<br>
lessen their burdens.<br>
<br>
     The 13 million women and men of the AFL-CIO join in prayers<br>
for your well-being and offer the further prayer that the misery of<br>
the blast may so shock the few in our nation who fan the flames of<br>
hate that their encouragement of conflict might be forever stilled.<br>
<br>
     For those who survived the horror of this blast, we offer a<br>
prayer of thanksgiving for your safety and for your deliverance<br>
from the memories of that day.<br>
<br>
     And on this day, we offer our thanks to the hundreds of union<br>
members and other workers who have labored so hard and long and<br>
with such dedication in the rescue and search operations. The fire<br>
fighters and police; the operating engineers; the ironworkers,<br>
electricians, carpenters, and others in the construction trades;<br>
the city and state and federal employees; the health personnel --<br>
everyone who has lifted a broken chunk of concrete or shard of<br>
glass has earned the gratitude and admiration of the nation.<br>
<br>
     Tomorrow, all across America, the men and women of the AFL-CIO<br>
will meet as they have annually over the past seven years in<br>
hundreds of observances of Workers' Memorial Day. <br>
<br>
     In each of those, there will be a moment of silence for the<br>
thousands of workers who were killed or injured on the job during<br>
the past year.<br>
<br>
     It is our way of reminding America that our workplaces can be<br>
dangerous places, and a reminder of the need for effective<br>
enforcement of occupational safety and health regulations.<br>
<br>
     This year, all of the people attending those Workers' Memorial<br>
Day observances will have in their minds and hearts the federal<br>
workers and ordinary citizens who died here, not because of any<br>
failure of safety and health laws but because of the madness of a<br>
few sick zealots.<br>
<br>
     They will reflect, as we do, on the horrible truth that<br>
ordinary workers -- some of them members of the American Federation<br>
of Government Employees working at four agencies in the building<br>
and a member of the Operating Engineers -- came to their workplaces<br>
as they did every day to perform the duties of the day.<br>
<br>
     They showed up at work to do what they did every day as<br>
federal workers -- to serve the people, to make their government<br>
real to their citizen-clients, to process claims for benefits or to<br>
pursue effective enforcement of our laws.<br>
<br>
     They were like millions of their brothers and sisters all<br>
across America. But within a few minutes, their lives and the lives<br>
to which they were connected were shattered -- smashed in an<br>
avalanche of concrete and glass and metal.<br>
<br>
     There were others. Citizens seeking government service, a<br>
striking member of the Rubber Workers in his own struggle for<br>
justice who was volunteering to help Social Security applicants,<br>
and little children seeking only the joy and comfort of their day<br>
care center while their parents did their jobs -- they had their<br>
lives stolen by the perpetrators of this heinous crime who cared<br>
not about the innocence of their victims. They killed<br>
indiscriminately, presumably to protest some imagined wrong.<br>
<br>
     At this point, it is still too early to know why this bombing<br>
could have happened. But it seems that there is some link -- we<br>
don't know exactly how strong it is -- to a certain kind of<br>
extremism that is abroad in the land.<br>
<br>
     This country has always been dedicated to the idea of free<br>
expression. That is one of the cornerstones of our society. None of<br>
us wants to tamper with that freedom in any way.<br>
<br>
     But today, there is something very ominous and frightening: a<br>
free-wheeling hatred, an eagerness for violence, a reverence for<br>
weaponry, a contempt for democratic government. All of these<br>
apparently found some ultimate sort of expression in the Oklahoma<br>
City bombing.<br>
<br>
     It left a gaping moral wound that we must heal.<br>
     But in the worst events and times, some goodness, some<br>
redemption or resurrection must be found. And surely the hundreds<br>
of people who have worked in the rescue efforts, the tens of<br>
thousands of residents of this city and the millions of Americans<br>
who can only observe and pray, have demonstrated again the<br>
resilience of the human spirit and the natural instincts for<br>
kindness and goodness and solidarity that we all share.<br>
<br>
     Perhaps that can help to fashion a new determination to reject<br>
hate, to root it out of our society.<br>
<br>
     It may be too much to hope for replacing it with love, for<br>
creating a society in which man's inhumanity to man is replaced by<br>
man's love for man -- for following the biblical injunction to love<br>
one another.<br>
<br>
      But it is surely possible for us all to dedicate ourselves to<br>
taking hate out of our national dialogue, and at the minimum to<br>
correct any among us who dares to speak without tolerance or who<br>
attempts to inflame our political discourse.<br>
<br>
     Let us here resolve that each of us will undertake to still<br>
the voices of hate, that we may never again have to memorialize so<br>
many whose lives held so much promise for good.<br>
<br>
     So we pray for the women and men and children who lost their<br>
lives. We pray for their loved ones who survived. We pray for this<br>
community that tries to find its way through its trauma. We offer<br>
a prayer of thanks for all of you who have worked so hard to<br>
relieve its suffering.<br>
<br>
     And let us also pray for our country -- for a reign of<br>
civility and moderation and decency, for peace and a simple respect<br>
for human life.</p>

<title>PR 04/13/95 Recess Campaign Urges Support for America's Working Families </title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>For immediate release                         Contact: Candice Johnson<br>
April 13, 1995                                         at 202/637-5010<br>
<br>
     Recess Campaign Urges Support for America's Working Families<br>
<br>
      Union members are pressing their congressional<br>
representatives, home for the Easter recess, about the wrong<br>
direction Congress has taken in its so-called ``Contract with<br>
America.'' <br>
<br>
      Working people are sending that message to their<br>
representatives in face-to-face meetings, phone calls, rallies,<br>
radio talk shows and newspaper and television ads. The campaign<br>
stresses that good jobs, good wages, health and safety, and a real<br>
voice on the job are workers' top priorities. <br>
<br>
      April 28, Workers Memorial Day -- and the final day of the<br>
House recess -- remembers those killed and injured on the job.<br>
Workers will call on their representatives to stop congressional<br>
actions that are threatening job safety and health. <br>
<br>
      Television ads, which began in the Washington area, are<br>
running in selected congressional districts in nine states during<br>
the recess. Newspaper ads, which appeared in the national edition<br>
of USA Today and in the Washington Post, also are appearing in<br>
several districts, in states including Kentucky and Pennsylvania. <br>
<br>
<br>
      For example, Pennsylvania legislative action committees to<br>
date have scheduled meetings with six members of Congress and in<br>
Ohio, another half a dozen legislative action committee meetings<br>
have been scheduled. Union members also are planning events where<br>
a member of Congress refuses to meet. <br>
<br>
      There also are two direct mail campaigns underway, aimed at<br>
union members in districts represented by Reps. Harris Fawell (R-<br>
Ill.) and Cass Ballenger (R-N.C.). Legislative action committee<br>
meetings also have been scheduled in other districts, in states<br>
including Illinois, Wisconsin and California. and others. <br>
<br>
      The Campaign for America's Working Families is the AFL-CIO's<br>
national effort to underscore the benefits Congress is offering big<br>
business and the rich at the expense of the middle-income working<br>
families.</p>

             Senate Rejects Bid to Block Presidential Order<br>
<br>
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland made this comment on the Senate's<br>
rejection of efforts to block the President's executive order:  <br>
<br>
     The Senate's failure to overturn the President's executive<br>
order on striker replacements is a victory for working families. We<br>
applaud those Senators who stood with us in opposing this attack on<br>
workers' rights.<br>
<br>
     The President's order, which bars large federal contractors<br>
from permanently replacing striking employees, sets a strong moral<br>
tone. Labor-management cooperation must be a two-way street.<br>
Working Americans simply will not believe all of the talk about<br>
``workplace cooperation'' and ``partnership'' from the same people<br>
who defend the permanent replacement of strikers.<br>
<br>
     We are grateful to President Clinton and the majority of<br>
Senate Democrats for their firm stance on this issue.</p>

<title>PR 02/23/95 Rep. Lowey, Workers Urge Congress to Maintain Funds for a Strong OSHA</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Colleen M. O'Neill,<br>
202/637-5010<br>
February 23, 1995 or David Saltz, 202/637-5318<br>
<br>
<br>
Rep. Lowey, Workers Urge Congress to Maintain Funds for a Strong<br>
OSHA<br>
<br>
<br>
Workers and local union representatives from around the<br>
country joined Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) in a call to Congress to<br>
preserve Occupational Safety and Health Administration protections<br>
and funding. They were in town to attend an appropriations hearing<br>
where it was anticipated that OSHA funding cuts would be<br>
considered.<br>
<br>
Nearly a dozen people flew in to Washington to give testament<br>
to the power of strong safety and health protections, with stories<br>
ranging from the helplessness felt while watching co-workers die<br>
needlessly to the triumph gained by knowing OSHA-backed sanctions<br>
brought improvements to the workplace.<br>
<br>
``The owner had been ignoring our complaints for many years.<br>
. . . It seems like they were always saying that there's never<br>
money for health and safety,'' said Jorge Deschamps, a Ladies'<br>
Garment Workers member from New York City. ``We need more money for<br>
OSHA, not less. We need more inspectors and more enforcement. We<br>
need every employer to know that there are high fines. It's only<br>
after our employer found out how much the OSHA fines could be that<br>
our employer started fixing the machines.''<br>
<br>
The appropriations measures are one of a series of Republican<br>
attacks on OSHA and regulations to protect citizens. This week, the<br>
House of Representatives is slated to consider H.R. 450 -- The<br>
Regulatory Transition Act of 1995 -- while next week it is possible<br>
that H.R. 9, The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act, will be<br>
considered.<br>
<br>
`` As part of their effort to scale back government, the<br>
Republicans may propose drastic cuts in OSHA's current<br>
appropriation and for the agency's 1996 budget,'' said AFL-CIO<br>
Safety and Health Director Peg Seminario. ``This is not an academic<br>
exercise in budget-cutting, however, it is an attempt to weaken<br>
protections for working Americans. <br>
<br>
``The sad result will be weaker enforcement, more workplaces<br>
with safety and health hazards, more injuries and increasing<br>
fatalities,'' she said. ``These proposals are a step backward and<br>
represent a reversal of 25 years of improving job safety.''</p>

The AFL-CIO made the following comment on the president's call for<br>
an increase in the minimum wage:<br>
<br>
     The president is absolutely correct that the nation needs to<br>
``build the middle class and shrink the underclass.'' Further, he<br>
is right in saying that an increase in the minimum wage is an<br>
indispensable step toward achieving that goal. <br>
<br>
     Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has introduced a bill to<br>
increase the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75 in three steps of 50<br>
cents each. That's the minimum needed to correct the national<br>
blight of letting the real buying power of the minimum wage sink to<br>
the lowest level in 40 years. It takes an hourly wage of $5.85 to<br>
restore the lost buying power cited by President Clinton.<br>
<br>
     The AFL-CIO will be in the forefront of the fight against the<br>
privileged interests who would abuse the poorest of working people.</p>

<title>PR 01/13/95 Mexican Loan Terms Stick Workers with the Tab </title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>For immediate release                      Contact: Mark Anderson<br>
January 13, 1995               at 637-5178 (301/652-4932 at home)<br>
                                   or Candice Johnson at 637-5010<br>
<br>
          Mexican Loan Terms Stick Workers with the Tab<br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO issued this statement on Mexico's currency crisis and<br>
the loan guarantee package Congress will consider: <br>
<br>
     Mexico's economic disaster and currency crisis threatens to<br>
once again stick workers in both Mexico and the United States<br>
with the tab.  <br>
<br>
     The central aim of the Mexican government's plan is to<br>
reduce its current account deficit by significantly increasing<br>
Mexican exports, and pricing imports out of the reach of the<br>
majority of Mexican citizens. A key part of its program is to<br>
accelerate U.S. investment in Mexican factories.<br>
<br>
     So working Americans -- as taxpayers -- are once again being<br>
asked to pay for the export of their own jobs, and, in fact, to<br>
push down their own wages. The reported $40 billion loan<br>
guarantee will be used to reinforce a direct appeal to American<br>
business to expand operations in Mexico rather than in the United<br>
States. <br>
<br>
     Mexican workers, under their government's plan, will see<br>
their wages capped at 7 percent this year while inflation is<br>
expected to exceed 19 percent. This follows 10 long years of<br>
austerity for Mexico's workers, and makes it even more unlikely<br>
that they will have the purchasing power to buy U.S. goods. But<br>
while U.S. taxpayers are being asked to prop up the Mexican<br>
economy with billions of dollars, wealthy Mexicans have instead<br>
helped to bring about this crisis by taking their money and<br>
investments to other countries. <br>
     This disaster demonstrates that, for workers, the North<br>
American Free Trade Agreement is a ``lose-lose'' situation.<br>
Extending this flawed structure to the rest of the hemisphere<br>
will only compound the damage. Worker rights and standards must<br>
have a central role in future trade agreements. Working families<br>
everywhere deserve no less.</p>

<title>PR 01/09/95  DUNLOP Report Picks Right Targets, but Falls Short </title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<p>For Immediate Release Contact: Candice Johnson<br>
January 9, 1995 202/637-5010<br>
or Mary MacDonald<br>
202/637-5305<br>
<br>
DUNLOP REPORT PICKS RIGHT TARGETS, BUT FALLS SHORT<br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO issued this statement in response to the report of the<br>
Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations:<br>
<br>
The Dunlop Commission correctly identified the urgent problems<br>
facing American workers -- stagnating wages, longer working hours,<br>
and a growing inequality in earnings. They reaffirmed what we have<br>
known for many years -- that the best way to address these problems<br>
is by giving workers a strong voice in decision-making through<br>
democratic unions of their own choosing.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the Commission failed to recommend strong<br>
enough protections for workers who try to achieve that<br>
participation but currently face strong employer opposition.<br>
<br>
Equally unfortunate is the fact that their recommendations on<br>
workplace committees would allow the boss to decide who represents<br>
the workers. Such a hollow version of &quot;representation&quot; runs<br>
counter to basic principles of democracy and threatens to undermine<br>
workers' legitimate representatives. <br>
<br>
American unions have a strong track record of supporting real<br>
employee participation programs and have been partners in many of<br>
the most successful and longstanding examples. But we know that<br>
real &quot;employee voice&quot; means democratically elected representation. <br>
And we know that many of the economic concerns of America's workers<br>
will persist until workers can freely choose their own<br>
representatives.<br>
<br>
The report's recommendations of positive changes in our labor<br>
laws, designed to enlarge and make real the opportunities for<br>
worker voice could, if enacted, alleviate some of the problems<br>
faced by workers.<br>
<br>
###<br>
<br>
AFL-CIO ANALYSIS OF THE DUNLOP COMMISSION'S<br>
RECOMMENDATIONS<br>
<br>
The Commission's Fact Finding Report -- In its June, 1994<br>
Fact Finding Report, the Commission found that the United States'<br>
labor relations system has failed &quot;to adjust to the changing<br>
environment in ways consistent with our past economic history of<br>
progress for virtually all our citizens.&quot; As a result, wages are<br>
stagnating and even falling (&quot;developments unprecedented in the<br>
past 75 years in this country&quot;); inequality is increasing (&quot;the<br>
U.S. earning distribution is the most unequal among developed<br>
countries&quot;), and younger workers, particularly those with less than<br>
college education are suffering, (&quot;their &quot;ability to form families<br>
and buy homes has been compromised by their labor market plight.&quot;)<br>
<br>
&quot;A healthy society,&quot; the Commission warned, &quot;cannot long<br>
continue along the path the U.S. is moving.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Commission's Recommendations -- The recommendations of<br>
the Commission fall far short of meeting the needs of America's<br>
working families which the Commission itself identified. The<br>
Commission states that the &quot;solution&quot; to the &quot;widening earnings<br>
inequality and stagnant real earnings that has characterized the<br>
American labor market over the past ten to fifteen years&quot; lies<br>
&quot;well beyond the mandate of this Commission.&quot; The AFL-CIO<br>
disagrees.<br>
<br>
We believe that a cornerstone of greater economic security for<br>
working men and women is a labor relations system which empowers<br>
workers and enables those workers, through their democratically<br>
elected representatives, to forge full and equal partnerships with<br>
management. The AFL-CIO and its affiliated unions are committed to<br>
creating productive, cooperative relationships in which workers,<br>
through their unions, participate fully in the range of workplace<br>
decisions. Experience in a wide variety of companies and<br>
industries proves that such equal partnerships between labor and<br>
management are the surest path to achieving world class workplaces<br>
and world class labor standards for American workers.<br>
<br>
The Failure of the NLRA and of the Commission's Proposed<br>
Solutions -- The Commission's Fact Finding Report shows that a<br>
principal barrier to achieving an empowered workforce and full<br>
worker participation is our inadequate labor laws. For most<br>
workers in the United States forming a union is &quot;highly<br>
confrontational&quot; and &quot;highly conflictual&quot;; the U.S. &quot;is the only<br>
major democratic country in which the choice of whether or not<br>
workers are to be represented by a union is subject to such a<br>
confrontational process in most cases.&quot; The inadequacies of the<br>
current law thus frustrate the just aspirations of the many workers<br>
who, as the Commission said, &quot;want a voice on their job but fear<br>
the tensions, risk and adversarial climate&quot; currently associated<br>
with organizing a union.<br>
<br>
The Commission's recommendations offer little to alleviate the<br>
&quot;fear&quot; which the Fact Finding Report recognizes to be so pervasive. <br>
Expediting the election process would be a welcome change but<br>
would do little to change the climate in which workers today face<br>
the decision of whether to cross their employer and opt for<br>
workplace representation. The same is true of the Commission's<br>
proposal to expedite reinstatement for illegally discharged<br>
workers. Only the Commission's proposal for a system of first<br>
contract dispute resolution -- including binding arbitration where<br>
necessary -- represents a significant improvement in our current<br>
law.<br>
<br>
The Commission's recommendations in this area fall well short<br>
of what virtually every neutral observer -- including most of the<br>
law professors who testified before the Commission and including<br>
several of the Commissioners themselves in their academic writings<br>
-- have recognized to be the essential elements of a system<br>
designed to make union representation freely accessible to workers<br>
who desire it.<br>
<br>
The Commission's Recommended Change in Section 8(a)(2) -- The<br>
Commission's recommendations not only fail to serve the needs of<br>
those workers who want a union but also allow employers to choose<br>
and control who will represent non-union workers, at least with<br>
respect to certain subject matters.<br>
<br>
Section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA states a very simple principle: it<br>
is unfair labor practice for an employer to &quot;dominate&quot; an employee<br>
organization. This principle is essential if employees are to<br>
enjoy the democratic right to freely choose their own<br>
representatives. And employer domination of employee<br>
representation plans is illegitimate and undemocratic without<br>
regard to the particular matters with which the employer controlled<br>
representatives deal.<br>
<br>
The change recommended by the Commission was not advocated by<br>
any employer representative who appeared before the Commission. <br>
Moreover, this is not a change desired by working men and women;<br>
they want to be free to democratically select their own<br>
representatives and do not want their employers making these<br>
selections for them.<br>
<br>
DUNLOP COMMISSION/FREEMAN-ROGERS SURVEY FACT SHEET<br>
<br>
Some reporters will ask whether the Dunlop Commission<br>
recommendations provide the kind of representation the Freeman-<br>
Rogers survey seemed to indicate workers want -- employee<br>
organizations with no independent power and a cooperative<br>
relationship with management. That finding, of course, merely<br>
reflected the realities of the balance of power in many of today's<br>
workplaces; that very little happens unless management wants it. <br>
<br>
However, the survey also included several findings which<br>
support the view that workers want organizations that give them a<br>
real voice.<br>
<br>
* When non-union workers in companies with committees are<br>
asked how the committee members should be picked, only 9% favor<br>
selection by management; the rest favor elections (49%) or a<br>
volunteer system (36%). <br>
<br>
* Freeman-Rogers find that the majority of workers (56%) do<br>
not want employers to have the final say over the terms under which<br>
their employees work.<br>
<br>
* Freeman-Rogers find that workers want voice on economic<br>
issues. 60% say that it is &quot;very important&quot; for them to have a<br>
&quot;lot of influence&quot; on deciding their benefits, yet only 6% say they<br>
have &quot;a lot of direct involvement&quot; regarding benefits. <br>
<br>
* Most importantly, workers already in unions, who have<br>
experience with independent representation, strongly favor it. <br>
Ninety percent (90%) of current union members say they want to keep<br>
the union in their workplace.<br>
<br>
* The survey also found substantial demand for unions among<br>
non-union workers. Thirty-two percent (32%) of non-union workers -<br>
- 37% if the &quot;no responses&quot; are eliminated -- express a desire for<br>
union representation, and 33% (or 38% without the &quot;no responses&quot;)<br>
say the majority of their coworkers feel the same way.<br>
<br>
* Finally, even managers recognize the value of unions for<br>
their employees. Sixty-four percent (64%) of managers surveyed<br>
said they believed the union improved working conditions for its<br>
members.</p>

<br>
              Job Injury Report Shows the Epidemic<br>
            Of Cumulative Trauma Disorders Continues<br>
<br>
Peg Seminario, director of the AFL-CIO Department of Occupational<br>
Safety and Health, made the following comment on the annual report<br>
on occupational injuries and illnesses released today by the Bureau<br>
of Labor Statistics:<br>
<br>
     The 1993 BLS survey shows progress in reducing workplace<br>
injuries, but also shows that cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs)<br>
from poor job design and repetitive motion continue to increase at<br>
alarming rates.<br>
<br>
     In 1993, more than 300,000 cases of CTDs were reported.  These<br>
crippling disorders have increased 770 percent in the past decade. <br>
But the rates of CTDs declined for the first time in industries<br>
like meat packing and auto assembly where OSHA and employers have<br>
intervened to prevent CTDs and implement ergonomic control<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
     The message from the BLS report is that OSHA needs to move<br>
forward now with an ergonomics standard so that workers in all<br>
industries can be protected from crippling injuries from poor job<br>
design and repetitive motion.<br>
<br>

<p>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- February 10, 1997</p>
<p>ORGANIZING FOR GOOD HEALTH -- The Maryland Federation of
Nurses and Health Professionals have jumped into the drive to
organize Maryland's state workers. The AFT affiliate will
campaign for the right to represent 2,120 state health care
workers. Md. FNHP made it over the first hurdle when the State
Mediation Service certified authorization cards. An election date
is to be set this month. In addition to AFT, AFSCME and the
Teamsters have organizing drives under way for other sectors of
the state work force. </p>
<p>CWA WIRES UP WINS -- The Communication Workers in Houston and
Austin, Texas, have 155 new brothers and sisters thanks to an
agreement between the union and Southwestern Bell Communications.
Meanwhile, workers at cable companies in Michigan, New York and
California voted for CWA representation. They are the inside
technicians at Comcast Cable in Detroit, workers at Chambers
Cable Television in Chico, Calif., and the tech unit of TCI Cable
in Smithhaven, N.Y. </p>
<p>SMOOTH LANDING -- Flight Attendants at Executive Airlines,
based in San Juan, P.R., landed a first contract providing pay
increases for its 113 crew members. Attendants at the American
Eagle regional carrier joined AFA in 1995. </p>
<p>UNPLUG ELECTRIC DEREGULATION -- Utility Workers Locals 369 and
387 led 2,500 people in a rally in Boston Feb. 1 to decry the
headlong rush to deregulate and restructure the electric utility
industry. AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka closed
the rally with a rousing speech reaffirming for the workers that
&quot;we will not go gently into the long, dark night of rapid,
radical, destructive utility deregulation.&quot; </p>
<p>GOP AIMS AT OVERTIME -- While President Clinton and the
Democrats want to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act,
Republicans in both houses want to let bosses substitute comp
time for paid overtime. Workers certainly want more control over
their time at work, but the GOP bills &quot;will mean more
control for employers --and less money for working people,&quot;
Karen Nussbaum, director of the AFL-CIO's Working Women's
Department, told House and Senate committees last week. </p>
<p>AVONDALE WORKERS STAY AFLOAT -- The National Labor Relations
Board ordered Avondale Shipyard to count a final group of 550
ballots to decide a long-postponed certification ratification for
some 4,000 workers. The union needs less than 20 votes to win at
the Metairie, La., yard, where management has used a succession
of loopholes since a June 1993 election to deprive workers of
their rights. </p>
<p>TWIN CITIES' CLEAN UP -- Some 3,500 Service Employees working
in the Minneapolis-St. Paul cleaning industry have a new
three-year master contract that provides full-time employees with
wage increases and part-time workers with paid holidays. The deal
covers workers employed by 18 janitorial companies. </p>
<p>NO-FLY ZONE -- In the wake of USAir's use of an employer-
dominated employee association (AKA company union), the
Communications Workers will challenge the results of a
representation election for nearly 10,000 passenger service
workers. Although 3,973 ballots were cast in favor of CWA out of
4,190 cast and deemed valid, the Railway Labor Act requires a
majority of all eligible voters. &quot;It was clear that CWA
would have won this election under the labor laws that govern
most private- industry workers,&quot; AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney said. </p>
<p>OVERNITE MUST BARGAIN -- Two federal appeals courts ordered
Overnite Transportation to negotiate with Teamsters locals at the
company's terminals in St. Louis and Milwaukee. Both units were
elected and certified last year, but management refused to
bargain with workers. &quot;The Teamsters aren't going to let
Overnite get away with anything and, it appears, neither are the
courts,&quot; said IBT Freight Division Director Dennis Skelton.
The union is involved in a massive national organizing campaign
at the nation's largest nonunion trucking firm. </p>
<p>COMIN' INTO LOS ANGELES -- The City of Angels is the site for
the AFL-CIO Executive Council's annual winter meeting next week
-- the first the time the gathering has been held outside of Bal
Harbour, Fla. in 40 years. The Federation's trade departments
begin their meetings this week and an indoor &quot;picnic&quot;
at Union Station for L.A. union members, activists and leaders
kicks off the main event Sunday night. A march to support
organizing efforts at the New Otani Hotel in L.A. is set for
Wednesday Feb. 19. Vice President Al Gore, Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt (D-Mo.) will address the council. Executive Vice
President Linda Chavez-Thompson and a delegation of union
presidents tour the strawberry fields and workers' homes in
Watsonville, Feb. 16 and will update the council on the
strawberry campaign. </p>
<p>NY PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS OK -- New York Gov. George Pataki
(R) has OK'd project labor agreements on several public work
construction projects. Under the agreement, unions and the prime
contractors agree on terms and conditions of employment and all
project workers must join their craft union. &quot;We praise the
governor for honoring his commitment to stimulate job creation
for the working men and women of the construction industry,&quot;
said Edward J. Malloy, president of the New York State Building
Trades Council. </p>
<p>BUSTED AT YALE -- In a major reversal of policy, the National
Labor Relations Board regional office charged that Yale
University illegally threatened graduate students who
participated in a &quot;grade strike&quot; last year. The strike
was part of an action by the Graduate Employees and Students
Organization, affiliated with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees, which was seeking recognition by the school.
Previously, the NLRB has ruled that graduate students who taught
were not employees under federal labor law. </p>
<p>JIMMY AND THE BLAZERS -- Electronic Workers at GM's
&quot;sport ute&quot; assembly plant in Moraine, Ohio, ratified a
new three-year pact. The settlement comes on the heels of a
three-day strike and the rejection of an earlier GM offer that
would have included a controversial absenteeism policy. </p>
<p>BAD LIGHT AT GE -- Five months before a contract with the 14-
union Coordinated Bargaining Committee expires, GE's CEO has
thrown down the gauntlet. John Welch rejected outright three
important union bargaining goals and began preparing for strife
by declaring GE was the &quot;best prepared company in the world
to take a strike.&quot; The unions reacted with shock to Welch's
&quot;irresponsible, union busting&quot; rhetoric. </p>
<p>NO BUBBA GUMP HERE -- UNITE filed charges of race and sex
discrimination on behalf of more than 200 of its members working
at Kitchens of the Ocean shrimp processor in Deerfield Beach,
Fla. Last year, the workers overwhelmingly voted to join UNITE,
but the company refuses to bargain. </p>
<p>SEEKING SAFE WORKPLACES -- A judicial order upholding a major
lockout/tagout citation against Dayton Tire, a
Bridgestone/Firestone subsidiary, wins Steelworkers' applause.
One hundred violations carrying a total fine of $518,000 remain
on the record, including &quot;willful&quot; violations that led
to the death of Robert Julian on a tire assembly machine.
&quot;Nothing can bring back Bob Julian,&quot; Tony Carr, USWA
Local 998L safety and health chairman says, but the decision
&quot;means that Bob's coworkers will not have to face the same
hazards.&quot; </p>
<p>16-YEAR DISPUTE SETTLED -- The Denver Federation of Nurses and
Health Professionals (AFT) and St. Anthony Central and North
hospitals resolved a 16-year dispute with a settlement that calls
for the hospital to pay $381,000 to 435 technicians and licensed
practical nurses. Sixteen years ago, hospital administrators made
changes in time-off policies without negotiating with the union. </p>
<p>WAGE LAWS IGNORED -- The Massachusetts Foundation for Fair
Contracting has a new survey that finds many contractors violate
the state's prevailing wage laws by underpaying workers and
misclassifying workers. Of the 309 workers the foundation polled,
64 percent were nonunion. Of those, 43 percent had no health
insurance, 48 percent had no pension plans and 81 percent had
never received apprenticeship training, even though their
employers had promised to train them. </p>
<p>PHILLY TEACHERS BLAST TEST -- As President Clinton attempts to
put children and education first, the Philadelphia Federation of
Teachers continued its offensive against the school district's
accountability plan, blasting a standardized test that does not
measure what students have been taught. The union, which
represents 12,000 teachers, declared that the only ones to
&quot;benefit from this are the administrators who will get
bonuses for falsely inflated test scores.&quot; </p>
<p>SOMETHING IN THE OVEN -- Food and Commercial Workers Local
1059 gained a new three-year contract at Pillsbury that will
boost the hourly wage rate for workers at the Wellston, Ohio,
plant by $1.50 per hour over term. The contract, which also
increases the company pension contributions, covers 1,100
production and maintenance workers. </p>
<p>IMITATION IS NOT FLATTERY -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
urged many of the world's leading financial and political leaders
to resist copying a U.S. model of export-led growth, tight money,
tax breaks for the affluent and cutbacks for the poor,
deregulation of corporations, flexible labor markets and weakened
unions. Speaking before the World Economic Forum in Switzerland,
Sweeney warned that following that path would lead to
&quot;massive social upheaval, with far greater economic costs
than benefits.&quot; </p>
<p>SHOWING THE MONEY AT AP -- The Associated Press reached
separate, three-year labor agreements with two unions
representing 1,700 editorial and technical employees of the news
cooperative. The contracts with the Wire Service Guild and
Communication Workers both will increase salary and benefit costs
approximately 9 percent over three years. Both improve pensions
and provide for 401(k) matching. </p>
<p>DETROIT PAPERS BIASED --Four Detroit-area newspapers unfairly
kept striking Detroit newspaper pressmen from working as
substitutes in their pressrooms, an administrative law judge
ruled. The judgement against the Bay City Times, Flint Journal,
Grand Rapids Press and Saginaw News said the papers discriminated
against the strikers and violated their contract with the union.
The Times was ordered to pay five workers for lost wages as a
result of being taken off a list of possible substitutes and all
four papers were ordered to let strikers work as substitutes. </p>
<p>INDONESIAN PROTEST -- Hundreds of demonstrators chanted
&quot;Free M.P., Free M.P.&quot; as they marched in front of the
Indonesian embassy demanding the release of Indonesian labor
leader Muchtar Pakpahan. Pakpahan, known as M.P., was arrested on
trumped-up charges of subversion, and faces possible execution.
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and several international union
leaders delivered a message to the Indonesian ambassador calling
for Pakpahan's release and the granting of trade union rights. </p>

<p>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- February 3, 1997</p>
<p><br>
CHAMBER LOSES, MD. WORKERS WIN -- It's on to the bargaining table
for Maryland state workers. A circuit court in Anne Arundel
County threw out the Chamber of Commerce's lawsuit to overturn a
state employee collective bargaining executive order issued by
Gov. Parris Glendening. AFSCME Maryland won the first four union
elections covering 18,000 employees with an average victory
margin of 3-1. Ballots go out Feb. 7 for the fifth election,
covering 9,000 administrative and clerical employees. The
Teamsters and AFT also have organizing drives under way for other
sectors of Maryland state workers. </p>
<p>UNITE AT UNITED -- Home care workers at United Home Care
Services in Miami voted 78-53 for UNITE representation. The
&quot;per diem&quot; employees work only for a salary, receiving
no benefits, holidays, vacation or compensation for using their
cars during the working day. </p>
<p>TEAMSTERS DRIVE ON -- For the second time in as many months,
toll collectors on Florida's Hillsborough County's Veterans
Expressway voted and won Teamsters representation. Barton
Protective Services raised objections about the security of the
ballot box after the December win, prompting the second election
with the same results. Other recent IBT victories include: the
pilots at the Monroe, Mich.,-based Grand Aire Express; workers at
Western Container in Los Angeles; workers at the York County,
Pa., youth development center; and 24 employees at Waddington
Dairy in Salem, N.J. </p>
<p>IFPTE TAKES THE METRO -- Following up on two victories, the
International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers
sewed up two more King County, Wash., Metro transit units. The
yearlong organizing drive brings 400 new IFPTE members into the
fold. </p>
<p>COOKIES DON'T CRUMBLE -- Some 3,000 Bakery, Confectionery
&amp; Tobacco Workers at Keebler Biscuit are working under one
contract after the company agreed to bring its agreements at
recently purchased Sunshine Biscuit in line with the better
Keebler deal. The new deal raises former Sunshine workers' pay by
an additional $1 an hour over two years. It also raises pension
benefits and guarantees continued health benefits. </p>
<p>NO SCAB SEATS -- Johnson Controls backed off plans to keep two
strike-bound plants open with scab labor when Ford announced that
it would not accept nonunion products from the company. The 500
newly organized UAW members walked out Jan. 28 after talks
reached an impasse. The plants manufacture seats for Ford's
Econoline van and the hot new Expedition sports utility vehicle. </p>
<p>WRONG GUESS -- Despite Guess's attempt to silence them,
writers and poets joined a former Guess worker at the Midnight
Special Bookstore in Santa Monica, Calif., Feb. 2 to talk about
the need to organize workers. Guess tried to stop the reading and
discussion by suing Common Threads and UNITE as part of their
campaign to harass workers that are involved in organizing
activities. </p>
<p>FREE PAKPAHAN! -- Join AFL-CIO President John Sweeney,
Executive Council members and international labor leaders at the
Embassy of Indonesia this Wednesday at 1 p.m. to demonstrate
support for Muchtar Pakpahan. The Indonesian labor leader, who
was interrogated and imprisoned last summer on phony charges, now
is on trial for subversion for his defense of worker rights in
Indonesia, and faces possible execution. For more information
contact Stacey Heath at the AFL-CIO's International Affairs
Department, (202) 637- 5074. </p>
<p>ECONOMISTS SLAM BUDGET AMENDMENT -- More than 1,000 prominent
economists, including 11 Nobel laureates, condemned a balanced
budget constitutional amendment as &quot;unsound and
unnecessary.&quot; They point out that Congress and the president
can balance the budget without a constitutional amendment that
they predict would put the country in an &quot;economic
straight-jacket.&quot; It also would prevent, the economists say,
borrowing to finance &quot;infrastructure, education, research
and development, environmental protection and other investment
vital to the nation's future well-being.&quot; The Senate
Judiciary Committee approved the amendment last week and a vote
is expected in late February. House committee action is set this
week. </p>
<p>GET ON BOARD -- During Black History Month, A. Philip Randolph
and thousands of African-American railroad employees will be
remembered by the Pullman Blues Tour. The cross-country whistle-
stop railroad tour, which includes three former Pullman porters,
recalls the victories of the Sleeping Car Porters. The tour
begins in Oakland on Feb. 9, with stops in Los Angeles, Kansas
City, Mo., and St. Louis before ending in Pullman, Ill., outside
Chicago, on Feb. 16. For more information, call Norm Hill at
APRI, 202/289- 2774. </p>
<p>BACK ON TRACK -- Rail workers stayed on the job after unions
and the National Railway Labor Conference agreed to work together
to find a fair solution to differences over disability pensions.
Workers came within a hair's-breadth of a national walkout after
the Railroad Retirement Board announced drastically changed
qualifications for workplace disability pensions. </p>
<p>DON'T CHICKEN OUT ON ETHICS -- The National Interfaith
Committee for Worker Justice (NICWJ) has called for a &quot;Code
of Ethics for Poultry Companies.&quot; The action was based on
testimony from Laborers' members working at Case Farms, the North
Carolina poultry processor. The code addresses concerns about
increased worker injuries, declining income for growers and the
treatment of immigrant workers. Case Farms workers voted for
LIUNA representation in 1995, but the company refuses to
recognize the union. </p>
<p>MOTOWN MOTORS EAST -- Striking Detroit newspaper workers
carried their 18-month dispute to Washington, Boston and New York
last week. Prior to the Jan. 28 meeting of the Knight-Ridder
board, strikers and supporters traveled to the three cities and
approached directors at their homes and offices to offer
information on the strike. Editor &amp; Publisher, the leading
newspaper industry trade paper, reports that the Detroit
newspapers have lost 35 percent of their readers since the strike
began. </p>
<p>GM STRIKE OVER -- More than 4,000 workers at General Motors
Corp.'s truck assembly plant in Moraine, Ohio, returned to the
job after reaching a tentative contract agreement that ended a
strike against the automaker. The Electronic Workers said GM
agreed to settle all grievances and to scrap a more restrictive
absentee policy it had proposed. That policy led to the rejection
of an earlier contract. </p>
<p>NEEDING MORE LIFT -- In a move to bolster its leverage with
management, the Air Line Pilots asked hundreds of its members at
United Airlines to stop participating in the work of dozens of
employee committees and task forces sponsored by the carrier.
&quot;We want it recognized that we're what made this company
successful, not a couple of right moves by management,&quot; said
Kevin Dohm of ALPA. The action came a week after pilots rejected
a new pact, throwing the issue into arbitration. </p>
<p>PUTTING PATIENTS FIRST -- New Jersey residents are the lucky
beneficiaries of the new Patients First Coalition -- composed of
units from AFT, AFSCME, Operating Engineers and an independent
union. The coalition is sponsoring a public education campaign in
which patients and health care workers speak out about the
horrors of profit-gouging and cost-cutting in the health care
industry. Consumers are asked to call toll-free -- 888-PT-HELP-9
-- to tell their health care horror story. Radio spots, a
consumer survival guide and legislative H_arings on the state of
the state's health care industry also are planned. </p>
<p>GOP PAYBACK -- In a blatant move to silence labor's political
voice, Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles (R-Okla.) introduced
legislation to require unions to get written permission of
individual members and agency fee-payers before spending union
funds for political activities. Union members now have the right
to request refunds for any dues money used for political
purposes. GOP lawmakers have placed the bill high on their list
of legislative priorities. </p>
<p>JOB 1? KEEP YOUR WORD -- Ford Motor Co.'s 30,000 workers in
the United Kingdom are voting on whether to strike over the
company's decision to cut 1,300 jobs at a plant in Liverpool and
produce the new model Escort car elsewhere in Europe after the
year 2000. Ford had promised to make the Liverpool plant the
European source for the new Escort. </p>
<p>MEMBERSHIP HAS ITS ADVANTAGES -- Union membership continues to
offer a substantial economic advantage to workers. Organized
workers got $615 in median weekly earnings last year, compared
with $462 for nonunion, a 33 percent union advantage. In
manufacturing, the union advantage was about 16 percent; 42
percent for precision production craft and repair; 44 percent for
transportation and material-moving occupations and 48 percent for
machine operators, assemblers and inspectors. The pay
differential was 61 percent in the construction industry and 68
percent in such heavily unionized protective services as fire and
police. </p>
<p>TOTALLY BOGUS...NOT -- New federal legislation would restrict
Federal Aviation Administration certification of foreign aviation
repair stations, while making all domestic and foreign
maintenance facilities subject to the same operating and safety
procedures. It also would yank certification from any facility
knowingly using bogus parts. </p>
<p>CAL SEEKS SAFE SCHOOLS -- A drive by the United Teachers Los
Angeles and other teacher organizations throughout the state to
bolster student and teacher safety soon may pay off. State Sen.
Teresa Hughes is sponsoring a bill to create a code of conduct
that will require public schools to draft a discipline code and
safety plan. If enacted, school officials who fail to comply will
be subject to criminal penalty. </p>
<p>POWER TO THE PEOPLE -- A new video featuring real people from
around the country discusses the issues concerning restructuring
in the electric power industry. &quot;Power Switch,&quot;
produced by the Electrical Workers, contrasts some of the
promised benefits of competition with reality when regulatory
safeguards are removed and market pressures determine electricity
cost. For more information, call IBEW's Media Relations
Department at 202/728-6135. </p>
<p>STEEL DRIVING -- The American Labor Museum/Botto House will
open a new exhibit, &quot;Iron Men, Steel Rail: Track Labor and
the Art of Mark Priest,&quot; which includes paintings and
drawings of railroad crews portraying the agony, challenges,
issues and fellowship of workers. The exhibit will run March 1
through April 27 at the museum in Haledon, N.J. For more
information call 201/595-7953. </p>
<p>ART TAKEI DIES -- Asian-American labor pioneer Art Takei, 73,
died at his Los Angeles home Jan. 28. Interned as a teenager
during the World War II incarceration of Japanese-Americans,
Takei worked after the war as a grocery clerk and then rose
through the ranks of the Food and Commercial Workers. In 1987, he
formed the Alliance of Asian Pacific Labor and was instrumental
in the founding of the Asian-Pacific-American Labor Alliance,
AFL-CIO. A memorial service is scheduled for Feb. 8 at UFCW Local
770 in Los Angeles; call (213) 387-1974 for details. </p>

<p>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- January 28, 1997<br>
<a href="wip0121.htm"></a></p>
<p>LEVI PLANT ZIPPED UP -- The Levi Strauss plant in Blue Ridge,
Ga., agreed to recognize UNITE following a card authorization
check by more than half of its workers. UNITE also represents 750
Levi workers in Valdosta, Ga. The card checks fall under a
three-year- ago partnership agreement between the union and
company designed to increase efficiency and secure jobs, as well
as to give workers a free choice concerning union membership. </p>
<p>ORGANIZE--STAT!! -- Some 150 physicians at Thomas-Davis
Medical Clinics in Tucson, Ariz., voted to join an AFSCME
affiliate after repeated conflicts over their right to practice
medicine without being over-ruled on patient care decisions. It
was the first private sector election for the Federation of
Physicians and Dentists/National Union of Hospital and Health
Care Employees. Currently, the union represents all the
physicians employed by the state of Florida and is also involved
in organizing physicians in Albuquerque and Seattle. </p>
<p>IFPTE WINS UNIT -- Equipment specialists and production
controllers at the Naval Aviation Depot in Jacksonville, Fla.,
voted by mail to join Professional and Technical Engineers Local
22. The latest victory increases the bargaining unit to about 500
members. </p>
<p>OVERNITE SENSATION -- Workers at Overnite Transportation's New
Orleans terminal voted 16-9 for Teamster representation. This is
the 24th Overnite win since the IBT began the campaign in late
1994. </p>
<p>BEVERLY REPLACEMENT OVERTURNED -- Hundreds of illegally
replaced Beverly Enterprise nursing home workers represented by
the Service Employees must be reinstated under a district court
judge's ruling. The court upheld the National Labor Relations
Board's ruling that Beverly illegally replaced and then denied
rehire to nearly 1,000 nursing home workers who struck 15 of the
company's Pennsylvania facilities for three days last April.
Beverly faces hundreds of NLRB unfair labor practice charges for
its anti-worker antics nationwide. </p>
<p>BEVERLY PART II -- &quot;Bad Care in Beverly's Back
Yard,&quot; issued by the AFL-CIO's Food and Allied Service
Trades Department, exposes the foul conditions in Beverly-owned
nursing homes in Arkansas, the company's home state. The failures
include unsanitary environments, failure to control and prevent
infections and failure to prevent resident abuse and neglect. The
company operates 632 nursing homes in 33 states and the District
of Columbia. More than 75 percent of its $3 billion annual
revenue comes from taxpayers through Medicare and Medicaid.
Additional information is available from Unnia Pettus, SEIU,
202/898-3266; Gene Bruskin, FAST, 501/565-6306; or Greg Denier,
UFCW, 202/223-3111. </p>
<p>CURTAINS FOR HOMEWORK -- UNITE members at Richmark curtain
factory -- who went public last year with revelations of worker
abuse through industrial homework -- ratified a new three-year
contract. The contract for the Everett, Mass., workers bans
industrial homework and includes a pay raise and increased
benefits. </p>
<p>CLC COUNCIL CONVENES -- The AFL-CIO's new Union Cities and
Changing to Organize programs, plus the ongoing Strawberry and
Living Wage campaigns, topped the agenda of a weekend meeting in
Washington of the Central Labor Council Advisory Committee. The
committee is made up of CLC's from large, medium and small
communities. </p>
<p>LABORERS WIN MILLIONS FOR MEMBERS -- After more than 10 years
of courtroom battles, the Laborers won a $3.1 million settlement
for some 190 Laborers who were locked out of their jobs at
Outboard Marine Corporation in Calhoun, Ga. Following a short
walkout in 1986, the workers were rebuffed when they tried to
return to work. The settlement, the largest non-litigated award
in the history of the National Labor Relations Board's Atlanta
regional office, included back pay, bonuses and interest to the
workers. </p>
<p>SWEENEY TO SWITZERLAND -- AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney
will bring the workers' perspective to a gathering of some of the
world's most powerful business executives and influential
economic thinkers this weekend in Davos, Switzerland. While most
participants at the World Economic Forum will tout unfettered
free trade and global competition, Sweeney will remind the forum
of their obligations to working families and warn of the pitfalls
and problems of unchecked free trade. </p>
<p>PUBLIX PAYS UP -- The Food and Commercial Workers'
&quot;Women's Action Campaign&quot; reaps an $81.5 million
victory with the announcement that Publix Super Markets will pay
that amount to settle a class-action lawsuit by 150,000 female
employees who had been relegated to dead- end, low-paying jobs.
&quot;If not for the UFCW, women workers would have continued to
suffer in silence without an effective voice to demand equal
opportunity,&quot; the union said. </p>
<p>AFTRA ACTS ON MERGER -- A merger between the Television and
Radio Artists and the Screen Actors Guild was approved
overwhelmingly by AFTRA's Board of Directors. The approval set
the stage for action by members at the AFTRA convention in July.
If the convention approves the plan, the final step would be a
secret ballot mail referendum by AFTRA and SAG, which would
require approval of 60 percent of each union's membership. </p>
<p>SURPRISE, GOP TARGETS WORKERS -- Senate Republicans wasted
little time in targeting workers and their unions in the first
batch of bills introduced. S.4 would make it easier to replace
paid overtime with comp time and S.9 would limit unions' rights
to spend money for political purposes. Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) called the comp time bill a &quot;step
backward&quot; in worker protection. The Dems also introduced
bills on campaign finance reform, children's health coverage,
education and other &quot;family first&quot; measures. </p>
<p>CAT STRIKE WAS &quot;UNFAIR&quot; -- The UAW's 18-month strike
against Caterpillar Inc. was based on a pattern of unfair labor
practices, the NLRB found. The complaint issued against
Caterpillar stems from the discharge of 11 workers following the
strike. The NLRB said the strike was caused by a pattern of
unfair labor practices and was &quot;prolonged by unfair labor
practices.&quot; The ruling &quot;confirms that Caterpillar
management, through harsh and numerous violations of workers'
rights was directly responsible for the unfair labor practices
strike,&quot; UAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker said. </p>
<p>BLACK LUNG BENEFITS -- Coal miners with black lung and their
survivors will face a more fair fight in the battle with coal
operators over black benefits under new DoL proposals. The
proposal would cap the amount of evidence that can be submitted.
While a miner may be able to secure evidence from a doctor or
black lung clinic, companies deluge the process with dozens of
opinions that can drag out the claims process for years and many
black lung victims die before claims are settled. </p>
<p>SMOOTH SAILING AHEAD -- Bowing to union pressure, American
President Lines agreed to place nine container vessels in the new
U.S.-flag Maritime Security Program, ensuring U.S.-citizen crews.
The decision followed a one-day strike by the Marine Engineers,
supported by other waterfront unions. Also under the plan, APL
agreed to re-flag four ships that have circumvented U.S. labor
laws by flying the Marshall Islands flag. </p>
<p>HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM -- Voters shot down a living wage
of $6.50 for Houston workers by a 3-1 margin in a Jan. 18 special
election. Opponents spent more than $1 million in a scare
campaign. The labor-backed measure would have lifted out of
poverty thousands of children with working parents and directly
affected more than 200,000 workers. The Living Wage Campaign said
it would continue its efforts for a higher wage. </p>
<p>MILL SAPS SAFETY -- Paperworkers, Machinists and Electrical
Workers at the S.D. Warren paper mill in Skowhegan, Maine were
not surprised by 13 OSHA citations against their employer and a
proposed fine in excess of $110,000. &quot;Employee safety and
health has taken a low priority since SAPPI bought S.D.
Warren,&quot; said UPIU Local 9 President Carl Turner. Workers
have been without a contract for 13 months and now are working
under management-imposed conditions. SAPPI workers in South
Africa, Great Britain and Germany have pledged support. </p>
<p>FREE TRADE, HIT OR MYTH? -- A new study shatters the myth that
free trade is always a good deal for workers. The report,
released by the Institute for Policy Studies and the Great Cities
Institute, finds that most trade-related job claims are based on
export data but often ignores the impact of imports on jobs and
wages. Further, increasingly mobile corporations have no
incentive or requirement to use export profits to raise wages or
create jobs, instead they spend the money to finance activities
that do just the opposite. &quot;Government officials, business
leaders and many economists are using unwarranted claims about
jobs and trade to sell the free- trade model across the
globe,&quot; University of Illinois-Chicago professor David
Ranney said. </p>
<p>HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATES -- Service Employees President Andy
Stern, Communications Workers Local 1109 President Tony Matarazzo
and investment consultant Michael Hirsch were honored for their
efforts in promoting human rights in the workplace by the Jewish
Labor Committee. </p>
<p>NEW IN JERSEY -- Charles Wowkanech was elected president of
the New Jersey AFL-CIO and Laurel Brennan became the first women
to assume a top leadership post when she was elected
secretary/treasurer. Wowkanech will serve out the remaining three
years of retiree Charlie Marciante's four-year term. Marciante
was president of the state federation since 1969. Brennan, a
veteran garment industry organizer, was UNITE's assistant manager
for the Philadelphia/South Jersey District Council. </p>
<p>AFTRA-3, NBC-0 -- The Television and Radio Artists won a third
legal battle to force NBC to provide essential information to
which the union is entitled. A federal appeals court upheld
rulings by the NLRB and an administrative law judge that NBC must
furnish AFTRA with documentation of its relationship to three
subsidiary operations. </p>
<p>GETTING REAL -- Real average hourly wages rose 0.2 percent in
December, bringing the year's increase to 0.5 percent. Real
weekly earnings were up 1.1 percent for the month, reflecting a
0.9 percent rise in hours worked. Meanwhile, consumer prices rose
a modest 0.3 percent, the same as the previous three months. </p>
<p>BRANDEIS LANDS REICH -- Former Secretary of Labor Robert B.
Reich joins the faculty of Massachusetts' Brandeis University. He
will teach graduate and undergraduate students across disciplines
and departments and also establish a Center on Jobs, the Economy
and Society.</p>

<p align="left">AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- January 13, 1997</p>
<p>WORKERS GET WINNING HAND -- The Teamsters were on a roll in
three separate organizing wins last week. Dealers at the
Tropicana Casino in Atlanta City voted 407-357 for the IBT, which
also won an election, 21-3, to represent workers at the Forsythe
&amp; Associates Commuter Bus Co. in Scottsdale, Ariz. At New
York's LaGuardia Airport, Local 851 gained 40 full-time cargo
warehouse and clerical employees at Ogden Services Corp. The vote
was 27-1. </p>
<p>TWIN STRATEGY -- Service Employees Local 250 in northern
California found two different ways to provide the benefits of
unionism to hospital workers. Local 250 won a late-December
election to represent 49 respiratory therapists at Salinas Valley
Memorial Hospital, and in the same week negotiated a new contract
with Brookside Hospital that will bring 150 new members into the
local. </p>
<p>MORE SEIU SCORES -- Metro Action Commission workers --
teachers, aides and bus drivers for the Head Start program in
Nashville, Tenn. -- voted 125-40 to join SEIU Local 205.
Meanwhile, two other SEIU locals won elections to represent
nearly 200 nursing home workers in Westbury, Conn., and
Annandale, Minn. </p>
<p>WORKERS UNITED -- In the second card-check recognition by FDR
Laundry, UNITE garnered 90 percent of the 100 workers at the
company's facility in Front Royal, Va. UNITE also won a
hard-fought campaign among a diverse immigrant work force at MRC
Industries in Queens, N.Y., as the workers voted 93-27 for union
recognition. </p>
<p>SAME OLD SONG -- House Republicans decided to keep Speaker
Newt Gingrich, architect of the anti-worker &quot;Contract on
America&quot; in the last Congress, but will change the name
(again) of the chief labor committee. Named the Economic and
Educational Opportunities Committee 24 months ago, the panel now
is the Education and Workforce Committee, although its tune is
much the same. First out of the chute: a bill by Rep. Cass
Ballenger (R-N.C.) that would allow employers to offer comp time
instead of overtime pay. On a positive note, Rep. William Clay
(D-Mo.) introduced legislation to increase the number of hours
workers are allowed to take off under the Family and Medical
Leave Act. </p>
<p>SPEAK OUT -- Workers are encouraged to attend Working Family
Issue Forums in Connecticut and New York on Tuesday, Jan. 14, to
meet their member of Congress and help set an agenda for the
year. Rep. Jim Maloney (D) will meet with workers at the
Hotchkiss Hose Co. No. 1 on David Humphrey Road in Derby, Conn.,
at 6:30 p.m., while Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D) will be at the
Plumbers' Hall at 137 Willis Ave. in Mineola, N.Y., at 7 p.m. In
Connecticut, call Roger Clayman at 860/571-6191; in New York,
call Jack Caffey at 516/228-4940. </p>
<p>FIRST CITY -- Nearly 300 local union leaders from the
Baltimore metropolitan area, meeting in Atlantic City, N.J., last
week, urged the city central labor council board to be the first
to adopt the AFL-CIO Union City program. The new program supports
unions working together to organize, mobilize members, form
grassroots political action networks and build community
coalitions. For information, call Scott Reynolds at 202/637-5226. </p>
<p>LIGHT SHINES ON JOBS -- As many as 3,000 new construction jobs
will be created as the result of a project agreement between the
AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department and the
University of California's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
to construct the nation's superlaser, the National Ignition
Facility. The $1.1 billion superlaser will allow scientists to
check aging nuclear warheads. </p>
<p>SEOUL BROTHERS AND SISTERS -- AFL-CIO Executive Vice President
Linda Chavez-Thompson delivered a package of protest letters to
the Korean labor attache during a demonstration Jan. 10 at the
Korean Embassy. The situation in Korea is rapidly deteriorating,
with mass arrests of trade union leaders, police violence against
strikers and businesses demanding that unions be forced to pay
for their financial losses. Last month, federation President John
Sweeney called on the Korean government to scrap a new labor law
that pulls the rug out from under workers' rights. </p>
<p>VOICE FOR JUSTICE -- Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich left
office last week with a vow to continue speaking out for economic
justice. The Clinton administration's &quot;unfinished agenda is
to address widening inequality&quot; between the rich and poor in
this nation, Reich said in a Jan. 9 speech. He also warned that
some proposals to fix Social Security and Medicare would only
aggravate economic inequality, not end it. Reich was given a
surprise farewell reception Jan. 8 at AFL-CIO headquarters. </p>
<p>IN THE LINE OF DUTY -- Electronic Workers are mourning the
deaths of union members Charles Jones, Greg Douchard and Arthur
Brice, who were aboard the commuter plane that crashed last week
in Ida, Mich. They were on their way to the formal signing of an
historic three-year contract with the Packard Division of General
Motors in Brookhaven, Miss. </p>
<p>CORPORATE TAKE GIVING -- Companies are beginning to yield to
pressure from unions and other shareholders in cutting off
pensions for outside directors, the Conference Board reports.
Still, 43 percent of the companies surveyed said they still give
these retirement benefits to non-employee directors. </p>
<p>UNIONS POUR IN TO HELP -- The AFL-CIO's Western area community
services liaisons have been busy establishing food banks and
offering assistance for families affected by the floods in
Sacramento, Calif., and Northern Nevada. Workers from some of the
larger construction locals in Sacramento are volunteering to make
repairs. </p>
<p>RIGHT TO VOTE IT DOWN -- A last-minute effort to pass right-
to-work legislation in Illinois was shot down by quick-acting
workers and their leaders. The attack on labor, which came in the
waning hours of the 89th General Assembly Jan. 7, was denounced
also by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Attempts by the
business lobby to slash workers' compensation and unemployment
insurance failed to move during the final days as well. </p>
<p>TWIN-CITY WAGES -- The drive for living wages received a shot
in the arm from the St. Paul, Minn., City Council, which voted to
require businesses receiving at least $100,000 in city aid to pay
their workers the equivalent of at least 110 percent of the
federal poverty level for a family of four -- currently about
$8.25 an hour. Those providing basic health care would be
required to pay 100 percent. The initiative awaits the signature
of Mayor Norm Coleman (R), and a similar proposal is likely to
come up before the Minneapolis City Council next month. </p>
<p>ON THE RIGHT TRACK -- Rail workers at Norfolk &amp; Western
Railway Co. who took early retirement after signing liability
releases for their employer are still free to make claims against
management, a federal appeals court ruled. The workers, who
suffered hearing loss from exposure to excessive noise on the
job, sought relief under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.
The court ruled the release cannot serve as a bar to the
plaintiff's claims under FELA &quot;unless the release was
clearly executed as a settlement for their hearing-loss
injuries.&quot; </p>
<p>DRY DOCK -- Labor scofflaw Avondale Shipyards was slapped by
the National Labor Relations Board's general counsel, who asked
an NLRB judge to approve extraordinary measures to end
&quot;outrageous&quot; and &quot;pervasive&quot; labor law
violations. The yard, the target of a four-year organizing
campaign by the New Orleans Metal Trades Council, has been the
site of hundreds of unfair labor practices and health and safety
violations, and is the subject of a two-year trial. The latest
trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 27. </p>
<p>BERRY NICE CARDS -- The Strawberry Workers Campaign's
notecards featuring pastels by artist Tony Ortega are still
available for $10 for a set of 12 or $25 for three sets. To
order, call 202/637-5043 and ask for item No. 271. Proceeds
support the campaign to improve the lives of 20,000 California
strawberry workers. More on the campaign follows on Page 3 of
this report. </p>
<p>CLOCK IS TICKING -- A federal judge has denied supermarket
giant Albertson's bid to slow a suit by its California employees
alleging illegal off-the-clock work. The judge also ruled that
25,000 more employees can join the suit, which is being supported
by the Food and Commercial Workers. </p>
<p>GIANT STEP -- Striking Teamster drivers for Giant Food asked
the chain's British owners, J. Sainsbury PLC, to sign a code of
conduct pledging that it will not undercut the prevailing wages
and benefits that exist in communities where they own stores. The
drivers have been on strike since Dec. 15 after Giant demanded
that it be allowed to contract out the drivers' jobs to non-union
firms as they retire. </p>
<p>INTEREST YIELD -- Air Line Pilots at Atlantic Coast Airlines
credit interest-based bargaining for a new tentative accord. The
process, under which both sides meet and identify shared
interests before staking out positions, &quot;has strengthened
labor-management relations at Atlantic Coast,&quot; said Capt.
Jeff Brundage, who chairs ALPA's Master Executive Council at the
carrier. The pact would increase compensation and improve work
rules for 500 pilots at the United Express commuter. Members will
vote before the end of the month. </p>
<p>STEADY AS SHE GOES -- The unemployment rate remained unchanged
in December at 5.3 percent, matching the average for the last two
quarters of 1996. However, the government's alternative measure,
which includes marginally attached workers like those discouraged
or working part time involuntarily, was 9.2 percent, up from 8.9
percent in November. Payroll jobs increased by 262,000, led by a
112,000-job increase in the services industry. Manufacturing
added 19,000 jobs. </p>
<p>TEMPORARY CHIEF AT OSHA -- Deputy Assistant Secretary for OSHA
Gregory Watchman has been designated acting OSHA head while the
Clinton administration searches for a permanent replacement for
Joseph A. Dear. Watchman previously served as counsel to the
Senate Labor and Human Resources labor subcommittee and as
associate counsel for civil rights with the House Education and
Labor Committee. </p>
<p>THE ENVELOPE, PLEASE -- The Sidney Hillman Foundation, whose
prizes honor journalism that investigates issues relating to
social justice and public policy, is accepting submissions for
1996. For the first time, a &quot;UNITE&quot; award will be
presented to individuals whose work brings together disparate
people or groups locally or globally. The deadline for
submissions is Jan. 17. For more information, call Executive
Director JoAnn Mort at 212-265-7000, ext. 725. </p>
<p>HEALTH TRAINING -- The National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences is sponsoring a technical workshop at the George
Meany Center for Labor Studies in Silver Spring, Md., Jan. 23-24
on training partnerships to promote worker safety and health. For
more information, call 301/431-5425; or FAX at 301/431-6464; or
e-mail at chouse@dgs.dgsys.com. </p>
<p>Support Strawberry Workers </p>
<p>Why we do it </p>
<p>&quot;They have a contract&quot; </p>
<p>Jorge wants to be a doctor. &quot;What I like to do best is to
study. I've always had that idea of getting ahead,'` he says. But
for the last six years Jorge has picked strawberries along with
20,000 other California workers, earning about $8,500 a season. </p>
<p>What he's learned in the fields: strawberry workers don't do
nearly as well as workers in some other crops. </p>
<p>The reason others do better: _They have a contract.&quot; </p>
<p>So, the 24-year-old strawberry picker got involved with the
United Farm Workers organizing drive last year. He believes
organizing a union will lead to better wages, a family health
insurance plan and some sort of pension similar to what workers
have in crops such as mushrooms and roses. </p>
<p>It wouldn't take much to improve conditions for strawberry
workers. For only 5&quot; more per pint of strawberries, workers'
piece pay rates could increase by at least 50 percent. But, the
$650 million-a-year strawberry industry is standing in the way,
fighting workers like Jorge and their attempt to improve their
lives. </p>
<p>Needed: 20,000 people </p>
<p>You can change the world -- or, at least a piece of it. </p>
<p>A broad coalition will meet in Watsonville April 13 to support
The Strawberry Workers Campaign. Activities will culminate with a
march that aims to attract 20,000 people from throughout the U.S. </p>
<p>Central Labor Councils, state federations and international
unions are helping to build support for the march. </p>
<p>For information, call 202-637-5280. </p>
<p>Taking the lead </p>
<p>Ralphs, the largest supermarket chain in California and the
sixth-largest chain in the nation, topped the news in December as
it signed on to The Strawberry Workers Campaign. </p>
<p>In a Dec. 20 announcement at the Los Angeles County Federation
of Labor, the 408-store chain backed the drive for basic rights
for strawberry workers. A store executive signed the pledge
supporting a living wage, clean drinking water and bathrooms, job
security, health insurance and an end to abuses such as sexual
harassment. </p>
<p>Ralphs joins several other large chains, including two in New
York City -- Key Food, with 130 stores, and Gristedes and Sloans,
with 62 stores. CLCs are working toward producing more signees
around the nation. </p>
<p>l Local governments are lining up behind the campaign. CLCs
have helped organize resolutions of support in Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, Los Angeles and San
Francisco. </p>
<p>l The Strawberry Workers Campaign tour that helped build
support in the Northeast will travel the Midwest in February, not
January as originally planned. Tours are also being planned for
the West Coast and a return trip is being set for the Northeast. </p>
<p>l The more than 40 member groups of the National Strawberry
Commission for Workers' Rights are developing local support
networks. Member groups plan to tell their members and the public
why the strawberry workers' fight is their fight. The commission
is also planning to send a delegation to the strawberry fields
this spring. </p>

<p align="left">AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- January 6, 1997</p>
<p>JUSTICE CONEXION -- Sprint Corp. must rehire and pay back
wages to 177 workers, mostly Hispanic women, who were fired in
1995 a week before they were set to vote for union representation
by the Communications Workers, the National Labor Relations Board
ruled. The board accused a Sprint vice president of falsifying
documents to make it appear the company was concerned about
finances at La Conexion Familiar, the Spanish-language facility
in San Francisco, when it was shut down. Sprint was ordered to
rehire the workers in equivalent positions, or place them on a
preferential hiring list. Back pay could amount to $15 million.
Sprint says it will appeal. </p>
<p>HEALTH CARE HURRAHS -- AFT scored victories at hospitals in
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as nurses at Philadelphia's Episcopal
Hospital rang in the new year Jan. 1 with a 210-31 vote for
representation by the Health Professionals and Allied Employees
and nearly 600 service and support workers at St. Francis
Hospital in Milwaukee gave themselves an early Christmas present
Dec. 18 with a 296-208 pro-union vote. Local 5001 of the
Wisconsin Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals already
represents nurses at the facility. </p>
<p>BULLISH ON UNION -- CWA gained 2,500 employees at Dow Jones
when the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees voted
overwhelmingly (985-311) to affiliate. The new CWA members work
at the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, Dow Jones Information
Service and WBIS-TV. </p>
<p>FIGHT GOES ON -- The Electrical Workers will file objections
and unfair labor practice charges against Baltimore Gas &amp;
Electric after workers rejected the union by a 2-1 margin.
&quot;It is a shame that the laws of our nation allow
corporations to abuse the rights of their workers in this
manner,&quot; said IBEW President John Barry, who accused
BG&amp;E of harassing union supporters, offering wage increases
only if workers voted against the union, and spending nearly $40
million to keep the union out, much of it in fees to the notorous
union-busting consultants, the Burke Group. </p>
<p>HOLD THAT LINE -- In suburban Chicago, 24 of 25 workers in a
cable TV bargaining unit signed a petition urging voluntary
recognition of the IBEW by Time Warner DuPage, and 20 of the
workers showed up in person to present the petition. But the
company said it would require a representation election and has
sought to dilute the bargaining unit by including workers from
two other locations. Tell Time Warner to do the right thing and
recognize these workers' right to a union. Call (708/430-4840) or
FAX (708/430-1870) to Ron Murray, regional manager, Time Warner
Cable in Hickory Hills, Ill. </p>
<p>SNEAK ATTACK -- New labor laws rammed through by South Korea's
majority government in a secret session &quot;turns back the
clock on democratic reform and fundamentally undermines workers'
rights,&quot; AFL-CIO President John Sweeney declared, praising
South Korean trade unions for their general strike in opposition.
Sweeney urged South Korea's president to veto the legislation. </p>
<p>SIGNATURE VICTORY -- In a major victory against corporate
greed, the NLRB backed 300 members of the Graphic Communictions
Union at American Signature in Atlanta, ordering the company to
reinstate the strikers with full backpay. The workers, fired in
1993 after wages were slashed, were supported by a coalition of
other unions, clergy and activists. </p>
<p>BLACK DAY AT RED CROSS -- Some 70 Service Employees members
who collect blood in West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio went on
strike Dec. 30 over wages, benefits and a proposal to allow
technicians to perform tasks now done by nurses. The workers
rejected an offer that would have raised wages by 9 percent over
three years and brought higher insurance premiums. The employees
average $7.95 per hour. The Red Cross also proposed discontinuing
payments for nurses' continuing education and a $100 annual
allowance for uniforms. </p>
<p>SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY -- A plan to preserve and strengthen
Social Security was unveiled Monday by six of 13 advisory council
members, including AFL-CIO Vice Presidents George Kourpias of the
Machinists and Gloria Johnson of the Electronic Workers, and
Gerald Shea, assistant to AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. They
joined Robert Ball, former Social Security commissioner, in
rejecting Wall Street privatization schemes advanced by other
members of the advisory council. &quot;Our plan will stabilize
Social Security for the next 75 years without huge tax increases
and benefit cuts,&quot; Shea said. The plan includes options to
lengthen the averaging period from 35 to 38 years or to increase
contributions by 0.15 percent, and to move toward a
public-private investment strategy that would put 40 percent of
Social Security funds in an indexed, passively managed portfolio
of equities. </p>
<p>SUPPORT FOR HOUSTON VICTIMS -- The Machinists are mourning the
loss of eight members who died in a pre-Christmas blast at the
Wyman- Gordon Forging Co. in Houston. Two other members of IAM
Local Lodge 15 hurt in the explosion were hospitalized and have
returned home. &quot;Our hearts go out to those who have lost
loved ones in this catastrophe,&quot; said IAM President George
J. Kourpias, who characterized the men as &quot;American working
heroes.&quot; A memorial service is planned for Jan. 12 in
Houston. </p>
<p>A DONE DEAR -- OSHA Administrator Joseph Dear has stepped down
to become chief of staff to the governor-elect of Washington,
Gary Locke. Dear previously was Washington's labor commissioner
and had worked for the state AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>ERGO, IT'S GONE -- In a victory for California workers, the
state Office of Administrative Law has sided with the AFL-CIO in
rejecting as unclear and unenforceable a number of provisions in
the new ergonomics standard. Sending the regulation back to the
Cal-OSHA Standards Board, the OAL cited several of the reasons
raised in a suit filed by the California Labor Federation.
&quot;We are continuing to pursue our legal action to assure that
the Standards Board provides meaningful, enforceable
protections,&quot; said Art Pulaski, executive
secretary-treasurer of the state fed. </p>
<p>GET THE LEAD OUT -- Beginning this month, workers will benefit
from a new program to cut lead exposure if they work in such
industries as battery, manufacturing, lead smelting, lead
chemicals, fabrication using lead and solder manufacturing. The
Lead Industries Association Inc. and the Battery Council
International - - representing some 33 companies -- have agreed
to participate in a voluntary initiative to lower workers'
exposure to lead. The companies will provide protective gear and
engineering devices and offer educational training. </p>
<p>AND THEY'RE OFF -- Bridgestone/Firestone has been removed from
the AFL-CIO's official boycott list at the request of the
Steelworkers. USWA members and the company have ratified
contracts at plants across the country. Meanwhile, Unoven has
been removed from the list at the request of the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers. OCAW Local 7-517 has ratified an agreement
with the company at the Lemont, Ill., refinery. </p>
<p>HOLIDAY HELP -- Texas Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers locked
out by Crown Petroleum since February received a seasonal boost
of more than $6,000 and four pick-up loads of food from fellow
union members. The Gulf Coast Organizing Committee, Houston Gulf
Coast Building Trades and Electrical Workers Local 66 made
donations to the Crown Hardship Fund and collected food in boxes
at local union halls to help the members of OCAW 4227. </p>
<p>A RANSOM FOR GOOD NAME -- Responding to numerous complaints by
members, the Machinists are seeking $50 million-plus in damages
from Walt Disney Pictures &amp; Television Inc. and two script
writers over the union's portrayal in Mel Gibson's latest movie,
&quot;Ransom.&quot; Gibson plays an airline executive whose past
includes bribing a corrupt union official described as being with
the &quot;Machinists Union,&quot; and the film contains
references to &quot;Machinists Union indictments.&quot; The
company has rejected requests to drop the references. </p>
<p>SENDING A MESSAGE -- A recorded message for members of the Air
Line Pilots at United Airlines signals some dark clouds ahead in
labor- management relations at the employee-owned airline.
Although union leaders approved a contract that members are
voting on this month, they are &quot;disappointed and
angered&quot; by the company position during talks, said Michael
H. Glawe, president of the union's United council. </p>
<p>BAR THE DOOR -- Teamsters President Ron Carey urged Rodney
Slater, President Clinton's choice for new transportation
secretary, to continue a year-long delay in implementing trucking
provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The IBT
contends Mexican trucks are on average three times older and up
to twice as heavy as American trucks, while often lacking
adequate insurance and not complying with U.S. air emission
standards. Giving Mexican trucks access to the four border
states, with total North American access in 2000, would be
&quot;disastrous for highway safety, environmental quality and
good jobs,&quot; Carey said. </p>
<p>JOBS ON DEATH ROW -- Federal Prison Industries announced it
plans to increase its production of office desks, credenzas and
bookcases by almost $40 million a year. The expansion, the third
in less than a year by the government corporation, which supplies
federal agencies, will further retard employment opportunities in
the private sector. </p>
<p>FINDERS, KEEPERS -- You may have already won part of a $10
million jackpot the federal government wants to give away -- if
you are one of 3,000 retirees from 565 companies with terminated
pension plans covered by the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corp. The
Labor Department's &quot;Pension Search Directory&quot; lists
workers, the name and location of their companies and the date
the pension plan ended, and is available on the Internet by
accessing www.dol.gov or http://search.pbgc.gov. Those finding
themselves on the list should contact the PBGC immediately at
1/800-326-LOST. The directory is updated quarterly. </p>
<p>DECK THE HALLS -- Painters at V.R.D. Decorating in Rochester,
N.Y., got a special gift in time for their Christmas party when
they read on their bulletin board a notice from management
admitting that it had violated federal labor law. The posting,
required by the NLRB, came after Local 150 uncovered numerous
union-busting activities, including &quot;losing&quot; the job
applications of identified union members, who are now eligible
for back wages. </p>
<p>OAKLAND STRIKE EXHIBIT -- &quot;We Called it a Work Holiday:
The 1946 Oakland General Strike&quot; exhibit at the Oakland
Museum of California runs through Feb. 23. The exhibit
commemorates the 50th anniversary of the citywide strike in 1946.
The museum is located at 1000 Oak Street. </p>
<p>RELIGION IN CONTEXT -- How the media reports, or does not
report, religious news is the topic of a panel discussion set for
New York City Friday, Jan. 24, 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. The influence of
the religious right also will be discussed. The event, organized
by the Metro NY Labor Communications Council, will be at Judson
Memorial Church, Thompson St. &amp; Washington Square South.</p>

<p>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- December 23, 1996<br>
<br>
YALE, YALE, THE UNION'S HERE -- Yale University's corporate-<br>
like agenda to slash pay and benefits and outsource jobs crumbled<br>
last week when the school agreed to a six-year pact for 4,000<br>
workers. The contract with Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees<br>
Locals 34 and 35 includes extraordinary job security and pension<br>
improvements, part-time worker protection and increased health
care<br>
benefits. Yale's cave-in came one week after AFL-CIO President
John<br>
Sweeney and 311 others were arrested in protest against Yale's<br>
downsizing efforts. &quot;United,&quot; Sweeney said,
&quot;workers can beat back<br>
corporate profiteers at rich institutions, on Wall Street and in<br>
corporate board rooms all across the nation.&quot;<br>
<br>
WE WILL BERRY YOU -- California's largest food retailer, the<br>
Ralph's chain, Friday endorsed the 5 Cents for Fairness campaign
to<br>
improve conditions for the state's strawberry workers. The
company,<br>
which has hundreds of Southern California stores, joined with the<br>
Farm Workers, Food and Commercial Workers and other labor and<br>
advocacy groups in Los Angeles to sign a pledge endorsing the<br>
campaign to win a livable wage, health care, clean drinking water<br>
and sanitation facilities and protection from sexual harassment
and<br>
arbitrary firings for 20,000 California strawberry workers.<br>
<br>
USWA VICTORIOUS AT BRIDGESTONE -- The Steelworker's two-and-a-<br>
half-year battle with Bridgestone/Firestone came to a winning<br>
conclusion Friday. USWA members at the tiremaker's LaVergne,
Tenn.,<br>
plant ratified a new contract. Workers at six other sites OK'd<br>
pacts this month. The vote means &quot;Steelworkers at all of<br>
Bridgestone/Firestone's U.S. plants will be working under fair<br>
agreements . . . the primary goal of the campaign and
boycotts,&quot;<br>
USWA President George Becker said. After the vote the
Steelworkers<br>
called for an end to the consumer boycott and worldwide corporate<br>
campaign against the company.<br>
<br>
HERMAN CHOICE HAILED -- Alexis M. Herman, President Clinton's<br>
selection as labor secretary, &quot;knows and understands working<br>
families concerns...and I know she is committed to putting
together<br>
a strong team to fight for good jobs, justice and dignity for<br>
America's working families,&quot; said AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney.<br>
Herman currently serves as director of Clinton's Public Liaison<br>
Office, and previously was chief of staff for the late Ron Brown<br>
during his tenure at the Democratic National Committee. During
the<br>
Carter administration, Herman was director of DoL's Women's
Bureau.<br>
<br>
FALLON ON GOOD TIMES -- Workers at McDonnell Douglas on the<br>
VanVoorhis Naval Air Station in Fallon, Nev., voted to join the<br>
Electronic Workers. The addition of more than 250 mechanics at
the<br>
&quot;Top Gun&quot; base concludes a good IUE organizing year
that saw more<br>
than 5,000 new members come aboard.<br>
<br>
GRASSROOTS TAKING HOLD -- Last week, union political activists<br>
met with 10 U.S. senators and representatives in initial
grassroots<br>
meetings in five states. Labor's goal is 150 face-to-face get-<br>
togethers with lawmakers before March.<br>
<br>
KEEP THE BRAKES ON -- Last year, at the urging of the<br>
Teamsters, President Clinton delayed a provision of the North<br>
American Free Trade Agreement that would have allowed Mexican<br>
trucks unlimited access to U.S. highways. Now the trucking
industry<br>
and GOP governors Pete Wilson of California and George Bush of<br>
Texas want the ban lifted -- despite evidence that most of these<br>
trucks are improperly licensed, driven by underage drivers, and<br>
have broken suspensions, substandard tires, inoperable brakes and<br>
unsecured loads. IBT is calling for a permanent ban.<br>
<br>
WORKING FAMILIES AGENDA -- 1. Good jobs and pay, including<br>
protecting wage and safety standards, non-discrimination and the<br>
right to organize. 2. Education, including affordable college and<br>
strong job training programs. 3. Health care, including
protecting<br>
health care programs for the elderly and poor and providing<br>
affordable and accessible care for working families. 4. Social<br>
Security and Pensions, fighting against Wall Street schemes to<br>
pillage Social Security and fighting for new ways to protect and<br>
expand private pensions. 5. Fair tax, trade and economic
policies,<br>
including ending tax breaks to U.S. firms that send jobs overseas<br>
and protecting worker rights in trade and economic policies to<br>
create more jobs. The Council meets in February for a more
detailed<br>
study of legislative strategy.<br>
<br>
LABORERS RE-ELECT COIA -- In its first-ever rank-and-file<br>
vote, the Laborers re-elected President Arthur Coia by a 2-1
margin<br>
over Bruno Caruso, president of Local 1001 in Chicago. The
members<br>
also approved a referendum to elect all future executive board<br>
members by rank-and-file vote. Coia called his win &quot;a clear
vote of<br>
confidence for the internal reforms efforts we began two years
ago<br>
in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice.&quot;<br>
<br>
SWEATIN' THE BOSSES -- A walkout by immigrant Latino sweatshop<br>
workers at the Rubberstampede factory in Oakland, Calif., has<br>
stirred up city and state government officials. The strikers
charge<br>
the company with speeding up production, paying low wages and<br>
violating their legal right to organize. The city council wants<br>
hearings to jump-start negotiations, and a state legislator is<br>
calling for testimony before the state's labor committee. The<br>
Longshoremen and Warehousemen are challenging the company's
tactics<br>
in an earlier election, and an NLRB hearing is set for January.<br>
<br>
MEGA-MERGER TALKS -- Machinists President George Kourpias will<br>
meet with the CEOs of Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas after the<br>
holidays to discuss the companies' planned merger. &quot;However
the<br>
merger talks proceed,&quot; Kourpias said, &quot;the IAM's
commitments remain<br>
the same. We are committed to promoting domestic aerospace<br>
production, because a solid base of aerospace jobs and
technologies<br>
is indispensable to a modern, high-wage economy.&quot;<br>
<br>
CARDINAL RULES -- BADLY -- Some 450 Catholic high school<br>
teachers for the Archdiocese of New York held a series of rallies<br>
and &quot;sickouts&quot; to protest Cardinal John O'Connor's
decision to<br>
renege on the recently approved contract between the archdiocese<br>
and its teachers, represented by the Laborers. The cardinal wants<br>
the teachers to include a &quot;mission statement&quot; that
would subject<br>
teachers to terminations without hearings on such issues as<br>
divorced teachers dating, certain kinds of demonstrations and<br>
criticizing of principals.<br>
<br>
IUE/GM PACTS -- The Electronic Workers approved a new contract<br>
with General Motors on behalf of 38,000 employees and retirees.
The<br>
agreement includes &quot;unprecedented provisions&quot; for job
security and<br>
&quot;includes no give-backs or take-aways,&quot; said GM
Conference Chairman<br>
Ron Gilvin, IUE's secretary-treasurer-elect. Meanwhile, UAW GM<br>
workers signed their new contract, bringing to an end the Big
Three<br>
auto talks. <br>
<br>
ACROSS UNITE STATES -- UNITE's 1,110 Healthtex workers in<br>
Centreville, Ala., Warrenton, Ga., and Danville, Va., ratified a<br>
three-year contract with job security language and the
elimination<br>
of a two-tier system. In Charlotte, N.C., 600 UNITE workers at
the<br>
TJ Maxx Distribution Center ratified a new three-year contract.
In<br>
Maryville, Tenn., 460 workers at the BTR Sealing Systems Group<br>
Finishing plant accepted a new two-year contract. UNITE workers
at<br>
two Brooks Brothers plants, in Kinston and Garland, N.C.,
approved<br>
a new three-year pact. The contract continues health care
benefits,<br>
increases wages and pensions. And 400 UNITE workers at North<br>
Carolina's Mohawk Industries facility have a new three-year deal<br>
that includes an annual 3 percent wage hike, improvements in the<br>
bonus program, seniority rights and training pay.<br>
<br>
PACT PEAKS WAGES -- Mine Workers who drive shuttle buses at<br>
Denver International Airport ratified their first contract last<br>
week, gaining a $2 wage increase over term, lower health costs,<br>
more sick leave, life insurance, a grievance procedure and strong<br>
safety language. The 150 Republic Parking workers become UMWA
8431,<br>
in honor of their 84-31 vote for UMWA representation.<br>
<br>
THE RIGHTS STUFF -- For the first time, the World Trade<br>
Organization's members pledge to observe core labor standards,<br>
including freedom of association, the right to organize and<br>
bargaining collectively, nondiscrimination in the workplace and a<br>
prohibition against exploitative child labor. But AFL-CIO
President<br>
John Sweeney cautions that more needs to be done. Maintaining the<br>
standards is essential &quot;if the international trading system
is to<br>
raise living standards for working people around the globe.&quot;<br>
<br>
GIANT BROUHAHA -- The delivery trucks have stopped rolling at<br>
Giant Food supermarkets in the Baltimore-Washington area as 320<br>
Teamster drivers walked out Dec. 18 after contract talks failed.
At<br>
issue is Giant's insistence that drivers accept the same<br>
concessions as did drivers at Safeway, its top competitor in the<br>
area. Giant also wants to contract out direct deliveries to some<br>
stores.<br>
<br>
DISCRIMINATION UNDER THE DOME -- AFSCME Local 26 will<br>
represent 15 custodial workers who have filed a sexual<br>
discrimination complaint against the Architect of the U.S.
Capitol.<br>
The complaint with the Office of Compliance claims that the<br>
architect deliberately has kept the wages low for about 300<br>
custodial workers, 98 percent of whom are women, while their
duties<br>
and workload have increased.<br>
<br>
FRIENDLIER SKIES -- Machinists will vote the week of Jan. 6 on<br>
a new mid-term wage adjustment with United Airlines that raises<br>
wages by 10 percent over the next three-and-a-half years. The<br>
24,000 workers may receive lump-sum payments as bonuses in 1998
and<br>
1999, if the company earns $1 billion in the preceding years.<br>
<br>
OUTBOARD OUT $3 MILLION -- Outboard Marine Corp. will pay $3<br>
million in back wages to 109 members of the Laborers who struck
the<br>
Calhoun, Ga., company in 1986. The settlement agreement,
announced<br>
by the NLRB, grew out of a charge by LIUNA Local 752 that
Outboard<br>
improperly delayed recalling strikers back to work by hiring
excess<br>
replacement workers.<br>
<br>
GIVE ME THAT ON-LINE RELIGION -- The National Interfaith<br>
Committee for Worker Justice homepage, located at<br>
www.igc.org/nicwj, provides information on religious support for<br>
worker campaigns, resources on building religion and labor<br>
partnerships and contacts for local interreligious groups
concerned<br>
with labor issues. They can also be reached by e-mail at<br>
nicwj@igc.org.<br>
<br>
UNITY CALENDAR HIGHLIGHTS FUTURE -- Forget someone on your<br>
gift list? Send them a better-late-than-never holiday gift -- the<br>
all-new 1997 Unity Calendar features members of the IAM, UAW and<br>
Steelworkers. Orders may be FAXed to Brown &amp; Bigelow at
800/245-<br>
2654.<br>
<br>
BREAK TIME -- The folks at Work in Progress are taking a<br>
little time off for the holidays. The next WIP will be on your
fax<br>
machines the week of January 6. We wish you a happy holiday
season<br>
and a bountiful and organized New Year.</p>

<p>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- December 17, 1996</p>
<p>NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS -- The AFL-CIO Executive Council met in<br>
Washington Monday to review the 1996 elections and issue a<br>
grassroots and legislative American Working Families Agenda. Vice<br>
President Gore thanked unions for their support during the<br>
election, noting that he and President Clinton are keenly aware<br>
that one-quarter of all votes cast were from union households,<br>
which overwhelmingly voted for Clinton-Gore. He pledged the
Clinton<br>
administration will continue to address workers' concerns in the<br>
next four years.<br>
<br>
GRASSROOTS REVIVAL -- The council approved a budget for 1997 that<br>
sharply increases resources to organizing and accelerates efforts<br>
to revitalize grassroots activity devoted to organizing,
bargaining<br>
and pro-worker legislation. It also saluted the Jobs With Justice<br>
community coalitions and urged participation in a massive rally<br>
next April 13 in Watsonville, Calif., to support strawberry<br>
workers. The federation also unveiled a &quot;Union Cities&quot;
program that<br>
will provide a framework for central labor councils to rebuild
the<br>
labor movement at its grassroots.<br>
<br>
SWEENEY JAILED AT YALE -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and more<br>
than 300 Yale University students, university employees and<br>
supporters were arrested in New Haven, Conn., last week in a<br>
massive demonstration that drew more than 2,000. Yale's clerical<br>
and service employees, represented by Hotel Employees and<br>
Restaurant Employees Locals 34 and 35, have been working without
a<br>
contract for almost a year.<br>
<br>
LONG LUNCH AT NYU -- Some 1,600 clerical workers at New York<br>
University walked out in a half-day strike Dec. 11, as they
sought<br>
to jump start negotiations, stalled since Nov. 13. The workers,<br>
members of the United Staff Association of NYU, an affiliate of<br>
AFT, have been working without a contract since Oct. 31.<br>
<br>
DEMS HAVE AYES IN TEXAS -- A big turnout, spurred by union
members,<br>
helped toss out a notoriously anti-worker Republican
representative<br>
and helped a freshman Democrat maintain his seat after<br>
gerrymandering brought in a big GOP enclave. In the special run
off<br>
elections Dec. 10, Nick Lampson (D) shot down gun-lobby-backed<br>
Steve Stockman (R), 53-47 percent. Rep. Ken Bentsen (D) beat
Dolly<br>
Madison McKenna (R) with 57 percent of the vote. The victories<br>
lower the GOP edge in the House to 227-207-1.<br>
<br>
CLOSE CALL -- How close did the labor movement come to reversing<br>
the GOP margin in the House? &quot;If we could have gotten a
little more<br>
than 12,000 votes total in 11 districts where anti-worker<br>
Republicans narrowly won, the Democrats would have had the<br>
majority,&quot; Sweeney told a press conference after the council<br>
meeting.<br>
<br>
CAREY ON TOP -- Sweeney saluted Teamsters President Ron Carey as
a<br>
&quot;unique American hero&quot; after his narrow victory over
challenger<br>
James P. Hoffa in a ballot by the IBT's rank and file. Carey
called<br>
the win a &quot;victory for reform.&quot; Sweeney also credited
Carey with<br>
aggressive organizing and bargaining campaigns.<br>
<br>
MERGER APPROVED -- The Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers<br>
overwhelmingly approved a merger with the Steelworkers. The vote
by<br>
a special convention was hailed as a &quot;phenomenal
achievement&quot; by<br>
ABGWU President Ernie LaBaff. USWA President George Becker<br>
emphasized the added strength in numbers for the union workers.
The<br>
addition of the 40,000 ABGWU members brings the USWA total to<br>
740,000.<br>
<br>
SOUTHWEST UNIT TAKES OFF -- More than 4,000 ramp agents at<br>
Southwest Airlines, formerly represented by an unaffiliated
union,<br>
joined the Transport Workers. Local 555 has major bases in
Chicago,<br>
Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Phoenix. The
carrier's<br>
flight attendants also are represented by TWU.<br>
<br>
JUSTICE IN TEXAS -- In Ennis, Texas, UNITE gained 500 new members<br>
when workers at the Ennis Automotive plant voted 236-204 for the<br>
union. The mostly Hispanic work force, earning just $5 to $7.50
an<br>
hour, was angered that the company could afford to hire the
union-<br>
busting law firm of Jackson &amp; Lewis.<br>
<br>
MORE MARYLAND WINS -- The drive to organize Maryland's 40,000
state<br>
workers rolls along, with two more units in the fold. A coalition<br>
of AFSCME and the Teamsters handily won the right to represent a<br>
unit of 7,844 public safety and security officers with
two-thirds.<br>
A labor and trades unit of 2,500 workers also voted
overwhelmingly<br>
for AFSCME.<br>
<br>
GETTING THERE OVERNITE -- Overnite workers at Macon, Ga., Nanuet,<br>
N.Y. and Houston petitioned to join the Teamsters as the chorus
for<br>
respect, job security and a voice on the job grows louder at the<br>
company's terminals across the country. In the past six months,<br>
Overnite workers have filed for IBT representation at 13 trucking<br>
terminals, winning nine.<br>
<br>
GOOD HEALTH CARE -- Two California Service Employees locals won<br>
three elections at community health clinics. Local 79 won a pair
of<br>
elections to represent 120 workers at the Bayview Hunters Point<br>
Foundation and 35 employees at Horizons Unlimited in the San<br>
Francisco Bay area. SEIU Local 415 and new organizing director
Dave<br>
Werlin got 49 new members from a vote by Salud Para La Gente in<br>
Santa Cruz.<br>
<br>
CIRCUS IS GOOD GIG -- The dancing elephants, prancing horses and<br>
daring young men and women on the flying trapeze will have a
steady<br>
back beat now that the Musicians have ratified a new three-year<br>
pact with Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus. The two<br>
touring troupes each carry a nine-piece AFM band for a 48-week
road<br>
show. The new deal boosts wages and pension contributions and<br>
includes vacation and medical coverage. AFM has represented
circus<br>
musicians since the 1920s.<br>
<br>
REFORMING WELFARE REFORM -- The Executive Council vowed to fight<br>
any attempts to privatize the Medicaid, food stamp, unemployment<br>
insurance and employment service programs, and said the AFL-CIO<br>
will work to ensure that public employees continue to administer<br>
welfare programs. The federation will fight for legislation to<br>
extend worker rights to welfare recipients and will seek pledges<br>
from nonprofit organizations to participate only in
welfare-to-work<br>
programs that treat the participants fairly.<br>
<br>
GRINCH GETS COMEUPPANCE -- Two days before Thanksgiving,<br>
Westmoreland Coal Co. cancelled health benefits for more than 150<br>
retired coal miners. But the Mine Workers -- like the Whos in Dr.<br>
Seuss' &quot;Grinch&quot; -- went to court to force the company
to restore<br>
health benefits and pay $10,000 into an escrow account to cover
any<br>
medical expenses incurred by the retirees during the two weeks
that<br>
they were denied coverage.<br>
<br>
RAIL PENSION RAID -- The Executive Council called on the Railroad<br>
Retirement Board to back off its plan to unilaterally impose<br>
industry standards for determining the conditions that would<br>
disable workers for various railroad occupations. &quot;It
amounts to a<br>
raid on the pension system that (workers) depend on,&quot; the
council<br>
said. &quot;This threat to the health and welfare of rail workers
cannot<br>
and will not go unchallenged.&quot;<br>
<br>
CALLING FOR PEACE -- Cardinal Adam Maida, citing the &quot;human<br>
fallout,&quot; called for an end to the 17-month Detroit
newspaper<br>
strike. The strike is &quot;legitimate,&quot; he said. &quot;The
right of people<br>
to organize is fundamental. Those that exercise that right, I
stand<br>
with them.&quot; Maida said he has contacted each member of the
boards<br>
of Gannett and Knight-Ridder and is working with Mayor Dennis<br>
Archer and U.S. Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich) on ways to end the<br>
dispute.<br>
<br>
OPEN BORDERS -- Borders Books is resisting organizing efforts,<br>
drawing the wrath of unions. In Ann Arbor, Mich., members of the<br>
National Writers Union\UAW Local 1981 picketed the book seller,<br>
alerting the public to the company's union-busting tactics and
low<br>
wages. They also marked the six-month anniversary of the firing
of<br>
Philadelphia worker Miriam Fried for her organizing attempts.
Among<br>
the &quot;alternative&quot; Christmas carols picketers belted out
was one to<br>
the tune of Hark the Herald Angels Sings -- &quot;Borders fired
Miriam<br>
Fried in the name of corporate greed.&quot;<br>
<br>
FOOD LION GUILTY -- A federal jury in Florida says Food Lion<br>
violated federal wage-and-hour laws for failing to pay overtime
to<br>
two assistant store managers. The Nov. 14 decision means back pay<br>
claims from more than 1,000 other assistant store managers may go<br>
to court. The anti-union grocery chain must pay the pair for
2,700<br>
hours of uncompensated overtime.<br>
<br>
NONUNION 76 -- UNO-VEN Co. and all its Union 76 products are now
on<br>
the AFL-CIO's national boycott list at the request of the Oil,<br>
Chemical and Atomic Workers. The boycott was triggered by the<br>
company's unilateral decision to make sweeping changes in its<br>
contract, including flexibility issues and creating a multitier
pay<br>
structure.<br>
<br>
PARALLEL RUNWAYS -- A federal court last week rejected a lawsuit
by<br>
the unaffiliated Independent Federation of Flight Attendants<br>
seeking to block a representation election petition by the<br>
Machinists for 5,400 TWA flight attendants. While the National<br>
Mediation Board has yet to act on the request, IFFA members are<br>
voting on whether to affiliate with the Association of Flight<br>
Attendants, with balloting expected to end late this month. IFFA<br>
President Sherry Cooper last August reached a merger agreement
with<br>
IAM that was subsequently turned down by IFFA's executive board.<br>
<br>
BOOTING UP IN THE CITY -- The Teamsters National Black Caucus
urged<br>
Circuit City to donate 10,000 computers to the nation's
inner-city<br>
schools as a way to make up for the company's history of racial<br>
discrimination. Two African-American workers were recently
awarded<br>
almost $300,000 in damages after a jury found the electronics
giant<br>
guilty of showing intentional bias in its employment practices.<br>
<br>
SMOOTH SAILING -- Members of the ILA-affiliated Masters, Mates
and<br>
Pilots re-elected union president Capt. Timothy Brown and<br>
Secretary-Treasurer James Hopkins to third terms. Brown called
the<br>
results a vote for continuity in light of a recently enacted<br>
federal maritime program.<br>
<br>
GOODBY-WATER -- The Executive Council bid adieu to one of its
most<br>
outspoken members, William Bywater of the Electronic Workers, who<br>
stepped down in favor of Edward Fire, who defeated him at the<br>
union's convention last month. The council noted Bywater's<br>
unflinching opposition to exploitation of workers, &quot;whether
it is<br>
in the form of injustice and abuse on the job or in the aftermath<br>
of cold, uncaring economic policies and unfair trade
practices.&quot;<br>
<br>
MEXICO'S MAXI ANTI-UNION -- A complaint filed by the
Communications<br>
Workers charging that the Mexican government failed to protect<br>
workers at Maxi-Switch Inc. in Sonora from &quot;brutal
anti-union&quot;<br>
activities will be reviewed by the U.S. agency overseeing<br>
compliance with NAFTA's labor side agreement. CWA says the state<br>
colluded with the pro-government Confederation of Mexican Workers<br>
to block formation of an independent union, and violated the side<br>
agreement by denying workers &quot;fair, equitable and
transparent&quot;<br>
tribunal proceedings.</p>

<p align="left">AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- December 9, 1996</p>
<pre>MARYLAND GOES AFSCME -- In the first-ever collective bargaining
elections by Maryland state employees, AFSCME Maryland was chosen
as the representative for the state's 7,000 health care and human
service employees and the social workers unit. The union won by
better than 3 to 1 among the health care unit and 2.5 to 1 in the
social workers unit. They were the first results in a series of
union votes among Maryland workers involving AFSCME, the Teamsters
and AFT.

UP TO SOMETHING GOOD -- The 5,400 TWA workers in the unaffiliated
Independent Federation of Flight Attendants are closer to
affiliating with the Association of Flight Attendants. Pending
ratification by IFFA members and AFA's Executive Board, the pact
would boost the 40,000-member AFA and give voting rights to the
IFFA, with a merger taking place within four years. &quot;This ground-
breaking affiliation agreement puts all of us in the strongest
position to meet the challenges we face in our industry,&quot; AFA
President Patricia Friend said.

SEIU'S TRIPLE PLAY -- The Service Employees won three new units
last month. Locals 250 and 790 joined forces and organized 540
workers employed by the San Francisco Visiting Nurses and Hospice.
Up in Seattle, Local 1199NW signed up 105 case workers, social
workers, nurses and support personnel at the Eastside Community
Health center. And 70 janitors who clean federal buildings in
Chicago signed on with Local 25.

DOUBLE WINS AT THE INNS -- The Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees and the Operating Engineers won separate elections at
Washington-area hotels. Workers at the Crystal City Hilton Hotel in
Arlington, Va., voted for representation by HERE Local 25, the
first successful bottom-up (all workers) hotel organizing drive in
more than 20 years, HERE reported. Issues included dignity, health
care and wages. Meanwhile, congrats go to the IUOE Local 99, which
organized engineers at the Bethesda, Md., Hyatt. The engineers
voted 8-3 for representation.

DOWN ON THE RANCHO -- Some 120 city workers in Rio Rancho, N.M
voted 72-30 for AFSCME representation. The wall-to-wall unit
consists of workers ranging from laborers to accountants.

WALL STREET UNION -- Workers at The Wall Street Journal are urging
fellow employees to vote for affiliation with the Communications
Workers. This is the third time in almost a decade that the
Independent Association of Publishers' Employees has pursued
affiliation with a larger union.

SINGAPORE SLING -- The ministerial meeting of the World Trade
Organization got off on the wrong foot even before it opened
Monday, as a speaking invitation to Michel Hansenne, director
general of the International Labor Organization, was rescinded.
It's an apparent effort to appease developing countries opposed to
linking trade with labor rights. The AFL-CIO delegation to the
meeting is led by International Affairs Director Barbara Shailor.

NO BOW TO CROWN -- OCAW President Robert Wages and several
Baltimore labor leaders were arrested Dec. 6 after blocking the
doors to Crown's corporate headquarters. The &quot;lock-in&quot; and downtown
rally launched a consumer boycott against the oil company to
protest the lock-out of 250 OCAW members at Crown's Texas refinery.

LORDING IT OVER WORKERS -- More than 1,000 anti-sweatshop
activists, led by UNITE, rallied at Lord &amp; Taylor department store
in New York Dec. 6 to expose the May Company's use of sweatshop
contractors to manufacture private label merchandise. May owns Lord
&amp; Taylor's.

DON'T FOLLOW THESE TRENDSETTERS -- Holiday shoppers who care about
worker rights shouldn't use the De CPI SCHEME: CALAMITY CHANGE --
A proposal to lower the Consumer Price Index would in fact lower
wages, Social Security and other benefits tied to the CPI, AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney warned. A new report from a private
commission claims the CPI overstates inflation and should be
adjusted downward, but it is &quot;far from the last word on this
subject,&quot; Sweeney said. Many respected researchers disagree with
the report and believe it may actually understate inflation.
Lowering the CPI &quot;is nothing more than a back-door tax increase on
working people, the elderly and the poor,&quot; Teamsters President Ron
Carey said.

     partment of Labor's 

     Trendsetter list, which includes many nonunion companies, and
some virulent anti-union employers, UNITE says. DoL established the
list to spotlight apparel manufacturers and retailers that have
voluntarily taken extra steps to ensure their goods are not made in
sweatshop conditions, but labor law violators still abound.

JANITORS STRIKE USC -- Janitors at University of Southern
California staged a two-day strike to protest the illegal
intimidation, harassment and firings of their co-workers by
ServiceMaster supervisors, the contractor that provides janitorial
services  for the university. The workers, members of SEIU Local
399, held a March for Justice and rally along with the Dec. 4-5
action.

MOTOWN HOLIDAY CHEER -- Facing their second holiday season on
strike, Detroit newspaper workers need your help. You can give by
subscribing to the striker-produced newspaper, the Sunday Journal,
by calling 313/567-9818, ext. 135. And you can adopt a striking
family by sending a check to the Detroit Striker Relief Fund, 3100
East Jefferson, Detroit 48207. For more information, call 313/877-
9016.

MO' MOTOWN -- Striking Detroit newspaper workers are taking their
struggle to New York City this week. They will distribute
informational leaflets today through Thursday from 8-10 a.m.
outside the Paine-Webber Media Conference at the McGraw Hill
building in Manhattan.

GETTING TO KNOW YOU -- Union members meet tomorrow with first term
Rep.-Elect Julia Carson (D-Ind.). The Indianapolis meeting is the
first of about 150 that unions plan to hold before March with new
and returning members, both Democrats and Republicans. Building on
Labor 96's success, the goal is to make sure lawmakers know and
understand working families' concerns.

WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN -- While the GOP purrs about bi-
partisanship, Rep. Bill Clay (D-Mo.) warns &quot;it's all rhetoric.&quot;
Republicans on the House Economic and Educational Opportunities
Committee will pursue, he says, the &quot;same stringent, anti-worker,
anti-labor agenda&quot; they did in the last Congress. Committee
Chairman William Goodling (R-Pa.) promises a bill allowing comp
time instead of overtime-bill and so-called TEAM Act legislation.
Attacks on Davis-Bacon and OSHA are expected too. Same old song.

HITTING HOME -- The AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust, with assets
of about $2 billion, has been selected as the first labor partner
in HUD's National Partners in Homeownership. The partnership has
set a goal of generating 8 million new home owners over the next
four years. &quot;There is no place more fundamental to begin a family's
quest for self-sufficiency than right at home,&quot; said Stephen Coyle,
HIT's chief executive.

NO TENDER LOVING CARE -- When TLC Services Inc., a Milwaukee
trucking company, abruptly shut its doors Nov. 27, tossing out more
than 70 workers with no advance warning, it was engaged in union-
busting, Teamsters Local 200 charges. Some workers were immediately
rehired by another company located next door under the same
ownership after TLC filed for bankruptcy, the union noted. TLC
failed to give at least 60 days warning of closure, as is required
by state law, and still owes its workers several weeks of back pay.

REPETITIVE WHINE -- An American Trucking Association report is the
latest salvo in a corporate campaign to derail an OSHA-issued
ergonomics standard. ATA claims such a rule would cost the trucking
industry some $6.5 billion annually -- more than OSHA estimates the
cost for all industries. Meanwhile, as corporate interests work to
protect their pocketbooks, some 700,000 of their employees lose
work time each year because of ergonomic-related injuries.

CAL'S WEAK ERGO LAW CHALLENGED -- California's new regulation on
ergonomics will be challenged in court after the holidays, when the
California AFL-CIO seeks a truly protective standard. Executive
Secretary-Treasurer Art Pulaski criticized the regulation's
exemption of employers with less than 10 workers and the lack of
required compliance until two or more workers are injured on
identical jobs.

BEEF'S OVER -- Some 1,800 workers at IBP Inc. in Joslin Mo., ended
their month-long strike by accepting a four-year contract with the
beef processing plant. The agreement calls for annual wage
increases totaling 80 cents per hour over the contract term and
continues the profit sharing plan in a modified form, a major
factor leading to the strike.

COMMON GROUND IN BOSTON -- Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
Local 26 averted a threatened strike by approving a new contract
with eight Boston hotels. The five-year accord will raise pay for
most workers by $1.98 per hour over term. The agreement is expected
to set a pattern at six other area hotels and cover about 3,500
workers.

 A CASE FOR UNION -- Workers from Case Farms poultry processing
plant in Morganton, N.C. joined with religious leaders, consumers
and environmentalists seeking congressional investigation of worker
abuses in the poultry industry. Last year the workers voted for
Laborers representation, but the company refuses to bargain with
LIUNA.

DOL BEGINS HEALTH CARE CHECK UP -- The health care industry is
being scrutinized by the Department of Labor for compliance with
wage and hour requirements as part of its Fair Labor Standards Act
initiative. The DoL's Wage and Hour Division has found a 60 percent
violation rate on complaint-driven investigations of nursing homes
and home health care providers. The initiative already is examining
the garment industry, agricultural work and child labor.

TEMPS RISING -- The AFL-CIO urged the National Labor Relations
Board to change the rules and let the nation's 2.4 million
temporary and contingent workers organize and negotiate with their
employers to improve their lives, just as other workers can. Under
current rules, companies that use temporary agencies generally
control wages and working conditions for workers, but are not held
accountable for those conditions, the federation and several
affiliates said.

ECONOMY SLOWING DOWN -- More people are out of work and the rate of
job growth is slowing, according to an AFL-CIO analysis of the
November unemployment figures. The official jobless rate rose from
5.2 percent to 5.4 percent, while the real rate, which includes
marginal workers, was 8.9 percent. The number of new jobs was less
than half of the average for the first eight months of the year,
with most of the jobs added in services.

     &#12;Why we do it

     Three generations in the fields...

     Jesus' father was a farmer in Mexico. Today, Jesus and three
of his six children are strawberry pickers in California.

     Before coming to the U.S., Jesus was a sixth-grade teacher in
Mexico. &quot;My real dream was to be a professor,&quot; he says.

     But now Jesus is 46 years old and has spent 11 years in the
strawberry fields near Watsonville.

     Another dream has replaced the old one -- that conditions in
the fields will improve for Jesus' children. Jesus thinks that's
not far-fetched. He said some conditions began improving when the
United Farm Workers started organizing earlier this year. There
were fewer racial slurs used by foremen, and bathrooms and drinking
water were more often clean.

     Still, most workers don't have health insurance or protection
against abuses such as sexual harassment and arbitrary firings.
Wages remain low. The typical strawberry picker made about $8,500
for the 1996 season, even though it would take only 5 cents more
per pint of berries to increase piece pay rates by at least 50
percent.

     When the new season begins next year, Jesus believes workers
will begin to win a union, and with it, a living wage.

     Artist helps spread the word

     The Strawberry Workers Campaign has produced notecards
featuring pastels of strawberry workers by Colorado artist Tony
Ortega. Help spread word of the campaign by using the cards during
the holidays and beyond. They cost $10 for a set of 12 and proceeds
support the campaign. To order, call 202-637-5043; ask for item No.
271.


     Taking the lead

     CLCs, state labor federations and community groups raised the
campaign to a new level from Nov. 13 to Nov. 22 as UFW President
Arturo Rodriguez and strawberry workers traveled to six cities.
State federations and CLCs helped provide the umbrella for:

* More than 40 groups signing on to the National Strawberry
Commission for Workers' Rights during a national news conference
Nov. 13 in Washington D.C.

* A coalition of about 19 people representing labor, religious,
civil rights and community groups in Philadelphia Nov. 18.

* A coalition of 37 people representing civil rights, community,
religious and labor groups in Baltimore Nov. 19.

* A coalition of about 50 people representing labor and religious
groups in New Jersey Nov. 20.

* A coalition of community, religious, labor and government groups
in New York City Nov. 21.

* A coalition of about 125 people representing rank-and-file
activists, students and religious, labor, community and
environmental groups in Boston Nov. 22.

     Other regions of the country will get a similar catalyst. Next
month The Strawberry Workers Campaign will travel the Midwest.

     Please come to Watsonville

     Workers and their supporters from throughout the nation will
meet in Watsonville, the heart of strawberry country, in April for
a massive march.

     The goal is for 20,000 people to march not just in support of
the workers, but as part of a new movement for fairness.

<p>Work in Progress -- December 3, 1996<br>
<br>
GUESS? WHO DIDN'T MAKE THE LIST -- Guess? Inc., once on the<br>
Labor Department's coveted Trendsetter list, was placed on<br>
&quot;probation&quot; for allegedly violating labor laws. UNITE
President Jay<br>
Mazur noted that &quot;Guess? is a multiple offender of labor<br>
violations, including making use of industrial homework. It's
time<br>
for Guess? to do the right thing and clean up its act.&quot; The<br>
disclosure came as the DoL named 17 new companies to the year-old<br>
Trendsetter list of garment manufacturers and retailers that<br>
voluntarily have taken extra steps to ensure their goods are not<br>
made in sweatshop conditions.<br>
<br>
WORKER RIGHTS IN GLOBAL ARENA -- At the Vatican this week,<br>
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and other global labor leaders<br>
discussed worker rights, social issues and the role of labor
unions<br>
in the international economy. &quot;Let's work together for a
global<br>
economy that lifts the living standards and honors the human<br>
dignity of every man, woman and child,&quot; Sweeney told the
Pontifical<br>
Council for Justice and Peace. At a Thanksgiving meeting in
Geneva,<br>
Sweeney urged World Trade Organization President Renato Ruggerio
to<br>
back the establishment of a working party or commission to study<br>
the linkage of worker rights and trade. Developing nations are<br>
opposing that linkage, which will be championed at next week's
WTO<br>
meeting in Singapore by the United States.<br>
<br>
SWEATSHOPS EXPOSED -- Two Salvadoran union activists told the<br>
congressional human rights caucus Dec. 2 that their government is<br>
violating worker rights in the free trade zones built with U.S.
tax<br>
dollars. Women work 12- to 17-hour days, six days a week for as<br>
little as 40 cents an hour in sweatshops in the free trade zone,<br>
they said. Nearly all the garments made in the zone are exported
to<br>
the United States. Also testifying were Alan Howard of UNITE and<br>
Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee.<br>
<br>
CHICKEN STICKLIN' -- Responding to a report by the National<br>
Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice that workers in the
poultry<br>
processing industry face harsh and unlawful conditions, the<br>
Department of Labor next year will begin a special targeted labor<br>
standards enforcement program for the industry. &quot;Sweatshop<br>
conditions -- whether in garment factories, fields or poultry<br>
processing plants -- will not be tolerated,&quot; Labor Secretary
Robert<br>
Reich declared.<br>
<br>
UMWA WINS AT NURSING HOME -- Employees of Maple Grove Health<br>
Care in Lebanon, Va., voted 32-5 for Mine Worker representation.<br>
Several UMWA coal miners and workers from the recently organized<br>
Long Airdox manufacturing plant in Saltville, Va., participated
in<br>
the drive. Maple Grove is the third nursing home facility
organized<br>
by the UMWA.<br>
<br>
LEGITIMATE BEEF -- A federal judge in Colorado ordered Monfort<br>
Inc. to pay nearly $2 million in back wages to 5,071 employees at<br>
its Greeley, Colo., beef processing plant. The order resolves a<br>
suit filed by the Labor Department alleging that Monfort violated<br>
the Fair Labor Standards Act by not paying its workers overtime
and<br>
for not keeping required records. The workers are represented by<br>
the Food and Commercial Workers.<br>
<br>
COLLEGE WORKERS CASH IN -- Cashiers at University of Rochester<br>
(N.Y.) dining centers and snack bars have joined SEIU District<br>
1199, which represents some 175 UR campus workers and more than
800<br>
staff members at UR's Medical Center and Strong Memorial
Hospital.<br>
The 12 workers now come under a new two-year pact approved in<br>
October.<br>
<br>
NLRB FLUNKS YALE -- Two just-issued NLRB complaints charge<br>
that Yale University threatened to fire workers for participating<br>
in union activities, transferred employees who supported the
union<br>
and illegally stopped withholding union dues from paychecks after<br>
the last contract expired. HERE Locals 34 and 35 represent the<br>
school clerical, maintenance and technical employees involved.<br>
<br>
FIGHTING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY -- Unions can use their pension<br>
funds to fight moves to privatize Social Security, AFL-CIO<br>
Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka said. In a speech to labor<br>
educators at the University of California, Trumka said pension
fund<br>
trustees should avoid investment houses that want to turn Social<br>
Security into a speculative Wall Street venture and shift pension<br>
plans to individual retirement accounts. IRAs &quot;undermine the<br>
leverage workers have on corporations, and they channel
investments<br>
in ways that are indifferent and even hostile to workers'<br>
interests,&quot; Trumka said. &quot;Workers and their unions
should not allow<br>
our pension funds to be used against us.&quot; <br>
<br>
LIMO DRIVERS FIGHT VIOLENCE -- Hundreds of newly organized New<br>
York City limousine drivers rallied Dec. 2 to protest the beating<br>
of one of their union leaders. Aijaz Alamdar was beaten Nov. 22
by<br>
four men on the property of Elite Limousine while conducting
normal<br>
business. The next day, the drivers' union voted to affiliate
with<br>
IAM District Lodge 15. The mostly immigrant workers from
Pakistan,<br>
India, China, Latin America and the Caribbean won the right to an<br>
election when the NLRB rejected Elite's claim the 500 drivers
were<br>
&quot;independent contractors.&quot;<br>
<br>
HEALTH CARE PARTNERSHIP -- In northern California, Service<br>
Employees Local 250 reached an unprecedented master agreement
with<br>
the West Bay Region of Catholic Health Care West that recognizes<br>
union rights and protects against subcontracting. The four-year<br>
pact prohibits subcontracting on site and gives the union the
right<br>
to offer alternatives to off-site subcontracting. A mutual code
of<br>
conduct for organizing campaigns was established, as were<br>
procedures to speed up union elections. Workers also gained a
voice<br>
in patient care through a new joint committee.<br>
<br>
ALTITUDE ADJUSTMENTS -- The Air Line Pilots reached a<br>
tentative agreement with UAL Corp., the parent company of United<br>
Airlines, that features a 10 percent wage increase over four
years<br>
and a profit-sharing plan. The pact, which affects 8,500 pilots,<br>
also contains increases in expense per diem and international<br>
expense override. ALPA members will be receiving ratification<br>
ballots in mid-December and votes will be counted a month later.<br>
Some 22,000 Flight Attendants at the airline have been without a<br>
contract since March.<br>
<br>
POOR PUMMELED BY BUDGET CUTS -- Programs designed to help the<br>
poor took much bigger hits in the GOP-controlled 104th Congress<br>
than other programs. A report by the Center on Budget and Policy<br>
Priorities shows that programs aimed at the poor account for 37<br>
percent of entitlement spending between 1997 and 2002, yet absorb<br>
93 percent of the entitlement budget cuts. In the entire
nondefense<br>
budget, low-income programs account for 23 percent of spending
but<br>
will absorb 53 percent of the spending cuts.<br>
<br>
UNIONS MEAN PAY EQUITY -- Union representation not only<br>
usually affords higher wages for women and minorities but also<br>
provides a voice at the workplace and in the courts to press for<br>
equal wages, a report by the National Committee on Pay Equity<br>
concludes. The &quot;Intersection Between Pay Equity and
Workplace<br>
Representation&quot; is available from the Committee at
202/331-7343.<br>
<br>
MEETING OF THE MINDS -- Screen Actors Guild and Television and<br>
Radio Artists leaders have formally backed plans to merge the two<br>
unions of performers and broadcasters. The plans now must be<br>
approved by the unions' boards individually, by the AFTRA<br>
convention in August 1997 and finally by 60 percent of the
members<br>
of each union via secret ballot. The plans would create 30 locals<br>
covering 120,000 current members governed by a national board
with<br>
a national president, secretary-treasurer and four vice
presidents,<br>
a biennial convention and offices in Los Angeles and New York.<br>
<br>
WALKOUT IN AKRON -- After more than a year of stonewalling and<br>
union-busting tactics by management, workers at the Akron City<br>
Hospital said &quot;no more&quot; and walked off the job. The
only result of<br>
a year's worth of talks, AFSCME Local 684 says, has been constant<br>
threats to job security. The hospital tried to establish a co-pay<br>
for health insurance for the predominantly female,
African-American<br>
workers, whose average pay is $8.50 an hour. No talks are<br>
scheduled.<br>
<br>
MAKE IT A UNION GIFT -- UNITE launched a holiday campaign to<br>
urge consumers to &quot;Wear what you believe: UNITE!&quot; The
ad urges<br>
consumers to look for the union label, and will run for two weeks<br>
beginning Nov. 29 in The New York Times, New York Times Magazine,<br>
The Washington Post, Women's Wear Daily, the Daily News Record
and<br>
The New Republic magazine.<br>
<br>
WORKERS' GUIDE TO INVESTMENTS -- Want to learn how unions can<br>
make worker-friendly investments? Pick up a copy of the<br>
federation's digest on capital strategies. It outlines investment<br>
in plants, equipment, modernization, training, innovation and new<br>
work systems using workers' own pension funds. The guide explores<br>
strategies for such investments and the legal framework behind<br>
them. It also includes sections on shareholder activism and<br>
employee ownership programs. The guide can be ordered through the<br>
AFL-CIO's Corporate Affairs Department, by calling Christine Tate<br>
at 202/637-5162.<br>
<br>
HIGHER PENSION GUARANTEE -- The maximum retirement benefit to<br>
be guaranteed by the federal government next year is $2,761.36
per<br>
month, or $33,136.32 per year. Those benefits are payable by the<br>
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.'s insurance program to retirees in<br>
underfunded single-employer defined-benefit plans that are<br>
terminated in 1997. Since 1974, the PBGC has guaranteed the<br>
benefits of nearly 400,000 private-sector workers and retirees<br>
participating in 2,084 pension plans.<br>
<br>
ADJUSTING TO NAFTA -- In a deal brokered by the UAW, workers<br>
displaced by the North American Free Trade Agreement but denied<br>
income-support benefits under an earlier eligibility definition<br>
have a new chance for help. A recent agreement with the Labor<br>
Department applies to those persons certified for NAFTA Trade<br>
Adjustment Assistance but denied income support under a since-<br>
rejected provision. Workers have until April 15, 1997, to contact<br>
their local Employment Service office for redetermination of
their<br>
TAA eligibility.<br>
<br>
DEEPER IN DEBT -- September's trade deficit was the worst<br>
ever, a whopping $17.7 billion. The deficit for the year is<br>
projected to hit $180 billion, breaking 1995's record of $173<br>
billion. So far this year, imports of manufactured goods have<br>
exceeded exports by $129.7 billion. China topped the month's list<br>
at $4.7 billion, and is fast approaching Japan as the largest<br>
bilateral deficit trading partner.<br>
<br>
PUBLIC SECTOR DELIVERS -- In a strong endorsement of the<br>
public sector, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued a three-<br>
year, multimillion dollar grant giving Washington state's<br>
Employment Security Department prime responsibility for
developing<br>
and operating the &quot;One-Stop Shopping System.&quot; The
grant, which<br>
ranges from $2.5 million to $5 million annually, keeps the full<br>
range of employment services in the hands of state employees
rather<br>
than a private company.</p>

<p>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- November 26, 1996<br>
<br>
WORKLIFE AT MGM -- IT'S GRAND -- After a four-year organizing<br>
drive, nearly 3,000 workers at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas
won<br>
union representation under a card-check agreement between the
hotel<br>
and Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Locals 226 and 165.<br>
The unions, which gathered the signatures of more than half the<br>
workers, also gained recognition for a smaller number of
employees<br>
at the Main Street Station hotel/casino in downtown Las Vegas.<br>
<br>
HEALTH WORKERS GO LIUNA -- More than 1,000 registered nurses,<br>
LPNs and technicians at two Redding, Calif., hospitals said yes
to<br>
LIUNA representation. The workers seek better wages and safer
work<br>
conditions in an atmosphere poisoned by hospital and staff
cutbacks<br>
that drastically increase patient-to-nurse ratios.<br>
<br>
TEAMSTERS ROLL -- Workers at Overnite Transportation in<br>
Decatur, Ala., and Little Rock, Ark., voted for Teamsters<br>
representation --by 15-4 and 18-13 votes, respectively. Workers
may<br>
see more Overnite success because six more terminals filed for
IBT<br>
representation last month: Baltimore, Charlotte, N.C., Tupelo,<br>
Miss., Florence S.C., New Orleans and Oakland.<br>
<br>
UNION BUSTER'S BALLOON BURST -- An imported union buster lost<br>
a four-month fight with 160 A&amp;E Transport drivers in
Syracuse, N.Y.<br>
The drivers, who provide transportation for special-needs school<br>
children, rolled over the lies and voted for representation by<br>
Service Employees Local 200B. Meanwhile, in Greene County, N.Y.,<br>
SEIU Local 4053 didn't let a county move to privatize former
public<br>
sector jobs deter its organizing efforts. The local went after<br>
them, winning the right to represent 42 health care<br>
paraprofessionals who work for a private contractor at a<br>
correctional facility.<br>
<br>
UPGRADING TO FIRST CLASS -- The Communications Workers hope to<br>
win the votes of nearly 10,000 USAir passenger service workers in<br>
balloting next month. If approved, it would be the first airline<br>
shop for the CWA and the first union for the airline's ticket and<br>
reservation agents and others who assist passengers at more than<br>
100 airports and reservation centers. Other unions at USAir
include<br>
the Air Line Pilots, Flight Attendants, Machinists and Transport<br>
Workers. Ballots will be mailed Dec. 17.<br>
<br>
ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY IBT -- Workers at Federal Express<br>
suddenly got a 3 percent raise and lump-sum direct
profit-sharing,<br>
apparently resulting from an aggressive Teamsters organizing<br>
campaign. Just a few months ago, CEO Fred Smith declared that<br>
workers would no longer get scheduled pay increases, and profit-<br>
sharing monies would go into retirement accounts. &quot;Just
think how<br>
much more they'll win with a legally binding contract,&quot;
President<br>
Ron Carey said. Workers at eight FedEx stations have filed for<br>
representation elections, and organizing is taking place at<br>
hundreds of other stations nationwide.<br>
<br>
CRASH CLAIMS IAM VP -- Machinists are mourning the death of<br>
Vice President Larry Downing, who directed the union's nine-state<br>
Midwest Territory. He was one of the 14 victims in the crash of a<br>
commuter plane and private plane last week in Quincy, Ill.
Downing,<br>
who was traveling to Quincy on union business, is survived by his<br>
wife, Pat, a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>
CONFRONTING GANNETT -- More than 100 Detroit newspaper<br>
strikers and their supporters challenged corporate scofflaw
Gannett<br>
and its private goon squad, Vance Security, in three days of<br>
protest in the D.C. area. Apparently frightened by peaceful<br>
protesters and picket signs, Gannett put its Rosslyn, Va.,<br>
headquarters under virtual lock-down. At the headquarters of
Vance<br>
Security -- whose squads have harassed strikers -- protesters had<br>
a spirited, peaceful face-off with dozens of police officers and<br>
scores of security guards in riot gear. The next day, the
strikers<br>
leafleted at the National Press Building, where Gannett and
Knight-<br>
Ridder have bureaus.<br>
<br>
NEW ORGANIZING APPOINTMENTS -- Chris Woods, former Organizing<br>
Institute recruitment director, has been named deputy director of<br>
the AFL-CIO Organizing Department. Four new assistant directors<br>
also have been announced: Bob Lawson, for organizing education;<br>
Stephen Lerner, for campaign strategies; Andy Levin, for<br>
cooperative campaigns; and Peter Rider, for national campaigns.
All<br>
have been involved in the restructuring of the department under<br>
director Richard Bensinger, and Levin was director of Union
Summer.<br>
They join Allison Porter, who heads the Organizing Institute and
is<br>
assistant director for recruitment and training.<br>
<br>
YALE FAILS -- Yale University will face charges if it doesn't<br>
settle with teaching assistants who are trying to unionize, the<br>
NLRB told the Ivy League school. A strike by the Graduate
Employees<br>
and Students Organization ended in January after the university<br>
threatened to take away the teaching jobs of assistants who<br>
withheld grades. The precedent-setting case could make it easier<br>
for teaching assistants to form unions.<br>
<br>
FIGHTING TO THE NTH DEGREE -- More than 1,200 striking<br>
graduate teaching assistants were joined by thousands of other<br>
student employees in their strike at three University of
California<br>
campuses. They are protesting the nine-campus system's refusal to<br>
recognize the union of graduate student instructors. More than
two-<br>
thirds of GSIs at UCLA, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley signed<br>
representation cards for the UAW-affiliated unit.<br>
<br>
FIRE WINS AT IUE -- Ed Fire was elected president of the<br>
Electronic Workers, defeating incumbent Bill Bywater 64,865 to<br>
59,787 Saturday at the union's convention in Orlando, Fla. Fire,<br>
59, had served as secretary-treasurer since 1982, when Bywater,
76,<br>
was elected president. Ron Gilvin, 51, chair of the IUE GM<br>
Conference Board, was elected secretary-treasurer, defeating Tom<br>
Rebman. The new officers take over Jan. 1.<br>
<br>
HERE'S BRIDGE FOR JUSTICE -- HERE Local 11 members, calling<br>
themselves the &quot;building bridges for justice&quot;
delegation, took<br>
their long-running fight with the New Otani Hotel &amp; Garden in
Los<br>
Angeles to Japan. A delegation of union members met with
executives<br>
of the hotel's parent New Otani Co. Ltd, U.S. Ambassador Walter<br>
Mondale and Japan Trade Union Confederation officials. They also<br>
demonstrated at New Otani's offices in Tokyo.<br>
<br>
CITARELLA IS GROCERY CRUELLA -- Food and Commercial Workers<br>
Locals 174 and 1500 rallied in front of Citarella grocery in New<br>
York City demanding reinstatement of workers fired for supporting<br>
a union. The union also filed unfair labor practice charges with<br>
the NLRB. Many of the store's mostly Latino workers put in 66 to
80<br>
hours a week while earning barely more than the minimum wage,<br>
working in Citarella's basement with only one exit.<br>
<br>
A TASTE OF VICTORY -- SEIU Local 82 reports progress in its<br>
seven-week janitors' strike against P&amp;R Enterprises, the
largest<br>
non-union cleaning contractor in Metropolitan Washington. At<br>
National Airport, P&amp;R's joint venture partner, PRIEM Building<br>
Services, agreed to settle many strike issues with janitors, and<br>
the strikers there have been able to return to work. But more
than<br>
150 janitors at other locations in downtown Washington remain on<br>
strike as the holidays approach. Hundreds rallied behind the<br>
Justice for Janitors banner last Thursday.<br>
<br>
ACT NOW ON BLACK LUNG -- The Mine Workers say it's time for<br>
quick action on 20 recommendations by the Labor Department to<br>
eradicate black lung disease and silicosis. UMWA President Cecil<br>
Roberts calls speedy implementation &quot;a major step toward
stopping<br>
the progress of these diseases among today's miners, and entirely<br>
preventing these diseases among the next generation.&quot;<br>
<br>
HUNGERING FOR JUSTICE -- Six laid-off Price Pfister workers<br>
are on a weeklong hunger strike to protest the Pacoima, Calif.,<br>
company's cruel treatment of its largely Latino work force. The<br>
hunger strike continues through Thanksgiving eve, when workers
will<br>
present the company with the &quot;Turkey of the Year&quot;
award. The 1,000<br>
workers at Pfister, members of the Teamsters, are fighting the<br>
company for its layoff of 300 workers in the last year in order
to<br>
shift production to Mexico.<br>
<br>
FAIR BALL -- Reebok International Ltd. announced that by this<br>
spring the company's soccer balls will bear labels guaranteeing<br>
they were made without child labor. Reebok has pledged to
implement<br>
a rigorous monitoring program and is supporting educational and<br>
vocational training programs for children previously employed in<br>
the industry. The action was in response to the &quot;Foul
Ball&quot;<br>
campaign mounted by labor and its allies to spotlight the use of<br>
child labor to make the balls.<br>
<br>
JUST DO IT, MICHAEL -- In a letter-writing campaign, children<br>
around the world are asking hoop hero Michael Jordan to put<br>
pressure on Nike, one of his biggest sponsors, to pay its workers<br>
a living wage. The Council of Labor Union Women says that
Jordan's<br>
Nike endorsement earns him $20 million a year, more than Nike's<br>
entire 120,000-strong Indonesian work force earns annually. CLUW<br>
has extended its deadline to receive letters from union members.<br>
For information, call 202/466-4610.<br>
<br>
ADDING UP EDUCATION -- It shouldn't be a surprise, AFT says,<br>
that an international survey shows American 8th graders below<br>
average in math and above average in science. &quot;We're kidding<br>
ourselves if we think we'll see any real improvement in student<br>
learning in this country until we put in place a system of<br>
fundamental changes: high standards for all students, a solid<br>
curriculum with challenging academic content and a serious,<br>
disciplined environment for learning,&quot; notes AFT President
Albert<br>
Shanker.<br>
<br>
HOLD THAT LINE -- Utility Workers President Don Wightman urged<br>
Home Box Office to stop using a promo that shows children picking<br>
up a wire (that leads to a spaceship). The ad &quot;gives a
message to<br>
children that there is something fun at the end of a downed wire,<br>
while what really awaits them may be live electricity and
death,&quot;<br>
Wightman wrote.<br>
<br>
&quot;RANSOM&quot; SLINGS MUD AT IAM -- Mel Gibson's latest
movie,<br>
&quot;Ransom,&quot; takes some cheap shots at the Machinists.
Gibson plays an<br>
airline owner whose son is kidnapped. Another actor plays a
corrupt<br>
IAM union official. Large numbers of outraged members have called<br>
IAM's headquarters to complain about the union's portrayal. The<br>
union legal department is exploring what action, if any, can be<br>
taken.<br>
<br>
ERGONOMICS, TAKE TWO -- An OSHA-NIOSH conference on effective<br>
workplace practices and programs dealing with ergonomics is set
for<br>
Jan. 8-9, 1997, in Chicago. Check out OSHA's home page on the<br>
Internet at www.osha.gov for information, including a
registration<br>
form, or call VisionsUSA, the conference coordinator for OSHA, at<br>
404/880-0006, Ext. 227.<br>
<br>
HEALTH CARE CONFAB -- Workers interested in pushing for<br>
universal health care gather in Arlington, Va., Dec. 6-8 at the<br>
Universal Health Care Action Network's sixth annual conference.<br>
Service Employees and UNITE representatives will address the<br>
delegates. Other sponsors include 1199 National Health and Human<br>
Services Employees Union, UNITE, Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers,<br>
the Indiana State AFL-CIO, OCAW Local 6-10 and Musicians Local
802.<br>

<br>
STRAWBERRY TRAILS -- Representatives from more than 50 labor,<br>
community and religious organizations joined AFL-CIO President
John<br>
Sweeney and Farm Workers President Arturo Rodriguez Nov. 13 to<br>
launch a new National Strawberry Commission on Workers Rights.
The<br>
commission will monitor working conditions in strawberry fields,
as<br>
well as seek support for the workers from supermarket managers
and<br>
the public. Rodriguez and several strawberry workers on Sunday<br>
began a tour of East Coast cities to drum up support.<br>
<br>
GOT THEIR ATTENTION -- Further evidence that the AFL-CIO's<br>
Labor `96 campaign brought working families back to the political<br>
limelight comes from the Coalition, the alliance of powerful big<br>
business and trade groups that is planning a permanent
organization<br>
to fight workers' efforts in coming elections. Why? &quot;We want
to<br>
continue to counter a resurgent labor movement,&quot; a Coalition
leader<br>
said.<br>
<br>
PARK UNION -- A campaign by the Parking Attendants Rights<br>
Committee of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees won a<br>
huge victory after MetroPark agreed to sign a union contract<br>
covering all its facilities in the metropolitan Washington area.<br>
The win comes 18 months after workers voted in favor of union<br>
representation.<br>
<br>
POWER DEMAND -- As the merger nears between non-union<br>
Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric and Washington's PEPCO, the
Electrical<br>
Workers intensified its organizing campaign at BG&amp;E during a
Nov.<br>
15 rally led by AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and IBEW President<br>
John Barry. &quot;BG&amp;E has resisted our efforts with a litany
of<br>
tactics, including the hiring of a union-busting law firm and<br>
outright lies about the IBEW,&quot; Barry said.<br>
<br>
RAISIN' UP IN HOUSTON -- Under the banner &quot;Six-fifty for the<br>
City,&quot; the Houston Coalition for a Living Wage turned in
more than<br>
30,000 signed petitions Nov. 7 to put a citywide, $6.50-an-hour<br>
minimum wage on the ballot. &quot;We found broad and enthusiastic<br>
support&quot; to give the city's 54,000 minimum-wage workers a
raise,<br>
said Richard Sawyer, Harris County AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer.
The<br>
referendum is scheduled for Jan. 18.<br>
<br>
OVERNITE SENSATION -- Workers at Overnite Transportation Co.<br>
in New Orleans and Oakland joined their brothers and sisters at<br>
other locations around the country in filing election petitions
for<br>
Teamsters representation. So far, IBT has been selected at 21<br>
Overnite terminals, and the NLRB has issued bargaining order<br>
complaints at another 14 sites. &quot;The time has come to join
the<br>
Overnite movement for fairness and respect on the job,&quot;
Oakland<br>
city driver Aaron Gettle said.<br>
<br>
DARK DAYS AT SUNBEAM -- Chainsaw Al has done it again. Roving<br>
terminator Albert Dunlap, who earned the moniker after laying off<br>
a third of Scott Paper Co.'s workers in 1994, plans to get rid of<br>
50 percent of Sunbeam Corp.'s work force, chopping down 6,000<br>
workers. Analyst John Challenger said the slash-and-burn action<br>
&quot;certainly ranks up there with the largest cuts&quot; --
this after a<br>
decade marked by wholesale downsizing. Labor Secretary Robert
Reich<br>
called the move &quot;irresponsible corporate behavior,&quot; a
view shared<br>
even by many on Wall Street.<br>
<br>
BAD BUSINESS -- Pennsylvania's working families will converge<br>
on the State Capitol in Harrisburg Nov. 19 to challenge state<br>
leaders to abandon policies that encourage low-wage jobs and take<br>
up a new direction to create good jobs and strengthen families
and<br>
communities. &quot;At the moment, Pennsylvania may be open for
business,<br>
but it's the wrong kind of business,&quot; said William George,
state<br>
fed president.<br>
<br>
GUESS AGAIN -- UNITE's anti-sweatshop campaign is putting the<br>
heat on Guess? Inc., which uses sweatshop labor for its trendy<br>
clothing line. Students at more than 20 campuses, spearheaded by<br>
Union Summer grads, will demonstrate against Guess?. For more<br>
information, contact the Stop Sweatshops Campaign (212) 819-0959,<br>
or go straight to the source and call 1-800-39GUESS and ask them<br>
why they use sweatshop labor.<br>
<br>
GRASSROOTS REVIVAL -- State federation leaders are in<br>
Philadelphia early this week, meeting with AFL-CIO President John<br>
Sweeney, Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka and Executive Vice<br>
President Linda Chavez-Thompson to map out new grassroots<br>
strategies for organizing and legislative activism. Workshops are<br>
being held on subjects ranging from workers' compensation and<br>
training systems to welfare reform. <br>
<br>
ONE PILL COSTS YOU MONEY -- Nursing home residents and their<br>
families may face possible price gouging by the Pharmacy Corp. of<br>
America, a subsidiary of Beverly Enterprises. The Family and<br>
Advocates Network sponsored by the Service Employees found that
PCA<br>
may be overcharging from between 11 percent to nearly 300 percent<br>
for their prescriptions. Last week, the Network kicked off a<br>
nationwide campaign to alert the public.<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS TOY JOY -- The Labor Students and Alumni of Indiana<br>
University in South Bend launched a Christmas toy drive for the<br>
children of striking Detroit newspaper workers who are spending<br>
their second holiday season on the picket lines. And they are<br>
urging local unions across the country to do the same thing. For<br>
more information on ways to help the strikers, call 313/877-9016.<br>
<br>
SEE YOU IN COURT -- Legal Aid lawyers and support staff have<br>
sued the City of New York, claiming the city violated their labor<br>
rights during their 1994 strike. The short strike by the
attorneys,<br>
members of UAW Local 2325, against the nonprofit Legal Aid
Society<br>
ended when GOP Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced he was canceling<br>
the society's contract to provide legal services to the city's
poor<br>
and would not pay for services by any lawyer who did not report
to<br>
work the next day.<br>
<br>
REAL DOWNER -- Real average hourly earnings dipped 0.3 percent<br>
in October. Working families feel the pinch because hourly
earnings<br>
have not increased for a year, while prices have gained a bit.
Real<br>
weekly earnings dropped even further, 1.5 percent, and are down
0.6<br>
percent for the 12-month period. Meanwhile, prices rose 0.3
percent<br>
for the month, indicating that inflation is moderate and steady,<br>
with no indication of a major upsurge any time soon.<br>
<br>
UFCW TO IBP, LET'S SHARE -- Last year, for the first time<br>
since it was instituted, some 1,800 members of UFCW Local 1540 at<br>
IBP beef processing plant received a significant payout from a<br>
profit-sharing plan. So when IBP's latest contract offer killed
the<br>
plan, the workers at the Joslin, Mo., plant last week rejected
the<br>
pact and walked off the job.<br>
<br>
REBUILDING HOPE -- UNITE has helped to rebuild three black<br>
churches burned in South Carolina over the past 18 months. Union<br>
President Jay Mazur traveled to Effingham, S.C., to join the<br>
pastors of the churches to mark UNITE's offering. &quot;Evil
meant to<br>
triumph in this burning, but God meant it for good,&quot; said
Rev. Troy<br>
Shaw of Effingham Baptist, one of the three churches. &quot;Labor
has<br>
truly supported us during this time of trouble.&quot;<br>
<br>
TWO MORE WINS -- A year-and-a-half struggle at Bulk Lift<br>
International near Chicago ended when UNITE members there won a<br>
first contract that gives preferential reinstatement rights to 56<br>
workers fired for union activity. AFSCME members working for New<br>
Mexico's Children, Youth and Family Services Department won an<br>
arbitration in which the state admitted changing work schedules
to<br>
avoid paying overtime.<br>
<br>
NEW CLASS AT HARVARD -- Harvard University's determination to<br>
cut health care premium payments prompted the AFSCME-affiliated<br>
Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers to set up<br>
informational picketing starting Oct. 30. If the Ivy League
school<br>
has its way, more than 500 part-time workers will see their
health<br>
care costs go up $700 annually.<br>
<br>
FREE TRADE'S JUST ANOTHER WORD -- A poll by BankBoston reveals<br>
that most Americans aren't buying the argument that free trade<br>
equals job growth. The survey found that 51 percent think trade<br>
agreements result in fewer jobs, with only 23 percent foreseeing<br>
greater opportunity. On top of that, a whopping 73 percent of<br>
Americans think labor and environmental provisions should be<br>
included in trade pacts.<br>
<br>
STANDARD ISSUES -- The White House plans to continue linking<br>
labor standards and trade, as exemplified by its push for a labor<br>
standards work group at the World Trade Organization. However,
its<br>
reluctance to reopen the labor side agreement of the North
American<br>
Free Trade Agreement means that American workers, like those
fired<br>
at a Spanish-language Sprint subsidiary in San Francisco, still<br>
would lack redress, according to the AFL-CIO Task Force on Trade.<br>
<br>
CALIFORNIA TAKES ON ERGONOMICS -- The nation's first state<br>
standard addressing the spreading scourge of repetitive motion<br>
injuries is in place in California -- but the rule is too riddled<br>
with loopholes to do much good. &quot;It is an unenforceable
standard,&quot;<br>
said Tom Rankin of the California AFL-CIO. The rule could be<br>
useful, said AFL-CIO Occupational Safety and Health Director Peg<br>
Seminario, in that it shows a significant problem and the
necessity<br>
of government action in solving the problem. &quot;That said, the<br>
solution being put forward is the most minimal action that could
be<br>
taken. It was not a serious effort to protect workers.&quot;<br>
<br>
REPETITIVELY SPEAKING -- A conference on effective workplace<br>
practices and programs dealing with ergonomics is set for Jan.
8-9,<br>
1997, at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. Co-sponsored by<br>
OSHA, NIOSH and the Voluntary Programs Participants' Association,<br>
the conference also will provide a forum for labor, government,<br>
business and academia representatives to share information. For<br>
more information, contact Kathy Lea at the VPPPA at 703/761-1146.<br>
<br>
HEALTH CARE BACK IN SPOTLIGHT -- Two weeks after an election<br>
in which the AFL-CIO drove the national debate on issues
important<br>
to working families like Medicare and Medicaid, President John<br>
Sweeney keynoted the American Public Health Association's annual<br>
meeting. Sweeney was the 1996 Dolan Lecturer honoring public
health<br>
nurse Margaret Baggett Dolan. A one-day conference examining the<br>
role of labor and consumer organizations in safeguarding health<br>
care quality is slated for Nov. 21 at the Gramercy Park Hotel in<br>
New York City, during the annual meeting. The conference is<br>
sponsored by the AFL-CIO's Department for Professional Employees.<br>
For more information, contact DPE's Pamela Wilson at
202/638-0320,<br>
Ext. 2, or Marjorie Wheeler at 202/638-0320, Ext. 4.<br>
<br>
SPINNING THE INFO.WEB -- The AFL-CIO will hold InfoTech, an<br>
information technology conference, on Nov. 20. The one-day<br>
conference at federation headquarters shows how the booming<br>
cyberspace race can be used by unions to boost organizing,<br>
political action, membership services and much more. For<br>
information, or to reserve a space, contact Renate Lawson at
(202)<br>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>November 14, 1996<br>
<br>
WORKING FAMILIES ARE BACK! -- The unprecedented Labor '96<br>
grass-roots effort forced Newt Gingrich and his allies to retreat<br>
from their extremist agenda and campaign on working family
issues.<br>
Incumbents with anti-working family records were defeated in 18<br>
congressional districts where the labor movement ran aggressive<br>
campaigns. Pro-worker Democrats also won three open seats and
eight<br>
Senate seats where Labor '96 had active campaigns.<br>
<br>
WORKERS GET OUT AND VOTE -- Twenty-three percent of all voters<br>
were from union households, up from 14 percent in 1994 and 19<br>
percent in 1992. These 21 million voters were the key in many<br>
congressional races, where 68 percent of AFL-CIO union members<br>
voted Democratic and 32 percent voted Republican, according to a<br>
Peter D. Hart post-election poll. That compares with 45 percent<br>
Democratic and 53 percent Republican among nonunion households.<br>
Unionists favored President Clinton by 64 percent, with 28
percent<br>
for Bob Dole and 8 percent for Ross Perot.<br>
<br>
UNION MEMBERS APPLAUD CAMPAIGN -- Among union members who had<br>
heard about the AFL-CIO campaign, 70 percent approved, 13 percent<br>
were neutral and only 15 percent had a negative reaction, the
Hart<br>
poll showed. Even among those who voted Republican, 33 percent
had<br>
a positive view of the AFL-CIO campaign.<br>
<br>
WINNING RESPECT -- Working families will get more respect in<br>
the next Congress, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney predicted after<br>
the election. &quot;Despite the fact that working men and women
and<br>
their unions were outspent by business 7 to 1, this election<br>
amounts to a sea change in Congress for working families. The
105th<br>
Congress will legislate under the spotlight of a working families<br>
agenda, not a business-driven Contract with America,&quot;
Sweeney said.<br>
But those business interests will still be there, &quot;and we'll
be<br>
there, watching out for working families and holding Democrats as<br>
well as Republicans accountable.&quot;<br>
<br>
REICH'S FAMILY LEAVE ACT -- Labor bids a reluctant farewell to<br>
Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich, who is leaving the Cabinet to<br>
spend more time with his family. Reich has been a strong voice in<br>
government for workers and their unions.<br>
<br>
WIN AT BRIDGESTONE -- After two-and-a-half years of bitter<br>
struggle, the Steelworkers announced a tentative contract that<br>
meets all the demands of the union. Some details still need to be<br>
worked out, USWA President George Becker said, but the workers<br>
scored wins on the issues of wages, pensions, work rules, pattern<br>
bargaining and the return to work of all union workers. Becker<br>
credited the solidarity of the Bridgestone workers and support
from<br>
then labor movement for the win.<br>
<br>
UNION MOMENTUM IN MARYLAND -- With 40,000 state workers<br>
eligible for the benefits of union representation, mail ballots<br>
went out Nov. 8 to workers in three units petitioned by AFSCME. A<br>
unit of public safety and security officers, being organized<br>
jointly by AFSCME and the Teamsters, will get their ballots next<br>
week. AFSCME filed last week to represent a fifth unit, covering<br>
9,000 employees, and AFT is preparing to file petitions to<br>
represent workers in two other units. Workers are learning the<br>
importance of collective bargaining thorugh radio ads and direct<br>
mailings prepared by AFSCME. On Nov. 7, Baltimoreans United in<br>
Leadership Development/BUILD, a group of 50 churches, sponsored a<br>
rally to support the organizing effort.<br>
<br>
SCHOOL'S IN -- About 400 non-instructional employees at<br>
Montgomery (Md.) College said &quot;No more!&quot; to
second-class treatment<br>
and joined AFSCME's District Council 67.<br>
<br>
REORGANIZED COAST TO COAST -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney<br>
has appointed new directors and deputy directors in a Department
of<br>
Field Mobilization streamlined from 12 to 4 regions. Directing
the<br>
West is Mark Splain, an Organizing Institute veteran, and the<br>
deputy director is Pat Lee, a founding member of the Asian
Pacific<br>
American Labor Alliance; Mary Fears Creighton moves from the New<br>
York region to direct the Midwest, assisted by Bruce Colburn,<br>
secretary-treasurer of the Milwaukee central labor council; Kirk<br>
Adams, international health care organizing coordinator for the<br>
Service Employees, will direct the South, and his deputy will be<br>
Ken Johnson, who has directed the Southern Labor Institute;<br>
directing the East will be Jose (Joe) Alvarez, who has been
UNITE's<br>
political director, and the deputy director will be Merrilee<br>
Milstein, now the Connecticut deputy secretary of state and
former<br>
political director of the state AFL-CIO. Directors for each state<br>
will be announced later.<br>
<br>
FOCUS ON GLOBAL ECONOMY -- The AFL-CIO Industrial Union<br>
Department convention voted to restructure to build &quot;a
strong<br>
global strategic action framework&quot; to help unions deal with<br>
transnational corporations that &quot;shop the world for the
lowest<br>
labor costs and the least restrictive health and safety,<br>
environmental and investment laws.&quot; Delegates elected Peter
diCicco<br>
president and Joe Uehlein secretary-treasurer.<br>
<br>
UAW GAINS SECURITY AT GM -- The UAW's new contract with<br>
General Motors will go to the membership for ratification Nov.
15,<br>
the union announced. The new deal, patterned after accords with
the<br>
other two Big Three automakers, guarantees that 95 percent of
GM's<br>
215,000 UAW workers will keep their jobs. GM had sought to cut as<br>
many as 70,000 jobs over the next three years. The contract also<br>
calls for pension increases and improved health care benefits.<br>
<br>
WORKERS KEEP SHIRTS -- Workers at the C.F. Hathaway shirt<br>
plant in Waterville, Maine, approved a three-year contract with
an<br>
investor group that agreed to buy the plant to avoid a threatened<br>
shutdown. The new contract initially freezes pay, reduces
holidays<br>
and requires workers to contribute toward health insurance while<br>
preserving severance benefits and guaranteeing production at the<br>
facility. Warnaco Group, the former owner announced last May that<br>
it planned to shut or sell the plant, threatening the jobs of 515<br>
UNITE workers.<br>
<br>
OTHER DETROIT DAILIES SETTLE -- Detroit newspaper workers<br>
reached tentative agreement with two Detroit suburban dailies --<br>
the Macomb Daily and the Daily Tribune in Royal Oak. The workers,<br>
who made wage and benefit concessions in 1993, will receive a 9<br>
percent raise over the next three years. &quot;I think it speaks
very<br>
loudly that the Council of Unions (which represents the newspaper<br>
workers), when it has a reasonable newspaper management to deal<br>
with, can negotiate a labor agreement without the strife and<br>
bitterness that we have seen with the downtown newspapers,&quot;
said<br>
Louis Mleczko, president of Newspaper Guild Local 22.<br>
<br>
MEANY CENTER CHIEF -- Susan Schurman has been named executive<br>
director of the George Meany Center for Labor Studies. She has<br>
directed the Labor Extension Programs at Rutgers University since<br>
1992 and is a two-term president of the University and College<br>
Labor Education Association. Schurman, who assumes the new post
in<br>
January, succeeds Bob Pleasure, now assistant to President
Sweeney<br>
for education.<br>
<br>
MECHANICS TO LINK WITH UAW -- The Mechanics Education Society<br>
of America announced it will merge with the UAW next year,<br>
effective Jan. 1. MESA represents about 3,000 skilled trades and<br>
production workers at manufacturing facilities in Ohio, Michigan<br>
and New York.<br>
<br>
JOINT FLYING EXERCISE -- The Canadian Air Line Pilots<br>
Association, meeting in convention Nov. 19-21, will consider a<br>
proposal to merge with its U.S. counterpart, a move already<br>
approved by the ALPA executive board. &quot;This merger will be
the<br>
first step toward ensuring that pilots of different nations will<br>
not be pitted against one another, and that the hard-fought-for<br>
standards of the piloting profession will not be eroded,&quot;
said ALPA<br>
President J. Randolph Babbitt.<br>
<br>
MAIL HANDLERS RE-ELECT OFFICERS -- The Mail Handlers re-<br>
elected President William Quinn and Secretary-Treasurer Mark<br>
Gardner to their second terms in mail balloting that concluded
Oct.<br>
28. The union, a division of the Laborers, represents 50,000<br>
workers at the U.S. Postal Service.<br>
<br>
SCAB WATCH -- The use of striker replacements would be an<br>
unfair labor practice in many cases in Canada under a proposal by<br>
Labor Minister Alfonso Gagliano. While not prohibiting their use<br>
during a legal strike or lockout, the amendments would prohibit<br>
their use as a way to undermine a union's representative
capacity,<br>
and would give strikers employment preference after resuming
work.<br>
Canadian unionists criticized the proposal for not including a<br>
general ban on the use of striker replacements.<br>
<br>
FREE PAKPAHAN -- A top-level delegation from the International<br>
Confederation of Free Trade Unions, led by Secretary-General Bill<br>
Jordan, visited Indonesia and demanded the release of jailed
labor<br>
leader Muchtar Pakpahan. Pakpahan, who heads Indonesia's free
trade<br>
union federation, SBSI, has been held in solitary confinement
since<br>
July 29 and is charged with subversion, a capital offense.
AFL-CIO<br>
Vice President Leon Lynch of the Steelworkers was a member of the<br>
delegation. Earlier this year, Pakpahan testified before the U.S.<br>
Congress about worker rights abuses in Indonesia. To find out how<br>
you can help, contact the International Affairs Department at
202-<br>
637-5050, FAX 202-637-5325.<br>
<br>
TRUCK STOP -- The AFL-CIO has joined with the Teamsters and<br>
other groups to run print and radio ads urging the U.S.
government<br>
to bar unsafe Mexican trucks from highways in California and
Texas.<br>
Republican governors have demanded that the trucks, which now
must<br>
unload within a narrow strip along the border, be permitted<br>
anywhere in their states, putting at risk the jobs and safety of<br>
their constituents. The ads note that the trucks are used only<br>
because drivers in Mexico are paid as little as $8 a day.<br>
<br>
TRADING RIGHTS FOR WRONGS -- Trade unionists will descend on<br>
Singapore early next month to push for including standards in<br>
upcoming trade agreements. The global effort at the first<br>
ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization will include
a<br>
planning conference followed by the WTO meeting, where many<br>
unionists will serve as delegates. A draft agenda for the meeting<br>
ignores the issue of worker rights, which the Clinton<br>
administration has vowed to pursue.<br>
<br>
JOB INSECURITY -- Despite an expanding job market and<br>
declining unemployment, 4.2 million workers were displaced from<br>
jobs they held for more than three years between January 1993 and<br>
December 1995. That was down only slightly from the 1991-1993<br>
period surveyed by the Labor Department, which covered part of a<br>
recession and slow recovery. Workers, only 43 percent of whom<br>
received advance written notice, said most frequently that plant
or<br>
company closings or moves were responsible for their
displacement.<br>
<br>
HO HO HO! AN INTERESTING OFFER -- Many participants in Union<br>
Privilege's Union Credit Card Program will pay no interest on<br>
purchases made in November and December. The gift ends at the end<br>
of the year, with the regular interest rate charge assessed to<br>
those November and December purchases beginning in January. </p>

<p align="left">AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- November 04, 1996</p>
<p>VOTE! YOUR LIFE MAY DEPEND ON IT -- Saying that Mine Workers
and<br>
their families face a &quot;life-or-death situation&quot; in the
face of<br>
congressional attacks on health and safety rules, union President<br>
Cecil Roberts called a memorial period covering all 75,000
members<br>
for Election Day, Nov. 5. Roberts, who has the right to call<br>
memorial days under UMWA contracts, urged members to use the day
to<br>
vote, and to make sure that as many other working people vote as<br>
possible for candidates who will &quot;protect their health,
safety and<br>
retirement security.&quot;<br>
<br>
KEY STRAWBERRY VICTORY -- In support of the AFL-CIO/Farm Workers<br>
Strawberry Campaign, Lenore Miller, president of the Retail,<br>
Wholesale and Department Store Union, convinced Key Foods<br>
Supermarkets in New York City to sign on to the pledge for<br>
strawberry workers' rights. Key Foods operates a chain of 148<br>
stores. Latest developments in the strawberry campaign are
included<br>
on Page 3.<br>
<br>
SETTLEMENT AT GM -- The UAW-GM council will meet Nov. 6 to review<br>
a tentative national contract before sending it to members for<br>
ratification. No details were released, but UAW President Stephen<br>
P. Yokich said the union worked hard to craft an agreement that<br>
would fit all of the Big Three automakers and &quot;that's
exactly what<br>
we have now accomplished.&quot; While there is a national
agreement,<br>
local disputes continue. Workers at an Indianapolis metal
stamping<br>
plant ended a five-day local strike that had crippled production
of<br>
GM pickups and sport utility vehicles. A walkout continued at a<br>
Jaynesville, Wis., plant.<br>
<br>
RAIL UNIONS UNITED -- Rail labor will unite to jointly analyze<br>
competing Conrail merger proposals and take a collective position<br>
on any sale or merger of the company, AFL-CIO President John<br>
Sweeney announced after a meeting of the unions and the<br>
federation's Transportation Trades Department. The unions also<br>
established firm unity ground rules that rail unions will meet<br>
collectively only as a unified group under the TTD. The unions<br>
involved are the Train Dispatchers, Maintenance of Way<br>
Employes,Railway Signalmen, Machinists, Boilermakers, Electrical<br>
Workers, Firemen and Oilers Conference of SEIU, Sheet Metal<br>
Workers, Transportation Communications Union, Transport Workers
and<br>
United Transportation Union.<br>
<br>
HERE WINS AIRPORT VOTE -- Stuck in a rut for 18 years, Hotel<br>
Employees and Restaurant Employees Local 355 got results by<br>
switching 40 percent of its budget to organizing. Workers at<br>
Rexall's food and beverage operation in Miami Airport voted 78-42<br>
for union representation. &quot;This is just the beginning. We
are<br>
spending three days doing rep work and devoting two days to<br>
organizing workers,&quot; said Secretary-Treasurer Andy Balash.<br>
<br>
HOOSIERS TAKE ON FEDEX -- Across the country, FedEx employees are<br>
fired up over Congress' &quot;midnight special&quot; favor to
FedEx that<br>
helps the company avoid organizing. Hundreds of FedEx workers
from<br>
throughout the Midwest converged on Indianapolis Nov. 3 in
support<br>
of their brothers and sisters seeking Teamsters recognition at
the<br>
carrier's facilities there and in Muncie and Columbus, Ind.
&quot;FedEx<br>
workers built their company and are proud of what they've
built,&quot;<br>
the union said. The IBT represents 200,000 workers at UPS,
Airborne<br>
and other FedEx competitors.<br>
<br>
PUTTING ON A NEW KOAT -- NABET-CWA members at KOAT-TV in<br>
Albuquerque, N.M., have a first contract after bargaining for
more<br>
than a year. Local 407 garnered community support via news<br>
conferences, picketing and letters to advertisers, a strategy<br>
NABET-CWA locals also have used in Buffalo, San Diego and Detroit
-<br>
- and banner-toting airplane flyovers.<br>
<br>
GETTING OUT THE MESSAGE -- Election volunteers across the country<br>
are making the final push to turn out informed worker/voters on<br>
Nov. 5, working the phones and plant gates and going door to
door.<br>
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and 10,000 working families
rallied<br>
with Vice President Gore and Democratic Sens. John Kerry and
Edward<br>
M. Kennedy in a pre-election gathering in Boston Nov. 1. The
rally<br>
came in the midst of a whirlwind of activity by Sweeney,
Secretary-<br>
Treasurer Richard L. Trumka and Executive Vice President Linda<br>
Chavez-Thompson, as the three criss-crossed the country in the<br>
final days before the election reaching out to working Americans.<br>
Sweeney toured Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode
Island<br>
and rode a bus through four Ohio cities before traveling back to<br>
Massachusetts, where he attended rallies in four cities. In just<br>
two days, Nov. 1-2, Trumka spoke to seven rallies: in Pittsburgh;<br>
Philadelphia; Long Island, N.Y.; three in New Jersey; and<br>
Gillespie, Ill. Chavez-Thompson spent the weekend stumping
through<br>
Texas.<br>
<br>
NORTHWEST RAISE UP IN AIR -- Arbitration has begun to determine<br>
whether Air Line Pilots at Northwest Airlines will get a full
&quot;wage<br>
snap-up.&quot; Under the 1993 ALPA contract, pilots are entitled
to a<br>
snap-up determined by averaging wage increases at four other<br>
airlines at the time concessions were made years ago. Management<br>
says the amount should be less than the 3 percent sought by the<br>
union.<br>
<br>
KENNECOTT UNIONS MINE RAISE -- Members of six unions ratified a
new<br>
six-year contract with Kennecott's Utah copper mining facilities<br>
that raise wages by an average of $2.90 an hour, 50 cents the
first<br>
five years and 40 cents in the last. Pension benefits and
sickness<br>
and accident benefits also were increased. The 1,800 workers are<br>
represented by the Steelworkers, Machinists, Operating Engineers,<br>
United Transportation Union, Office and Professional employees
and<br>
Electrical Workers.<br>
<br>
UNION BEATS GREED -- Members of Teamsters Local 528 voted 300-40
in<br>
favor of a new contract with Atlanta Gas &amp; Light, ending a
five-day<br>
strike. AG&amp;L made more than $77 million in profits during the
fist<br>
nine months of this year, but provoked a strike by demanding that<br>
workers agree to contracting out their jobs, a wage freeze and an<br>
increase in co-payments for health insurance.<br>
<br>
ROCKIN' FOR DETROIT NEWSPAPER WORKERS -- British rock musician<br>
Billy Bragg brought his social conscience and music to Detroit in<br>
a benefit concert for striking newspaper workers. The benefit<br>
netted $5,100 for the strikers.<br>
<br>
STRIDES IN JANITORS' STRIKE -- As the Washington Justice for<br>
Janitors' strike entered its sixth week, more than 1 million
square<br>
feet of office space cleaned by P&amp;R Enterprises in three
different<br>
buildings was put out to bid. The janitors also started a
&quot;Rit<br>
Thompson Watch&quot; asking the public to contact Justice for
Janitors<br>
if they spot Thompson, who is president of P&amp;R, so he can
respond<br>
to his workers' concerns.<br>
<br>
STILL GETTING THE SHAFTA -- The number of U.S. workers certified<br>
for assistance after losing their jobs under the North American<br>
Free Trade Agreement jumped 40 percent in the last year to nearly<br>
90,000, according to the U.S. Labor Department. But, some
analysts<br>
think the true figure of those displaced may be five times that.<br>
Robert E. Scott, a researcher at the University of Maryland,<br>
estimates that between 392,000 and 484,000 jobs have been lost
due<br>
to NAFTA. The Labor Department says that eligibility for income<br>
support while in training will increase, thanks to the recent<br>
settlement of a suit brought by the UAW.<br>
<br>
FED UP -- In a letter to the Federal Reserve Board, AFL-CIO<br>
Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka assailed the reduced time
and<br>
information available for those who to want to comment on
proposed<br>
bank mergers and acquisitions. Particularly hard hit would be<br>
minority, low- and moderate-income communities, who need the
two-or<br>
three-month period now available to learn about and respond to<br>
merger proposals. The Fed wants that period shortened to 15 days.<br>
&quot;Given the rapid and soon-to-accelerate rate of banking
industry<br>
consolidation, more information about bank mergers and
acquisitions<br>
and more careful scrutiny of their impact on the public prior to<br>
approval is needed, not less,&quot; Trumka said.<br>
<br>
JOBLESS RATE HOLDS STEADY -- The nation's unemployment rate<br>
remained steady in October at 5.2 percent. Payroll employment
rose<br>
by 210,000, with the largest gains in services and retail trade,<br>
while manufacturing was unchanged. When marginally attached
workers<br>
and those working part time involuntarily were added in, the rate<br>
was 8.8 percent, down from 9 percent in September.<br>
<br>
VIOLENCE COMMENTS SOUGHT -- OSHA again has extended the deadline<br>
for comments on its draft &quot;Guidelines for Workplace Violence<br>
Prevention Programs for Night Retail Establishments,&quot; with
comments<br>
now due by Dec. 4. The draft addresses exchange of money, working<br>
alone or in small numbers, late at night or early in the morning,<br>
in high-crime areas, as a guard or in community settings.
Comments<br>
may be sent to Patricia D. Biles, Workplace Violence Program<br>
Coordinator, Department of Labor/OSHA, 200 Constitution Ave.
N.W.,<br>
Room N3107, Washington, D.C. 20210.<br>
<br>
SILICOSIS TARGETED -- The Labor Department's announcement of an<br>
initiative to prevent silicosis comes as welcome news to the more<br>
than 1 million workers exposed annually to silica dust. Free<br>
materials on the education campaign &quot;If It's Silica, It's
Not Just<br>
Dust&quot; are available by calling 1/800-35-NIOSH. DoL
inspectors also<br>
will distribute such material on silicosis, a lung disease which<br>
kills 250 American workers annually.<br>
<br>
CHAMPION . . . NOT -- A federal appeals court reversed an NLRB<br>
decision that labor law was violated when a supervisor told
workers<br>
in the midst of an organizing campaign, &quot;I hope you guys are
ready<br>
to pack up and move to Mexico.&quot; The U.S. Court of Appeals
for the<br>
7th Circuit ruled that &quot;off-handed&quot; remarks were not
coercive or<br>
threatening, while conceding that the comments came &quot;close
to the<br>
edge&quot; of running afoul of the National Labor Relations Act.
The UAW<br>
filed the complaint against Champion Laboratories Inc.<br>
<br>
NO HOLIDAY IN MEXICO -- The Labor Department will hold a hearing<br>
Dec. 3 to air charges that Mexican federal workers are being<br>
prevented from organizing an independent union. Labor and human<br>
rights groups say the Mexican government eliminated the
government<br>
trade union for employees of the Fishing Ministry and prevented
it<br>
from registering again. DoL's National Administrative Office is
to<br>
issue a report that will recommend whether ministerial<br>
consultations, a prescribed &quot;remedy&quot; under NAFTA, are
warranted.<br>
<br>
CAPITALIST TOOLS -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. is being scrutinized
by<br>
a federal grand jury for allegations that it sold high-tech
machine<br>
tools to China's military in exchange for orders for its Chinese-<br>
built MD-80 and MD-90 jetliners. While the U.S. manufacturer has<br>
been building the planes in China for more than a decade, it was<br>
warned three years ago that failure to deliver the equipment
would<br>
&quot;have a big influence on the program and long-term
cooperation.&quot;<br>
Both McDonnell Douglas and Boeing have been sharply criticized by<br>
unionists for trading away U.S. technology and U.S. jobs in<br>
exchange for market share.</p>

<p>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- October 29, 1996</p>
<p>IT'D BE FUNNY IF . . . Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas), in his<br>
continued bumbling war against AFL-CIO advertising, took the
stand<br>
yesterday in a hearing for a preliminary injunction. He admitted<br>
under cross-examination that he did not read Congressional Budget<br>
Office reports, did not know the name of the director, and
refuses<br>
to read the New York Times or the Washington Post. He was seeking<br>
an injunction to stop ads that hadn't run in his district in<br>
months. His two witnesses about the harm he'd been caused
included<br>
one who admitted he'd never seen the ads prior to court and one
who<br>
didn't live in his district. The judge denied his motion.<br>
<br>
UAW, GM TALKING FOR NOW -- Talks between the UAW and GM resumed<br>
Oct. 29, two days after a strike deadline had passed. President<br>
Stephen P. Yokich said the union had no immediate plans for a<br>
strike, but he left open the possibility that some locals could<br>
call strikes at individual plants. UAW-GM locals with no local<br>
agreements are free to call walkouts. Last week, the Canadian
Auto<br>
Workers approved a new three-year contract with GM after a 21-day<br>
strike caused the layoff of nearly 20,000 U.S. and Mexican
workers.<br>
<br>
DOCS STEP UP FOR UNION -- Associations representing most of the<br>
nation's podiatrists have formed the first nationwide labor union<br>
for doctors. The First National Guild for Health Care Providers
of<br>
the Lower Extremities will become part of the Office and<br>
Professional Employees, and expects at least 10,000 of the
nation's<br>
14,000 podiatrists to join. The union wants to give podiatrists
and<br>
other doctors more power in dealing with managed-care<br>
organizations.<br>
<br>
NURSES NOT FOOLED -- Genesis Health Systems wanted to bust<br>
Teamsters Local 332 by merging Flint Osteopathic Hospital with<br>
nonunion hospitals. What they didn't count on was the
determination<br>
of the nurses to keep union protections. Registered nurses at the<br>
merged facility voted 406-249 for the IBT.<br>
<br>
BE FAIR WITH CARE -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney will join<br>
hundreds of workers today in a rally for a fair contract at the<br>
Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. The 1,900 workers,
represented<br>
by the Teamsters, have been working without a contract since
Sept.<br>
30, and are fighting management's efforts to eliminate job
security<br>
provisions. They rejected the most recent contract offer by 97<br>
percent.<br>
<br>
BRIDGESTONE EXPOSED -- The Steelworkers released a hard-hitting<br>
expose of corporate renegade Bridgestone/Firestone and pledged to<br>
continued fighting until workers win a fair contract.
&quot;Running Over<br>
the American Dream: A Case Study in Corporate Greed and<br>
Irresponsibility,&quot; will be printed in four languages and<br>
distributed in countries where Bridgestone does business. USWA<br>
President George Becker also announced that three Saturn dealers
--<br>
two in Ohio and one in Iowa -- have joined the union's
&quot;Don't Buy&quot;<br>
campaign against Bridgestone.<br>
<br>
NO BLUE RIBBON FOR PABST -- After 152 years, Pabst is moving its<br>
brewery out of Milwaukee, leaving 250 workers without jobs a week<br>
before Christmas and betraying the trust of employees and the
city.<br>
Effective Dec. 17, the company is shifting its production to a<br>
plant in La Crosse, Wis., owned by Stroh's. The workers, members
of<br>
the UAW's Brewery Workers Local 9, have launched a national<br>
campaign against the company.<br>
<br>
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A CONTRACT MAKES -- The Farm Workers signed a
new<br>
contract with Monterey Mushroom Co. that gives workers pay<br>
increases from 20 to 35 percent over the next five years. During<br>
the Oct. 28 contract signing, UFW President Arturo Rodriguez also<br>
presented union pension checks -- one for $16,732 -- to four<br>
retired farm workers and the widow of a fifth who didn't know
they<br>
were eligible for retirement benefits.<br>
<br>
ON THE ROAD -- Many international union presidents have joined
the<br>
AFL-CIO's John Sweeney, Rich Trumka and Linda Chavez-Thompson on<br>
the hustings as the Nov. 5 Election Day looms nearer. Among the<br>
activists urging union members to vote for candidates who stand<br>
with working families are Presidents George Becker of the<br>
Steelworkers, Gerald McEntee of AFSCME and John Sturdivant of
AFGE,<br>
who on Thursday join Sweeney in Ohio for a GOTV bus tour. Andy<br>
Stern of the Service Employees joins Sweeney Friday in<br>
Massachusetts. Electronic Workers President Bill Bywater last
week<br>
was with Trumka in Evansville, Ind., where 600 union members
rocked<br>
the city's coliseum with a pre-election rally. Machinists
President<br>
George Kourpias has been out all month traveling from work site
to<br>
work site, urging union members to vote. Becker has been
tireless,<br>
with forays into Minnesota, Alabama, Ohio, New York and<br>
Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>
LIVING BETTER WITH LESS CHEMISTRY -- The government issued a rule<br>
negotiated with labor to limit exposure to 1,3-butadiene, a<br>
flammable, carcinogenic chemical used in making synthetic rubber.<br>
The regulation, signed at a union hall in Akron, Ohio, by OSHA<br>
Administrator Joe Dear, substantially reduces permissible
exposures<br>
and provides for employee training, exposure monitoring, hazard<br>
communication, medical surveillance and recordkeeping. The<br>
Occupational Safety and Health Administration predicts that the<br>
rule, which affects nearly 10,000 workers, will prevent about 79<br>
deaths over a 45-year working lifetime.<br>
<br>
NO JUSTICE NO PEACE -- Janitors in Washington continued their<br>
weekly protests at National Airport Oct. 23 as they entered their<br>
fifth week of strikes. More than 250 union and nonunion janitors<br>
who clean National Airport are holding firm despite threats and<br>
harassment from PRIEM Building Services. Contracts covering 1,700<br>
union janitors in the city expired Sept. 30.<br>
<br>
LIUNA REFORM APPROVED -- A federal appeals court upheld the<br>
Laborers' internal reform program, throwing out a challenge by
two<br>
suspended union vice presidents. The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the<br>
7th Circuit said the LIUNA board &quot;used powers bestowed upon
them by<br>
the members' own votes&quot; to enact the new ethical practices
code.<br>
<br>
GOOD NEWS ON THE PACIFIC RIM -- South Korea will only be admitted<br>
into the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development if<br>
it brings its labor laws into conformance with international<br>
standards. The condition was added after an AFL-CIO petition<br>
convinced the White House to reverse its earlier support for the<br>
fast-developing Asian country's entry into the world body without<br>
such a requirement. Korea's labor laws are a legacy of its
earlier<br>
military government, and have been used to restrict the
collective<br>
bargaining process and intimidate thousands of union members and<br>
leaders.<br>
<br>
STOP AT THE BORDER -- The Teamsters moved ahead with its lawsuit<br>
challenging trucking provisions of the North American Free Trade<br>
Agreement. In a new brief filed in federal court, the union<br>
attacked proposed federal rules to certify Mexican carriers as
safe<br>
for U.S. highways, pointing to General Accounting Office warnings<br>
of significant safety problems. Nearly half of the trucks
inspected<br>
between Dec. 18 and April 5 have been taken out of service. Under<br>
the proposed rules, the application form for certification would<br>
require no proof that safety requirements have been met,
including<br>
those governing the transport of hazardous materials.<br>
<br>
COMPETITION CUTS BOTH WAYS -- A report by the Council on<br>
Competitiveness concludes that the United States over the past<br>
decade has outperformed other advanced industrial economies in<br>
several key measures of competitiveness. But the glass is clearly<br>
half empty. While the U.S. position has improved in global market<br>
share, per capita domestic production, growth in industrial
output,<br>
budget deficit reduction and employment, the council found the<br>
United States slipping in wage stagnation and inequality,
national<br>
saving rate, investment in plant and equipment, R&amp;D outlays
and<br>
education.<br>
<br>
INSENSITIVITY TRAINING -- Giving a new twist to job training, the<br>
New Jersey Business and Industry Association sponsored a seminar<br>
called &quot;Dismissing Employees&quot; to help bosses
&quot;satisfy all legal<br>
requirements in a termination, whether it is a single dismissal
or<br>
a larger layoff.&quot; In response, the state's Industrial Union
Council<br>
last week joined unemployed workers in a press conference held at<br>
the seminar site, and presented BIA with a big pink slip saying,<br>
&quot;Stop the Layoffs!&quot; IUC Secretary-Treasurer Lois
Cuccinello called<br>
for passage of a law that would provide income to affected<br>
employees and communities affected by downsizing, while
penalizing<br>
corporate do-badders.<br>
<br>
SWEATSHOPS ON THE RUN -- Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich last
week<br>
added the &quot;power of the pulpit&quot; in his campaign to
eradicate<br>
sweatshops. Representatives from a broad spectrum of organized<br>
religions pledged to carry the anti-sweatshop message to their<br>
congregations. The national campaign is working: A DoL report
shows<br>
that child labor was down significantly in several Central
American<br>
countries and that many manufacturers for American industry have<br>
developed codes of conduct which ban child labor.<br>
<br>
UNIONS GET LABOR MANAGEMENT FUNDS -- The Machinists, Teamsters
and<br>
Roofers will receive $100,000 each as part of a $1.5 million<br>
federal grant to create labor-management committees or to expand<br>
existing cooperative workplace efforts under grants from the<br>
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Municipal governments<br>
and their public-sector unions, including AFT, the Graphics<br>
Communications Union, the Boilermakers and UNITE, were awarded<br>
funds ranging between $54,000 and $75,000 to develop performance<br>
systems or expand employee involvement committees.<br>
<br>
CYBER JOB SEARCHING -- The Labor Department last week launched a<br>
new Internet web site that provides federal employees who face<br>
downsizing with on-line search and career transition services.
The<br>
exit off the information superhighway is<br>
http://safetynet.doleta.gov.<br>
<br>
QUAN IS UNITE VP -- Katie Quan was elected a vice president of<br>
UNITE, making her the first Asian-American elected to a top<br>
leadership position with the union. Quan has been manager of the<br>
Pacific Northwest District Council of UNITE.<br>
<br>
MARITIME LEADER DEAD -- Seafarers Vice President Joseph Sacco
died<br>
Oct. 19 after a heart attack. He was 58. Sacco, a member of the
the<br>
executive board of the AFL-CIO Maritime Trades Department,<br>
supervised and directed organizational and operational activities<br>
in ports nationwide, coordinated contractual negotiations and<br>
supervised the union's political activities. In lieu of flowers,<br>
the family asked that contributions be made to the Joseph Sacco<br>
Scholarship Fund, Tom DeVivio, trustee, 5201 Auth Way, Camp<br>
Springs, Md. 20746.<br>
<br>
LABOR NEWS PIONEER DIES -- Henry Fleisher, the first director of<br>
publications of the AFL-CIO and a public relations consultant for<br>
unions and nonprofit associations for many years, died Oct. 25 of<br>
pneumonia in Washington, D.C. He was 83. Fleisher was the
assistant<br>
editor of CIO News and director of publicity for the CIO before<br>
being named to head publications for the merged AFL-CIO in 1955.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- October 21, 1996</p>
<pre>ENDGAME -- With just two weeks left, tens of thousands of union
activists are mobilizing across the country to make sure union
members make the difference on Election Day. The Machinists are
working through 23,000 in-plant union representatives. The Service
Employees have signed up 7,000 leaders and members to take part in
at least five political action activities. Hundreds of AFL-CIO and
union staff are in targeted congressional districts to spread the
word on how candidates stand on the issues and to urge union
members to vote.

     YELLING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK -- While Republicans are
howling about union political activities, a new report by the
Center for Responsive Politics shows that business groups have
contributed $242 million to candidates this political season,
mostly to Republicans. That's &quot;nearly seven times the $35 million
given by labor groups and more than $10.6 million given by such
ideological or single-issue groups as the National Rifle
Association, which opposes gun control,&quot; the Washington Post
reported.

     GOING TO WORKERS -- Activists in Washington state will be
spending their lunch hour Wednesday at plant gates all across the
state, distributing hundreds of thousands of leaflets urging union
members to vote. They will be trying to reverse the 1992 election
result that sent six anti-worker legislators to Congress.

     THE SUNSHINE STATE -- AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka
and Robert A. Georgine, president of the Building and Construction
Trades Department, helped celebrate the Jacksonville United Labor
Alliance's get-out-the-vote campaign Oct. 18. Florida is a key
state in this year's critical election, Trumka told an audience of
more than 500 people.

     WHAT'S AT STAKE? -- The AFL-CIO Transportation Trade
Department is distributing a rank-and-file union member voter guide
entitled &quot;What's at Stake for Transportation Workers in the Race
for President?&quot; Contact TTD at 202/628-9262.

     FIGHTING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY -- Trumka pledged an all-out
fight in the next Congress to prevent the Wall Street-backed plan
to privatize Social Security. While the system &quot;requires some
thoughtful, timely adjustments, which we'll support, we will not
support any sort of tampering with or undermining of the current
system,&quot; said Trumka, who joined consumer and seniors' advocates
Oct. 17 in a news conference to release a new expose in Mother
Jones magazine.

     LESS IS MORRELL -- Hundreds of John Morrell &amp; Co. retirees
were joined by their union, the Food and Commercial Workers, and
Rep. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) at a press conference last Thursday to
focus attention on their continued fight to regain their company
health insurance. The union took the case to the Supreme Court, but
the court refused to hear it. The workers now depend on Medicare.
In another case, on Sept. 27, a federal judge ruled that Pabst
Brewing Co. could cancel health benefits for its retired workers.
Johnson, who is running against incumbent Republican Sen. Larry
Pressler, announced his support for the workers' cause.

     IFPTE ENGINEERS TWO WINS -- About 150 employees in the
Pittsburgh District Office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
voted two-to-one for representation with the Professional and
Technical Engineers. Meanwhile, across the state, 1,240 employees
at the Naval Surface Warfare Center voted overwhelmingly for IFPTE
representation.

     WAVING THE BLACK FLAG -- The Steelworkers will release a
report Oct. 22 at AFL-CIO headquarters that will point the finger
at Bridgestone/Firestone as a flagrant corporate lawbreaker.
&quot;Running Over the American Dream: A Case Study in Corporate Greed
and Irresponsibility&quot; describes the way the company abuses its
workers, the environment and workplace safety standards while
ducking civic responsibility in the communities that host its
plants. Press conferences are scheduled Oct. 22 in Akron, Ohio;
Bloomington, Ill.; Decatur, Ill.; Des Moines, Iowa; Kings
Mt./Gastonia, N.C.; Nashville, Tenn.; Noblesville, Ind.; Oklahoma
City; Prescott, Ark.; and Russellville, Ark.  GETTING DOWN TO
BUSINESS -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney is taking workers'
messages directly to business groups this week. He's in New York
Monday to meet with the U.S. Council for International Business,
and returns to the city Friday to speak with Business for Social
Responsibility. On Wednesday, he's in Arizona for a Work-in-America
Roundtable and, on Thursday, he's in Chicago for the Common Ground
Project. Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka and Executive Vice
President Linda Chavez-Thompson will join Sweeney on the road for
GOTV from Texas to Indiana, Minnesota and Montana. 

     

     JOBS AT STAKE -- Three union leaders warned that thousands of
American high-tech jobs will be lost if the Federal Communications
Commission doesn't soon adopt national standards for high-
definition television. In a letter to Vice President Gore,
Presidents John Barry of the Electrical Workers, Morton Bahr of the
Communications Workers and  Bill Bywater of the Electronic Workers
urged adoption of standards agreed to by the Grand Alliance -- the
group of computer industry manufacturers and consumer electronic
broadcasters. Two members of that group, Thompson and Philips, have
pledged to manufacture HDTV receivers in the United States if the
FCC sets a transmission standard.

     HARBORING OMNIOUS THOUGHTS -- Omni Inner Harbor Hotel in
Baltimore was slapped with a formal complaint and hearing by the
National Labor Relations Board after the luxury facility refused to
recognize Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Local 7, which
has represented its workers for more than 20 years. The complaint
itemizes such union-busting activities as offers of money and other
incentives to get workers to decertify the union, threats and
unilateral changes to wages and benefits. Contract negotiations
broke down more than a year ago.

     LOOKING UP DOWN ON THE LINE -- UAW members voted by a 73
percent margin to approve a new three-year pact with Chrysler Corp.
that adds job security provisions and raises wages. The contract,
which is similar to one reached with Ford Motor Co., improves
pension benefits and provides for a $2,000 lump sum payment in the
first year followed by two annual 3 percent raises. Combined with
other features, economic gains could total $13,900 for a typical
worker, the union said. Talks with General Motors are ongoing.

     HANDS ACROSS THE WATER -- Canadian Auto Workers were joined on
the picket line by Detroit newspaper strikers, who crossed the
Detroit River in a show of international solidarity. Two dozen
newspaper strikers showed up at General Motors' Delphi plant, which
has cut its union work force from 2,600 to 1,000. Labor and
management at GM have set noon today as a deadline for reaching an
agreement. &quot;We are facing the same anti-union aggression from our
employers,&quot; said Louis Mleczko, president of The Newspaper Guild
Local 22, one of six unions on strike against the Detroit News and
Detroit Free Press since July 13, 1995. GM and CAW have set an Oct.
21 deadline to settle that strike.

     BEVERLY CHALLENGE -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney helped
open three days of public demonstrations by Beverly nursing home
workers in Harrisburg, Pa., last week, urging good-faith bargaining
by the company. Beverly employees in 18 facilities have been
working without a contract since Dec. 1, 1995, and workers at two
facilities have been working without a contract since Dec. 31,
1994. Service Employees President Andy Stern and Mine Workers
President Cecil Roberts also participated in the rally.

     STOP PICKING ON WORKERS! -- The Strawberry Campaign is
targeting 25 cities, including the largest strawberry markets, to
heighten consumer awareness of the plight of strawberry workers.
Targeted cities include Atlanta, Baltimore, Seattle, Wichita, San
Diego and New York. To build public support for the workers, the
campaign will seek backing from supermarket managers and consumers,
as well as allies, including environmental, consumer, Latino and
religious groups.

     TAKING A BITE OUT OF APPLE -- A federal judge in Brooklyn,
N.Y., is allowing to let stand a lawsuit filed by a worker at Yale
University who says severe pain in her right hand, wrist and elbow
resulted from her on-the-job use of computer keyboards and a mouse.
The court rejected arguments by Apple Computers that the statute of
limitations should date from the first time Marice Dorsey touched
a keyboard. Judge Jack Weinstein ruled instead that the clock
starts running when the injury first becomes evident.

     NEW PACT AT FOAMEX -- UNITE workers at the Foamex plant in
Cornelius, N.C., ratified a new three-year contract that includes
a wage increase, increases in pension and insurance benefits and
improved language on overtime and job-bidding policies. The
facility employs 140 workers who manufacture foam for the auto,
furniture and carpet industries.

     UNLUCKY GUESS? -- UNITE members are asking Guess? to sign a
union contract that ensures decent wages and benefits for all
workers in its contracting shops. The members staged demonstrations
outside 30 high-volume Guess? boutiques around the nation to
protest the use of sweatshops by the company.

     EDUCATION FOR A LIFETIME -- The Steelworkers' Career
Development Program at Inland Steel in East Chicago, Ill. will
receive the 1996 Knowles Award for Outstanding  Adult Education
during the meeting of the American Association for Adult and
Continuing Education.

     FUN WITH NUMBERS -- Two educational programs are available to
explain the economy's increasing inequality. &quot;The Growing Divide:
Inequality and the Roots of Economic Insecurity&quot; is a workshop that
has used group discussion, experiential exercises, flip charts and
a comprehensive information packet to inform over 15,000
participants in 450 training sessions. &quot;Art for a Fair Economy&quot;
incorporates street theater, dance performances and graphic arts to
make economic data accessible, and can lead into the workshop. For
information, contact United for a Fair Economy, phone 617/423-2148.

     SING OUT FOR VOTES -- The Labor Heritage Foundation is
offering lyrics to four get-out-the-vote songs, sung to the
melodies of old standards. To get copies of the lyric sheet FAXed
to you, call Rocky Delaplaine at 202/842-7879.

<p>WORK IN PROGRESS -- October 14, 1996</p>
<p>CURTAINS FOR HARASSMENT -- It worked in Everett, Mass. It can
work<br>
other places too. Richmark International, a curtain maker in the<br>
Boston area, fired and harassed workers trying to improve their<br>
lives by forming a union. On Oct. 8, AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney<br>
rallied employees outside Richmark's plant while community
leaders<br>
were getting arrested inside. Less than a week later, Richmark<br>
changed its attitude. The company recognized the workers' union,<br>
UNITE!, and is reinstating fired workers with back pay.<br>
<br>
WOMEN RALLY FOR VOTE -- Working Women Vote '96 continues its<br>
campaign now through Election Day, Nov. 5. On tap this week are a<br>
rally at Cleveland's Old Arcade on Oct. 18, with an address by<br>
President Sweeney. Women in Wichita, Kan., go on a two-day bus
tour<br>
through nine cities of the 4th congressional district Oct. 19-20<br>
under the banner &quot;Make them listen . . . Vote.&quot; Other
actions are<br>
planned for Fort Worth, Texas, (contact Stormy Moore,
817/246-2444)<br>
and San Jose, Calif. (contact Cyndy Chavez, 408/266-3790).<br>
<br>
COMING TO A CITY NEAR YOU -- Sweeney, Secretary-Treasurer Rich<br>
Trumka and Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson have<br>
begun a three-week dash crisscrossing the country to mobilize
union<br>
members to vote. Sweeney's tour this week includes Seattle and<br>
Spokane, Wash.; Harrisburg, Pa.; Cleveland; and Superior and<br>
Kenosha, Wis. Trumka will visit Waterbury and Groton, Conn.
Chavez-<br>
Thompson begins her trek next week in Texas, Colorado and
Montana.<br>
<br>
MARCHING FOR JUSTICE -- Union members took their places beside<br>
their brothers and sisters in two marches in Washington this<br>
weekend. Chavez-Thompson and Electronic Workers President Bill<br>
Bywater addressed hundreds of thousands of Latinos who marched
Oct.<br>
12 for worker and immigrant rights, affirmative action and a<br>
livable wage. Later that evening, unions supported AIDS research<br>
during the 1996 NAMES Project AIDS Memorial with an exhibit booth<br>
and reception, and marched with candles under the banner,
&quot;Labor<br>
Cares.&quot;<br>
<br>
ORGANIZING BUILDING TRADES -- The building trades will take on<br>
a multicraft, marketwide organizing campaign, involving all 15<br>
building trade unions. &quot;With determination, we will organize
our<br>
target, whatever it is, in two years,&quot; said Robert Georgine,<br>
president of the AFL-CIO's Building and Construction Trades<br>
Department. The campaign will be based on worker-to-worker<br>
organizing and will target an entire market, which will be<br>
announced later.<br>
<br>
SI, SI SINDICATO -- SEIU gained nearly 3,000 members with the<br>
affiliation in Puerto Rico of the Sindicato Puertorriqueno de<br>
Trabajadores (SPT). The new members are health care and education<br>
workers. SEIU President Andy Stern and executive vice president<br>
Eliseo Medina were on hand to participate in the official<br>
affiliation signing ceremony.<br>
<br>
HOST UNION HERE -- Workers for the Host Marriott food service<br>
cafeterias and bars at the airport in Hartford, Conn., airport<br>
voted 40-27 for representation by Hotel Employees and Restaurant<br>
Employees Local 217. The organizing drive follows a successful<br>
organizing drive by Marriott workers at Hartford's Trinity
College.<br>
<br>
DANIA UNITES ALL THE WAY -- Licensed practical nurses at Dania<br>
Nursing Home in Miami voted unanimously to become UNITE members,<br>
joining the certified nursing assistants, housekeeping, dietary
and<br>
laundry workers who had voted for the union in August. &quot;This<br>
victory shows the company that everyone at Dania Nursing Home
means<br>
business in their struggle for justice. Everyone is together now
as<br>
they look forward to a good contract,&quot; said organizer John<br>
Belizaire.<br>
<br>
BORDERS BOOKS UNION -- The employees of Borders Books &amp; Music<br>
store in Chicago voted 28-17 for representation by the Food and<br>
Commercial Workers. The win is credited to the workers' refusal
to<br>
yield to the company's anti-union pressure.<br>
<br>
JUST THE FACTS -- Leaflets for union members comparing the<br>
records of candidates on working family issues are available for
95<br>
congressional races, seven senate battles and one gubernatorial<br>
race. If you are interested in getting the word out to your union<br>
brothers and sisters, call your state federation to see whether<br>
leaflets are available for races in your area. <br>
<br>
UNION GROWTH HORMONE -- Keeping their promise to organize as<br>

<br>
DON'T FORGET YOUR (RWDSU) JACKET -- Workers at Andrew Marc<br>
Outerwear Co. in Secaucus, N.J., voted 23-5 to join the Retail,<br>
Wholesale and Department Store Union. When the predominately<br>
Hispanic work force raised objections over discrimination and no<br>
wage increases, they were told they had two choices -- either
walk<br>
back to work or walk out the door. They did walk -- to a union<br>
office.<br>
<br>
IBT PITCHES IN -- The Teamsters will give $200,000 to the Los<br>
Angeles Manufacturing Action Project to step up organizing,<br>
research and community activism to build an industry-wide union<br>
movement along the L.A.-Long Beach corridor. There are some
300,000<br>
manufacturing workers within LAMAP's target area -- about 70<br>
percent of whom are Latino and 90 percent of whom are nonunion.<br>
<br>
TEACH-INS CONTINUE -- Following up on the magnificent success<br>
of the kick-off teach-in at Columbia University, two more take<br>
place this week -- at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Oct.<br>
15-16, and Wayne State University in Detroit, Oct. 18. The teach-<br>
ins offer unions and the academic community a chance to explore<br>
their common goals and forge new partnerships to help America's<br>
workers.<br>
<br>
MOTOR CITY MADNESS -- &quot;Permanent replacement&quot; isn't a
nasty<br>
enough tactic for the union-busting Detroit Newspapers. Last week<br>
they fired 20 striking workers for taking part in a sit-down<br>
demonstration outside the Detroit News Building. One of those
fired<br>
was Susan Watson, co-editor of the strikers' Detroit Journal
paper<br>
and the only black columnist at the Detroit Free Press. The
firing<br>
of Watson and the others drew the condemnation of the Detroit
NAACP<br>
and City Council. Also last week, the Teamsters Black Caucus<br>
arrived in Detroit and slammed newspaper management for claiming
it<br>
is helping minorities by hiring them at scab papers.<br>
<br>
CLEANING UP AFTER THEMSELVES -- Showing more class than their<br>
strike-bound employer and respect for the traveling public, SEIU<br>
members cleaned up National Airport after their Oct. 10<br>
demonstration there. Union President Andy Stern and Farm Workers<br>
President Arturo Rodriguez joined the picket action. The janitors<br>
struck two weeks ago against PRIEM, a joint-venture partner of
P&amp;R<br>
Enterprises, one of the largest nonunion janitorial companies in<br>
the Washington area, over unfair labor practices.<br>
<br>
ILWU NOT BLUE IN HAWAII -- The Longshoremen's and<br>
Warehousemen's Union has reached agreements with The Orchid at<br>
Mauna Lani and Renaissance Wailes Beach Resort in Maui covering<br>
more than 1,000 members. The union credits public protest aimed
at<br>
management companies and owners for spurring the movement at the<br>
table.<br>
<br>
NOT A PENNY FOR CROWN -- At the request of the Oil, Chemical<br>
and Atomic Workers, Crown Central Petroleum has been added to the<br>
AFL-CIO boycott list. The company locked out 250 members of OCAW<br>
Local 4-227 from its oil refinery in Pasadena, Texas, with a
&quot;take-<br>
it-or-leave-it&quot; contract ultimatum.<br>
<br>
CWA FLIPS MAXI-SWITCH -- A U.S.-based manufacturer of computer<br>
keyboards and game sets has engaged in brutal anti-union
activities<br>
at one of its Mexican plants and that country's government has
not<br>
enforced its labor laws to stop the abuse, the Communication<br>
Workers charged. In a complaint allowed under the terms of a
NAFTA<br>
side agreement, the CWA says the company, the government and a<br>
government-approved union acted in collusion to prevent workers<br>
from organizing a real union at the Cananea, Sonora plant. Union<br>
activists have been threatened, fired and beaten.<br>
<br>
UAW AIDS YOUTH -- At-risk youths get a helping hand from a<br>
joint UAW/General Motors Corp. effort centered on the automaker's<br>
tough apprenticeship program. The program works so well, it was<br>
honored by the U.S. Department of Labor. Since 1992, more than 70<br>
students have completed the school-to-work Manufacturing
Technology<br>
Partnership program, gaining two-year scholarships at Baker
College<br>
in Flint, Mich. -- and 96 percent have passed the apprenticeship<br>
test.<br>
<br>
AFM BACKS `FIRST' SAX PLAYER -- The Musicians have endorsed<br>
the Clinton-Gore ticket for re-election. AFM President Steve
Young<br>
noted recent cuts in arts funding, and said &quot;we feel it is<br>
imperative to support the president and his efforts to keep live<br>
music alive in this country . . . we also support his veto of the<br>
`TEAM Act' and his concern for working families in America.&quot;<br>
<br>
BEETLE MAKER NOT FAB -- The Teamsters have taken on<br>
Volkswagen over the carmaker's decision to abandon its operations<br>
at the Port of Wilmington, Del., dislocating 340 IBT members who<br>
had served the company for 18 years. &quot;Volkswagen is
destroying<br>
family wage jobs in America and ripping off taxpayer
subsidies,&quot;<br>
IBT President Ron Carey said. After a protest at German Week<br>
celebrations in Washington, union members handbilled five of VW's<br>
largest dealerships last weekend informing shoppers about the<br>
automaker's action and about the many recalls VW has made during<br>
the `90s.<br>
<br>
USDA SHELLS NUTMAKER -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture<br>
barred Diamond Walnut from government business for three years in<br>
the wake of the government-related bribery conviction of the
parent<br>
company's president. Some 600 Teamsters have been on strike
against<br>
the nut company for five years. The strikers rallied in
Pleasanton,<br>
Calif., this month to urge the USDA to take this action.<br>
<br>
PROJECT AGREEMENTS UPHELD -- The San Francisco Airport Project<br>
Stabilization Agreement is &quot;constitutional and consistent
with the<br>
purposes underlying competitive bidding,&quot; Superior Court
Judge<br>
David A. Garcia ruled. It was the latest in a series of court<br>
rulings upholding the agreements, which require union labor on<br>
public projects. <br>
<br>
JOBS ON THE WEB -- Finding the right federal job has been made<br>
a lot easier with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's new<br>
Employment Information Homepage, &quot;USA JOBS.&quot; The
homepage, located<br>
at <a href="http://www.usajobs.opm.gov">http://www.usajobs.opm.gov</a>,
provides worldwide job listings<br>
updated daily. Non-Internet users can conduct job searches by<br>
dialing 912/757-3000.</p>

<p>WORK IN PROGRESS -- October 8, 1996<br>
<br>
WOMEN'S VOTES COUNT -- Working Women Vote Week is going full<br>
tilt, underscoring the fact that women will cast the deciding<br>
ballots this election year. The project, cosponsored by the
AFL-CIO<br>
and 9to5, the National Association of Working Women, runs through<br>
Oct. 11 with voter registration and GOTV events at more than 100<br>
sites nationwide. Nearly 10,000 union activists are reaching out
to<br>
women in grocery stores, shopping malls, day care centers, union<br>
halls and union worksites. Brochures and materials are available<br>
from Liz Gonchar at 202/637-5314.<br>
<br>
CURTAINS FOR SCOFFLAWS -- Companies that fire or harass<br>
workers who try to improve their lives by joining unions won't
get<br>
away with it, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney declared at a rally<br>
Tuesday in Everett, Mass., where workers at Richmark
International<br>
are trying to organize under UNITE's banner. The curtain<br>
manufacturer fired five workers for signing union authorization<br>
cards and laid off three more who distributed union literature<br>
before work. &quot;As long as workers are fired for an injustice,
we are<br>
going to be fired up for justice,&quot; Sweeney said.<br>
<br>
TEACH AND GROW -- An overflow crowd of more than 1,700<br>
university professors, students, labor leaders and union members<br>
swarmed a &quot;teach-in with the labor movement&quot; at
Columbia University<br>
Oct. 3-4. &quot;We need your help in making basic economic
education<br>
accessible to every American, so everyone can understand what is<br>
happening to their family budget and who is doing it to
them,&quot;<br>
President Sweeney said. Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka and<br>
Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson also participated.<br>
Nine other teach-ins are scheduled around the country this month.<br>
<br>
UNION IS HERE AT MARRIOTT -- The Marriott Hotel, the largest<br>
non-union hotel in San Francisco, has agreed to recognize the
Hotel<br>
Employees and Restaurant Employees Local 2. It is the first time<br>
that the huge Marriott chain has recognized a card check for<br>
organizing workers. &quot;This is an historical breakthrough that
is<br>
directly related to the local refocusing on organizing,&quot;
said AFL-<br>
CIO Organizing Director Richard Bensinger, who participated in a<br>
press conference in Mayor Willie Brown's office to announce the<br>
union victory.<br>
<br>
CHICKEN A LA RWDSU -- Workers at the Tyson's Foods poultry<br>
plant in Cleveland, Miss., voted 248-195 for representation by
the<br>
Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. The 550 workers had<br>
plenty of reasons to seek out the union: They were forced to work<br>
with injuries, could only take one seven-minute bathroom break a<br>
day and were subject to sexual harassment by supervisors.<br>
<br>
HILL COPS TRUCKIN' FOR IBT -- More than 450 Capitol Hill<br>
police officers signed petitions to be represented by the<br>
Teamsters. The petition vote came after enactment of the<br>
Congressional Accountability Act, which made Congress subject to<br>
the same labor laws as the rest of the country.<br>
<br>
VALUJET MECHANICS VALUE IBT -- Mechanics at ValuJet, concerned<br>
that their reputation and professionalism had been tarnished by
the<br>
airline's subcontracting much of its maintenance and safety work,<br>
voted for Teamsters representation. Following a May 11 crash<br>
killing all on board, the FAA grounded the airline for safety and<br>
maintenance problems, most tied to subcontractors said the IBT.
The<br>
airline resumed limited operations Sept. 26<br>
<br>
OCAW GAINS MEMBERS -- Some 1,100 members of the independent<br>
Union of Transportation Employees have voted to affiliate with
the<br>
Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers.<br>
<br>
IT'S WHAT WE WANT, IT'S WHAT WE GOT -- Despite fear tactics by<br>
management at Coral Gables Convalescent Center in Southwest
Miami,<br>
workers voted 31-20 for UNITE representation. &quot;It's a simple
matter<br>
of respect. That's what we want, and that's what we voted for<br>
today,&quot; said 20-year employee Prima Washington,.<br>
<br>
ATTACK DOGS -- Viewers say the AFL-CIO's electronic voter<br>
guides now running in 25 congressional districts are informative<br>
and fairly depict candidates' positions. But that hasn't stopped<br>
the Republican party bosses from launching an all-out assault on<br>
the federation's issues-based campaign. The GOP last week began<br>
airing a nasty set of ads that attack &quot;Big Labor's Big
Lies,&quot; and<br>
filed a &quot;public relations lawsuit&quot; against the Federal
Election<br>
Commission for not moving faster on its frivolous complaints.
AFL-<br>
CIO General Counsel Jon Hiatt said the GOP's lawsuit is designed<br>
&quot;to distract public attention from the real issue in this
year's<br>
campaign -- the Republican Congress' dismal record on working<br>
family issues such as Medicare, health care, education, taxes and<br>
pension rights.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A STITCH IN TIME -- Pensions for some 70,000 workers in the<br>
men's garment industry will be protected under a government plan<br>
backed by UNITE and men's suit manufacturers. The fund was facing<br>
$253 million in liabilities, mainly because contributors had<br>
dropped from 575 employers 10 years ago to 200 today.<br>
<br>
NEW RULES AT FIELDCREST -- Citing Fieldcrest Cannon's<br>
&quot;scorched earth&quot; approach during a 1991 union
organizing campaign,<br>
a federal appeals court has ordered a new election under tough
new<br>
rules. The election for the plants in Cabarrus and Rowan counties<br>
in North Carolina will be held at a neutral site. The court also<br>
gave the union access to the company's nonunion facilities, equal<br>
time to answer company charges, and approval for a 30-minute
speech<br>
to workers up to 48 hours before the vote. It upheld an NLRB
order<br>
to reinstate 11 workers with $450,000 in back pay.<br>
<br>
USWA STRIKES WHEELING-PITT -- Some, 4,500 Steelworkers walked<br>
off the job Oct. 1 at eight Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel plants
after<br>
the company refused to bring its pension plan near industry<br>
standards. USWA negotiators are seeking a defined pension plan<br>
paying retirees $40 per month per year of service. But the
company,<br>
which currently has pension costs about one-quarter of that of<br>
other steelmakers, wants a risky defined contribution plan with<br>
benefits based on the investment performance of its pension
funds.<br>
The company also has huge cash reserves that could help fund<br>
pensions.<br>
<br>
DETROIT PAPERS SNUB MAYOR -- A unique effort by the<br>
Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions and Detroit Mayor Dennis<br>
Archer to end the 15-month old Detroit newspaper strike was<br>
rejected by Gannett and Knight-Ridder Oct. 2. The unions agreed
to<br>
the mayor's call for binding mediation by a panel of three<br>
independent mediators. &quot;It takes two sides to bargain and
its<br>
obvious that the newspapers aren't interested in good faith<br>
bargaining, even under the wing of independent leaders such as
the<br>
mayor,&quot; said Al Derey of the Newspaper council. Also last
week,<br>
City Council President Maryann Mahaffey joined civil rights<br>
activist Dick Gregory and religious leaders in a 24-hour fast in<br>
support of the strikers.<br>
<br>
SENATE DELIVERS FOR FEDEX -- Succumbing to end-of-Congress<br>
fever, the Senate approved an FAA spending bill that puts up a
huge<br>
roadblock for 45,000 Federal Express drivers and their bid to<br>
unionize. FedEx is expected to use the provision to argue that
its<br>
drivers are covered by the Railway Labor Act, instead of the<br>
National Labor Relations Act, forcing companywide organizing,<br>
rather than site by site. FedEx employees spoke at a Capitol Hill<br>
news conference Thursday describing how they are facing
contracting<br>
out, reduced hours and harassment for their pro-union stands.
&quot;I<br>
worked 96 hours some weeks to help build this company . . .<br>
whatever it took,&quot; said Bill Chafin. FedEx continues to
deliver<br>
large profits, but not to its workers.<br>
<br>
CHECK YOUR CHECK -- Labor's push for a minimum wage increase<br>
became reality Oct. 1 for more than 4.3 million U.S. workers, who<br>
saw their earnings rise by 50 cents an hour in the first of two<br>
scheduled hikes. A 40-cent increase is set for Sept. 1, 1997.
AFL-<br>
CIO President John Sweeney said the increase was &quot;a raise
workers<br>
have earned, their employers can afford and the American people<br>
overwhelmingly support.&quot;<br>
<br>
UAW &amp; CHRYSLER NEAR -- CAW &amp; GM NOT -- The UAW's National<br>
Chrysler Council give its approval to a tentative contract
covering<br>
the carmaker's 66,000 union workers, who now will vote on<br>
ratification. Like the recently ratified Ford contract, the<br>
Chrysler deal calls for improvements in job security, wages and<br>
pensions. While the UAW continues talks with General Motors, the<br>
Canadian Autoworkers began a series of escalating strikes
Thursday<br>
against GM of Canada after talks broke down. Outsourcing is the<br>
main stumbling block, CAW officials say.<br>
<br>
ILA, ILWU RATIFY PACTS -- Longshoremen on the East and Gulf<br>
Coasts approved a five-year master agreement calling for a wage<br>
increase of $4 an hour over term for between 15,000 and 30,000
dock<br>
workers. On the West Coast, members of the Longshoremen's and<br>
Warehousemen's Union ratified a three-year deal for 8,000 workers<br>
at 26 ports. The contract calls for $3-an-hour pay increases over<br>
term.<br>
<br>
MORE BERRY PICKINGS -- More than 100 Coalition of Labor Union<br>
Women members participated in a demonstration at Sam's Club in
St.<br>
Louis in support of the Farm Workers' strawberry campaign. CLUW<br>
President Gloria Johnson, who led a delegation into the store,
not<br>
only met with the general manager but persuaded him to FAX the<br>
pledge and leaflet to Sam's corporate office. The general manager<br>
also said he &quot;would encourage them to sign the pledge.&quot;
Meanwhile,<br>
in South Florida, where worker delegations are visiting stores
each<br>
Tuesday, six more stores agreed to sign the pledge.<br>
<br>
PEACE ON THE RAILS -- A dozen railroad unions and 35 major<br>
freight carriers have reached agreement on five-year contracts<br>
covering some 145,000 workers nationwide, marking the first time
in<br>
nearly a decade accord was reached without strikes or imposed<br>
settlements. Maintenance of Way Employees President Mac Fleming<br>
said he hoped the negotiations could &quot;mark a turning point
in our<br>
recent, acrimonious relationship with the railroads.&quot; Two
smaller<br>
contracts await completion.<br>
<br>
STUDY TOGETHER -- Representatives who provide referral<br>
services for union members with substance abuse and other
personal<br>
problems under Member Assistance Programs can get help preparing<br>
for certification. If you have worked at least 3,000 hours<br>
providing these services and are ready to take a written exam to<br>
become a Certified Employee Assistance Professional, you qualify<br>
for the week of study, Dec. 2-6 at the George Meany Center for<br>
Labor Studies. For more information, call the Substance Abuse<br>
Institute at 301/431-1239.<br>
<br>
PETER J. BRENNAN DIES -- Peter J. Brennan, 78, a New York<br>
building trades leader who served as President Nixon's Secretary
of<br>
Labor from 1973-75 died Oct. 2. Labor Secretary Robert Reich
noted<br>
that Brennan's tenure was marked by laws protecting pensions and<br>
employment rights of the disabled, as well as strictly enforced<br>
workplace safety laws.<br>
<br>
SUPPORT STRAWBERRY WORKERS<br>
<br>
Why we do it<br>
&quot;A house and children...&quot;<br>
<br>
It's Romoco's first year in the strawberry fields. He picks<br>
berries near Salinas from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the peak of the<br>
season. As the season winds down, the 18-year-old is only able to<br>
pick about 12 boxes of berries a day, for which he says he'll get<br>
about $24.<br>
<br>
Romoco says the bathrooms are cleaned about every two weeks<br>
and drinking water is sometimes dirty. He lives with five other<br>
people in a $175-a-week room at a run-down motel. He pays $12 a<br>
week to get to and from work.<br>
<br>
It's a six-day-a-week job. The mention of Sundays, when he<br>
plays basketball with his friends, brings a smile.<br>
<br>
Of course, Romoco would like better conditions in the fields.<br>
<br>
But, like other workers in the strawberry fields, Romoco has<br>
a bigger dream that depends on changing the conditions.<br>
<br>
&quot;I want a job that's enough to have a house and
children,&quot; he<br>
says.<br>
<br>
It's not out-of-the question. For 5 cents a pint more per<br>
berries, wages for 20,000 strawberry workers could be increased
by<br>
at least 50 percent, according to the University of California.
Who<br>
wouldn't pay that? Consumers would. The strawberry corporations<br>
won't.<br>
<br>
Get ready<br>
<br>
Strawberry workers and United Farm Workers President Arturo<br>
Rodriguez will travel to Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia,<br>
northern New Jersey, New York City and Boston the week of Nov.
18.<br>
They'll seek support for the campaign. Tours in other regions of<br>
the country are being planned.<br>
<br>
Taking the lead<br>
<br>
On Sept. 16, central labor councils fought for strawberry<br>
workers in more than 60 cities. The massive activity came the day<br>
after at least 6,000 workers and supporters marched in
Watsonville,<br>
the heart of California strawberry country.<br>
<br>
* In Gainesville, Fla., students, women's rights activists,<br>
religious leaders and labor movement leaders visited stores and<br>
garnered news coverage from two TV stations, one radio station
and<br>
three alternative newspapers. CLC President Elsie Allen led the<br>
group.<br>
<br>
* In Flint, Mich., one man made a difference. Jose Vasquez,<br>
president of the Flint LCLAA Chapter, took a day off work to
visit<br>
nine stores. Now Vasquez is working with his CLC to organize<br>
delegations to visit more stores.<br>
<br>
* In Norfolk, Va., 80-year-old Joe Christian visited 20
supermarket<br>
managers, six of whom signed a pledge. Christian, a retired
member<br>
of the Graphic Communications International Union, also leafleted<br>
customers.<br>
<br>
* In Los Angeles, 130 people attended a press conference, where<br>
city council members signed the pledge.<br>
<br>
CLCs surpassed expectations. A complete list of active CLCs is<br>
attached.<br>
<br>
News from the fields<br>
<br>
* The strawberry corporations are gearing up to beat the<br>
workers, using an expensive public relations firm and lobbying<br>
political friends. They've conducted a whisper campaign among<br>
workers, saying the United Farm Workers are threatening a
boycott.<br>
In fact, the corporations are the ones talking about a boycott
and<br>
they're doing it to make the workers afraid for their jobs.<br>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>-- TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1996</p>
<p>HEX ON FEDEX -- Intensive weekend lobbying by transportation<br>
unions and the AFL-CIO held off approval of an FAA funding bill<br>
that contains a &quot;midnight special&quot; special interest
favor for<br>
Federal Express, which the Teamsters termed &quot;a crass attempt
to<br>
further insulate the company from organizing efforts.&quot; The
&quot;killer<br>
amendment&quot; would allow FedEx to argue that its 45,000
drivers<br>
should fall under the Rail Labor Act, not the National Labor<br>
Relations Act. That means drivers must be organized throughout
the<br>
entire company, instead of site by site. The Senate stayed in<br>
session to wrangle over the authorization measure, which
Democrats<br>
vowed to kill if the favor to FedEx isn't pulled.<br>
<br>
BEATING BUSTER -- Workers at the Family Service Society of<br>
Yonkers, N.Y., beat back a vicious campaign by the union-busting<br>
firm of Jackson, Lewis and voted 115-21 for AFSCME
representation.<br>
It was the second time District Council 1707, which picks up the<br>
unit of 215 home care employees, has beaten the law firm. The win<br>
brings to 1,013 the number of new members DC 1707 has gained in
the<br>
past four months.<br>
<br>
NEW PLOT AT GENERAL HOSPITAL -- Employees of the Irvington<br>
(N.J.) General Hospital have affiliated with AFSCME. More than
200<br>
hospital workers took a stand for better wages and benefits when<br>
their employee association affiliated with the National Union of<br>
Hospital and Health Care Workers Union, Local 1199J, an AFSCME<br>
affiliate.<br>
<br>
LABORERS WIN DEMOLITION DERBY -- Almost 1,000 mostly immigrant<br>
demolition workers in New York City have joined Laborers Local
79.<br>
That strength forced contractors to sign a new four-year contract<br>
covering about 75 percent of the city's demolition market; the
pact<br>
includes wage increases and health benefits. Rank-and-file
members<br>
played a huge part by paying house calls to the nonunion workers,<br>
followed by mass meetings and roving job-site pickets and
strikes.<br>
<br>
SHORESIDE SOLIDARITY -- Public employees in Jacksonville<br>
Beach, Fla., voted 105-49 for Laborers' representation. LIUNA
also<br>
has organized municipal workers in the surrounding beach<br>
communities of Atlantic and Neptune and the city of Jacksonville.<br>
<br>
DRIVERS PICK MINE WORKERS -- Continuing to build on its<br>
successful use of members recruiting members, the Mine Workers
won<br>
an election to represent 148 shuttle drivers employed by Republic<br>
Parking at the Denver airport. UMWA President Cecil Roberts<br>
credited rank-and-file members from Colorado, Montana, New
Mexico,<br>
Utah and Wyoming who went to Denver to explain the benefits of
UMWA<br>
membership.<br>
<br>
TWO DOWN, ONE TO GO -- UAW members ratified one contract with<br>
a Big Three auto maker and tentatively agreed to another. By
votes<br>
of 90 percent and 83 percent, respectively, production workers
and<br>
skilled crafts ratified the new contract with Ford on Sunday. The<br>
same day, the union reached a tentative agreement with Chrysler,<br>
leaving only General Motors without a deal with the UAW. The<br>
union's Chrysler Council will meet Oct. 3 to vote on whether to<br>
send the agreement to the membership for ratification.<br>
<br>
BRIDGESTONE PROGRESS -- After 26 months, almost all workers<br>
who struck the company have been called back to work at Japanese-<br>
owned Bridgestone/Firestone. This dramatic turnaround is &quot;a
result<br>
of our escalating campaign&quot; said John Sellers, executive
vice<br>
president of Steelworkers' Rubber/Plastics Industry Council. But<br>
the USWA campaign against the tire maker will continue until it<br>
meets the union's demands to recall 150 illegally fired workers,<br>
negotiate a decent union contract, pay back wages to the replaced<br>
workers and settle all pending unfair labor practices charges<br>
against the company.<br>
<br>
MADE OF STEEL -- The Steelworkers ended their 42-month strike<br>
against Bayou Steel Corp. with a new six-year contract that<br>
reinstates 220 members of Local 9121 with full seniority, calls
for<br>
a bonus to all returnees and an incentive plan that will have the<br>
effect of raising wages and protects workers against contracting<br>
out. &quot;They could not have ousted the scabs and won this
great<br>
victory if they had not maintained their solidarity and
commitment<br>
to trade union ideals,&quot; said USWA President George Becker.<br>
<br>
VOTER GUIDES ON THE AIR -- The AFL-CIO on Friday launched a<br>
new series of nonpartisan TV and radio voter guides to highlight<br>
candidates' stands on important working-family issues in 24<br>
congressional districts. The continuing campaign is focusing on<br>
issues raised at 29 America Needs A Raise town hall meetings this<br>
year, as well as polling and focus groups of union and nonunion<br>
members. &quot;We plan to continue to lobby officeholders and
would-be<br>
officeholders to adopt positions on issues like education, health<br>
care and retirement security that are good for working
people,&quot;<br>
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said.<br>
<br>
D.C. JANITORS STRIKE LOOMS -- Some 1,700 janitors in the<br>
nation's capital were set to strike at midnight Monday when
Service<br>
Employees Local 82's pact with area cleaning contractors expired,<br>
but negotiators kept talking past the deadline. More than 100<br>
Washington-area trade unionists rallied at National Airport
Friday<br>
in support of janitors trying to organize a union at P&amp;R<br>
Enterprises, a major area janitorial firm that also holds the<br>
airport cleaning contract.<br>
<br>
CONGRESS AT THE WIRE -- Congressional negotiators and the<br>
White House reached agreement on a massive spending package,<br>
including many labor-backed provisions in the Labor/HHS<br>
appropriations portion. No destructive riders were attached.<br>
Immigration reform was approved only after several objectionable<br>
provisions opposed by the AFL-CIO were dropped, including a ban
on<br>
public education for children of illegal immigrants, restrictions<br>
on public programs used by legal immigrants and provisions making<br>
it harder for workers -- especially in sweatshop situations -- to<br>
collect back pay.<br>
<br>
OTANI ON TRIAL -- Three Latina women fired by the New Otani<br>
Hotel for supporting the Hotel and Restaurant Employees'
organizing<br>
drive finally will have their day in court this week before the<br>
National Labor Relations Board. The hotel has bitterly fought the<br>
union since the organizing campaign began in early 1993, but the<br>
union has won every NLRB charge it has filed.<br>
<br>
HOSPITAL PRIVATIZATION PARRIED -- Hospital workers and their<br>
allies, cheered by the support of Executive Vice President Linda<br>
Chavez-Thompson and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, rallied in<br>
Cincinnati Sept. 24 to protest a plan to lease out the city's
only<br>
public and teaching hospital to a private company for $1 a year.<br>
The proposal, which faces a final vote by trustees Oct. 8, would<br>
nullify all contracts and abolish union representation for
interns,<br>
resident physicians and fellows.<br>
<br>
NUKE NEWT -- Union members rallying outside outnumbered House<br>
Speaker Newt Gingrich and his guests inside a GOP fundraiser in<br>
Sheffield, Ala., last week. &quot;Everything they stand for is
against<br>
everything we stand for,&quot; said Michael Lemay, Carpenters
Local 109<br>
business manager. Unions in that district are urging workers to
get<br>
out and re-elect Rep. Bud Cramer (D).<br>
<br>
WAVE THAT FLAG -- The Senate has sent to President Clinton a<br>
maritime reform bill that &quot;ensures America's national and
economic<br>
security while producing jobs for American merchant
mariners,&quot;<br>
Seafarers President Michael Sacco said. The bill sets up a
10-year,<br>
$1 billion program for U.S.-flag carriers that promise to their<br>
ships available to the U.S. military in emergencies.<br>
<br>
MAIN STREET SLAMS WALL STREET -- As the Federal Reserve<br>
pondered raising interest rates last week, working families in<br>
Minnesota chimed in with more than their two cents' worth on
fiscal<br>
policy. The Jobs Now Coalition denounced 9th District Federal<br>
Reserve Bank President Gary Stern for his lead role in pushing
for<br>
restrictive monetary policies, including higher interest rates,<br>
that kill jobs and create economic hardship, taking issue with<br>
Stern's belief that working families are &quot;making too much
and that<br>
small businesses' access to capital is too easy,&quot; declared<br>
coalition Director Kris Jacobs. The Fed decided against a rate<br>
hike.<br>
<br>
PROXY NATIONS -- Think the power of corporate wealth is<br>
overstated? Of the 100 largest economies in the world, less than<br>
half are countries -- the majority are corporations, the
Institute<br>
for Policy Studies found. The combined sales of the top 200<br>
corporations far exceeds a quarter of the world's economic<br>
activity, yet they employ less than three one-hundredths of one<br>
percent of the world's population. The new study &quot;The Top
200: The<br>
Rise of Global Corporate Power&quot; can be obtained from IPS at<br>
202/234-9382.<br>
<br>
CLIPPING THEIR WINGS -- The Flight Attendants filed suit<br>
seeking a stay against a Sept. 26 decision by the Transportation<br>
Department to permit safety-challenged Valujet Airlines to resume<br>
operations. A May 11 Valujet crash killed all on board, and the<br>
government grounded the airline last summer after finding a
pattern<br>
of repeated safety and maintenance problems.<br>
<br>
NO SWEAT -- Garment manufacturers would be legally responsible<br>
for ensuring their contractors' operations are not sweatshops
under<br>
legislation introduced by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and
Rep.<br>
William L. Clay (D-Mo.) UNITE President Jay Mazur said the bill<br>
&quot;closes a glaring loophole in our labor laws that has
allowed<br>
sweatshop production to once again invade the apparel
industry.&quot;<br>
<br>
DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH -- Strikers at Diamond Walnut will rally<br>
Oct. 1 in Pleasanton, Calif., to urge the Agriculture Department<br>
to bar the company from getting subsidies or other benefits in
the<br>
wake of the conviction of its parent, Sun Diamond, of bribing<br>
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. The 600 workers, members
of<br>
the Teamsters, struck Diamond Walnut five years ago.<br>
<br>
LABORERS ELECTION SET -- Holding its first secret ballot<br>
election, delegates to the Laborers' convention nominated LIUNA<br>
President Arthur Coia and Local 1001 President Bruno Caruso to<br>
appear on what will be the first rank-and-file ballot for LIUNA's<br>
top office. Balloting will be held from Nov. 2 through Dec. 16.
The<br>
convention also urged greater use of volunteer organizers and<br>
expanded their program to organize nonunion contractors.<br>
<br>
IAM SAYS YES TO MERGER -- Delegates to the Machinists'<br>
convention in Chicago overwhelmingly approved plans to merge with<br>
the UAW and the Steelworkers. The convention also voted to free
up<br>
funds earmarked for the strike fund for organizing, education and<br>
other services. Several speakers, including AFL-CIO President
John<br>
J. Sweeney, urged the delegates to vote like workers and throw
out<br>
the anti-worker Republican Congress in November.<br>
<br>
REAL HEROES -- The Letter Carriers have honored four of its<br>
workers with NALC Hero of the Year Awards. Joan Barr was
recognized<br>
for crawling under a train wreck to save trapped victims inside a<br>
burning car. Guy A. Young, Mark A. Hopkins and Carlos E. Tichenor<br>
received regional heroes awards and Donald Coldwell was selected
as<br>
the national humanitarian for his commitment to the foster care<br>
program.</p>

<p>-- MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1996<br>
<br>
BUILDING JOBS THAT LAST -- UAW members will vote Sept. 29 on<br>
a tentative three-year contract with Ford Motor Co. that, for the<br>
first time, includes a guaranteed employment floor. Under the<br>
agreement, Ford would maintain a minimum employment floor of 95<br>
percent of the current number of UAW-represented jobs, which is<br>
about 105,000. Following a first-year up-front lump sum payment
of<br>
$2,000, Ford employees would receive a 3 percent general wage<br>
increase in the second and third years. The UAW still has<br>
negotiations with General Motors and Chrysler.<br>
<br>
FIGHTING BACK PAYS OFF -- Employees at Burlington Industries<br>
took on their company and the investment establishment to win a<br>
$26.5 million settlement for their retirement plan. Burlington
had<br>
staved off a takeover bid in 1987 by creating an employee stock<br>
ownership plan that benefited its partner, investment banker
Morgan<br>
Stanley, while forcing employees to pay more than twice what the<br>
stock was worth. Also paying up is NationsBank, whose predecessor<br>
was the trustee of the plan. UNITE, then the Clothing and Textile<br>
Workers, helped the workers file the $100 million lawsuit.<br>
<br>
FRANKLY, MY DEAR . . . -- Rep. Gary Franks (R-Conn.) ducked an<br>
invitation to explain his votes to cut college loans and other<br>
education programs in front of a forum at Western Connecticut
State<br>
University. Organized by Youth for Justice, a campus group headed<br>
by Union Summer alum Justin Molitio, the Sept. 19 gathering<br>
featured testimony from several students and parents on the<br>
difficulty of financing a college education.<br>
<br>
TORTILLA DRIVERS ROLL -- After seven weeks on strike, more<br>
than 100 truckers, represented by the Teamsters, ratified a new<br>
five-year contract with Los Angeles tortilla maker Mission<br>
Guerrero. The contract, ratified Sept. 18, boosts worker pay by
$95<br>
a week over the term of the contract, raises the drivers'<br>
commission rate, prohibits the company from unilaterally<br>
contracting out the drivers' jobs and lowers health care costs.<br>
<br>
OVERNITE, IT'S UNION -- Workers at Overnite Transportation<br>
Co.'s Memphis, Tenn., terminal voted 219-201 for Teamsters<br>
representation. IBT has won the right to represent some 2,000<br>
Overnite workers in its nationwide organizing drive, with another<br>
1,000 being challenged. Memphis is the second-largest Overnite<br>
facility in the country.<br>
<br>
ALPA GOT THE SPIRIT -- Spirit Airlines pilots have voted for<br>
representation with the Air Line Pilots. Some 60 percent of the
86<br>
pilots eligible voted for ALPA.<br>
<br>
HOUSE LOSES -- Casino workers on the Admiral riverboat in St.<br>
Louis will get another chance to vote for a union because<br>
management violated labor laws. The National Labor Relations
Board<br>
ordered a new election, with locals of the Hotel Employees and<br>
Restaurant Employees and Service Employees working together to<br>
organize the workers. The St. Louis Federation of Labor and the<br>
Missouri AFL-CIOs launched a boycott of the casino after the<br>
tainted election last October.<br>
<br>
WAGES RISE SWIFTLY -- UNITE textile workers at Swift in Erwin,<br>
N.C., ratified a wage increase of 4 percent. The raise, which was<br>
effective Sept. 9, is the second raise of that size in 13 months.<br>
In the 1990s, UNITE has negotiated an overall 30 percent wage
boost<br>
for the 1,300 Swift workers. &quot;Once again, negotiations at
Swift<br>
have produced the best wage settlement in the textile
industry,&quot;<br>
said Phil Cohen, UNITE's Central North Carolina manager.<br>
<br>
WHAT'S UP? DOCK PAY -- The Longshoremen reached a tentative<br>
container contract with the Carriers Container Council Sept. 17<br>
affecting wages, hours, automation and health and pension plans
for<br>
up to 55,000 workers from Maine to Texas. Such local issues as
work<br>
practices and benefits still must be negotiated before the
current<br>
pact expires Sept. 30.<br>
<br>
PIPELINE TO JOBS -- A $1.1 billion, multiyear water pipeline<br>
project agreement was reached by the AFL-CIO Building and<br>
Construction Trades Department and Parsons Constructors. The
Inland<br>
Feeder water distribution pipeline is a project of the
Metropolitan<br>
Water District of Southern California. Several hundred
construction<br>
workers get started on the project this fall and will work
through<br>
1999.<br>
<br>
MIDWESTERN MOBILIZATION -- Workers were on the march in the<br>
Midwest last week at two huge rallies urging voter registration
and<br>
demanding that elected officials pay attention to the interests
of<br>
working families. More than 10,000 trade unionists marched to the<br>
Michigan state capital building in Lansing in a rally sponsored
by<br>
the state AFL-CIO. The Indiana state federation sponsored a State<br>
of the Union Town Hall Meeting that drew thousands of trade<br>
unionists to the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis. <br>
<br>
LOW PAY BURNS FIREFIGHTERS -- Federal fire fighters are<br>
&quot;dramatically underpaid compared to other federal
employees&quot; IAFF<br>
Vice President Michael J. Crouse said when he testified in favor
of<br>
legislation to correct the wage inequities Sept. 17. The<br>
legislation simply states that federal employees at the same
grade<br>
and step should earn the same hourly salary regardless of their<br>
duties. But the Department of Defense and the Office of Personnel<br>
Management suggested that a forthcoming joint report's<br>
recommendations could resolve the pay issues.<br>
<br>
TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELL -- America's workers are joining<br>
their academic allies in a national initiative on the
re-energized<br>
labor movement. &quot;A Teach-In With the Labor Movement&quot; is
designed to<br>
promote a new spirit of activism and a national dialogue between<br>
academics and trade unionists. It &quot;adds a powerful new
dimension to<br>
the development of the new and stronger voice for working
families<br>
we're working so hard to create,&quot; AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney<br>
said. A national teach-in at Columbia University is set for Oct.
3<br>
and 4, with regional events set throughout October.<br>
<br>
GIVE IT A REST -- The Federal Reserve Board, scheduled to meet<br>
Tuesday to consider a possible interest rate increase,
&quot;should give<br>
economic growth a chance . . . and not choke off growth on behalf<br>
of a wealthy bondholder elite,&quot; concluded an analysis by the
AFL-<br>
CIO Public Policy Department. The latest consumer price index<br>
showed only a trace of inflation, the bugaboo the Fed cites when
it<br>
decides to raise rates.<br>
<br>
NOW HEAR THIS -- The Transportation Trades Department's<br>
Executive Committee last week urged Congress to scuttle ocean<br>
shipping deregulation, condemned Federal Express for manipulating<br>
labor law to block organizing efforts, attacked proposals to
reduce<br>
the federal gas tax and to privatize airports, and called for<br>
passage of a bill to toughen certification of foreign aircraft<br>
repair facilities.<br>
<br>
YOUNG TO LEAD UPIU -- The Paperworkers elected Boyd D. Young<br>
as president to succeed the retiring Wayne E. Glenn, who was<br>
elected president emeritus. Secretary-Treasurer James Dunn was
re-<br>
elected without opposition. Young, 56, had been a vice president<br>
for eight years. The 2,200 delegates also voted to intensify<br>
organizing efforts.<br>
<br>
IBEW LIGHTS UP THE FUTURE -- Incumbent President John J. Barry<br>
and Secretary Jack F. Moore handily won the right to lead the<br>
Electrical Workers into the 21st century. at the union's 35th<br>
international convention. Re-elected without opposition by the<br>
2,400 delegates at the Philadelphia gathering were Treasurer
Thomas<br>
Van Arsdale and Executive Council Chairman Clyde Bowden. After
days<br>
of debate, delegates voted to go to a secret ballot in future<br>
conventions.<br>
<br>
GRAPHIC APPROACH TO ORGANIZING -- Delegates to the Graphic<br>
Communications Union convention raised per capita to boost<br>
organizing and service to members, and explored ways to make<br>
technological innovation work for workers, not against them.<br>
&quot;Without organizing, we jeopardize our existing wages and
working<br>
conditions,&quot; GCIU President James J. Norton told the nearly
500<br>
delegates.<br>
<br>
TWO UNIONS MEET -- The Laborers and the Machinists hold<br>
conventions this week. For the first time, LIUNA delegates,
meeting<br>
in Las Vegas, will hold secret-ballot elections for vice
presidents<br>
and nominate candidates for president, who will face a rank-and-<br>
file election later this year. LIUNA President Arthur A. Coia<br>
expects opposition, but there is no contest for secretary-<br>
treasurer. The upcoming merger with the Steelworkers and UAW will<br>
top the IAM agenda in Chicago, where delegates certainly will
toast<br>
the IAM's recent victory in the 15-week McDonnell Douglas strike.<br>
<br>
PENSION AUDIT MEASURE ADVANCES -- The Senate backed bipartisan<br>
legislation last week that would ensure meaningful audits of some<br>
$950 billion in private pension funds, enhancing the retirement<br>
security of millions of American workers, retirees and their<br>
families. The Clinton administration has urged the House to move<br>
quickly to approve the measure.<br>
<br>
DEATH RAISES SAFETY ISSUE -- The gruesome death of 18-year-old<br>
Solomon Velasquez, who was killed while cleaning an
industrial-size<br>
blender at Lundy Packing Co. in Sampson County, N.C., has
prompted<br>
the Food and Commercial Workers to launch an investigation.
Workers<br>
allege the company failed to provide legally required programs
on, <br>
and safeguards for, the cleaning and operation of hazardous<br>
machines. Three other workers at the same plant have lost hands
in<br>
the last year. Two years ago there also was an outbreak of<br>
brucellosis, a disease contracted from contaminated hog blood at<br>
the plant.<br>
<br>
METALWORKING PANEL ON THE WAY -- In the wake of a UAW request<br>
for emergency action, OSHA will form an advisory committee to<br>
recommend proposed rules for exposure to metalworking fluids.<br>
Nominations must be postmarked by Sept. 30 and should be sent to<br>
the U.S. Department of Labor/OSHA, Directorate of Health
Standards<br>
Programs, Metalworking Fluids Project Officer, 200 Constitution<br>
Ave. N.W., Room N-3718, Washington, D.C. 20210.<br>
<br>
ALBERTSON'S WORKERS SUE -- Seven current and former employees<br>
of Albertson's grocery chain filed a class-action lawsuit seeking<br>
back pay for work they performed off the clock. The suit, filed<br>
with the help of the Food and Commercial Workers, claims<br>
Albertson's threatens to fire employees who complain about
working<br>
off the clock and fails to permit rest breaks on company time.
More<br>
than 1,500 workers have given declarations that they worked off
the<br>
clock for Albertson's.<br>
<br>
SPEED TRAP -- The Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) and<br>
individual plaintiffs have filed suit against the Ohio State<br>
Highway Patrol alleging a pattern of stopping and searching<br>
Hispanic motorists and their passengers.<br>
<br>
AIFLD'S FRIEDMAN DIES -- The labor movement lost a longtime<br>
friend and educator when Jesse A. Friedman, executive director of<br>
the American Institute For Free Labor Development, died of cancer<br>
last week at 62. In memoriam, he asked for a celebration, which
was<br>
held at the George Meany Center for Labor Studies Friday.
Speakers<br>
included AFL-CIO President Sweeney and President Emeritus Lane<br>
Kirkland.<br>
<br>
HEAT WAVE<br>
<br>
From the beginning of June through the end of August, the AFL-<br>
CIO's Union Summer activists participated in organizing campaigns<br>
nationwide. Collectively, they racked up impressive numbers:
making<br>
almost 13,000 house visits, distributing more than 200,000 flyers<br>
and leaflets, collecting nearly 72,000 petition signatures for<br>
campaigns, and conducting more than 500 delegation visits to
stores<br>
and office buildings. The activists also helped to score<br>
significant victories for labor this summer. This final Heat Wave<br>
is a sampling of their work.<br>
<br>
During the course of Union Summer in Boston, activists helped<br>
win contracts for ComGas workers fighting a lockout, Hertz
Rent-A-<br>
Car employees and workers at the newly-merged City Hospital.<br>
<br>
Charleston, SC Union Summer activists' summer-long campaign of<br>
&quot;in your face&quot; tactics, including pickets, rallies and
guerilla<br>
theater, helped win the first union contract at the Melrose Club<br>
resorts.<br>
<br>
In their last week, Chicago Union Summer activists scored a<br>
victory when two grocery store managers signed a pledge
supporting<br>
the rights of strawberry workers to dignity, a living wage, and<br>
clean drinking water.<br>
<br>
As a result of Union Summer actions, six Denver custodial<br>
services contractors signed an agreement allowing organizers to<br>
talk to non-union workers about unionizing. Union Summer actions<br>
included joining tenant delegations, talking to property
management<br>
companies, and street demonstrations.<br>
<br>
In Detroit, Union Summer activists' in-store actions and face-<br>
to-face meetings with workers helped 2,000 employees of Rite Aid<br>
Drugstores get a union contract with the United Food and
Commercial<br>
Workers Local 876.<br>
<br>
Through continuous picketing, Los Angeles Union Summer<br>
activists helped HERE convince the owner of Camacho restaurants,<br>
who had reneged on his promise to have union employees at his Los<br>
Angeles Airport restaurant, to agree to negotiate with the union<br>
and hire back employees he'd fired for organizing.<br>
<br>
In just three weeks, Union Summer activists in New Orleans<br>
helped win a first-ever contract for city sanitation workers.
They<br>
also did the legwork and research to launch three new organizing<br>
campaigns: two nursing home drives and a drive with a janitorial<br>
service for local universities.<br>
<br>
New York Union Summer activists' rally and march in<br>
Manhattan's sweatshop district drew many new workers to the
Justice<br>
Center to learn more about unions. Their efforts also helped to<br>
resolve four employee dispute cases and win back pay for those<br>
employees.<br>
<br>
San Diego Union Summer activists recruited 100 precinct<br>
leaders in neighborhoods across San Diego, establishing an active<br>
base of community support for union efforts. The United Nurses<br>
Association of San Diego credits Union Summer activists' pickets<br>
with helping them win a contract for 2,700 nurses.<br>
<br>
Clearly impressed with the Watsonville Union Summer activists'<br>
abilities, corporate anti-union consultants complained publicly<br>
that the UFW had &quot;brought in 112 specially trained
activists&quot; who<br>
&quot;could change the minds of even the most adamant anti-union<br>
workers.&quot; The 16 Union Summer activists in Watsonville were<br>
extremely flattered.</p>

<h3>Work in Progress</h3>
<p>-- Monday, September 16, 1996<br>
<br>
BRIDGESTONE BURIED IN BIG EASY -- A New Orleans-style<br>
&quot;funeral,&quot; complete with Dixieland band, escorted Bridgestone and<br>
Firestone signs from four New Orleans tire stores to their final<br>
resting place as owner Cal Lucas suspended his use of the tires in<br>
support of the Steelworkers' &quot;Don't Buy&quot; campaign against the<br>
Japanese-owned company. Lucas is the largest independent tire<br>
dealer in New Orleans, doing up to $1 million annually with<br>
Firestone/Dayton. In Atlanta, the city council adopted a resolution<br>
calling for no more city purchases from Bridgestone/Firestone until<br>
its dispute with USWA is settled.<br>
<br>
BIG MAC IS BACK -- The 99-day strike against the nation's<br>
largest defense contractor ended Sept. 11, when 5,600 Machinists<br>
voted 2-1 in favor of a new contract with McDonnell Douglas that<br>
improved job security, retiree benefits and wages. The pact<br>
requires 60 days' notice of subcontracting plans and forces the<br>
company to meet with the union to retain work. It also raises wages<br>
by 4.5 percent, provides three bonuses and allows &quot;30 and out&quot;<br>
retirement at age 50 with what the union says is the highest<br>
defined pension in the aerospace industry. IAM President George<br>
Kourpias said the strike shows that &quot;people don't have to be<br>
victims of job exports or low wages.&quot;<br>
<br>
PUTTING IN THEIR 5 CENTS' WORTH -- Nearly 6,000 strawberry<br>
workers and their supporters marched Sunday in Watsonville, Calif.,<br>
setting the stage Monday for a second national action day of<br>
community activism from Alabama to Alaska. In Denver, a coalition<br>
of workers and labor and religious leaders were visiting<br>
supermarket corporate officers, urging their support in gaining<br>
better conditions in the fields. Similar activity occurred across<br>
the country. In Los Angeles, city council members signed a giant<br>
pledge card to support the workers. A recent study showed that<br>
doubling workers' $8,000 annual wages would cost the growers only<br>
5 cents per pint of berries.<br>
<br>
ORGANIZING . . . AND WINNING!! -- The AFL-CIO's elected leader<br>
task force on organizing spent three days in Chicago in candid<br>
discussions about the obstacles and opportunities faced in<br>
organizing workers. Some unions are doing it -- and winning:<br>
<br>
* Workers at Kitchen of the Ocean shrimp processing plant in<br>
Deerfield Beach, Fla., voted 173-18 for UNITE representation. The<br>
win marks the sixth UNITE victory in the Miami area since January.<br>
<br>
* The Green Bay Symphony Orchestra voted 63-18 to be represented by<br>
Musicians Local 205. The campaign was conducted by the union's<br>
newly established Organizing and Education Department.<br>
<br>
* In Logan, Ohio, workers stood strong against a year of hostility<br>
from the Carborundum Grinding Wheel Co. and voted 40-35 for Mine<br>
Worker representation.<br>
<br>
* City workers in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, voted to affiliate with<br>
AFSCME's Council 2 in Washington state. The union will represent 93<br>
employees.<br>
<br>
* Teamsters Local 572 won an election to represent 467 maintenance<br>
workers at the Los Angeles Airport. The workers are employed by<br>
Whitewood Oriental Maintenance Co.<br>
<br>
* After a two-year organizing campaign, 130 workers at the Cerebral<br>
Palsy Association of Niagara County, N.Y., voted for representation<br>
with Service Employees Local 652. The unit now plans to go after<br>
almost 1,000 technical employees at Children's Hospital in Buffalo.<br>
Meanwhile, 270 technical employees at Good Samaritan Hospital in<br>
Brockton, Mass., voted for representation by SEIU Local 767. The<br>
local also has filed for an election to represent the hospital's<br>
service and maintenance unit of more than 500 workers.<br>
<br>
LABOR MOVEMENT -- The AFL-CIO's top officers are on the move.<br>
President John Sweeney addresses the Graphic Communications Union<br>
convention in California and the Nevada AFL-CIO convention Monday,<br>
the Paperworkers in Las Vegas Tuesday and the Electrical Workers in<br>
Philadelphia on Thursday. Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka is feted<br>
by the Jewish National Committee as the labor recipient of its Tree<br>
of Life Award on Tuesday. He addresses Operation PUSH on Friday.<br>
Meanwhile, Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson is in<br>
Missouri Monday for the state AFL-CIO convention and in Washington<br>
Friday for that state convention.<br>
<br>
VICTORY AT VET HOME -- Striking AFSCME members at the Anna,<br>
Ill., veterans' home ratified their first contract Sept. 12,<br>
clearing their return to work after walking the bricks for some<br>
five weeks. The three-year pact with ServiceMaster Diversified<br>
Health Services calls for increases over term totaling nearly $4 --<br>
from $4.60 to $4.71 an hour to $8.25 to $8.50 an hour -- with<br>
employer-provided health insurance, additional paid leave, holiday<br>
pay, a 401(k) program, grievance procedures and regular labor-<br>
management meetings.<br>
<br>
BARGAIN, OR ELSE -- A federal judge ordered America West<br>
Airlines to immediately begin contract negotiations with the<br>
mechanics, who voted for Teamsters representation in April. &quot;We won<br>
the election fair and square and now the company has to negotiate,&quot;<br>
said Jim Grace, an America West mechanic for nine years.<br>
<br>
IT'S OFFICIAL -- Never one to resist an opportunity to hammer<br>
workers, Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) offered an amendment banning<br>
&quot;official time&quot; -- the time union reps spend on labor-management<br>
programs and other representational activities -- at the Social<br>
Security Administration and the Heath Care Financing<br>
Administration. But his amendment to the fiscal 1997 Treasury-<br>
Postal appropriations bill was one of more than 100 proposed and<br>
that caused Senate leaders to pull the bill from the floor.<br>
<br>
BILL IS HALF FULL -- When the Senate Appropriations Committee<br>
reported the fiscal 1997 Labor/HHS bill, it included full funding<br>
for the National Labor Relations Board (the House had cut the<br>
funding by 15 percent). It also did not place any ban on OSHA's<br>
ergonomic research or issuance of new ergonomics standards. But the<br>
bill's cuts in education and training have drawn a White House veto<br>
threat. The White House also criticized funding cuts for OSHA and<br>
a DoL program to eliminate sweatshops in the garment industry.<br>
<br>
DETROIT STANDS BY STRIKERS -- The Detroit newspaper strike<br>
continues to hit the scab Free Press and News squarely in the<br>
pocketbook. The two papers admitted that their weekday circulation<br>
has declined 35 percent, and 31 percent on Sunday, since the unfair<br>
labor practice strike began in July 1995 -- that's 10 percent<br>
higher than officials of the two papers were willing to admit<br>
previously. They also admitted that they are distributing some<br>
papers for which no revenue has been collected.<br>
<br>
COTTON DEAL FEELS GOOD -- A tentative agreement was reached<br>
Sept. 9 between UNITE and the multiemployer association<br>
representing cotton garment companies. The agreement, which covers<br>
30,000 employees in the cotton garment industry nationwide, was<br>
recommended by the negotiation committee. The ratification vote is<br>
scheduled in a couple weeks.<br>
<br>
OREOS FOR ALL -- The Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers<br>
have ratified a five-year pact with Nabisco Biscuit Co. The<br>
agreement covers some 5,700 workers in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia,<br>
Buffalo and Niagara Falls, N.Y., Denver, Atlanta, Houston, Chicago,<br>
Richmond, Va., Portland, Ore., Buena Park, Calif., and Fair Lawn,<br>
N.J., and provides across-the-board increases totaling $4.61 per<br>
hour over term. Workers also gained increases in pensions, health<br>
benefits and the formation of two labor-management task forces.<br>
<br>
ROTTEN TO THE CORE -- Apple processor Stemilt, Inc. of<br>
Wenatchee, Wash., discharged six workers for wanting to organize a<br>
union. Teamsters Local 760 has filed charges of unfair labor<br>
practices against the company. Ironically, Stemilt's President Tom<br>
Mathison was named &quot;Apple Man of the Year&quot; by the International<br>
Apple Institute.<br>
<br>
AMEN, BROTHERS AND SISTERS -- Building on their efforts in<br>
North Carolina, a coalition of religious leaders is expanding<br>
nationwide to increase its campaign for better conditions for low-<br>
wage workers. The Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice will<br>
campaign for better wages and working conditions in the poultry<br>
industry. The committee first mobilized to help 450 striking<br>
workers at the Case Farms poultry plant in Morganton, N.C.<br>
<br>
CALL WILLARD SCOTT -- Four unions that have recently<br>
celebrated or are looking forward to 100-year anniversaries have<br>
been added to the Labor Department's Century of Service Honor Roll.<br>
The Musicians, Iron Workers, Operating Engineers and Horseshoers<br>
join 33 other organizations that have been recognized.<br>
<br>
BEVERLY A BAD BET FOR VA -- The Department of Veterans Affairs<br>
overlooked vehement protests by the Service Employees and has<br>
awarded Beverly Enterprises a multistate nursing home contract.<br>
SEIU had urged the VA not to accept Beverly's bid, citing the<br>
company's dismal record and long history of labor violations.<br>
<br>
ALL ABOARD TCU -- Members of the Transportation Communications<br>
Union overwhelmingly ratified agreements with the nation's major<br>
freight railroads that will yield 16.9 percent wage increases by<br>
the end of the century. The pacts, covering clerks and carmen, also<br>
provide for post-contract cost-of-living adjustments every six<br>
months, no rule concessions and, in 1999, improved health care and<br>
dental benefits and a new vision plan.<br>
<br>
MEANY RUNS &quot;MILE&quot; -- The George Meany Center for Labor Studies<br>
is making it easier for students to transfer labor-education course<br>
credits to four-year colleges in Maryland. The Center's new<br>
Maryland Institute for Labor Education (MILE) was unveiled Friday<br>
in a ceremony featuring AFL-CIO President Sweeney and Maryland Gov.<br>
Paris Glendening, a former college professor who called MILE a<br>
national model of partnership among labor, government and the<br>
private sector. MILE will work closely with colleges, central labor<br>
councils and unionists throughout the state to offer and increase<br>
labor-related studies.<br>
<br>
AWARD-WINNING JOURNALISM -- David Elsila and Andrew Neather's<br>
examination of affirmative action in UAW's Solidarity garnered the<br>
1996 Max Steinbock Award in the ILCA's annual journalism contest.<br>
The award recognizes outstanding individual effort in exploring an<br>
issue of concern to working families, with particularly emphasis on<br>
the human spirit. For a complete list of all awards call the ILCA<br>
at 202/637-5068 or read it in the next AFL-CIO News.<br>
<br>
BACK TO SCHOOL -- The George Meany Labor Studies Center began<br>
its fall semester Sept. 10 with 29 different courses that will<br>
continue through December. Courses range from organizing,<br>
communications and negotiating to labor law and workplace violence.<br>
Contact the Center at 301/431-6400.</p>

<h3>Work in Progress</h3>
<p>-- Tuesday, September 10, 1996<br>
<br>
MAC STRIKERS VOTE -- Members of Machinists District 837 will<br>
vote Sept. 11 on a tentative contract that would end the three-<br>
month strike against McDonnell Douglas. The tentative agreement was<br>
reached late Sept. 6 after 30 hours of negotiations in the Capitol<br>
Hill office of Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). The unprecedented<br>
involvement of Gephardt and Federal Mediation and Conciliation<br>
Service Director John Calhoun Wells, who personally led the talks,<br>
was one of the key factors in breaking the stalemate. Some 6,700<br>
workers have been out since June 5 over the key issues of job<br>
security and outsourcing.<br>
<br>
COOKING WITH GAS -- The Steelworkers ratified a new six-year<br>
contract ending a bitter five-month lockout of 372 employees at<br>
Boston's Commonwealth Gas Co., in which the company cut off wages<br>
and health benefits. The key issues were health care insurance,<br>
contracting out and wages, according to Lowell Alexander, president<br>
of USWA Local 12004. Workers gained a flat rate for health-care<br>
premiums, a cost-of-living wage increase and job security on most<br>
live gas lines.<br>
<br>
LET IT GROW -- From bus drivers to dancers to pet food<br>
workers, some 2,500 workers decided to sport the union label in a<br>
half-dozen recent elections. Here's a rundown:<br>
<br>
YES, WE CAN -- Workers at the Atwater Canning Co. in Modesto,<br>
Calif., voted 349-273 for Teamsters representation. The win was<br>
part of a renewed drive by the workers to improve benefits, working<br>
conditions and wages in the industry.<br>
<br>
MORE THAN 57 AT HEINZ -- More than 700 production and<br>
maintenance workers at the Heinz Pet Products plant in Philadelphia<br>
voted to be represented by Food and Commercial Workers Local 38.<br>
<br>
BUS DRIVERS' ROUTE TO VICTORY -- The Steelworkers won their<br>
organizing drive to represent 430 Nashville school bus drivers. The<br>
workers organized around stronger safety measures, an end to<br>
overcrowding and unfair distribution of routes and fairer treatment<br>
for workers by the school district.<br>
<br>
DANCERS STEP TO SEIU -- Exotic dancers at San Francisco's<br>
Lusty Lady Theater voted 57-15 for Service Employees<br>
representation. Like other workers, the dancers, bouncers and other<br>
support staff are concerned with seniority, shift scheduling,<br>
working conditions, health insurance and wages.<br>
<br>
UNIONIZE THE PRIVATIZED -- SEIU Local 503 will represent<br>
workers whose jobs have been moved from the public sector to the<br>
private. Joining Local 503 are 120 direct-care workers at the<br>
Oregon Supported Living Program in Eugene and 45 direct-care<br>
workers at a group home in Corvallis.<br>
<br>
R-E-S-P-E-C-T WHAT THE UNION MEANS TO ME -- Dania Nursing Home<br>
in Miami finally won the respect they were seeking as they voted<br>
32-10 for UNITE. &quot;Workers are fed up with the way management treats<br>
them at Dania and they proved that they aren't going to take it<br>
anymore,&quot; said John Belizaire, a UNITE organizer.<br>
<br>
UAW IN DRIVER'S SEAT, AND BACK SEAT -- Workers at Findlay<br>
Industries in West Carrollton, Ohio, voted for UAW representation.<br>
The 316 hourly workers build seats for the Chevy Blazer.<br>
<br>
THEY'RE BACK, NASTY AS EVER -- Returning from a monthlong<br>
congressional recess, the GOP continued its unprecedented attack on<br>
workers. The first shot may be an amendment to the Senate's Labor-<br>
HHS appropriations bill to ban &quot;official time&quot; for union<br>
representatives to spend on labor-management partnership programs<br>
and other permitted representational activities at the Social<br>
Security Administration and the Health Care Financing<br>
Administration. The second volley could be an amendment to the<br>
Treasury-Postal spending bill that would ban official time<br>
throughout the government. Call 1-800-LABOR21 and tell your<br>
senators to oppose this blatant and partisan attack on workers'<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
LABOR'S LIGHT SHINES -- In New York City on Saturday, 100,000<br>
workers presented a spirited, diverse affirmation of trade unionism<br>
at one of the largest Labor Day Parades in years. Labor Day this<br>
year prompted lots of praise and damnation for the resurgent labor<br>
movement. &quot;Labor's engagement takes place against a backdrop of a<br>
rejuvenated and more confident union movement, one that has made<br>
gains in organizing, one that has seen the political tides<br>
apparently turn in its favor,&quot; the St. Louis Post Dispatch stated.<br>
&quot;Americans like winners and the sight of successful labor<br>
leadership has begun to alter a stagnant image,&quot; reported the<br>
Atlanta Journal and Constitution. &quot;Even its adversaries consider<br>
the AFL-CIO's sophisticated advertising and grassroots lobbying<br>
campaign for the minimum wage a major achievement,&quot; said Newsday.<br>
A lengthy Associated Press profile of the AFL-CIO's new activism<br>
appeared in newspapers coast to coast. <br>
<br>
EYEING ERGONOMICS -- Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) is expected to<br>
offer an amendment to ban the Occupational Safety and Health<br>
Administration from issuing any new ergonomics standards when the<br>
Senate Appropriations Committee, or the labor subcommittee, marks<br>
up the FY 1997 Labor/HHS spending bill Sept. 10 and 12. Ironically,<br>
the Gingrich-controlled House voted to strip such a ban from its<br>
version of the bill. Call your senators (1-800-LABOR21) and tell<br>
them to oppose any ban on ergonomics protections.<br>
<br>
PLUGGED NICKLES -- Angry workers from Oklahoma flooded Senate<br>
offices with phone calls, FAXes and letters to protest a move by<br>
Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.) to waive the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage<br>
law for reconstruction of the Oklahoma City Federal Building. The<br>
outpouring, a threatened veto and certain defeat apparently gave<br>
long-time fair-wage foe Nickles second thoughts, and the word is he<br>
will drop his effort. Following the April 19, 1995, explosion that<br>
claimed 168 lives, building and construction trades workers toiled<br>
tirelessly, and sometimes voluntarily, to find survivors, recover<br>
bodies and stabilize the building.<br>
<br>
W. VA. TOYOTA PLANT UNION-MADE -- A project labor agreement<br>
covering construction of a $400 million Toyota Motor manufacturing<br>
plant in Buffalo, W. Va., has been reached. The agreement was<br>
signed by Skilton Construction Co., the AFL-CIO Building and<br>
Construction Trades Department and 15 international unions, the<br>
Charleston Building and Construction Trades Council and its<br>
affiliated unions. Work is expected to begin in the next few weeks<br>
and will provide several hundred jobs for construction workers for<br>
the next two years.<br>
<br>
WORKING TOGETHER -- Three Government Employees locals and a<br>
Fire Fighters local will receive National Partnership Awards at the<br>
White House Wednesday. The unions are part of labor-management<br>
teams at federal agencies that worked together to improve delivery<br>
of customer service. The AFGE locals represent workers at the U.S.<br>
Mint, U.S. Department of Education and the Defense Distribution<br>
Depot, and the IAFF represents firefighters at the U.S. Army<br>
Armaments Research Development and Engineering Center.<br>
<br>
AROUND THE WORLD -- This week, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer<br>
Richard Trumka will be in Great Britain meeting with the Trade<br>
Union Congress. On the other side of the world, Executive Vice<br>
President Linda Chavez-Thompson will speak to workers at the<br>
Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas, who will have been on strike for five<br>
years as of Sept. 21.<br>
<br>
D.C. JANITORS SEEK COMMON CENTS -- Hundreds of workers joined<br>
AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson and SEIU<br>
President Andy Stern in a march through downtown Washington Sept.<br>
4 to support 2,000 janitors whose contracts expire Sept. 30. The<br>
janitors' fall campaign, &quot;A Penny for Justice,&quot; highlights the fact<br>
that &quot;it would only cost pennies to give the workers fair wages and<br>
health insurance,&quot; Stern told the crowd. The janitors held another<br>
rally Sept. 6 at National Airport to call attention to the unfair<br>
treatment and wages janitors receive from the airport cleaning<br>
services contractor, Priem Inc.<br>
<br>
BAD APPLES IN NEW YORK -- As a recent series of raids at<br>
Brooklyn garment makers highlights, New York continues to lead the<br>
nation in the number of garment worker wage and hour violations and<br>
in the total amount of back wages collected on behalf of garment<br>
workers. In the period between April 1 and June 30, 56 violations<br>
were uncovered, resulting in $310,347 in back wages for 1,134<br>
workers. The Flatbush raids included one shop linked to the<br>
celebrity Kathy Ireland line sold in Kmart.<br>
<br>
BOSSES: &quot;I SPY&quot; -- Employees are being increasingly spied upon<br>
and monitored at work. So the American Civil Liberties Union<br>
launched its &quot;Campaign for Fairness in the Workplace&quot; with the<br>
release of a 12-minute video and a white paper report that<br>
documents this growing abuse. The educational video, &quot;Through the<br>
Keyhole: Privacy in the Workplace -- An Endangered Right,&quot;<br>
documents a hotel worker who was secretly videotaped while dressing<br>
and undressing in the men's locker room and other abuses. The<br>
report is available on the World Wide Web at http:\\www.aclu.org or<br>
call 212/944-9800.<br>
<br>
HEALTH COMMISSION PRAISED -- Workers hailed President<br>
Clinton's creation of a national commission on health care quality,<br>
with AFL-CIO President John Sweeney calling it a &quot;concrete step<br>
that, by protecting consumers in the often-confusing and coercive<br>
health care situation of today, should lessen their anxiety and<br>
make their lives a little easier.&quot;<br>
<br>
JOBLESS RATE FALLS -- Unemployment fell from 5.4 percent to<br>
5.1 percent in August, the lowest level in seven years. Employment<br>
rose by 250,000, 10 percent of that in manufacturing, a sector led<br>
by motor vehicle and equipment fabrication. Including underutilized<br>
labor, the rate was 9.3 percent, or 12.7 million workers.<br>
<br>
HOW TIME FLIES -- Four unions that have recently celebrated or<br>
are looking forward to centennial anniversaries have been added to<br>
the Labor Department's Century of Service Honor Roll. The<br>
Musicians, Iron Workers, Operating Engineers and Horseshoers join<br>
33 other organizations that have been recognized.<br>
<br>
BRICK BUY BRICK -- Union organizations and rank-and-file<br>
members can buy pieces of the &quot;Hitting the Bricks&quot; 1995 Strike<br>
Memorial to commemorate the Machinists' victory against Boeing.<br>
Personalized bricks for individuals are $69 -- one dollar for every<br>
day of the 1995 strike -- and $321 or one dollar for each day<br>
District 751 has been on strike to date for labor organizations.<br>
The metal sculpture, featuring an eternal flame in the burn barrel,<br>
will be erected in front of the new union hall across from the<br>
Boeing plant in Everett, Wash. Mail your check or money order to<br>
Hittin' the Bricks Memorial, 9125 15th Place S., Seattle, Wash.<br>
98108.</p>

<h3>AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h3>
<p>-- Thursday, September 5, 1996<br>
<br>
DEMOCRATIC REVIVAL -- Labor took its &quot;America Needs A
Raise&quot;<br>
campaign to the floor and to the podium at the Democratic
National<br>
Convention in Chicago as sign-waving, demonstrating delegates<br>
greeted AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, who assailed corporate<br>
irresponsibility while embracing President Clinton and Vice<br>
President Gore as fighters for working families. &quot;Our idea
of a<br>
just society is one in which honest labor raises the standard of<br>
living for all, rather than enormous wealth for a few,&quot; he
said.<br>
<br>
FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE -- Sweeney and Secretary-Treasurer<br>
Richard Trumka put their bodies on the line in Detroit Aug. 30
when<br>
they were arrested for barring the doors at the Detroit News
during<br>
a protest in support of striking workers. The same day, more than<br>
100 trade unionists rallied at the Columbus (Ga.)
Ledger-Inquirer,<br>
which is owned by Miami-based Knight-Ridder, parent of the
Detroit<br>
Free Press, the other struck paper.<br>
<br>
GOP LIES ON MEDICARE -- Sweeney unveiled a new round of AFL-<br>
CIO ads aimed at 27 members of Congress who voted to slash<br>
Medicare, but who now deny it. &quot;Republicans in Congress are
running<br>
shamefully dishonest television commercials falsely claiming<br>
Medicare benefits would increase under the proposals,&quot;
Sweeney told<br>
a news conference Aug. 28. Pollster Geoff Garin, appearing with<br>
Sweeney, presented numbers that show union members overwhelmingly<br>
support the AFL-CIO campaign to educate workers about their
issues.<br>
As the nation's attention turns back to school, the federation<br>
today begins airing ads about efforts by some legislators to cut<br>
student loans.<br>
<br>
PRESIDENTIAL INTERVENTION -- A top priority of the labor<br>
movement over the next two months is to re-elect President
Clinton,<br>
Machinists President George Kourpias told a progressive policy<br>
forum in Chicago sponsored by the Campaign for America's Future.<br>
&quot;The labor movement could not have withstood the assault by
GOP<br>
leaders if the president had not intervened to defend working<br>
families,&quot; he said. Kourpias, who joined Clinton for one leg
of his<br>
train trip to Chicago, urged activists to help Clinton gain a<br>
Congress he can work with.<br>
<br>
WORKING WOMEN'S VOTE -- Women who declined to participate in<br>
1994 out of anger and alienation could be the key constituency to<br>
electing candidates who care about working families, said Karen<br>
Nussbaum, director of the AFL-CIO Working Women's Department.<br>
Nussbaum announced in Chicago that union women will reach out to<br>
all working women during Working Women Vote Week, Oct. 5-11. For<br>
more information, contact the department at 202/637-5087.<br>
<br>
WORKERS FLEX MUSCLES AT ROADMASTER -- Workers at Roadmaster<br>
Corp. in Opelika, Ala., gave the exercise equipment plant a
workout<br>
when they voted 343-150 for UNITE. &quot;The company tried every
trick<br>
in the book to keep the workers from forming a union, but this<br>
crowd stood tough and stayed focused on justice,&quot; said Joe
Gaines,<br>
a UNITE organizer.<br>
<br>
WALKED RIGHT IN, STEPPED RIGHT UP -- Host Marriott workers at<br>
Bradley Airport in Hartford, Conn., walked in on their employer
and<br>
requested union recognition. The company refused to take the<br>
petition from the workers and told them to take it up with the<br>
National Labor Relations Board. A majority of the Latino workers<br>
have signed up for representation by the Hotel Employees and<br>
Restaurant Employees Local 217.<br>
<br>
COMAIR FLIES WITH IBT -- Flight attendants at ComAir, a<br>
regional commuter airline owned partially by Delta Air Lines,
voted<br>
for Teamsters representation. The flight attendants sought IBT<br>
representation because of dissatisfaction with wages and working<br>
conditions. The workers are based in Cincinnati and Orlando, Fla.<br>
<br>
LABOR DAY -- As Americans relaxed for the holiday weekend the<br>
labor movement earned, labor itself was on the move. AFL-CIO<br>
President John Sweeney saluted the drive for justice in the<br>
strawberry fields in an address to the Farm Workers convention<br>
Sunday before flying to Detroit for Monday's Labor Day rally in<br>
support of striking newspaper workers. Also Monday, he joined<br>
President Clinton for a Labor Day picnic in Green Bay, Wis., and
a<br>
rally in Milwaukee. Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka was in<br>
Chicago on Labor Day to help the Chicago AFL-CIO celebrate its<br>
100th anniversary. Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson<br>
attended the Peter J. McGuire Labor Day observance in New Jersey<br>
Friday before heading to Los Angeles for the Labor Day festival
on<br>
Monday. Sweeney will be in New York next Saturday for the annual<br>
Labor Day Parade. <br>
<br>
BACK TO SCHOOL WITH UNION -- The classified staff at St.<br>
Genevieve R-2 School District in Missouri voted 45-16 for the
AFT.<br>
The unit will represent school secretaries, teacher and library<br>
aides, custodians, maintenance personnel, volunteer coordinators,<br>
school nurses, cafeteria workers and parents as teachers.<br>
<br>
FAMILIES IN CRISIS -- At a domestic policy forum Aug. 26<br>
sponsored by the National Policy Council, Sweeney joined<br>
conversations with American families via satellite. Among them:<br>
Kate Hartley, 83, a West Virginia widow struggling to get along
on<br>
Medicare and frightened that Congress would cut benefits. Another<br>
voice came from Garrett Zwack, a retired meatpacker and UFCW<br>
member at John Morrell and Co. in Sioux Falls, S.D., whose
monthly<br>
pension check was cut to $500, and whose health benefits were
taken<br>
away entirely.<br>
<br>
&quot;ALL PAIN, NO GAIN&quot; -- Despite job growth during the
1990s,<br>
the typical American family still faces considerable economic
pain,<br>
according to a report released Labor Day by the Economic Policy<br>
Institute. The State of Working America, 1996-97, finds that all<br>
but the top 20 percent of male earners and most female earners
saw<br>
their hourly wages decline between 1989 and 1995. Since middle-<br>
class workers pay the same proportion of their income in taxes as<br>
they did in the late 1970s, &quot;the rise in inequality and fall
in<br>
living standards reflect what employers aren't putting into<br>
paychecks, not what government is taking out in taxes,&quot; EPI<br>
stresses.<br>
<br>
FIRESTONE FALLOUT -- Bridgestone/Firestone, singled out as a<br>
corporate outlaw by President Sweeney in his speech to the<br>
Democratic convention, was the target of Labor Day rallies in
major<br>
cities across the country. Two years ago, the Japanese-owned<br>
company illegally discharged 2,300 striking Rubber Workers, now<br>
Steelworkers. More than 400 USWA members are still out of work<br>
while those back on the job are without the protection of a<br>
contract.<br>
<br>
BOSTON NURSES GAIN PACT -- Nurses formerly employed at Boston<br>
City Hospital have reached a 15-month pact with Boston Medical<br>
Center, formed by a merger between their hospital and Boston<br>
University Medical Center. The 800 registered and licensed<br>
practical nurses, members of Service Employees Local 285, will<br>
receive pay increases of between $1,000 and $6,000, will carry
over<br>
public pension credits, are eligible for full health insurance if<br>
they choose a designated HMO and will have bumping, recall and<br>
other layoff protection. The pact follows one negotiated for<br>
nonprofessional employees represented by Local 285 and AFSCME.<br>
<br>
NO WAY-VER -- The White House is not buying a bid by opponents<br>
of Davis-Bacon who are trying to get a proposed Senate amendment<br>
that would waive prevailing-wage provisions for reconstruction of<br>
the Oklahoma City Federal Building. The Labor Department said<br>
flatly last week that the Clinton administration is opposed to<br>
waiving Davis-Bacon provisions, and hinted strongly that any bill<br>
carrying waiver language would be vetoed.<br>
<br>
MARYLAND RIPE -- AFSCME Maryland and the Teamsters filed<br>
election petitions on Aug. 21, the first day state employees were<br>
eligible to petition for a collective bargaining representation<br>
election. AFSCME filed election petitions for four bargaining
units<br>
covering 20,000 state employees in labor and trade, health and<br>
human services, social and human services and public safety and<br>
security. The last unit was filed by the United Corrections and<br>
Public Safety Employees of Maryland, a coalition of AFSCME and
IBT.<br>
<br>
ASBESTOS REVISION -- The Occupational Safety and Health<br>
Administration has issued corrections and clarifications to its<br>
final asbestos standards for general industry, construction and<br>
shipyard work to strengthen employee information efforts and<br>
tighten training standards. The changes were published in the
Aug.<br>
23 Federal Register and are effective Sept. 23.<br>
<br>
NOT TOO LATE TO SAVE YOUR SKIN -- The Building and<br>
Construction Trades Department is co-sponsoring a workshop Sept.<br>
15-17 on How to Save Your Skin: Preventing Skin Problems in the<br>
Construction Industry, at the Dupont Plaza Hotel in Washington.
For<br>
more information, call 202/842-7840.<br>
<br>
THE HOUSE THAT LABOR BUILT -- The Teamsters, Painters and<br>
Carpenters have designated the week of Sept. 2 as &quot;Labor for<br>
Habitat Week.&quot; Following a national convention in Atlanta,
Aug. 30-<br>
Sept. 1, Habitat for Humanity International and union volunteers<br>
will participate in a 20-house &quot;Blitz Build&quot; in
Americus, Ga.<br>
<br>
CHILD LABOR CONFAB -- The Child Labor Coalition will host its<br>
second biennial conference on Sept. 8-10 at the Embassy Row Hotel<br>
in Washington. The conference will include a keynote address by<br>
Labor Secretary Robert Reich, along with discussions on trade and<br>
child labor, and lessons learned from the RUGMARK and Foul Ball<br>
campaigns. For more information, contact Sally Moore at 202/835-<br>
3323.<br>
<br>
WORKING WOMEN'S SUMMITS -- The Women's Bureau will launch<br>
&quot;Working Women's Summits&quot; throughout September on
family-friendly<br>
policies that can improve workers' morale and company profits.
The<br>
summits will be held Sept. 4 at Westchester Community College in<br>
Valhalla, N.Y.; Sept. 5 at Sheraton University City in<br>
Philadelphia; Sept. 10 at Palace of Fine Arts Theatre in San<br>
Francisco; Sept. 12 at the University of Washington Conference
Hall<br>
in Seattle; Sept. 17 at several sites, including Denver and the<br>
University of Missouri at Kansas City; Sept. 19 at the Holiday
Inn<br>
Pyramid in Albuquerque, N.M.; Sept. 25 at the Lansing Center in<br>
Lansing, Mich.; and Sept. 27 at the Holiday Inn in Tampa, Fla.

<h3>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS</h3>
<p>-- TUESDAY, AUGUST 27, 1996<br>
<br>
A PLACE IN THE HALL -- Working families are well represented<br>
at the Democratic Convention this week in Chicago, with more than<br>
800 delegates who are members of AFL-CIO unions. Combined with<br>
delegates from the unaffiliated National Education Association,<br>
union delegates constitute one-fourth of the 4,320 convention<br>
delegates. Workers set the tone for the convention with an
&quot;America<br>
Needs A Raise&quot; rally at noon Monday in front of the State of<br>
Illinois building, where thousands joined AFL-CIO President John<br>
Sweeney to put working family issues front and center. Sweeney
also<br>
will address the convention on Wednesday night.<br>
<br>
GORE: WE'RE ON YOUR SIDE -- Vice President Gore told a<br>
cheering, chanting labor meeting Sunday that he and President<br>
Clinton would continue their fight for working families into
their<br>
second term. Gore and Labor Secretary Robert Reich praised the
new<br>
vitality and energy of the labor movement and credited labor's<br>
aggressive campaign with forcing the Dole-Gingrich forces to seek<br>
to hide their extremist platform, which, if enacted, would
decimate<br>
workers' rights and programs. Chants of &quot;Four More
Years&quot; rocked<br>
the room.<br>
<br>
MAXIMUM VICTORY -- Giving credit to organized labor's push to<br>
raise the minimum wage, President Clinton signed the 90-cent-an-<br>
hour increase into law last week. He noted that while the vast<br>
majority of union workers earn far above the wage floor, unions<br>
fought for the hike because &quot;it was the right thing to
do.&quot; Before<br>
going to the White House for the signing ceremony, some two dozen<br>
low- and minimum-wage workers and their children lunched at
AFL-CIO<br>
headquarters, where President Sweeney noted that no one thought
the<br>
minimum wage could be raised until they and their unions
&quot;pushed<br>
your members of Congress.&quot;<br>
<br>
GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS -- Clinton also signed legislation making<br>
it easier for workers to carry their health insurance from job to<br>
job and harder for insurance companies to deny coverage for pre-<br>
existing conditions. Sweeney said it was a good first step, but<br>
&quot;the still serious and unmet need for broad health care
reform&quot;<br>
must be addressed. Sweeney had urged Clinton to veto a welfare<br>
reform measure, but the president signed it anyway, casting many<br>
poor families to the mercies of uneven state &quot;workfare&quot;
programs.<br>
This kind of change in the system &quot;will only serve to
undermine the<br>
value of work for all American families and reduce our overall<br>
standard of living,&quot; said Andy Stern, president of the
Service<br>
Employees.<br>
<br>
TAKING THE FIGHT HOME -- UNITE member Yamil Lopez stood behind<br>
Clinton at the minimum wage signing ceremony and then went home
to<br>
fight for workers at the Hebrew Home in North Miami, Fla.
&quot;The<br>
raise in the minimum wage is a good beginning, but we still have
a<br>
long way to go,&quot; said Lopez. &quot;Even those who make above
the new<br>
minimum wage are struggling to survive. Here at the Hebrew Home
we<br>
can't even afford health care for our families.&quot;<br>
<br>
UAW SHOWS $OLIDARITY -- The UAW showed true solidarity with<br>
striking Detroit newspaper workers, presenting each of the 2,000<br>
strikers with a $150 check for the fourth time since the strike<br>
began July 13, 1995. &quot;I do not know of any other
demonstration of<br>
support of this magnitude that has been bestowed by an<br>
international to individual workers. . . . Thank you from the<br>
bottom of our hearts,&quot; Newspaper Guild President Linda Foley
wrote<br>
to UAW President Stephen P. Yokich.<br>
<br>
ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES -- Volunteer organizers in Steelworkers<br>
District 7 pitched in to help organize a group of 160 workers at<br>
MEG Corp. in Cambridge City, Ind. The volunteers helped
house-call<br>
more than half of the work force, telling them about the
advantages<br>
of belonging to a union.<br>
<br>
IT'S THE MEMBERS, STUPID -- Union members overwhelmingly<br>
support the drive to educate union members and the public on<br>
legislators' stands on such key worker issues as Medicare,<br>
pensions, education and the minimum wage, a new poll shows.<br>
Republicans had charged, using trumped-up figures, that union<br>
members did not support the AFL-CIO's Labor `96 campaign.
Seventy-<br>
two percent approve the federation's television and radio ads,<br>
while 67 percent have a positive reaction to the AFL-CIO's
overall<br>
campaign, the media push and grass-roots mobilization in<br>
congressional districts. Only 11 percent react negatively. Only
17<br>
percent of those surveyed said they would be more likely to
support<br>
a candidate who has solidly backed Newt Gingrich's GOP agenda in<br>
Congress. The survey was conducted Aug. 2-4 by Peter D. Hart<br>
Research Associates. Summaries are available by calling 202/637-<br>
5041.<br>
<br>
UNSTOPPABLE SEIU -- The Service Employees continue to win<br>
economic justice and dignity for workers, raking up four
victories<br>
in the Midwest and on the West Coast. Health care professionals
at<br>
Peoples Community Care Residence in St. Paul voted for SEIU<br>
representation. In Gary, Ind., a unit of 37 city emergency
medical<br>
workers voted for the union. The R.N. units at Los Robles
Hospital<br>
in the San Fernando Valley voted 167-104 for SEIU. And in
Seattle,<br>
District 925 won an election for 27 patient account reps and
other<br>
employees at Children's University Medical Group.<br>
<br>
CLOSING ON THE REOPENER -- Miners won improvements in pension<br>
benefits, health insurance and wages in a new deal with the<br>
Bituminous Coal Operators Association. A reopener clause in the<br>
1993 contract paved the way for the new agreement that will
affect<br>
about 100,000 pensioners and 40,000 miners. UMWA and BCOA agreed
to<br>
begin bargaining next year in an attempt to reach a new agreement<br>
before this pact expires August 30, 1998.<br>
<br>
A HEALTHY PACT -- The Laborers and the Johns Hopkins<br>
University School of Public Health have joined forces for a five-<br>
year study to identify and address occupational safety and health<br>
hazards of construction and environmental cleanup.<br>
<br>
HAIL NO -- Millionaire Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent<br>
Cooke is trying to weasel out of paying construction workers<br>
prevailing wages on the team's new football stadium in Landover,<br>
Md. The Maryland attorney general issued a decision requiring<br>
prevailing wages on the project, but Cooke's lawyers took the<br>
decision to court. &quot;The Redskins should not want to operate
by a<br>
lower standard for your construction team,&quot; Building and<br>
Construction Trades President Robert Georgine told Cooke.<br>
<br>
USWA GETS BIG SAY -- The Steelworkers reached tentative<br>
agreement on an innovative four-year contract with Northwestern<br>
Steel and Wire Co. that gives the workers decision- making<br>
authority in all aspects of the business. In addition to gaining
a<br>
member of the board of directors, the union will have access to<br>
most of the company's business plans and financial data.<br>
<br>
FIFA SCORES GOAL -- The International Federation of Football<br>
Associations will make sure that their logo only appears on
soccer<br>
balls that are not made by child labor. The AFL-CIO's Executive<br>
Council had urged FIFA not to put their stamp of approval on any<br>
soccer ball made by child labor. Some 35 million soccer balls are<br>
made every year, mostly in Pakistan and other Third World<br>
countries, and about 80 percent of the balls imported into the<br>
United States are hand-stitched by children 5-14 years old.<br>
<br>
A ONE-TWO-THREE PUNCH -- Employees of Precision Castparts<br>
Corp. in Portland, Ore., will be armed with triple protection as<br>
the Steelworkers, UAW and Machinists begin a joint organizing
drive<br>
in the plant stemming from the unification talks that will merge<br>
the three unions in 2000.<br>
<br>
BOLD CHINA PATTERN -- For the first time, the U.S. trade<br>
deficit with China ($3.2 billion in June) exceeded that with
Japan,<br>
reflecting a continued but largely unreported surge in imports
from<br>
a country that uses forced and low-wage labor. Closer to home,
the<br>
gold rush south by U.S. corporations helped to create a
merchandise<br>
trade deficit with Mexico of $8.3 billion for the first six
months<br>
of the year, $600 million greater than in the same part of 1995.<br>
<br>
DISCOVER RHODE ISLAND -- Before the federal minimum wage<br>
increases, Rhode Island's working poor will get some relief Sept.<br>
1 when the state's minimum wage rises from $4.45 to $4.75 an
hour,<br>
and again to $5.15 next Jan. 1. Under the bill, the maximum<br>
allowance for gratuities in businesses like hotels and
restaurants<br>
will increase from 35 percent to 50 percent, with a minimum cash<br>
wage of $2.89 an hour. The income boost &quot;is a step toward
making<br>
sure that people who make minimum wage don't live in
poverty,&quot;<br>
state AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer George Nee said.<br>
<br>
CWA, GTE AGREE -- The Communications Workers ratified a<br>
statewide, three-year contract providing wage increases totaling
9<br>
percent for some 9,000 GTE California employees. The first raise,<br>
3 percent, is retroactive to March 17, when the prior contract<br>
expired. The workers also will be eligible for &quot;performance
team<br>
awards,&quot; that could total as much as 3 percent of their
salary for<br>
meeting certain company operations goals.<br>
<br>
MUNCHKIN POWER -- Mickey Carroll, who played a munchkin in the<br>
film, The Wizard of Oz, recently presented a $1,500 check to the<br>
Machinists on strike at McDonnell Douglas and posed for photos<br>
while carrying a picket sign. &quot;I'm for labor,&quot; said
Carroll, 77,<br>
who owns a St. Louis tombstone business. &quot;Everytime I go by
the<br>
picket line, I yell and stick my thumb up.&quot;<br>
<br>
NEITHER RAIN NOR SLEET -- Nearly 3,000 Postal Workers took to<br>
L.A.'s streets in an awesome demonstration at the boycotted New<br>
Otani Hotel, an organizing target of Hotel Employees and
Restaurant<br>
Employees Local 11. The delegates to APWU's 13th biennial<br>
convention met up with HERE members at City Hall and, under a<br>
blazing southern California sun, walked a seven-block circuit to<br>
the hotel, boisterously shouting and chanting, &quot;The boycott
united<br>
will never be defeated.&quot;<br>
<br>
BLAST SPARKS RECONSIDERATION -- An April 1995 explosion that<br>
killed five workers at a union-represented chemical firm has<br>
prompted OSHA to review its list of hazardous chemicals. The<br>
explosion at Napp Technologies in Lodi, N.J., occurred when four<br>
chemicals not covered under the standard exploded while being
mixed<br>
-- an act also not covered by OSHA's process safety management<br>
standard. The former Clothing and Textile Workers represented<br>
workers at the now-closed plant.<br>
<br>
WORKPLACE VIOLENCE -- The George Meany Center for Labor<br>
Studies is offering a one week course on Dealing with Workplace<br>
Violence Oct. 13-18 -- at the center's Silver Spring, Md.,
campus.<br>
For more information call (301)431-5408.<br>
<br>
LABOR DAY HEROES -- &quot;Heroes, 3: Profiles from the American<br>
Workplace&quot; is a one-hour Labor Day special from the public<br>
television series &quot;We Do The Work.&quot; The show pays
tribute to<br>
ordinary people who take action in times of adversity and make<br>
extraordinary contributions to society through their work. Check<br>
your local PBS listings for air times.</p>

<h3>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS</h3>
<p>-- TUESDAY, AUGUST 20, 1996<br>
<br>
ATTACK ON TEACHERS _ While the GOP kept many of its anti-union<br>
attack dogs in check during the convention in San Diego last week,<br>
presidential nominee Bob Dole couldn't resist haranguing against<br>
teachers' unions in his acceptance speech. Back in 1965, Dole voted<br>
against the creation of the student loan program, and he has<br>
continued to vote against education programs _including last year,<br>
when he backed Newt Gingrich in cutting the education budget. Now<br>
he opens his campaign scapegoating teachers. &quot;He should be trying<br>
to bring parents and teachers together, not trying to divide them,&quot;<br>
AFT President Al Shanker said.<br>
<br>
HOW BIG IS THAT TENT? _ Convention honchos tried to present a<br>
face of diversity and moderation. But the numbers tell a different<br>
story. Out of almost 2,000 delegates, there were less than 100<br>
minority delegates. Two-thirds of the delegates were male and an<br>
astonishing 40 percent of the Republican delegates in San Diego had<br>
annual incomes of $500,000 or more. Not all of America needs a<br>
raise.<br>
<br>
DON'T STEP IN IT AGAIN _ Supply-side economics _ the heart and<br>
soul of Bob Dole's economic plans _ sent the nation's deficit<br>
soaring and the wage gap widening in the Reagan `80s. Under<br>
President Clinton, the budget deficit has fallen every year. The<br>
Congressional Budget Office reported last week that the deficit<br>
will drop to $116 billion this year, the lowest level since 1981.<br>
<br>
EARLY FRUIT, GOOD CROP _ The Machinists, with help from the<br>
UAW and Steelworkers, beat back an anti-union campaign against<br>
workers at the Maremount Corp. in Loudon, Tenn, winning a 369-272<br>
representative vote. The workers make automobile mufflers.<br>
<br>
HIGH-FIBER VICTORY _ Workers at the Fiber Sales and<br>
Development Corp. of Urbana, Ohio, voted by a 2-1 margin for<br>
Teamsters representation after a November 1995 vote was set aside<br>
by the National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB said the company<br>
had offered a reduction in employee-paid health care premiums in<br>
order to improperly influence the 1995 election. The employees make<br>
powdered cellulose for use as an additive in other products.<br>
<br>
BEARS, WILDCATS ROAR FOR SEIU _ Service Employees Local 236 in<br>
Chicago won representation rights for ushers employed by Safety<br>
Service Systems, including ushers for the Chicago Bears and the<br>
Northwestern Wildcats. SSS also granted recognition to 180 current<br>
SEIU members after taking over a contract for the now-defunct Andy<br>
Fain Co.<br>
<br>
DISSERVICEMASTER _ Workers at the state veterans' home in<br>
Anna, Ill., struck Aug. 10 after a yearlong struggle under the<br>
AFSCME banner for a first contract with ServiceMaster _ and have<br>
been replaced. Family members of residents have reported that<br>
replacement workers are not showing up _ and when they do, they<br>
lack qualifications and skills and are administering poor care,.<br>
The AFL-CIO Executive Council urged the state to get involved in<br>
the dispute.<br>
<br>
AFTRA CABLE READY _ The Television and Radio Artists have<br>
launched a $1.25 million drive to organize workers in the booming<br>
cable entertainment and news programming industry. AFTRA has cable<br>
network contracts with The Nashville Network, Home Box Office and<br>
E! Entertainment.<br>
<br>
SI SE PUEDE _ Shouts of &quot;Si se puede&quot; (Yes, We Can)<br>
reverberated at rallies in more than 10 cities on Aug. 14 as AFL-<br>
CIO Central Labor Councils kicked off their campaign in support of<br>
the Farm Workers effort to organize 20,000 strawberry pickers in<br>
California. Thousands of trade unionists joined the informational<br>
leafleting and visits to supermarkets to urge store managers to<br>
sign a pledge supporting the workers.<br>
<br>
NO REST _ Anti-worker lawmakers may have fled Washington for<br>
a month, but they're not getting any respite from the AFL-CIO's<br>
grass-roots education campaign. Radio and television ads lambasting<br>
GOP attempts last year to allow big business to raid workers'<br>
pension funds and urging enactment of legislation to protect 401(k)<br>
plans aired in 30 districts for two weeks. Materials documenting<br>
the county-by-county impact of the fiscal 1997 GOP budget cuts for<br>
such programs as Medicaid, Head Start, job training, nutrition<br>
programs and highway construction were sent to the federation's 135<br>
congressional district coordinators. And when President Clinton<br>
signs the minimum wage increase today, district activists will hold<br>
events to celebrate labor's success in winning the wage fight _ no<br>
thanks to the congressional Republican leadership.<br>
<br>
SHIPYARD STRIKERS GAIN HELP _ Some 1,800 striking workers at<br>
San Diego's National Shipbuilding Co. shipyard were bolstered early<br>
last week by visits first from AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and<br>
then from Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka. The yard performs<br>
contract work for the U.S. Navy _ and while the NASSCO CEO enjoys<br>
fat raises each year courtesy of U.S. taxpayers, the workers<br>
haven't had a raise since 1992. The strikers belong to the<br>
Ironworkers, Machinists, Electrical Workers, Carpenters, Painters,<br>
Operating Engineers and Teamsters. Donations to help them may be<br>
sent to: Solidarity Fund for NASSCO Workers, c/o San Diego-Imperial<br>
Counties Labor Council, AFL-CIO, 4265 Fairmount Ave., Suite 110,<br>
San Diego, Calif. 92105.<br>
<br>
`ALL CLEAR' IN THIS YARD _ Sweeney ended his week on a very<br>
different note at a Virginia shipyard, saluting a business-labor<br>
partnership at Newport News Shipbuilding to produce five double-<br>
hulled tankers. Union Labor Life Insurance Co. is one investor in<br>
the $240 million project, with union construction set to begin in<br>
1997. The tankers will be U.S.-flagged and U.S.-operated.<br>
<br>
MCDONNELL DOUGLAS STALLS TALKS _ McDonnell Douglas' refusal to<br>
offer job security protections stalled negotiations to settle the<br>
10-week strike between the Machinists and the aerospace giant. The<br>
union made new proposals to accommodate the company's need for job<br>
flexibility, with the clear expectation that the company would meet<br>
the workers' need for job security. The new talks followed a mass<br>
&quot;March for American Jobs&quot; by 10,000 people on McDonnell Douglas<br>
headquarters Aug. 11, led by AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard L.<br>
Trumka and IAM President George Kourpias.<br>
<br>
LIUNA REBUILDS CHURCHES _ Members of Laborers Local 1177 in<br>
Baton Rouge, La., and community volunteers repaired or rebuilt<br>
three area churches that were desecrated by vandals in the recent<br>
rash of hate crimes against Southern black churches. LIUNA's<br>
national &quot;Rebuild, Prevent and Protect&quot; program was started at<br>
Sweet Home Baptist Church in Baker, La. LIUNA also donated funds to<br>
Cypress Grove Baptist Church in Zachary, La., to build a safety<br>
fence. The latest church to be repaired is St. Paul's Free Baptist<br>
Church, also in Baker.<br>
<br>
STRONG BONDS _ National religious leaders joined with<br>
community groups in Morganton, N.C., for a &quot;march for justice&quot; in<br>
support of workers on strike at Case Farm poultry plant because the<br>
company refuses to bargain with their union, the Laborers.<br>
<br>
SWEENEY'S TREATISE _ AFL-CIO President John Sweeney is the<br>
author of a new book, &quot;America Needs A Raise,&quot; a blunt account of<br>
America's economic troubles that presents the human face of<br>
American labor. Sweeney disects the realities of the global economy<br>
and argues that strong unions offer hope to all workers beset by<br>
economic insecurity. Copies are available in most bookstores or<br>
from Houghton Mifflin Co., 222 Berkeley St., Boston, Mass. 02116.<br>
<br>
GOING AGAINST CONVENTION _ Fancy digs at the plush San Diego<br>
Hilton Beach and Tennis Club couldn't keep Pennsylvania Gov. Tom<br>
Ridge (R) away from the problems back home. Members of the Service<br>
Employees, demanding that Ridge intervene in the ongoing Beverly<br>
Enterprises nursing home dispute, set up a picket line the governor<br>
had to pass through on his way to the convention.<br>
<br>
PUNCHING DOLE'S TICKET _ Teamsters were at the final<br>
shareholders meeting of Southern Pacific Rail Corp. in San<br>
Francisco Aug. 16 to protest the ties the carrier and its merger<br>
partner, Union Pacific Corp., have with Republican presidential<br>
nominee Bob Dole. During months leading to regulatory approval of<br>
the merger, the two carriers were the third-largest lobbying force<br>
in Washington, with 68 registered lobbyists, and UP's corporate PAC<br>
was the fifth largest donor to the Dole campaign. The merger is<br>
expected to cost 1,300 jobs in the Bay Area alone.<br>
<br>
IT'S IN THE CARDS _ The transfer of Union Privilege's<br>
MasterCard portfolio from Bank of New York (Delaware) to Household<br>
International was completed Monday. Household now will provide all<br>
customer service, send all bills and notices and make all credit<br>
decisions using its own approval criteria. Current cardholders will<br>
be receiving notification of the change starting this week.<br>
Household will offer to cardholders a deal to transfer balances<br>
from higher-interest cards and pay them off at the prime rate.<br>
<br>
CARPENTERS IN TRAINING _ In the second major agreement of its<br>
kind this year, the Carpenters have joined forces with the<br>
Ingersoll-Rand Architectural Hardware Division to improve training<br>
and standards in the construction industry. Ingersoll-Rand will<br>
provide technical support and training materials and will certify<br>
instructors and installers upon completion of the training. The UBC<br>
will provide the apprenticeship and training programs. The union<br>
had signed a similar agreement with Wilsonart.<br>
<br>
GAS WORKERS SETTLE _ The Utility Workers and Chemical Workers<br>
reached tentative agreement on a new two-year contract with<br>
Southern California Gas that protects against layoffs and raises<br>
salaries by 3 percent for 5,100 employees. The deal, worked out<br>
over 10 months of often-acrimonious talks, includes a 2.7 percent<br>
lump sum bonus after ratification and another 2.7 percent payment<br>
in 1997, the same year the wage increase begins. The company agreed<br>
not to lay off any full-time employee in the bargaining unit except<br>
for disciplinary reasons.<br>
<br>
CLINTON, YES. RUNYON, NO _ More than 8,000 delegates to the<br>
60th biennial Letter Carriers convention in Orlando, Fla., voted<br>
unanimously to endorse the Clinton/Gore ticket after Gore addressed<br>
the group via satellite. But the delegates voted no confidence in<br>
Postmaster General Marvin Runyon after NALC President Vincent<br>
Sombrotto told the convention &quot;tough times are ahead&quot; because of<br>
U.S. Postal Service attempts to privatize and implement other anti-<br>
union measures.<br>
<br>
SENDING REINFORCEMENTS _ In Las Vegas, the 39th Iron Workers<br>
convention added a new classification of workers to the union's<br>
official name _ reinforcing iron workers _ who join their brothers<br>
and sisters in the &quot;International Association of Bridge,<br>
Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
HEAT WAVE<br>
<br>
Union Summer activists based in Atlanta will be working in<br>
Georgia and Alabama this week. They will demonstrate with the<br>
Communications Workers of America, hold an action in support of the<br>
Detroit Free Press and News workers, help the Georgia State<br>
Employees Union fight privatization, and go to Opelika, Alabama for<br>
an election with workers at Roadmaster, which makes exercise<br>
equipment.<br>
<br>
Boston Union Summer interns will hold an action with locked<br>
out Commonwealth Gas workers on Tuesday. They are helping organize<br>
a demonstration Thursday to create pressure on Budweiser, which has<br>
refused to give Teamster drivers a contract. On Friday, the interns<br>
will demonstrate at area malls with UNITE! in support of Peerless<br>
garment workers.<br>
<br>
In Denver, Union Summer activists will take to the road,<br>
visiting Grand Junction for a day on the UFCW picket line with<br>
striking City Market workers. They will join a picket of Lord &amp;<br>
Taylor at the Cherry Creek Mall in support of sweatshop workers.<br>
House and office visits to support the Justice for Janitors<br>
campaign are also ongoing.<br>
<br>
Union Summer interns in the City of the Angels will join in<br>
several actions this week. They will act as a human billboard to<br>
protest the privatization of Los Angeles County hospitals, meet<br>
with grocery store managers to build support for strawberry<br>
workers, and walk precincts to educate voters on the California<br>
Civil Rights Initiative, which would end all affirmative action<br>
programs in the state.<br>
<br>
This week Union Summer activists in Miami will hold a vigil to<br>
support the Miami Herald boycott, organize skycaps at the Miami<br>
International Airport with the International Association of<br>
Machinists, and hold a demonstration and news conference in support<br>
of farm workers at the Fort Lauderdale corporate headquarters of<br>
Hyde Park Supermarkets.<br>
<br>
Union Summer interns in Puerto Rico are organizing and<br>
conducting house visits with health care, pharmaceutical and<br>
governmental workers around the island with SEIU and AFSCME.<br>
<br>
Sacramento Union Summer interns celebrated a victory last<br>
week. Thanks in part to activists who picketed, leafleted and held<br>
other actions with Justice for Janitors, Somers Building<br>
Maintenance settled with the Service Employees International Union,<br>
reinstating several employees who had been unjustly suspended.<br>
<br>
Union Summer activists in Watsonville will continue their<br>
visits to strawberry fields to survey workers and inspect work<br>
sites. Their activities are prompting responses from strawberry<br>
field owners, who are staging their own anti-union protests and<br>
trying to create a &quot;pro-worker&quot; committee opposed to unionization.</p>

<h3>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS</h3>
<p>-- AUGUST 13, 1996<br>
<br>
CHANGING THE WAY WE WORK _ AFL-CIO President John Sweeney<br>
continued his overhaul of the federation, naming three new<br>
department heads and other appointments at the Executive Council<br>
meeting in Chicago last week. Ron Blackwell, chief economist at<br>
UNITE, will head the new Department of Corporate Affairs that will<br>
expand the work the federation does to support union organizing and<br>
collective bargaining. Barbara Shailor, an assistant to Machinists<br>
President George Kourpias for trade and international finance, was<br>
named the federation's International Affairs Director. Bill<br>
Fletcher, who has headed SEIU's education and field services<br>
departments, was named the new AFL-CIO Education Director. Among<br>
Fletcher's first priorities will be helping to develop an ambitious<br>
program to educate all union members about workers and the economy.<br>
<br>
The Department of Corporate Affairs will feature three<br>
divisions: a Center for Strategic Research, headed by David Chu,<br>
former research director for the Service Employees; a Center for<br>
Worker Ownership and Governance, headed by Bill Patterson,<br>
corporate affairs specialist at the Teamsters; and a Center for<br>
Workplace Democracy, headed by Nancy Mills, who will serve as<br>
acting director. Mills previously worked on issues of workplace<br>
technology and change with SEIU. Dick Leonard, a 27-year activist<br>
for the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers, was named to direct<br>
strategic campaigns as an assistant director in the Department of<br>
Field Mobilization.<br>
<br>
MELROSE, PLACE FOR UNIONS _ The first resort contract ever in<br>
Carolina's coastal resort area was no television drama, it was a<br>
real life victory for resort workers and Union Summer activists.<br>
The Operating Engineers say their contract at Melrose Resort in<br>
Hilton Head, S.C., was due in large part to the persistent and<br>
creative pressure from Union Summer. The nation's press continues<br>
to chronicle the summer sojourn. A New York Times article last<br>
Friday quoted Yale sophomore Daniel Lang: &quot;This is great. I'm<br>
seeing the problems that workers face with my own eyes, and I'm<br>
seeing what unions are trying to do about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
DOLE TAXES CREDIBILITY _ Bob Dole's tax plan &quot;breaks new<br>
ground in its cynical attempt to woo voters with promises of<br>
economic well-being by providing tax breaks to the wealthy,&quot; the<br>
Executive Council charged. Similar supply-side policies of the<br>
1980s resulted in a record federal budget deficit and continue to<br>
threaten programs that serve working families. The council<br>
predicted that workers won't be fooled by &quot;a desperate effort by a<br>
flagging campaign to revisit the failed policies from which this<br>
country has just spent four years trying to overcome.&quot;<br>
<br>
FIBER BLOAT? _ &quot;I will fight the minimum wage with every fiber<br>
of my being,&quot; House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said a few<br>
months back. Last week, he got a chance to eat his words when<br>
Texas union members delivered 515 boxes (the minimum wage will be<br>
raised to $5.15) of high-fiber cereal to his Irving office. Maybe<br>
now he'll be just a regular guy.<br>
<br>
A CUT ABOVE AT KMART _ Meatcutters at a Super Kmart in Oakland<br>
became the first Kmart retail workers in the country to join a<br>
union. The workers voted 10-3 to join Food and Commercial Workers<br>
Local 120. The Teamsters and UNITE have gotten footholds in Kmart<br>
distribution centers, but the company remains virulently anti-<br>
union. The UFCW also used its member-based SPUR organizing program<br>
to enlist 500 new members at H&amp;M Food Systems in Dallas.<br>
<br>
WELCOME TO SAN DIEGO _ Republicans gathering in San Diego for<br>
the national convention Sunday were greeted by thousands of workers<br>
gathered in Balboa Park for an &quot;America Needs A Raise&quot; picnic and<br>
rally. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney told the group working<br>
families will demand that candidates protect pensions, Social<br>
Security, Medicare, prevailing wages and the 40-hour week. Pension<br>
protection is the topic of a new round of AFL-CIO TV and radio ads<br>
that highlight votes to allow corporations to raid pensions. Over<br>
the weekend, the federation also began the member mobilization<br>
phase of its Labor '96 campaign with a three-day planning session<br>
for congressional district coordinators and state federation<br>
officials.<br>
<br>
SPREADING OUT _ Service Employees Local 880, which has<br>
organized thousands of home care workers in Illinois, now<br>
represents 125 employees in Missouri. The vote at Homecare Services<br>
Inc. in St. Louis was 55-28 for SEIU.<br>
<br>
SECURE SOCIAL SECURITY _ Wall Street's drooling over the<br>
chance to get its hands on Social Security funds for so-called<br>
&quot;privatization&quot; and is conducting an orchestrated disinformation<br>
campaign on long-term financing problems. That, the Executive<br>
Council said, is why it's time to make Americans aware of &quot;the true<br>
value of the Social Security system and to discredit the false<br>
notion that private retirement accounts could match Social Security<br>
benefits.&quot; The council called on all unions to begin regular<br>
communications with their members about Social Security and to<br>
encourage activists to publicly defend the system.<br>
<br>
WORKERS DON'T LOSE SHIRTS _ Most of the UNITE workers at the<br>
C.F. Hathaway shirt plant in Waterville, Maine, will keep their<br>
jobs. In May, Hathaway's parent company, the Warnaco Group, said it<br>
would shut or sell the plant, the state's largest unionized apparel<br>
facility. But an investor group announced it will buy the plant and<br>
retain &quot;substantially all&quot; of the current work force.<br>
<br>
NOT JUST ENGLISH _ A measure to make English the official<br>
language of the federal government would &quot;disenfranchise, divide<br>
and disconnect&quot; millions of Americans from their government, the<br>
AFL-CIO Executive Council declared. Rather than penalize persons<br>
who do not speak English, the government should increase funding<br>
for adult education programs and English as a second language, the<br>
council said.<br>
<br>
HUNGER FOR JUSTICE _ Two striking workers at the Case Farms<br>
poultry processing plant in Morganton, N.C. began a hunger strike<br>
outside the plant Monday. More than 450 workers walked off the job<br>
last week after the company refused to recognize and bargain with<br>
the Laborers for more than a year. &quot;The will and spirit of my<br>
fellow workers will sustain me. We demand to be treated with<br>
respect and dignity. We will settle for nothing less,&quot; said Roberto<br>
Mendoza who is joined in the hunger strike by Luis Alberto Gonzalez<br>
and a local religious activist.<br>
<br>
CONVENTION CENTRAL _ Unions met across the country last week<br>
to plan their futures.<br>
<br>
* The Plumbers and Pipefitters, meeting in Las Vegas, elected<br>
new officers _ President Martin Maddaloni, Secretary-Treasurer<br>
Michael Collins and Assistant President Randal Gardner. Maddaloni<br>
replaces retiring Marvin Boede, effective Jan. 1.<br>
<br>
* In Pittsburgh, Steelworker delegates celebrated the planned<br>
unification with the UAW and Machinists in 2000 and heard President<br>
George Becker tell of plans by the Aluminum, Brick and Glass<br>
Workers to meet in special convention to consider joining the USWA.<br>
<br>
* AFT President Albert Shanker told the convention in<br>
Cincinnati that &quot;it is as much our duty to preserve public<br>
education as it is to negotiate a good contract or defend a<br>
competent teacher under attack.&quot;<br>
<br>
* The Fire Fighters, meeting in Honolulu, endorsed President<br>
Clinton after hearing from him in a video address. They also re-<br>
elected Al Whitehead as president and Vincent Bollon as secretary-<br>
treasurer.<br>
<br>
* The Glass, Molders and Pottery Workers pledged concerted<br>
political action for Clinton and re-elected President Frank Carter<br>
and other officers. Delegates passed a $2 dues increase.<br>
<br>
THESE SHOES DON'T FIT _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson described to<br>
the Executive Council the cozy relationship between multinational<br>
corporations like Nike and Reebok and the governments of developing<br>
countries, resulting in minuscule wages and outrageous working<br>
conditions. &quot;I am convinced that unless we address this, the vast<br>
body of oppressed workers can swallow up our labor market and not<br>
even have indigestion,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
SORRY, WRONG NUMBER _ &quot;It is clear that Bell Atlantic's buyout<br>
of NYNEX would take us in the opposite direction (from the goal of<br>
the 1995 Telecommunications Act): a bigger telecom monopoly with<br>
even less incentive to reverse the companies' existing pattern of<br>
declining service standards, ever-higher rates and the destruction<br>
of good jobs,&quot; the Executive Council said. The AFL-CIO, the<br>
Communications Workers and Electrical Workers have urged federal<br>
and state agencies to nix the deal.<br>
<br>
STRIKE IS HOT SALSA _ Protesting unfair labor practices, 200<br>
Teamster Local 63 delivery drivers struck Guerrero Mexican Food<br>
Products August 4. The firm, which also markets under the &quot;Mission&quot;<br>
brand, is the largest tortilla producer in southern California. The<br>
subsidiary of a huge Mexican corn flour conglomerate closely<br>
aligned with that country's ruling circles, Guerrero has benefited<br>
from corporate welfare and has been driving independent operators<br>
out of business, the union charges. They were joined by other<br>
labor, community, campus and religious groups for a rally last<br>
Wednesday in front of the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
REBUILDING CHURCHES AND FAITH _ The AFL-CIO will mobilize its<br>
affiliated unions and state and local councils to help rebuild<br>
churches, mainly in black communities, that have been burned,<br>
bombed or vandalized by hate criminals. And it will join with<br>
religious and civil rights groups to help foster a climate of<br>
tolerance and unity in the communities where these acts have<br>
occurred. The EC condemned the burnings and other racially,<br>
ethnically and sexually oriented crimes as &quot;acts of cowardly<br>
intolerance.&quot;<br>
<br>
HELP FOR STATE FEDS _ State and local central bodies &quot;are the<br>
backbone and infrastructure of this federation,&quot; Paperworkers<br>
President Wayne Glenn said as he urged the Executive Council to<br>
step up efforts to get local unions to affiliate. The council<br>
approved disbursement of funds to state federations from a program<br>
designed to encourage international unions to increase their local<br>
unions' affiliation with state feds. The money comes from a small<br>
_ one cent per member per month _ assessment on unions that do not<br>
meet affiliation goals approved earlier. Some of the funds will be<br>
reserved for grants of no more than $5,000 for program needs such<br>
as affiliation initiatives, technological enhancements or grass-<br>
roots development.<br>
<br>
STERN ADDITION _ Andy Stern, newly elected president of the<br>
Service Employees, was elected to the Executive Council, replacing<br>
his predecessor at SEIU, Richard Cordtz. Cordtz was praised by the<br>
council for his half-century of service as a labor movement<br>
activist.<br>
<br>
HEAT WAVE<br>
<br>
Union Summer activists working in Chicago received a standing<br>
ovation from the AFL-CIO Executive Council at its meeting in the<br>
Windy City last week. The Union Summer interns told the council<br>
how their experiences have changed their vision of America.<br>
<br>
Wednesday, August 14 is the AFL-CIO's National Action Day on<br>
strawberry workers, and most Union Summer sites are organizing<br>
actions. Other activities include:<br>
<br>
Boston Union Summer activists will picket Commonwealth Gas on<br>
Tuesday to support employees who are locked out. At the end of the<br>
week, they will go to Vermont and New Hampshire to canvass about<br>
Medicare.<br>
<br>
Union Summer activists in Chicago will join Teamsters Friday<br>
for an action to support the Overnight Trucking campaign. Chicago<br>
includes Union Summer's oldest activist _ a 63-year-old whose<br>
grandfather was an organizer for the UAW.<br>
<br>
The final wave of Los Angeles Union Summer interns will focus<br>
on the New Otani Hotel boycott and organizing Superior grocery<br>
store workers. They will also visit professors and students at UCLA<br>
to help the graduate students' union gain recognition from the<br>
University.<br>
<br>
Union Summer activists in Miami spent the week protesting the<br>
wages and benefits paid by Burdines Department Stores, and Tire<br>
Kingdom's record of sex discrimination in promotions. This week,<br>
they will work with the Farm Workers on the Prime mushrooms<br>
boycott.<br>
<br>
Union Summer interns in New Orleans will spend the week<br>
organizing parking attendants and ambulance drivers, and janitors<br>
who work for a private contractor at New Orleans University.<br>
<br>
All week, New York City activists will leaflet sweatshops,<br>
giving workers information about the Workers' Center and the<br>
support available there.<br>
<br>
Union Summer interns in Puerto Rico will recruit health care<br>
workers to join the Service Employees, and conduct house visits to<br>
organize a pharmaceutical company in Humaco. They are also<br>
organizing workers in the Departamento de Familia.<br>
<br>
Sacramento Union Summer activists are supporting the Living<br>
Wage Initiative, organizing opposition to the anti-affirmative<br>
action ballot measure, picketing for Justice for Janitors, and<br>
organizing home health care workers.<br>
<br>
Union Summer interns in San Jose are organizing a<br>
demonstration with Delores Huerta of the Farm Workers on Wednesday<br>
to highlight the plight of strawberry workers.<br>
<br>
The new Watsonville Union Summer activists will survey<br>
strawberry workers at their homes. On Wednesday, they will act as<br>
human billboards at busy intersections in Santa Cruz and Salinas,<br>
educating drivers about the working conditions in strawberry<br>
fields.</p>

<h3>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS</h3>
<p>-- August 5, 1996<br>
<br>
MARCH FOR AMERICAN JOBS _ Unionists from across the country will<br>
march Aug. 11 in St. Louis at McDonnell Douglas world headquarters<br>
to protest the company's use of tax dollars to slash jobs and<br>
export them overseas. The nation's largest defense contractor,<br>
McDonnell Douglas also is spending tax dollars to hire scab and<br>
security goons to try to break a two-month strike by the<br>
Machinists. Leading the march will be IAM President George<br>
Kourpias, UAW President Stephen P. Yokich, and Steelworkers<br>
President George Becker. For information, call 314/731-0603.<br>
<br>
&quot;REVOLTING&quot; REPUBLICANS YIELD _ Hoping to gain some political<br>
advantage, Republicans abandoned their &quot;revolution&quot; to allow final<br>
passage of pro-worker legislation championed by Democrats before<br>
heading home for a month. The minimum wage will jump from $4.25 to<br>
$5.25 in two 45 cent increases, Oct. 1 and Sept. 1, 1997. Clinton<br>
also got a health insurance reform bill that provides insurance<br>
portability from job-to-job and coverage for pre-existing<br>
conditions. Much still needs to be done &quot;to address the still<br>
serious and unmet need for broad health care reform,&quot; AFL-CIO<br>
President John Sweeney said.<br>
<br>
WAR ON THE POOR _ In what Sweeney called &quot;bad for the country . .<br>
. and harmful to poor families,&quot; Congress passed the GOP's welfare<br>
&quot;reform&quot; bill. Clinton said he would sign the bill, which would end<br>
the government's 61-year-old guarantee to provide a federal safety<br>
net for America's less fortunate. Now _ surprise _ The Wall Street<br>
Journal reports that Republican leaders are considering using the<br>
projected $56 billion in welfare cuts to finance tax breaks that<br>
may be aimed at America's wealthiest.<br>
<br>
SYLVANIA WORKERS SEE THE LIGHT _ The Electronic Workers were able<br>
to break a 40-year union drought when workers at the Osram Sylvania<br>
facility in St. Marys, Pa., voted 251-227 for IUE representation.<br>
The workers decided they'd had enough of the company's shenanigans<br>
after Sylvania tried to implement continuous shifts and permanently<br>
laid off 100 workers, sending their jobs to Mexico. IUE also won<br>
recognition for 206 workers after 124 signed authorization cards at<br>
American Roll Form and Manufacturing Co. in Angola, Ind., which<br>
makes auto bumpers. Another 77 probationary workers will be part of<br>
the unit when they become permanently employed.<br>
<br>
WHAT'S UP, AIRDOX _ Workers at the Long Airdox mining equipment<br>
plant in Saltville, Va., wanted security and respect _ so they<br>
voted 49-20 for Mine Workers representation. &quot;They refused to be<br>
intimidated by management's threats and illegal discharge of a<br>
union supporter,&quot; said UMWA President Cecil E. Roberts. The<br>
Saltville plant is the third plant to vote union among the six<br>
plants owned by Long Airdox. Also, members of an independent union<br>
representing workers at a conference center in Banff, Alberta,<br>
voted by a 2-1 margin to affiliate with the UMWA.<br>
<br>
MILE HIGH IN DENVER _ Service Employees Local 105 in Denver, where<br>
members help with organizing, has brought in 500 new members in<br>
recent weeks. The latest victory was July 25, when employees at the<br>
Mental Health Corp. of Denver voted 210-59 for SEIU representation.<br>
The local, which is pushing to organize 1,000 suburban janitors,<br>
took to the streets last week and blocked a major downtown<br>
intersection.<br>
<br>
OVERTIME OUT _ The Senate will be the next battleground in the<br>
fight to save the 40-hour week and overtime pay. Last week the<br>
House passed a bill by Rep. Cass Ballenger (R-N.C.) to give the<br>
boss an opportunity to offer &quot;comp&quot; time instead of paying cash for<br>
overtime worked. The Department of Labor has recommended that<br>
Clinton veto the bill.<br>
<br>
STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER? _ If that's what it takes to win basic<br>
rights for 20,000 California strawberry pickers, who earn about<br>
$8,000 a year. The campaign by the Farm Workers and the AFL-CIO<br>
heated up last week when Central Labor Councils around the country<br>
began a drive to seek pledges of support for the workers from local<br>
supermarkets. The pledge backs five things for the strawberry<br>
pickers _ living wages, clean drinking water and bathrooms, job<br>
security, health insurance and an end to sexual harassment. Stores<br>
that balk at the pledge will be leafletted Aug. 14. The strawberry<br>
campaign is one of the issues the AFL-CIO Executive Council will<br>
take up Tuesday and Wednesday during its annual summer meeting in<br>
Chicago.<br>
<br>
CRACKDOWN ON EGG FARM _ DeCoster Egg Farms operates an &quot;unsanitary<br>
and dangerous workplace,&quot; provides &quot;inhumane living quarters&quot; of<br>
cramped trailers and treats workers deplorably _ as in the case of<br>
a worker who severed several fingers and was forced to wait hours<br>
for medical aid, Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich said. The<br>
company faces $3.6 million in proposed penalties levied by the U.S.<br>
Department of Labor for safety and health violations _ and criminal<br>
charges are being considered.<br>
<br>
MORE LIFT FOR THE COCKPIT _ Air Line Pilots set up informational<br>
picketing Aug. 3 at airports in Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle to<br>
protest working conditions at Mountain West Airlines and WestAir,<br>
both divisions of Mesa Air Group, where they have been negotiating<br>
for more than a year. The pilots are seeking decent work rules and<br>
benefits and wages commensurate with those paid at other regional<br>
airlines. The airlines operate as United Express carriers.<br>
<br>
JANITORS CLEAN UP _ Janitors ratified a contract with San Francisco<br>
building managers that will raise wages and pension contributions<br>
by 25 percent. Meanwhile, SEIU's Justice for Janitors campaign is<br>
heating up across the nation. In Washington, union janitors marched<br>
alongside nonunion janitors at P&amp;R Enterprises, a company that pays<br>
low wages and provides no health insurance or sick leave.<br>
<br>
QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT _ The Longshoremen reached a tentative<br>
three-year contract with the Pacific Maritime Association that<br>
provides wage increases of $3 per hour for 8,000 workers at 26<br>
ports on the West Coast. Under the agreement, the workers receive<br>
a $2 raise in the first year and $1 in the second, the first<br>
increases since 1993.<br>
<br>
MOPPING UP THE SWEATS - The Clinton administration announced the<br>
formation of a blue-ribbon panel to find ways to help consumers<br>
make sure they aren't buying garments made in sweatshops. For the<br>
past year, unions, consumer groups and the Department of Labor have<br>
been leading an aggressive crusade against domestic and foreign<br>
sweatshops.<br>
<br>
POCKETING THE PAYCHECK _ Another underhanded bosses' trick to sway<br>
votes in representation election vote, splitting paychecks _ one<br>
for union dues and the other pay minus dues _ was banned by the<br>
National Labor Relations Board in a unanimous ruling. Citing its<br>
rules against last-minute speechmaking by either side to a &quot;captive<br>
audience&quot; and late campaigning near polling places, the board also<br>
prohibited changing the time, location or method of paycheck<br>
distribution. The case stemmed from a complaint by the Operating<br>
Engineers against Kalin Construction Co. in Sodus, Mich., over a<br>
1994 election. The board ordered a new election.<br>
<br>
AFGE GRASSROOTS EFFORT PAYS OFF _ Lobbying and phone calls by<br>
federal employees on Capitol Hill thwarted efforts by some members<br>
of Congress to eliminate assurances that 60 percent of critical<br>
military hardware maintenance is performed by federal employees.The<br>
provision in the defense authorization bill to privatize<br>
maintenance was dropped in conference.<br>
<br>
CALIFORNIA TEAMING _ The California AFL-CIO July 31 elected Art<br>
Pulaski, secretary-treasurer of the San Mateo Labor Council, as<br>
executive secretary-treasurer, replacing retiring Jack Henning.<br>
Henning's conclusion: &quot;If by suspension of the laws of nature, I<br>
again were young, I would follow no other course, no other flag,<br>
than the flag of labor.&quot; Tom Rankin, state federation research<br>
director and lobbyist, was elected to fill the president's post,<br>
succeeding Albin J. Gruhn, who also retired. Delegates approved the<br>
expansion of the council from 36 to 48 to increase representation<br>
by women and people of color.<br>
<br>
FIGHT INJUSTICE _ The Indonesian government has cracked down hard<br>
on trade unionists. Muchtar Pakpahan, leader of Indonesia's only<br>
independent union, SBSI, was detained earlier this week and charged<br>
with subversion. He endured a lengthy prison sentence last year on<br>
similar trumped-up charges. According to reports, eight other SBSI<br>
leaders and 25 union members have also been detained. President<br>
Sweeney, the ICFTU and many other unions and NGOs have sent<br>
letters. Please send letters of protest to: General Suharto,<br>
President, Government of Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia; FAX: 62-21-<br>
360-517, Abdul Latief, Minister of Manpower, Jakarta, Indonesia,<br>
FAX: 62-21-840-2746.<br>
<br>
WITHOUT A PARACHUTE _ Citing continuing safety concerns, the Flight<br>
Attendants asked the Transportation Department to give the boot to<br>
top officers at ValuJet Airlines. Charging that management is<br>
either incapable or unwilling to run a safe airline, the union said<br>
chief executive Robert Priddy and chief operating officer Lewis<br>
Jordan &quot;should not be trusted with the public safety.&quot; ValuJet's<br>
fleet was grounded on June 18 after numerous inspections by the<br>
Federal Aviation Administration turned up serious safety problems<br>
at the cut-rate carrier in the wake of a May 11 crash in Florida<br>
that killed all on board.<br>
<br>
NARI CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF _ The Air Traffic Controllers, an<br>
affiliate of the Marine Engineers, has provided initial funding for<br>
creation of the National Aviation Research Institute, which is<br>
intended to improve air safety through the development of new<br>
technology based on the input of the workers who actually operate<br>
the equipment. Technology of the present air traffic control system<br>
is 10 to 15 years behind, Acting Executive Director Mike Connor<br>
said.<br>
<br>
WHAT WE DO IN COMMUNITIES _ T-shirts and full-color posters with<br>
the legend, &quot;Organizing for Social Justice in our Community,&quot;<br>
produced by the Department of Field Mobilization for central labor<br>
councils, are available from the AFL-CIO. The T-shirts (black) are<br>
$12 each and posters are $1. To order, contact the AFL-CIO, PMO,<br>
Room 209, 815 16th St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006.<br>
<br>
<br>
HEAT WAVE<br>
<br>
The Union Summer Southern Bus Tour will travel to Montgomery<br>
and Birmingham, Alabama in the final week of the Care-A-Van.<br>
Activists will handbill at the Estes nursing homes and conduct<br>
house visits with nursing home caregivers. They will tour the Civil<br>
Rights Museum in Montgomery and the Birmingham Jail, where Martin<br>
Luther King, Jr. was incarcerated.<br>
<br>
Bay Area Union Summer interns finished their three-weeks with<br>
a flurry, picketing the Lafayette Park Hotel; blocking traffic to<br>
draw attention to the ongoing boycott of the hotel. In San<br>
Francisco, activists drew more than 1000 people to a rally at the<br>
Embarcadero in support of janitors whose contract had expired after<br>
failed negotiations with employers.<br>
<br>
A new wave of Union Summer activists in Boston pick up where<br>
the last wave left off, organizing nursing home employees and<br>
meeting with union members in New Hampshire and Vermont. They will<br>
also lay groundwork for a Workers' Rights Board in Boston, which<br>
will be made up of 100 prominent citizens who will help non-union<br>
employees defend their rights.<br>
<br>
Union Summer interns in Charleston are taking to the streets<br>
to eradicate the term &quot;plantation&quot; from hotels and resorts in<br>
Hilton Head. Next week, they will sweep the beach to inform<br>
vacationers about job conditions in area hotels and the living wage<br>
initiative.<br>
<br>
Denver Union Summer activists will hit the ground running in<br>
support of the on-going Justice for Janitors campaign, leafleting<br>
downtown office buildings and petitioning tenants to adopt a<br>
responsible contract policy. Next week, activists will visit the<br>
Ludlow Massacre Site in Trinidad, Colorado and will meet with mine<br>
workers in the rural community.<br>
<br>
New Orleans Union Summer interns are organizing parking<br>
attendants and tourist industry employees. They are also meeting<br>
with Jefferson Parish female custodians who are filing a sex<br>
discrimination suit against the school district. The women, called<br>
&quot;maids,&quot; do the same work as male custodians but receive lower<br>
wages and fewer opportunities for advancement.<br>
<br>
In support of sweatshop workers in the garment industry, New<br>
York Union Summer activists will reach out to the community about<br>
worker's rights abuses. Activists will also picket New York<br>
department stores that sell brands associated with these abuses.<br>
<br>
Union Summer interns in Puerto Rico will work on two major<br>
campaigns: half will visit government workers at their agencies as<br>
part of an AFSCME organizing drive; the other half will do house<br>
visits to private sector health care and pharmaceutical workers<br>
with SEIU.<br>
<br>
Thirty-two Union Summer interns in Sacramento will work on the<br>
local Justice for Janitors organizing campaign and visit home<br>
health care workers at their homes. Activists will also support the<br>
United Farm Workers' efforts to organize strawberry pickers.<br>
<br>
Union Summer activists in San Jose are sending delegations to<br>
local stores that sell strawberries to talk to management about<br>
workers' rights violations against strawberry pickers. Interns are<br>
also working to organize mechanics, musicians and home health care<br>
workers.</p>

<h3>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS</h3>
<p>-- Tuesday, July 30, 1996<br>
<br>
BLUE LIGHT CONTRACT AT KMART -- UNITE members at Kmart's<br>
Greensboro, N.C., distribution center are celebrating the end of<br>
their three-year struggle with an &quot;excellent&quot; new contract that<br>
includes a pay increase ranging from 22 percent to 52 percent, two<br>
new paid holidays, sick leave gains and nondiscrimination language.<br>
The settlement comes after the dispute pulled together the<br>
Greensboro community behind the workers, including civil<br>
disobedience and a consumer boycott. The starting rate in the<br>
warehouse will increase from $7.25 per hour to $9 over term, while<br>
the base rate of $9 per hour will go to $11.<br>
<br>
HISTORIC RAIL PACT -- Conrail backed off its dispute with the<br>
Maintenance of Way Employees this morning, ending a two-year<br>
struggle to achieve labor agreements between rail labor and the<br>
nation's major freight carriers. If ratified, the tentative<br>
agreements with 13 unions, affecting 145,000 rail workers on 35<br>
railroads, would mark the first time in at least 30 years that the<br>
national rail industry has survived a bargaining process without<br>
strikes or imposed settlements from Congress.<br>
<br>
TALKIN' ABOUT O.T. -- That little extra you work harder for --<br>
overtime -- could be snatched away from you if the House approves<br>
a bill this week to let bosses pay in &quot;time&quot; instead of cash. This<br>
attack on the 40-hour work is orchestrated by Rep. Cass Ballenger<br>
(R-N.C.), who deceptively calls the bill, &quot;Working Families<br>
Flexibility Act.&quot; Some mostly toothless provisions would give<br>
workers no protection from the employer forcing comp time instead<br>
of overtime and, if you do get time, it's the boss who'll control<br>
when you take it. The bill is H.R. 2391. Call 1-800 LABOR-21 and<br>
tell your representative to vote no.<br>
<br>
VETO SIDELINES TEAM -- President Clinton will veto the company<br>
union &quot;TEAM Act&quot; today, scuttling that bill for the rest of this<br>
congressional season. Neither the House nor the Senate passed the<br>
anti-worker legislation with near enough votes -- a two-thirds<br>
majority -- to overcome a veto.<br>
<br>
FAT CATS LOSE -- What do you call a bill that lets rich fat<br>
cats give even more big political donations, halves what worker-<br>
financed political action committees can give and attacks unions,<br>
too? If you're Newt Gingrich, you call it &quot;campaign finance<br>
reform.&quot; But this bill was so outrageously weighted to the wealthy<br>
it fell 259-162 last week. It also would have scrapped current<br>
rules that allow union members to seek dues refunds for non-<br>
collective bargaining expenses and force unions to obtain annual<br>
written permission from every member to engage in spending around<br>
national policy issues.<br>
<br>
NLRB TO GROUP HOMES, &quot;YOU'RE BAD&quot; -- AFSCME's fight for group<br>
home workers in Michigan scored big last week when the NLRB upheld<br>
the union's charges that four home operators refused to bargain in<br>
good faith. The union has prepared similar charges against 35 other<br>
operators.<br>
<br>
ORGANIZING PAYS OFF AGAIN -- In Orlando, Fla., last week, SEIU<br>
Local 750 won the right to represent workers at National Car Rental<br>
on a 38-18 vote. Two Chicago janitor units at CHA properties also<br>
overwhelmingly said yes to SEIU. The votes were 26-0 at Rockwell<br>
properties and 18-2 at Near North Gardens.<br>
<br>
GHOST OF McCARTHY -- A la 1950s Communist witch hunts, the<br>
House Republican leadership is engaging in &quot;an ugly and gross abuse<br>
of government authority . . . the latest chapter in the organized<br>
smear campaign against union leaders,&quot; AFL-CIO President John J.<br>
Sweeney said. Republicans on the House Judiciary subcommittee<br>
staged a show hearing last week on the Laborers' 1995 agreement<br>
with the Justice Department to institute reforms, complete with a<br>
witness behind a screen. The mystery guest has previously testified<br>
publicly, his identity is common knowledge and he has sold info to<br>
the government and tabloids -- but the GOP lauded his credibility.<br>
The hearings &quot;are a naked political payback -- conducted at<br>
taxpayer expense -- to try to punish all of America's unions for<br>
telling it like it is on Medicare, tax cuts for the rich and the<br>
minimum wage,&quot; Sweeney said.<br>
<br>
FRESH, NOT TOXIC -- A fight started with a 1989 AFL-CIO<br>
lawsuit calling for the banning on fresh foods of pesticides<br>
suspected of causing cancer is coming to a successful end. Already<br>
such agents are banned from processed foods, but a House-passed<br>
bill would apply uniform standards to fresh and processed foods. It<br>
also creates higher standards for certain foods and chemicals that<br>
affect children and calls for screening for chemicals that raise<br>
the risk of breast cancer.<br>
<br>
COOK IS SEIU FAMILY AFFAIR -- A two-year fight for dignity and<br>
decent wages by the Service Employees at Cook Family Foods ended<br>
when the workers ratified a new contract. The agreement doubles<br>
current pay levels, exceeding industry standards, the union said.<br>
While the contract does not include a union shop clause, some 188<br>
of the 200 workers who voted in the election joined the union.<br>
<br>
WELD WEDDED TO CORPORATE CASH -- Republican Massachusetts Gov.<br>
William Weld's campaign for the U.S. Senate gets big money from<br>
corporations that have locked out, laid off and cut the wages of<br>
Massachusetts working families, Federal Election Commission reports<br>
reveal. This is &quot;nothing short of a betrayal of the commonwealth's<br>
working men and women,&quot; charged Massachusetts AFL-CIO President<br>
Joseph Faherty. The PAC contributors include Commomwealth Energy<br>
Systems, Kmart, Browning-Ferris Industries and AT&amp;T. In several<br>
cases when the workers have requested Weld's help in keeping local<br>
jobs or maintaining wage and benefit levels, he has refused to act.<br>
<br>
JANITORS MAY STRIKE -- San Francisco janitors may turn up the<br>
heat and strike if negotiations with the Building Owners and<br>
Managers Association do not improve by July 31, when the union's<br>
contract expires. BOMA wants to dismantle the union hiring hall,<br>
reduce health and welfare coverage and eliminate seniority hiring<br>
rights. Meanwhile, SEIU Local 82, which heads up Justice for<br>
Janitors in the nation's capital, unveiled its World Wide Web site<br>
called Toxin Watch. The site includes information on toxic spills,<br>
releases and other environmental problems of select oil, gas, and<br>
chemical companies. The web address is http//www.seiu.org/local/82-<br>
dc/toxin.htm.<br>
<br>
NO TALKS BEFORE RESTORATION -- Steelworkers President George<br>
Becker is willing to meet anywhere, anytime to settle the two-year<br>
strike against Bridgestone/Firestone, but only if replaced workers<br>
are returned to work. Becker's statement was in response to reports<br>
that in a meeting with Rev. Jesse Jackson, Bridgestone officials<br>
said they wanted to meet with Becker and that Becker should be<br>
involved in future negotiations.<br>
<br>
SHELL'S NIGERIAN CONNECTIONS SLAMMED -- More than 200 trade<br>
unionists demonstrated in front of a Shell gasoline station in<br>
support of Nigerian Oil Workers during the Service Employees Civil<br>
and Human Rights Conference in Washington last weekend. Several<br>
leaders and members of the Nigerian Oil Workers have been<br>
imprisoned by the Nigerian government. SEIU President Andy Stern<br>
and Arthur Onovrian of the Oil Workers Union of Nigeria spoke at<br>
the conference.<br>
<br>
NEW HAND ON THE THROTTLE -- Delegates at the Locomotive<br>
Engineers' elected Clarence Monin president by a 320-276 margin. He<br>
served five years as first vice president and alternate president<br>
before defeating incumbent Ronald McLaughlin for the top spot. A<br>
third candidate, Paul Morrison, received 23 votes. Also at the<br>
Detroit convention last week, a thousand members, officers and<br>
family members showed support for striking Free Press and Detroit<br>
News workers and raised $20,000 to help out the strikers and their<br>
families.<br>
<br>
COMMUNITY SERVICES CONFAB -- A mini town hall meeting on youth<br>
and unions and a solidarity court and rally for the Detroit<br>
newspaper strikers are on the agenda for this week's AFL-CIO<br>
Community Services Conference in Dearborn, Mich. Speakers include<br>
AFL-CIO President Sweeney and Executive Vice President Linda<br>
Chavez-Thompson. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) is to receive the<br>
Murray-Green-Meany-Kirkland Award.<br>
<br>
BE&amp;K AWARD REVERSED -- A $20 million lower court award against<br>
the Carpenters and the Paperworkers was reversed by the 8th U.S.<br>
Circuit Court of Appeals. BE&amp;K, a nonunion construction firm based<br>
in Birmingham, Ala., alleged that the unions conspired to have the<br>
company removed from a paper mill construction project.<br>
<br>
WORK OK'D FOR TEENS -- Teen-age workers could be allowed to<br>
load cardboard paper balers in use at most grocery stores that meet<br>
American National Standards Institute prescriptions under a measure<br>
approved by the Senate July 17. The House passed a similar bill<br>
last fall. The Food and Commercial Workers, which had fought a<br>
similar measure, signed on to the Senate bipartisan compromise<br>
bill.<br>
<br>
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL -- NOT! -- San Francisco's Economic<br>
Opportunity Council says no to economic opportunity. California<br>
Professional Employees, an affiliate of the Painters, represents<br>
council workers and has been attempting to bargain a new contract,<br>
but agency officials refuse to negotiate. The agency also is<br>
fighting union efforts to organize other agency employees. The<br>
union has filed unfair labor practice charges with the National<br>
Labor Relations Board over the negotiations and organizing<br>
roadblocks. The city's Board of Supervisors passed a resolution<br>
supporting the union and its workers.<br>

Heat Wave<br>
<br>
After an uplifting launch in Memphis, the interns on the Union<br>
Summer Southern bus tour got a scary look at what workers face when<br>
they try to organize. In Jackson, an employer intentionally injured<br>
an activist by sideswiping her with his car, grazing her back with<br>
his sideview mirror as she was handbilling at a nursing home. The<br>
interns will travel to Alabama this week where they will learn<br>
organizing techniques and meet with nursing home workers in Mobile.<br>
They will handbill and &quot;blitz&quot; area nursing homes to inform<br>
residents and their families about working conditions.<br>
<br>
Union Summer interns in the Bay Area will spend the week<br>
working on the boycott of the Lafayette Park Hotel and leafleting<br>
at Long's Drug Stores. They also will mail and phonebank to draw<br>
supporters to a rally at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel on July 30,<br>
and conduct house visits for the United Community Workers Campaign.<br>
<br>
After spending Sunday leafleting and protesting at a Brooklyn,<br>
Michigan car race sponsored by Bridgestone/Firestone that was<br>
expected to draw more than 1,000 spectators, one group of Chicago<br>
Union Summer activists will complete their internships -- and a new<br>
group will begin on Wednesday. The new activists will see action<br>
immediately, traveling to Milwaukee Thursday for a Justice for<br>
Janitors event.<br>
<br>
On Monday, Union Summer interns in Los Angeles will see the<br>
fruits of their labor when the state senate transportation<br>
committee holds hearings to investigate truckers' grievances. The<br>
activists have been circulating petitions to gather support for the<br>
truckers, and calling senators to encourage them to attend the<br>
hearing. On Tuesday, the activists will join a major Justice for<br>
Janitors demonstration. On Wednesday, they will educate shoppers<br>
and clothing store managers at area malls about working conditions<br>
in sweatshops that supply major clothing designers.<br>
<br>
San Diego Union Summer activists are meeting with local union<br>
members to encourage them to join the effort to save the eight-hour<br>
work day, increase the minimum wage, and register voters.<br>
<br>
In San Jose, Union Summer interns will spend the week urging<br>
people not to patronize nonunion auto dealers, visiting home health<br>
care workers at their homes, and educating supermarket shoppers<br>
about problems with strawberries due to unsafe working conditions<br>
for strawberry workers.<br>
<br>
Union Summer activists in Watsonville are identifying labor<br>
law violations that affect strawberry workers, including unsanitary<br>
and unsafe working conditions. They are working with paralegals to<br>
file legal notices of violations. Next week, they will go to Teatro<br>
Campesino to learn about Chicano history.<br>
<br>
To accommodate the overwhelming number of Union Summer<br>
activists, a new site has been added and two additional sites will<br>
start up again in August. The new Union Summer site is Puerto<br>
Rico; Union Summer activists will be based in San Juan, but will<br>
work on organizing campaigns across the island. Sites now scheduled<br>
for an additional &quot;wave&quot; of activists are New Orleans and Boston.</p>

<h3>AFL-CIO Work in Progress - July 15, 1996 </h3>
<p><strong>`COMEBACK TIME' _ WORKERS WIN BIG ON CAPITOL HILL</strong> Any doubt that 
working families and their unions are reemerging as a national political force was washed away last 
week by a tide of congressional victories. AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney hailed it as a 
&quot;comeback week for America's working families.&quot; Here's a rundown: </p>
<p><strong>RALLY 'ROUND THE RAISE</strong><br>
The AFL-CIO scored a huge legislative victory when the Senate voted to raise the minimum wage. 
Five GOP senators joined all Democrats in slam-dunking a move to exempt millions of low-wage 
workers from the pay hike. The minimum wage victory came just hours after more than 1,000 
worker activists rallied on the Capitol's steps and lobbied their senators, and after months of TV 
and radio ads by the federation pushing the increase. Showing little grace in defeat, Sen. Don 
Nickles (R-Okla.) threatens to hold up a House/Senate conference on the bill. </p>
<p><strong>TEAM ACT NOT PLAYOFF BOUND</strong><br>
The TEAM Act's fate _ death by veto _ was sealed last week when it squeaked through the 
Senate 53-46, 14 votes short of the number needed to overturn President Clinton's promised veto. 
The company union bill &quot;got a heavy push forward by some of the biggest corporate lawbreakers 
and special-interest seekers in America,&quot; President Sweeney said. But grass-roots action from 
workers and phone and personal lobbying from federation and affiliated staff stymied the GOP's 
hopes for many Democratic defections. </p>
<p><strong>WORKERS, 61; RIGHT-TO-WORK COMMITTEE, 38</strong><br>
Anti-worker forces were on the short end of the lopsided defeat of the national right-to-work (for 
less) bill in the Senate last week. The bill was &quot;intended to punish working families and their unions 
for their new found strength. . . . This bill's defeat is a resounding win over the bully payback tactics 
of this Congress,&quot; Sweeney said. </p>
<p><strong>REPETITIVE VICTORY SYNDROME</strong><br>
In another win, the House stripped away a ban in the Labor/HHS spending bill on federal job 
safety agencies from studying and developing guidelines on repetitive stress injuries. Thirty-five 
Republicans joined 180 Democrats and one independent in voting against the provision. 
Ergonomics-related problems form the fastest-growing category of injuries and illnesses tracked by 
the government; their incidence has increased by 800 percent over the last 10 years. </p>
<p>CLCs RISE AND SHINE _ More than 200 representatives from AFLCIO central labor councils 
nationwide gathered in Denver last week for the first Central Labor Conference. &quot;The future of the 
labor movement depends far more on what CLCs do than what we do in Washington,&quot; President 
Sweeney said. AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson and labor 
commentator Jim Hightower also addressed the gathering. Much of the activity occurred in 
workshops on organizing, the role of CLCs, strategies, activities, programs to build membership 
participation, development and Labor `96. </p>
<p>YOU'RE IN ARMEY'S (FACE) NOW _ Rep. Dick Armey (R-Texas), House majority leader 
and rabid union hater, said last week that he &quot;thumbs my nose&quot; at unions. He got a retaliatory 
raspberry back when about two dozen sign-carrying and slogan-chanting union members greeted 
him as he entered the Chamber of Commerce's national headquarters to deliver his standard 
union-bashing drivel to a fundraising breakfast for corporate bosses. A new AFL-CIO report 
documents the GOP's coordinated &quot;big lie&quot; scheme against unions, of which Armey is a main 
architect. </p>
<p>&quot;DAYS OF RAGE&quot; _ On the second anniversary of the Bridgestone/Firestone strike July 13, 
President Sweeney and Steelworkers President George Becker joined more than 2,500 union 
members and supporters for a mass &quot;Days of Rage&quot; rally and concert in Nashville. The 
International Chemical and Energy Workers secretariat also called for a &quot;cyberdemo,&quot; with 
workers bombarding the tire maker's World Wide Web site with protests. Demonstrations of 
solidarity in Turkey and several European and South American countries as well as handbilling by 
union members and Union Summer activists at MasterCare auto service centers, owned by 
Firestone, throughout the United States rounded out the action. </p>
<p>IRVIN UNITES _ Workers at Irvin Aerospace in Red Springs, N.C., voted 2-1 for UNITE 
representation. Issues that motivated workers to organize included low pay, unaffordable health 
insurance and unsafe and unsanitary working conditions. The workers make parachutes for such 
clients as Boeing, McDonnell-Douglas, Lockheed, NASA and the Air Force. </p>
<p>UNION WINS AT RED CROSS _ Red Cross nurses, professionals and technicians at the South 
Jersey-Penn Region of the American Red Cross Blood Services voted to be represented by the 
Hospital Professionals and Allied Employees (HPAE) of the AFT. The victory represents a 
growing trend at Red Cross Blood Services around the country, where 2,000 of the 14,000 
workers are organized. </p>
<p>VICTORY FOR BEVERLY WORKERS _ Service Employees nursing home workers in 
Pennsylvania have won the latest round against Beverly Enterprises Inc., as the National Labor 
Relations Board granted a 10(j) injunction ordering the rehiring of &quot;permanently replaced&quot; strikers. 
An NLRB hearing into unfair labor practice charges centered on the company's anti-worker and 
anti-patient practices begins today. </p>
<p>SPUTTER, SPUTTER, BACKFIRE _ Democratic lawmakers and witnesses turned a Republican 
&quot;show trial&quot; hearing on so-called union corruption on its ear last week. &quot;There has to be a partisan 
Republican attack on labor as the subtext to this hearing,&quot; Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) said. 
DoL Inspector General Charles Martsen pointed to corruption charges that have brought down 
many company managers. One of his assistant IGs also testified that employers can wind up 
&quot;cheating the union and cheating the employee benefit funds.&quot; </p>
<p>NEEDED: A UNION _ Some 24,000 nonunion employees at United Airlines are bound by the 
terms of the 1994 buyout pact negotiated by the carrier and participating unions, the U.S. District 
Court for the 11th Circuit ruled. It ruled that the nonunion workers had no representative whom the 
airline was required to consult in deciding structure and terms of work, giving further credence to 
the notion that every employee needs a union. </p>
<p>APRI CONFERENCE _ Vice President Gore, Labor Secretary Robert Reich and President 
Sweeney will address the A. Philip Randolph Institute's National Education Conference in 
Washington, July 17- 20. The conference, which will include a rally at the National Press Building 
in support of the striking Detroit newspaper workers, features workshops on communicating with 
the media, effective voter participation and special sessions on black church burnings and 
international workers' rights. </p>
<p>UNIONS PROVE METTLE AT OLYMPICS _ When the Olympics open this week in Atlanta, 
the union label will be in many places _ like the Olympic Stadium (built by union labor), and 
communications, transportation, printing, event staging and even the television broadcasts. The 
Communications Workers, Graphic Communications Union, Theatrical Stage Employees, 
Amalgamated Transit Union, CWA's Broadcast Employees, Electrical Workers and Directors 
Guild of America all are involved in the staging of the Games. Two union members will be going for 
the gold _ boxer Lawrence Clay-Bey (AFSCME) and judo athlete Hillary Wolf (Screen Actors). </p>
<p>AND THE WINNER IS IBPAT _ As the Olympic games begin, &quot;Operation Clean Brush&quot; is 
putting the final strokes on more than 250 homes surrounding the competition. The project is a $1.5 
million collaborative effort of the Painters, businesses and the Atlanta government and has allowed 
almost two dozen unemployed or low-skilled Atlanta residents to learn a skill and participate in the 
union's pre-apprenticeship program. </p>
<p>WORKERS CAMPAIGN AGAINST HARASSMENT _ Women's, labor, legal, religious and 
community organizations have pledged their support for legislation in Massachusetts to clarify and 
expand protections for sexual harassment victims. &quot;We stand solidly with those supporting this 
legislation that will serve to hold responsible parties accountable when perpetrators of sexual 
harassment are negligently hired or retained in the workplace,&quot; said Massachusetts AFL-CIO 
President Joseph Faherty. </p>
<p>GIVING AN INCH AND KEEPING A YARD _ The AFL-CIO Metal Trades Department has 
reached agreement with the Naval Sea Systems Command to facilitate a number of work rule 
changes aimed at boosting productivity in the Navy's public shipyards. </p>
<p>SKIP THIS UTILITY BILL _ Legislation introduced in the House to impose restructuring and 
deregulation on electric utilities would threaten American jobs and communities, the Electrical 
Workers say. &quot;We believe that, despite the good intentions of some of its backers, the bill as it 
stands would cause chaos and disruption in an industry already undergoing massive changes,&quot; said 
IBEW President John J. Barry. </p>
<h2>Heat Waves </h2>
<p>This week, Union Summer activists in Akron will visit nursing home workers at their homes, survey 
voters about health insurance, and leaflet at the African American festival and parade. </p>
<p>Bay Area Union Summer interns are supporting HERE boycotts of the Sir Francis Drake and 
Lafayette Park hotels, organizing nonprofit workers in San Francisco, supporting Justice for 
Janitors on an upcoming strike vote, and organizing part-time workers in Richmond. </p>
<p>Union Summer activists at the all-women site in Boston will join a demonstration and information 
blitz with laundry workers outside hospitals this week with UNITE, make house calls to health care 
workers with SEIU in Pittsfield, and register voters with IUE in Lynn. </p>
<p>After riding out Hurricane Bertha, Charleston Union Summer activists are resuming house visits 
with workers of the Melrose Resort (on the island adjacent to Hilton Head) who are fighting for 
their first contract. </p>
<p>After just a week of work, Union Summer interns in Chicago have gathered more than 500 
signatures for the Chicago Jobs and Living Wage campaign. This week they will rally at a Chicago 
City Council Finance Committee hearing to require city contractors to pay their employees at least 
$7.60 per hour. They also will protest a union-busting law firm. </p>
<p>Union Summer interns in Los Angeles will spend the week organizing truckers at the harbor with 
CWA and hotel and restaurant employees in Santa Monica with HERE. </p>
<p>New Orleans Union Summer activists are supporting a raise in the minimum wage in the city to 
$6.00 per hour. On Thursday they will present their petitions to the City Council. </p>
<p>Union Summer interns in New York will picket to support jewelry workers, attend a hearing on a 
dangerous toxin used in drycleaning, and picket a clothing contractor who engages in unfair labor 
practices. They also will help at the Workers' Center, where non-union workers come to air 
grievances and seek legal assistance against employers. </p>
<p>Union Summer activists in St. Louis will join a large organizing meeting with nurses on Friday. They 
also are leafleting and picketing with Justice for Janitors, and canvassing and making house calls 
with AFSCME. </p>
<p>Volunteers recruited by San Diego Union Summer activists have met with more than 1,000 local 
union members. They are working to save the eight-hour work day, increase the minimum wage, 
and register voters. </p>
<p>A new group of Watsonville Union Summer activists will spend their first week interviewing 
strawberry workers to identify health and safety violations in the field. They will circulate a 
questionnaire and take affidavits from workers.</p>

<h2>AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h2>
<p>RALLY FOR WAGES _ More than 1,000 worker activists will swarm over Capitol Hill Tuesday 
morning to tell the Senate to vote for a real minimum wage and give America the raise it needs. The 
workers will join Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
all three top AFL-CIO officers and union presidents at a press conference outside the Capitol. 
Then union leaders and workers will go inside to call on their senators before gathering for a 
minimum wage vote watch in Room 430 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The message: Pass 
Kennedy's version and defeat a version from Sen. Kit Bond (R-Mo.) that denies millions of 
workers the wage hike. The Washington lobbying has been augmented by tremendous back home 
pressure, including tens of thousands of phone calls from union members to their senators. </p>
<p>UNABASHED UNION BASHING _ In retaliation for the AFL-CIO's success in bringing the 
minimum wage increase to the nation's attention through a massive media and grass-roots 
campaign, Republicans will try and muscle the TEAM Act and a national right- to-work (for less) 
bill through the Senate on Wednesday. Again, rank-and-filers and union leaders will lobby senators 
to turn back both bills. You can pitch in too. Call 1-800/96AFL-CIO and tell your senators to vote 
against cloture on the right-to-work bill (S. 1788) and to defeat the TEAM Act (S. 295). You can 
also <a href="http://www.standup.westlake.com/cgi-bin/zipsearchform?letternum=0">send a fax from the Web.</a> </p>
<p>GRASS-ROOTS REVIVAL _ More than 200 delegates will attend the first AFL-CIO Central 
Labor Council conference in Denver July 11- 14. The meeting, bringing together those folks who 
do the work for unions at the local level across the country will include workshops on major 
AFL-CIO campaigns and legislative and political issues. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney will 
address the group on Friday. </p>
<p>BRIDGESTONE/FIRESTONE READY FOR PRIME TIME _ The Steelworkers will observe 
the second anniversary of the company's illegal replacement of 2,300 workers during an unfair 
labor practice strike Saturday with a concert and rally in Nashville, nationwide MasterCare 
leafletting and a 30-minute TV special, &quot;They're running over the American Dream.&quot; The show will

<p>JANITORS' NEW PACT SHINES _ The janitors that clean the California Bay Area's posh 
offices by night capped a four-year struggle for dignity by ratifying &quot;the best agreement in the local's 
history,&quot; said Mike Garcia, president of Service Employees Local 1877. The four-year pact raises 
wages for 5,000 janitors, makes all members eligible for family health benefits by the end of the 
contract term and brings Bay Area janitors under one master agreement. </p>
<p>IAM CLAIMS HARASSMENT _ McDonnell Douglas has illegally spied on and harassed 
Machinists during the course of the month-long strike, the IAM charges in a July 2 complaint to the 
National Labor Relations Board. The company is infringing on the workers' right to strike by 
forcing picketers to march dangerously close to moving traffic, in one case only 10 inches from 
moving cars, the union said. So far, three picketers have been hit by cars. Luckily, none has been 
critically injured. The union also charged that squads from the security company hired by 
McDonnell Douglas, Asset Protection Team, are following strikers in vans, filming them wherever 
they go in hopes of provoking a confrontation </p>
<p>&quot;IT'S HIP TO BE UNION&quot;... according to an article in the July 8 issue of Newsweek that says 
&quot;anger over corporate cutbacks and meager pay hikes is giving the (labor) movement its biggest 
boost in decades.&quot; A new Newsweek poll shows that 62 percent of Americans approve of unions, 
up from 55 percent in 1981. Among people 18 to 29, 68 percent view unions favorably. While the 
time is certainly right for a resurgence in unionism, the article also credited the new leadership of the 
AFL-CIO for stepping up with aggressive legislative and organizing campaigns, including Union 
Summer. </p>
<p>SEIU NOTCHES TWO _ Health care workers at Nord Center, a mental health facility in Lorain, 
Ohio, voted 53-36 for representation in Service Employees Local 1199. SEIU Local 4 in Chicago 
won card check recognition for 85 nursing home workers at Highland Nursing Home and 50 
workers at the Fairmount nursing facility. </p>
<p>YEAR-OLD NEWSPAPER STRIKE GOES GLOBAL _ One year after it began, the Detroit 
newspaper strike has gone global. The Geneva- based Postal, Telegraph and Telephone 
International urged its 223 affiliated unions in 117 countries to support the AFL-CIO's &quot;Don't buy; 
don't advertise&quot; campaign against USA TODAY, the flagship newspaper of Gannett Corp., owner 
of the Detroit News. Some 2,000 employees of the News and Free Press, owned by 
Knight-Ridder, have been on strike since July 13, 1995. Management and imported scabs from 
other papers are producing the newspapers. </p>
<p>NY `HOT GOODS' LAW _ A New York &quot;hot goods&quot; law singed last week will help state law 
enforcement better protect garment workers. It allows inspectors to stop the shipment of 
merchandise made in violation of minimum wage or overtime laws. It also lets the government seek 
back wages and fines against manufacturers that profited from the use of illegal labor. </p>
<p>BUTTON, BUTTON, WHO'S GOT THE BUTTON _ The UAW won a round in its dispute with 
Caterpillar when an administrative law judge upheld the National Labor Relations Board's support 
for the right of the UAW local union 1415 president to wear a protest button directed at Caterpillar 
CEO Don Fites. The button read &quot;Happiness is waking up in the morning and finding Don Fites' 
picture on a milk carton.&quot; </p>
<p>OVERNITE, BUT NOT OVERTIME _ The Teamsters are on the air with radio ads explaining 
how Overnite Transportation Co. has reneged on its promise to pay workers overtime. The 
company promised time-and- a-half for work beyond 47 hours. Now it says only workers willing 
to work at their normal hourly rate will be given work in excess of 47 hours. </p>
<p>SAFETY RULES CROSS THE LINE _ Succumbing to pressure from trucking firms, 
Transportation Department officials have agreed to weaken a truck safety inspection program on 
the Texas-Mexico border. Under the new plan, companies can self-certify that their trucks have no 
safety problems despite DoT findings that 51 percent of the trucks crossing into Texas were found 
too dangerous to operate on U.S. highways. Trucking deregulation is a provision under the North 
American Free Trade Agreement that the Teamsters and several Mexican driver groups want 
renegotiated. </p>
<p>RUNNING ON TIME _ The Machinists, Maintenance of Way Employees, Sheet Metal Workers 
and Transportation Communications Union say recommendations by presidential emergency 
boards, while constructive, fall short for settlements between rail labor and most of the nation's 
large freight railroads. The boards used as a guideline an arbitration decision in a United 
Transportation Union case that combined general wage increases, lump sum payments and a 
cost-of-living adjustment. The unions challenged the carriers to reach an agreement before the 
current 30-day cooling-off period ends. </p>
<p>ILO ACTION _ Despite intense employer opposition, the International Labor Organization 
adopted a new International Convention on Home Work. The three-pronged approach seeks to 
establish international labor standards for the increasingly precarious nature of work resulting from 
economic globalization. The ILO also spotlighted Nigeria for its widespread disregard of freedom 
of association, Burma once again for its use of forced labor, and Iran for discrimination in 
employment due to gender and religion. </p>
<p>ONE BIG SONGBOOK _ The workers' choir at Whiteville Apparel in Greensboro, N.C., has 
produced a tape of its gospel and labor music. The choir is made up of members of UNITE Local 
1077 and sang at UNITE's founding convention. The tapes are available for $10 from UNITE, 
1010 Tucker St., Greensboro, N.C. 27405. The money raised will be used for the union's political 
action fund. </p>
<p>GO SEE CIO EXHIBIT _ The American Labor Museum/Botto House National Landmark in 
Haledon, N.J., has developed an exhibit commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Congress of 
Industrial Organizations. The exhibit, &quot;The Birth and Formative Years of the CIO in New Jersey,&quot; 
covering the years 1935-1961, will be on display at the Labor Museum July 6 through Sept. 21. 
For more information, call 201/595-7953. The New Jersey Historical Commission provided 
assistance to the project. </p>
<h2>Heat Wave -- July 8, 1996</h2>
<p>A new crop of Union Summer activists, <em>all women,</em> arrive in Akron this week. They will leaflet 
with SCORE (Summit County Organizing for Rights and Equality) for living wages, health care for 
all, a voice on the job and corporate accountability. </p>
<p>Also all women this month, Boston Union Summer interns will organize hospital and health care 
workers in western Massachusetts, work with UNITE! to organize laundry workers in Boston, and 
rally in support of state legislation to give women three years (rather than six months) to report 
sexual harassment or rape that occurs on the job. </p>
<p>Charleston Union Summer activists spent the weekend demonstrating at a 5K running race and 
using guerilla theater at the Melrose Club resort and the Hyatt Hotel to focus attention on unfair 
labor practices by the hospitality industry in Hilton Head. </p>
<p>The second wave of Union Summer interns began work in Chicago this weekend. They will leaflet 
at Sears and Firestone stores to support the Bridgestone/Firestone boycott, visit nursing home 
workers at their homes, and gather signatures for the living wage campaign. </p>
<p>In Detroit, Union Summer activists will join a demonstration next Saturday to mark the first 
anniversary of the Detroit newspaper strike. The event will bring together union members from 
across the state at North Plant, the paper_s largest distribution plant. </p>
<p>Union Summer interns in Nashville are planning demonstrations for the second anniversary of the 
Bridgestone/Firestone strike this Friday and Saturday, July 12-13. They will meet President 
Sweeney on Saturday before he speaks at the big rally. On Tuesday, they will host a Clergy Prayer 
Breakfast for Justice at Vanderbilt University_s chapel. They will also leaflet businesses in Century 
City, where the Bridgestone/Firestone corporate office is located. </p>
<p>New Orleans Union Summer activists are gathering signatures of registered voters to raise the 
minimum wage in the city to $6.00 per hour. They also are supporting efforts to organize hospitality 
industry workers. </p>
<p>Working with UNITE!, New York Union Summer interns are supporting a retailer accountability 
campaign through community outreach and store visits. They will focus on the role retailers play in 
exploiting garment workers. </p>
<p>Twenty-five Union Summer activists in Sacramento will support the Justice for Janitors campaign, 
visit health care workers at their homes, and work on the boycotts against the Hyatt Regency and 
the Beverly Garland hotels. In addition to college students, Sacramento interns include a teacher, a 
single mother, and a woman whose grandfather started a union. </p>
<p>St. Louis Union Summer activists will leaflet with leather goods workers, organize for AFSCME's 
first contract campaign at Beverly Farm in Godfrey, Illinois, and picket with striking McDonnell 
Douglas workers. </p>

<h2>AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h2>
<p>ON THE AIR AGAIN - AFL-CIO television and radio ads that began airing June 27 in 19 
congressional districts slam cuts in Medicare proposed by House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) 
and ask lawmakers to vote against them. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney accused the GOP of 
&quot;double talk in saying they're slowing the growth of Medicare - not cutting.&quot; The ads ask listeners to 
call their lawmakers (1-800/96AFL-CIO) and urge them &quot;not to destroy Medicare - and tell them, 
this time, we're listening.&quot; The federation is also airing minimum wage ads in 11 districts to gin up 
pressure on senators when the bill hits the floor after the July 4 recess. In a letter to union 
presidents, Sweeney warned that tough fights also loom against the so-called TEAM Act and 
national &quot;right-to-work&quot; bill. </p>
<p>THEY CAN RACE, BUT THEY CAN'T HIDE - The <a href="http://www.uaw.org/">UAW </a>and GM Saturn joined the 
Steelworkers' &quot;Don't Buy&quot; campaign against Bridgestone/Firestone by agreeing to allow customers 
of new Saturns to replace, at Saturn's expense, any Firestone tires with another union-made brand. 
The union also warned the tire maker that Saturn may drop Firestone as its exclusive tire when 
contracts expire in 1997. Some 500 USWA members dropped the &quot;Black Flag,&quot; the traditional 
symbol for disqualification, on Bridgestone/Firestone at the Cleveland Medic Drug Grand Prix over 
the weekend. USWA President George Becker also announced a series of worldwide 
demonstrations at the company's plants worldwide next week to commemorate the second 
anniversary of the company's illegal replacement of 2,300 workers during an unfair labor practices 
strike. The union also will run a 30-minute TV program in 20 cities exposing the company's 
activities. </p>
<p>UNION SUMMER ON HILTON HEAD - Union Summer activists descend on the resort village 
of Hilton Head, S.C., this July 4th weekend as part of the drive to organize the low-wage workers 
who toil in the high-priced hotels. Activists plan to carry union signs as they run and walk in the 
Firecracker 5K race. See Union Summer Heat Wave below. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.afscme.org/">AFSCME </a>LOOKS SHARP - Nearly two-thirds of the registered nurses at seven Sharp 
Healthcare facilities throughout the San Diego area voted for representation with AFSCME's 
United Nurses Associations of California. The union has its work cut out: Sharp is in the process of 
being acquired by the anti-union Columbia HCA, the nation's largest for-profit hospital chain. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.teamster.org/">IBT </a>MAKES GRADE - By an almost 2-1 margin (1,129-568) classified supervisors in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District said yes to Teamsters' representation. &quot;Before we had no voice 
and the school district bureaucracy would just ignore our suggestions and complaints,&quot; said Lupe 
Ramirez, area bus supervisor for the district. &quot;Now, with the Teamsters we can be sure to have a 
say in the future of our work, our schools, and the children we serve.&quot; </p>
<p>HOT DOG - Workers at Thornapple Valley, makers of Wilson franks and hot dogs, voted to be 
represented by the Electronic Workers. The 220 member unit in Forrest City, Ark., will be 
chartered as Local 1108. </p>
<p>VICTORY IS SWEET - Agreements were reached last week in three major disputes. Striking and 
locked-out Food and Commercial Workers in Denver and other Colorado towns are back on the 
job after ratifying a new three-year contract with King Soopers and Safeway. The pact, covering 
some 14,000 members of Local 7, includes wage increases and boosts in health and pension 
benefits and job protection. Consumer pressure and worker solidarity helped end the dispute. 
Some 1,200 Paperworkers, locked out since January by Trailmobile in Charleston, Ill., were voting 
Monday on a tentative pact hammered out after an international campaign for justice. And San 
Francisco Bay area janitors, some 5,000 members of SEIU Local 1877, are voting this week on a 
deal to end their four weeks of rolling strikes against offices and high-tech firms that subcontract for 
janitorial work. </p>
<p>POST IT - Thousands of <a href="http://www.apwu.org/">Postal Workers</a> were picketing postal facilities across the country July 1 
to alert the public to attempts to privatize the U.S. Postal Service, problems of postal 
mismanagement and other threats to continued quality service. The demonstrations were held on 
the 25th anniversary of the founding of the union and the creation of USPS as an independent 
agency. </p>
<p>WORK AT ART - Tens of thousands of jobs are in jeopardy, and millions of others could be 
affected, if the GOP is able to kill funding for the Institute of Museum Services, the National 
Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts are successful, unions 
representing these professional employees say. Trade unionists are urged to press Congress for 
funding for those programs as requested by the White House. </p>
<p>PLANE FIGHT CONTINUES - In the first bargaining session since the strike began June 5, 
Machinists and McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis resumed bargaining June 27 under the auspices of 
the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. IAM District 837 members have denounced the 
hiring of replacement workers and the transfer of work to other plants or subcontractors since the 
strike began. In a tragic sidelight to the strike, a Navy F/A-18C Hornet fighter crashed June 19 
outside a St. Louis suburb after having major repair work done by white-collar supervisors at the 
plant. A cause of the crash has not been determined. </p>
<p>NYC HOSPITALS FORCE STRIKE - About 7,500 Service Employee Local 144 health care 
workers are on strike against 13 New York City hospitals and nursing homes. They walked out 
June 24 when management refused to budge from their proposal for a one-year wage freeze, a 
two-tier wage scale and reduced sick leave. The local is a broad spectrum of workers from 
housekeepers to X-ray technicians - who had been working without a contract since the previous 
pact expired seven months ago. Bargaining resumed June 27. The union has set up a strike hotline: 
1-800/875-4219. </p>
<p>TAKE TIME FOR THE FAMILY - The AFL-CIO applauded President Clinton's plan to expand 
the Family and Medical Leave Act by granting up to 24 hours a year for children's school activities 
and family medical needs, urging Clinton to go further and expand FMLA to cover workers in firms 
smaller than the current 50-employee threshold. But unions rejected Clinton's proposal to relax the 
Fair Labor Standards Act overtime provisions. Even worse, a House committee last week 
approved a GOP-backed bill that gives employers the right to offer compensatory time instead of 
paid overtime. With lax employee protections, workers could be forced to give up their overtime. </p>
<p>RETIREES SEEK SLICE OF PIE - Union workers who gave their all for GE rallied June 24 in 
two dozen locations nationwide for a bigger share of the company's overfunded pension plan. The 
15 GE unions in the Coordinated Bargaining Committee said even if pensions were doubled, the 
fund still would have a surplus. Under a negotiated agreement, the company and employees 
contribute to the pension fund - but GE's investments have been so profitable the company hasn't 
put a penny toward the fund since 1987. </p>
<p>DON'T PARK HERE - Oglebay Park in Wheeling, W.Va., has been added to the AFL-CIO 
boycott list at the request of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees. More than 80 
percent of the workers at park voted for HERE representation but the Wheeling Park Commission 
has harassed, fired and intimidated supporters and refuses to recognize the union. </p>
<p>NO MERIT IN BUFFALO - Thousands of Buffalo trade unionists rallied June 24 against Merit 
Construction Alliance, which is trying to impose lower wages and 12-hour workdays, withdraw 
health benefits and create unsafe working conditions on Buffalo-area trades workers. The company 
also has waged a lie-filled $200,000 advertising campaign against the Buffalo Building and 
Construction Trades Council. </p>
<p>NY TEACHERS INK AGREEMENT - New York City teachers and other educational 
employees approved a five-year contract seven months after rejecting an earlier offer. The deal 
increases wages for members of AFT's United Federation of Teachers by 13 percent over term 
and guarantees job security for union members until 1998. </p>
<p>COMBATTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT - The UAW will offer intensive training sessions for 
100 local union officials to heighten workers' awareness of sexual harassment at the Mitsubushi 
Motor Manufacturing plant in Normal, Ill. The UAW also has proposed a joint union-company 
comprehensive sexual harassment awareness program involving virtually the entire Mitsubishi work 
force. Meanwhile, U.S. and Japanese women's groups protested June 27 outside the company's 
shareholders meeting in Tokyo. </p>
<p>UNSAFE AT ANY BORDER - Most trucks entering the United States from Mexico are not 
inspected and almost half the small number that are have dangerous safety problems, a new report 
from the U.S. Department of Transportation says. With NAFTA boosting the number of Mexican 
trucks on U.S. highways, serious accidents will occur, the Teamsters charged. Only about 2 
percent of trucks crossing the border were inspected between December 1995 and March 1996, 
but nearly half of the 12,462 trucks inspected were taken out of service because of dangerous 
safety violations. </p>
<p>FOUL BALLS - Foul Ball is an organization aiming to end the exploitation of kids in the soccer 
ball industry in Pakistan. Labor Secretary Robert Reich attended the group's kickoff to keep 
Pakistani children from stitching soccer balls. He later opened hearings to report on the U.S. 
garment industry's efforts to monitor the use of child labor in products imported from other 
countries. Anne Knipper of the AFL-CIO was among those who testified. </p>
<h2>Heat Wave -- July 2, 1996</h2>
<p>A new crop of Union Summer activists arrived in Charleston, S.C., this weekend. They will 
accompany hotel and restaurant workers to their jobs in Hilton Head and picket hotels in the 
continuing effort to unionize the resort hotels in the city. </p>
<p>In Los Angeles, activists continue their voter registration drive and their efforts to organize home 
health care workers and the local supermarket chain, Superior Markets. This weekend they joined 
a Hotel and Restaurant Employees' picket of a nonunion restaurant at Los Angeles International 
Airport. </p>
<p>Every day this week, Union Summer activists in Nashville will picket and leaflet Mastercare centers 
owned by Bridgestone/Firestone. They are organizing a massive action on July 12, the second 
anniversary of the USWA's labor dispute with Bridgestone Inc. </p>
<p>In just two weeks, San Diego Union Summer activists have already met with more than 150 union 
members. This week they will organize precinct walks and community meetings in support of the 
eight-hour day, the minimum wage initiative and San Diego Needs a Raise. </p>
<p>Seattle Union Summer activists finished out their internships with two rallies. Over 300 interns, 
Teamsters and supporters conducted a mass picket at the regional headquarters of Browning- 
Ferris Industries in nearby Bellevue. They raised a deafening roar by using garbage can lids as 
symbols, forcing BFI's top manager to come out of the plant. A 20-year-old Union Summer activist 
handed the official a mountain of petitions containing over 10,000 signatures calling for BFI to 
respect both their workers and the environment. Earlier in the day, a similar-sized group stormed 
the University of Washington's administration building and occupied it temporarily while SEIU 
District 925 members presented the school's chief negotiator demands for a fair and equitable 
contract. </p>
<p>In Watsonville, Union Summer activists continue their work on the strawberry campaign. This week 
they will lead delegations of farm workers to local supermarkets to educate store managers about 
working conditions in the strawberry fields. They will also meet with Dolores Huerta of the United 
Farm Workers, and tour the UFW headquarters. </p>
<p>Next week, Union Summer starts up in three new locations - New Orleans, New York and 
Sacramento. A second wave of internships begins in Akron, Boston, Chicago, Detroit and St. 
Louis. The San Diego internship continues. And the first of three internships in Watsonville, Calif., 
comes to an end. Thus, young activists will be walking the pavement and talking to workers in 10 
cities across the country. </p>

<h2 align="center">AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h2>
<p>NO CHEERS FOR NEWT -- Compelling evidence that America Needs a
Raise came in Boston June 18 as the AFL-CIO completed a series of
29 town hall meetings focusing on the challenges facing American
workers. Down the street, House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and
two Massachusetts GOP congressmen were attending a $1,000-a-plate
dinner with their corporate backers, so AFL-CIO
Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka posted an oversized letter in
front of TV's Cheers tavern, inviting the House members &quot;to
give up that dinner and come to listen to Boston's working
families.&quot; </p>
<p>GOP MUZZLE -- &quot;Congress has entered the silly
season,&quot; said Rep. Matthew Martinez (D-Calif.) at a hearing
on a bill designed to muzzle labor's political voice. GOP leaders
claim their concern is the rights of union members, but
&quot;anyone who believes that should have their head
examined,&quot; Martinez said. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
said the hearings weren't called &quot;to examine the right of
union members to spend part of their dues money on issue-based
political education. They were called as part of an orchestrated
assault on America's unions for our new vigilance and vitality on
behalf of U.S. working families.&quot; </p>
<p>PSST...WANNA BUY AN ELECTION? -- Despite anguished wails from
GOP leaders about labor's political education efforts, businesses
and their allies far outspend worker groups, according to a new
Federal Election Commission Report. The FEC found that so far in
the 1995-96 campaign cycle, big business has given almost four
times as much to candidates as all of labor. The majority of
business contributions -- some $46.3 million -- went to
Republicans. </p>
<p>SUMMER BREEZE -- <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/usummer">Union
Summer</a> activists helping to organize women in the Akron,
Ohio, area, were urged to spread the good news about unions to
coalition groups who share unions' concerns about the plight of
working families. Karen Nussbaum, director of the federation's
Working Women's Department, visited the Akron Union Summer
contingent, an all-female group, on June 20. See the Union Summer
&quot;Heat Waves&quot; update on Page 3. </p>
<p>REMEMBER IN NOVEMBER -- Government employees from around the
country are set to &quot;Rally for Action&quot; on the U.S.
Capitol's West Steps Wednesday. The rally's focus is jobs, health
care, OSHA &quot;reform&quot; and other issues. It is part of
AFGE's &quot;Remember in November&quot; political action
campaign. AFGE President John Sturdivant, AFL-CIO
Secretary-Treasurer Trumka and several Democratic and Republican
lawmakers will speak. Vice President Gore is scheduled to address
the union's legislative conference on Tuesday. </p>

<h2 align="center">AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h2>
<h3 align="center">June 18, 1996</h3>
<p>HAVE YOU BARGAINED WITH A FORD LATELY? _ The UAW opened
bargaining with the first of the Big Three automakers June 10
when it sat down with Ford Motor Co., but UAW President Steve
Yokich refused to begin the ceremony until a reporter from USA
Today left the room. USA Today is the flagship publication of
Gannett, the owner of the struck Detroit News. Talks opened June
11 with Chrysler and June 12 with General Motors. Contracts for
about 400,000 hourly workers expire Sept. 14. </p>
<p>SENATE STALLS ON WAGES _ New, more conservative Senate leaders
have yet to say how they plan to deal with the House-passed
minimum wage bill. But they are expected to strike back at
labor's success through anti-worker amendments and companion
bills. If Republicans do not schedule a vote soon, Democrats warn
they will try to attach the pay raise to every bill that moves to
the Senate floor. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney told union
presidents the federation may go back on the air with minimum
wage ads targeted at House members who voted no and at senators
who warrant pressure. </p>
<p>STATES MOVE ON WAGES _ On the state and city level, pay raise
measures are moving. Delaware and Vermont passed laws increasing
the minimum wage. The California living wage initiative garnered
enough signatures to get a place on the fall ballot. And just
days after President Sweeney urged Colorado Gov. Roy Romer to
veto a bill denying a place on the ballot to minimum wage
initiatives issues, Romer killed the bill. Living wage drives are
under way in Boston, Chicago and Denver. </p>
<p>DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL _ New York's WBAI-FM begins broadcasting
&quot;Union Summer Radio Show&quot; on July 1. The hour-long show
will highlight the campaign and its activists, and will be made
available to other public radio stations throughout the country.
See updates on the Union Summer Heat Waves on page 3. </p>
<p>HOW GRIM IS MY (SILICON) VALLEY? _ Imelda, a Mexican
immigrant, told the AFL-CIO's San Jose, Calif., town hall meeting
June 11 that workers like her need a raise. Imelda used to
provide care for an 82-year-old woman who lives by herself. But
earning only $4.25 an hour for just a few hours a day, the
eight-months- pregnant mother of one could not afford day care
for her daughter and is now out of work. &quot;When I used to
take care of this woman, my work reflected compassion and
quality, but this doesn't seem to mean anything in the labor
market,&quot; she said. In Atlanta last week, workers sang
&quot;My job lies over the ocean&quot; to the tune of &quot;My
Bonnie Lies . . .&quot; And in Pittsburgh, ebullient workers
joined the America Needs a Raise chorus. The final scheduled
event is this week in Boston. </p>
<p>KEEP 'EM FLYING _ Pilots at Southern Air Transport voted for
Teamsters representation, capping a three-year effort. The
workers fly cargo worldwide, including into &quot;hot spots&quot;
for the U.S. military. Meanwhile, at Phoenix-based America West
Airlines, stock clerks filed IBT authorization cards, following
the lead of the airline's mechanics who voted for the IBT in
April. </p>
<p>TRASHING THE GREEDY _ As janitors and their supporters rallied
around the country June 12, Justice for Janitors Day, more than
5,000 janitors in the San Francisco Bay Area prepared for their
third week of &quot;rolling&quot; strikes. Talks continue between
SEIU Local 1877 and eight contract cleaning firms. On Father's
Day, June 16, the janitors held a candlelight vigil and speakout
at the home of Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers, one the largest
clients of Acme, which refuses to negotiate a fair deal. The June
12 observance also called attention to &quot;America's Top
Trash&quot; companies _ nonunion cleaning companies that refuse
to pay decent wages. The 1996 nominees are Hewlett-Packard,
Contract Cleaning Inc., Marine Midland Bank, DQE Inc., University
of South Carolina, Tri-C Community College, Lawrence Lui, City of
Hartford, P&amp;R Enterprises Inc., Creative Building Maintenance
and Koll Real Estate Services. </p>
<p>FIGHTING BACK IN ST. LOUIS _ AFL-CIO President Sweeney joins
Machinists on the picket line at McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis
Tuesday, emphasizing that the IAM members are holding the line
for the entire labor movement. The workers face outrageous
company antics _ temporary replacement workers, increased
subcontracting and a proposal to grant workers one wage increase
in the next four years. IAM District 837 notes that McDonnell
Douglas has $770 million in after-tax profits and a
one-quarter-billion-dollar surplus in its pension fund, but
refuses to bargain additional raises and health care cost
reductions for future retirees. </p>
<p>HILLARY, DETROIT STRIKERS MEET _ First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton met with 16 Detroit newspaper strikers last week. The
strikers urged that the Justice Department investigate blatant
violations of the joint operating agreement during the 11-month
strike of the Detroit News and Detroit Free Press. The JOA
governs business practices of the two scab newspapers. </p>
<p>TITHING FOR ORGANIZING _ Communications Workers meeting in
convention in Detroit last week passed a constitutional amendment
requiring the union to devote 10 percent of resources to
organizing. They endorsed the Clinton-Gore presidential ticket,
and heard President Morton Bahr promise &quot;the most vigorous,
energetic and effective political action program that CWA has
ever waged.&quot; </p>
<p>AFSCME IN ACTION _ The November elections loom importantly for
more than 4,000 delegates gathered in Chicago this week at
AFSCME's 32nd convention. &quot;What's at stake is whether
America will be country where every family can get ahead and no
worker is ever left behind, or whether it will be a nation where
only a few make to the top while the rest of us are left to fight
it out on the bottom,&quot; AFSCME President Gerald McEntee told
the delegates. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and Executive Vice
President Linda Chavez- Thompson also will address the
convention. Get up-to-the-minute coverage of the convention
on-line by going to the AFSCME home page: http:\\www.afscme.org </p>
<p>SHUTTING DOWN FOR ELECTION DAY '96 _ The Service Employees
will put the power of their people behind the power of their
political convictions, shutting down headquarters for the final
two weeks before the November election to facilitate the full
participation of officers, members and staff in this year's
critical elections. SEIU is asking its members to pledge to work
five days between now and November on the national, state or
local level. </p>
<p>IT'S A WRAP AT REYNOLDS _ Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers
and Steelworkers have ratified six-year contracts with Reynolds
Metals Co. and the Aluminum Company of America, covering more
than 16,000 workers. The agreements increase wages, pension
benefits and job security. </p>
<p>NO TO TRAILMOBILE _ Paperworkers locked out by Trailmobile
Corp. in Charleston, Ill., rejected the latest contract offer by
an 80 percent margin. The company was trying to extend for three
years a wage freeze that has been in effect for nearly four
years. UPIU Local 7951 members also objected to provisions having
the union drop all pending National Labor Relations Board charges
and the local's president apologize for the union's bargaining
strategy. </p>
<p>A LITTLE JINGLE IN THE JEANS _ UNITE, which represents workers
at Levi Strauss &amp; Co., praised the jeans maker's plan to
offer a year's salary as a bonus to all of its 37,600 workers
worldwide, if the company meets its cash flow target by the end
of its 2001 fiscal year. &quot;It is entirely appropriate that a
company as successful and progressive as Levi Strauss &amp; Co.
share the gains of its success with the workers who have helped
make it all possible,&quot; said UNITE President Jay Mazur. </p>
<p>NOT KIDS STUFF _ President Sweeney urged the International
Labor Organization to adopt a convention to ban child labor
&quot;in its most dangerous, degrading and exploitative
forms.&quot; Addressing a ministerial conference June 12 in
Geneva, Switzerland, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich also called
for an end to child labor abuses. </p>
<p>BRAZIL NEEDS A RAISE _ The AFL-CIO has thrown its support
behind a June 21 general strike called by International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) Brazilian affiliates _
CUT, Forca Sindical and CGT. In Washington, the demonstration
runs from noon to 1 p.m. at the Brazilian Embassy, 3006
Massachusetts Ave. N.W. Others events are set at Brazilian
consulates in Boston, Los Angeles, Miami and San Francisco. </p>
<p>A NEW DEAL _ Union Privilege selected Household International
to take over the Union Privilege credit card program from The
Bank of New York. President Sweeney said the agreement &quot;will
provide great benefits to our members and give a tremendous boost
to the AFL-CIO and its unions in our efforts to revitalize the
labor movement.&quot; The program will continue to offer a credit
card at a rate well below the national average and will add new
types of cards to meet the needs of more union members. An added
bonus: Household has committed to protecting the rights of
workers to organize. </p>
<p>UNITE PRESSES PEERLESS SUITS _ More than 200 UNITE members
marched on a Gaithersburg, Md., Hecht's department store in
support of workers at Peerless. The mostly immigrant workers at
the Montreal factory of one of North America's largest makers of
men's suits, suffer low wages, sexual harassment and unfair
hiring and firing. The store's managers got so frazzled they
locked out shoppers along with the protesters. </p>
<p>DON'T BOOK EM' DANO _ If you're traveling to Hawaii, call
ahead and ask the hotel if it has a signed union contract. Some
12,000 Longshoremen and Warehousemen have been working without a
contract for nearly a year. The hotels include the Hilton
Waikoloa, the Sheraton Orchid at Mauna Lani and Kauai Resort,
which is on the AFL-CIO boycott list. </p>
<p>BRIEFS:<br>
Union Summer activists in Akron will meet with Karen Nussbaum,
director of the AFL-CIO Working Women's Department, on Thursday
to discuss women in unions. Nussbaum will also speak at an
evening community forum. </p>
<p>During their last week in Boston, activists will protest at a
hearing on hospital privatization, visit city council districts
to generate support for laundry workers, and join a rally for
immigrant workers' rights. </p>
<p>In Denver, as part of a Justice For Janitors campaign,
activists helped force a cleaning contractor to recognize the
union. This week, they will protest at a Metro Waste Water
Reclamation District meeting in support of employees who have not
had a contract in two years. They will also join truck drivers to
picket a local five-star hotel. </p>
<p>Motor City Union Summer will wrap up this week as activists
organize citywide demonstrations at 150 nonunion drug stores, and
leaflet neighborhoods to support striking newspaper workers. </p>
<p>Georgia Union Summer activists will hold a rally following a
city council hearing to protest hospital privatization. </p>
<p>In Los Angeles, Union Summer will kickoff with a drive to
organize home health care workers. Activists will also picket a
nonunion hotel and conduct house calls to unionize a local
supermarket. </p>
<p>St. Louis activists will continue to protest unfair labor
practices in the riverboat gambling industry and will begin
organizing home health care workers. </p>
<p>Union Summer also begins in San Diego this week, where
activists will focus on the campaign to keep the eight-hour day,
the minimum wage initiative and San Diego Needs a Raise. </p>
<p>Last week in San Jose, Union Summer activists turned out more
than 1,000 workers for the city's America Needs a Raise rally.
This week they continue their activities supporting striking
janitors. </p>
<p>Seattle Union Summer activists will join a letter carriers'
picket to protest new national postal policies, and sit in on the
King County Labor Council meeting to hear about area union
campaigns. </p>
<p>After a week of intensive training on the California Labor
Relations Law, Union Summer law student activists in Watsonville
continue to work to expose violations of the strawberry pickers'
legal rights. More Union Summer activists will hit Watsonville
this week to go into the fields to talk with and organize
workers. </p>

<h2 align="center">AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h2>
<h3 align="center">June 11, 1996</h3>
<p>THE WORD ON THE STREET -- Main Street came to Wall Street June
6 when AFL-CIO President John Sweeney issued a challenge to
America's financial community as thousands of New York-area
workers cheered. &quot;For the past 20 years, Wall Street and
corporate America have been putting profits before people,&quot;
Sweeney charged. &quot;Our message to business: Low wages are bad
business and they are bad for business -- put some confidence in
our ideas, put some dollars in our pockets and we'll put you on
the map ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD! The following day, Sweeney carried
his tough message for corporate America to the City Club in
Cleveland, after which local working families, retirees and other
community members shared their personal stories. </p>
<p>ON THE ROAD FOR A RAISE -- Elsewhere on the cross-country
America Needs a Raise campaign, Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka
and Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson listened to
workers in town hall meetings in Baltimore, Albuquerque, N.M.,
and Wichita, Kan. In Baltimore, a 45-year-old minimum wage worker
with six children brought the audience to tears and action as he
explained he was about to be evicted from his apartment. &quot;I
just want a decent paying job,&quot; he said. This week, town
hall meetings are set for San Jose, Pittsburgh and Atlanta. </p>
<p>ROLLIN' UP THE WINS -- Workers are saying Union YES in
workplaces across the country. Respect and fairness were key for
workers at Beatrice Cheese Co., in Mayville, Wis. They brushed
off an anti- union campaign by the company to vote 152-138 for
the Machinists. In St. Louis, what began as a social cookout
ended with 224 employees of the Parkway School District voting
for representation with the Electronic Workers. &quot;I just feel
the union had done so much for me over the past 19 years that I
would like to share the benefits of the union with others,&quot;
said Gary Hodges, president of IUE Local 823, who heard the
workers complain at the cookout and helped them find the
solution. Locomotive mechanics on the Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie
Railroad voted for representation by the Brotherhood of Railroad
Signalmen. And the on-air staff at WFAS AM/FM in White Plains,
N.Y., voted to be represented by the Television and Radio
Artists. </p>
<p>ROCKY TIMES FOR STRUCK STORES -- The 13,000 striking and
locked-out workers at Colorado Safeways and King Sooper groceries
picked up support from other workers and the community as more
people understand the impact of downsizing. Some 617 employees of
Safeway stores in northern Colorado went on strike June 2 after
contracts expired, while the struck stores have lost about 60
percent of their customers since the strike began May 14. GOP
LABOR-BASHING CONTINUES -- Republicans call it the Workers
Right-To-Know Act, but the only thing right about it is that is
yet another right-wing attack on unions. &quot;This bill is
calculated to chill the exercise of our First Amendment rights to
inform our members and the public about the attacks this Congress
is leading against working families,&quot; President Sweeney
said. Even though the current law already imposes on unions the
strictest financial disclosure rules of any organization, and
says employees represented by unions do not have to financially
support union political activities to which they object, the bill
would impose Draconian new rules with the kind of odious
paperwork requirements Republicans profess to oppose. </p>
<p>KEEPING HEAT ON -- Young activists are spreading the message
that working families need a break in Union Summer campaigns in
San Jose, Calif., Akron, Ohio; Atlanta; Boston; Charleston, S.C.;
Chicago; Denver; Detroit; Miami; Oakland, Calif.; San Francisco;
Seattle; St. Louis; Washington; and Watsonville, Calif. See Union
Summer UPDATE, attached. No matter where you are, you can send a
similar message back to Washington as the Senate tries to figure
out what to do with the bill to raise the minimum wage. Now is
the time to RAISE YOUR VOICE. Call 1-800/97AFLCIO and tell you
senator that &quot;America Needs A Raise.&quot; </p>
<p>NLRB NOT ON TEAM -- The Team Act &quot;does not provide for
democracy in the workplace&quot; and would &quot;permit employers
to dominate employees,&quot; NLRB Chairman William B. Gould said
in a strongly worded statement urging the Senate to reject the
company union bill. The Senate is expected to act soon on the
bill, S. 295. Call 1-800-97AFLCIO and urge your senators to vote
NO. </p>
<p>BAD BADGER -- Reebok wants to turn the University of
Wisconsin's Bucky Badger into a symbol for sweatshops, but dozens
of pickets marched outside a Board of Regents meeting urging the
body to say &quot;No&quot; to Reebok's devilish deal. The
athletic apparel company has offered the university $7.9 million
over five years for rights to UW athletic gear. Reebok is one of
the worst corporate violators of human rights, paying Indonesian
workers 16-20 cents an hour for six-day-a-week, 10-hour shifts. </p>
<p>MORE FROM CHEESE LAND -- In Racine, labor's efforts played a
big role in tossing an anti-worker state senator out of office in
a recall election. Not only did the GOP lose George Petak's seat
to Democrat Kim Palche, it lost control of the state senate. That
is the first take-back of a state house since the 1994 elections. </p>
<p>IAM GROUNDS McDONNELL DOUGLAS -- Some 6,700 Machinists at
McDonnell Douglas' St. Louis plant walked out June 5 after
rejecting the aerospace company's latest contract offer. Key in
the talks is McDonnell's increasing use of outside contractors
and the transfer of some work to non-union plants in Mesa, Ariz.,
and Macon, Ga. </p>
<p>PEERLESS SOLIDARITY -- About 500 UNITE members stood with
workers from Peerless Clothing International Inc., at a Macy's
Department store in Atlanta, asking for the store's support to
encourage Peerless to treat its workers with dignity. Peerless,
located in Montreal, is the largest manufacturer of men's suits
in North America. Its largely immigrant workers have been
victimized with low wages, sexual harassment and unfair firings. </p>
<p>CWA CONNECTS IN DETROIT -- First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
headlines the Communications Workers' 58th annual convention,
June 10-12 in Detroit. On June 11, the 3,000 delegates will march
to the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News to support the more
than 2,000 union members who have been on strike at the Detroit
newspapers since July. </p>
<p>JANITORS CAUSING DUST-UP -- Talks between the Service
Employees, representing more than 5,000 janitors, and eight
contract cleaning firms in the San Francisco Bay area resumed
June 7 after a week of selective strikes. The SEIU's Justice for
Janitors campaign has been using surprise as a key element in the
strategic strike, laying down their brooms at a different site
each night. </p>
<p>ATTENDANTS IN FLIGHT -- Some 50 flight attendants have left
ValuJet since a crash in Florida last month that killed all 110
people on board. The Flight Attendants, which is seeking a first
contract at the carrier, are backing legislation, H.R. 3187,
which would make it easier for workers to report safety lapses,
shield workers from company retaliation and protect management
from frivolous complaints. </p>
<p>UN-FREE PRESS -- Washington unions have rallied to the defense
of former Tacoma News Tribune reporter Sandy Nelson, who was
banished from her reporting job in 1990 for off-duty support of a
Tacoma initiative to protect sexual minorities' civil rights. A
caravan of union supporters from Seattle, Tacoma and Portland,
Ore., will travel to Olympia June 11 to support Nelson's appeal
of a lower court ruling supporting the newspaper's action. </p>
<p>PBS HIGHLIGHTS LABOR -- We Do The Work, the only national
television show devoted to covering working people, will examine
the Detroit newspaper strike and the new leadership of the
AFL-CIO on PBS in June. &quot;Workplace Beat: Covering the Bottom
Line&quot; will examine the issues in the 11-month strike.
&quot;State of the Unions&quot; profiles the new leaders of the
AFL-CIO and their vision of how to improve conditions for
American workers. Check your local listings for air times. </p>
<p>FIGHTING THE BOYS IN THE HOODS -- AFL-CIO President Sweeney
presented the National Anti-Extremist Coalition's Courage Award
to Laborers' organizer Randy Siemers for his work in combatting
hate crimes in Billings, Mont. Siemers garnered community support
for a resolution against hate crimes and worked with local police
to boost security at meetings denouncing the crimes. </p>
<p>WORK AT PLAY -- The Working Theater, dedicated to producing
culturally diverse plays about working people, will present a
free staged reading of &quot;A Drop in the Bucket&quot; at
UNITE's New York Joint Board Auditorium on June 13 at 7 p.m., and
on June 14 at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. The play is about an elderly
retired woman who finds a new lease on life when a spunky
neighbor introduces her to the thrills of Atlantic City. For
reservations, call 212/967-5464. </p>

<h2 align="center">AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h2>
<h3 align="center">June 4, 1996</h3>
<p>STANDING FOR CHILDREN _ More than 50,000 union members
journeyed to Washington on 650 buses for the June 1 &quot;Stand
for Children&quot; rally, with large contingents from AFSCME,
AFT, NY1199, OPEIU and UNITE. The AFL-CIO staffed an information
booth and helped spread the word that &quot;America Needs a
Raise&quot; with 28,000 buttons, signs and fact sheets. The D.C.
event, organized by the Children's Defense Fund, was mirrored by
one in Los Angeles, the &quot;Stand Against Violence Everywhere:
Los Angeles March for Children,&quot; which attracted more than
6,000 participants in a march on City Hall that denounced
violence in the schools and streets of the city. </p>
<p>LETTUCE BACK ON SALAD BAR _ After a bitter 17-year battle,
more than 400 Farm Workers won an historic contract with one of
the nation's largest lettuce growers. The five-year contract ends
the boycotts, litigation and conflict between the UFW and Bruce
Church Inc. It includes wage increases, a grievance procedure,
the establishment of a pension fund, paid holidays and health
insurance. Former UFW President Cesar Chavez died April 23, 1993,
following two days of testimony in the lawsuit between the
parties. </p>
<p>HEAT WAVE _ The first wave of Union Summer activists, nearly
500 young people, fanned out across the nation beginning May 31,
joining in campaigns to organize workers in nursing homes, the
hospitality industry, lumber yards and government buildings. The
recruits also began working with community groups fighting for
living wage initiatives. Union Summer, modeled after the Freedom
Summer civil rights fight of the `60s, is designed to involve
youth in a high-profile campaign for social justice for American
workers and their families. See Union Summer UPDATE, attached. </p>
<p>UP AGAINST THE WAL-MART _ President John J. Sweeney,
Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka. Executive Vice President
Linda Chavez-Thompson and UFCW President Doug Dority joined human
rights activist Harry Wu and about 1,000 unionists and allies at
a rally outside a Wal-Mart in Las Vegas May 30. They were
protesting the sale of Chinese-made goods by Wal-Mart, which
bills itself as a &quot;Made in America&quot; chain. The AFL-CIO
has called for a boycott of all Chinese-made products during the
month of June to protest China's abuse of human and worker
rights. Trumka will testify before Congress this week against the
Clinton administration's plan to extend most-favored-nation trade
status to China. </p>
<p>EDDIE BAUER, NO SWEAT! _ Eddie Bauer, J. Crew and Kmart sell
clothes made by underage Honduran workers, according to the
National Labor Committee, which last month exposed abuses in
making Wal-Mart's Kathie Lee clothing. At a news conference May
29, Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) called on retailers to adopt a
&quot;No Sweat&quot; label that assures customers that products
were not made by exploited child labor. </p>
<p>NO CONTRACT, NO WORK _ In the Bay area, more than 5,000
janitors put three-quarters of all commercial office building and
high-tech real estate behind picket lines after their contract
expired May 31. The janitors, represented by Service Employees
Local 1877, demonstrated at the San Jose International Airport
and in Oakland to publicize their union's effort to gain a master
contract. While negotiations were under way for two months,
employers did not respond to the union's proposals or submit any
counter proposals. </p>
<p>WORKERS SADDLE UP WITH TEAMSTERS _ Workers at Fleming Foods in
Warsaw, N.C., voted for representation with Teamsters Local 391.
The vote came after an intimidating two-year campaign by the
company that included racial and sexual harassment. The workers
were encouraged by IBT volunteers from Fleming plants in Oklahoma
City and Houston. </p>
<p>NURSING HOME UNITES _ Fed up with a lack of respect, workers
at Fountainhead Nursing Home in North Miami voted 2-1 for UNITE
representation. The unit will include certified nursing
assistants, housekeeping, laundry and dietary workers. </p>
<p>GOOD TURN FOR SEIU _ On the heels of SEIU Local 250's victory
for AMR workers in Marin County, a unit of EMT's and paramedics
employed by AMR in San Francisco voted unanimously to join the
local. </p>
<p>AGREEMENT AT VENCOR-HILLHAVEN _ Workers' two-year struggle
with the Vencor-Hillhaven nursing home chain in California ended
as three Service Employees locals signed an agreement that calls
for a labor-management patient care committee, a fast election
procedure to gain new members and average annual wage increases
of 7 percent. The agreement gives the workers a greater voice in
the decisions that affect their jobs and their patients. </p>
<p>GOP TAKES AIM AT OSHA AGAIN _ Like a phoenix rising from the
ashes, congressional Republicans have brought back the specter of
cuts in federal safety and health programs in their fiscal year </p>
<p>1997 proposal. Members of the House Appropriations Labor/HHS
subcommittee once again are pushing for very restrictive language
on ergonomics and deep cuts for the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health. The subcommittee markup is
scheduled for June 10. </p>
<p>CBTU MARCHES ON HERALD _ Some 400 members of the Coalition of
Black Trade Unionists rallied in front of the Miami Herald
offices May 24, demanding that the Herald's parent,
Knight-Ridder, negotiate a fair contract with striking workers at
the Detroit Free Press. AFL-CIO Vice President William Lucy,
CBTU's president, led the march from the group's annual
convention. </p>
<p>DRIVIN' THAT TRAIN _ The Locomotive Engineers ratified a
contract with many of the largest rail carriers that will raise
wages for 20,000 members at least 10.5 percent by July 1999. The
pact resulted from &quot;two-track&quot; bargaining that assigned
local issues to the general chairman while the international
union addresses more universal issues. Separate performance-share
wage agreements were reached with Norfolk Southern and Santa Fe
railroads, while an agreement with CSX Transportation is awaiting
ratification and talks continue with Conrail. </p>
<p>PORT CALLS _ The Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union
distributed leaflets May 30 in communities all along the West
Coast to pitch their case for keeping ports public and
prosperous. The union is concerned with &quot;port privatization
schemes that displace family- and community-supporting jobs with
cut-rate, low-wage operations,&quot; President Brian McWilliams
said. &quot;Worse, various bills are working their way through
Congress that would wreak havoc on American workers and port
communities.&quot; Public ports account for 15.3 million jobs. </p>
<p>UNDERSTANDING MANAGEMENT _ The best insurance against
declining wages and job loss is a work force that understands and
contributes to management decisions, AFL-CIO President Sweeney
told the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service's
Labor-Management Conference in Chicago May 29. Sweeney outlined
federation plans to promote this understanding through a new
Corporate Affairs Department, which will provide information and
tools for workers on bargaining and pension funds, and a Center
for Workplace Democracy. </p>
<p>WORKING TOGETHER _ Worker participation is critical to state
and local government success, concludes a report by the U.S.
Department of Labor's Task Force on Excellence in State and Local
Government Through Labor-Management Cooperation. Labor members of
the task force include Al Bilik, president of the AFL-CIO Public
Employee Department; AFT Secretary-Treasurer Edward J. McElroy;
Kent Wong, president of the Asian Pacific American Labor
Alliance; and Ken Young, former executive assistant to AFL-CIO
President Emeritus Lane Kirkland. </p>
<p>HOGAN'S NO HERO _ A federal judge turned down a request by the
Maintenance of Way Employees to permit them to bargain separately
with the nation's rail carriers. BMWE President Mac Fleming
charged D.C. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan, a Reagan
appointee, with political bias against the union, noting the
ruling came on the first day of hearings before a presidential
emergency board charged with helping to resolve BMWE's contract
dispute. Hogan said the issue of multiemployer bargaining is a
matter for Congress to decide, not the courts, and ordered the
union not to strike until all steps under the Railway Labor Act
have been taken. </p>
<p>NAFTA SHAFTS ALL WORKERS _ The number of workers with one
full-time, permanent job is declining as part-time jobs and
demand for temporary or contract workers increase in the United
States, Canada and Mexico, according to a preliminary report by
the North American Free Trade Agreement's Commission on Labor
Cooperation. Despite Mexico's well-publicized economic woes, it
was U.S. workers who took the largest beating in real average
weekly earnings from 1984 to 1995, with an 8.5 percent decline. </p>

<h2 align="center">AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h2>
<p>MEMORIAL DAY BASHES -- Two Memorial Day weekend institutions,
the Indianapolis 500 and the Yale University graduation, were
given a dose of reality courtesy of thousands of union members
and their supporters rallying for justice. Steelworkers from
dozens of cities descended on Indianapolis to &quot;make
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. a poster child for corporate greed and
irresponsibility,&quot; USWA President George Becker said. In New
Haven, Conn., 8,000 workers and college students conducted a
People's Graduation ceremony to support members of the Hotel
Employees and Restaurant Employees Locals 34 and 35, lower-income
support staff who are being threatened by Yale's plans to
subcontract jobs. Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson addressed the rally. </p>
<p>WAGES YES! POISON NO! -- The House May 23 spit back the
Republican leadership's &quot;poison pill&quot; to exempt small
businesses covering millions of workers from wage and overtime
laws, and subsequently voted to raise the minimum wage. AFL-CIO
TV and radio ads in 30 targeted districts in April and May were
the catalyst for the &quot;yes&quot; vote. The bill calls for a
50-cent boost to $4.75 July 1 and another 40-cent increase July
1, 1997. When the Senate takes up the measure in early June,
workers and unions will be pushing to clean up other amendments
House Republicans attached to the bill. </p>
<p>TEAM BENCHED -- Senate GOP leaders want to give their business
backers the anti-workplace-democracy TEAM Act to make up for
being unable to stop a minimum wage hike. It is expected to come
up when the Senate returns to work June 3. There is still time to
call your senators and tell them to vote NO! on the TEAM Act.
Call 1/800- 97AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>A CALL ACROSS THE NATION -- The AFL-CIO's &quot;America Needs
a Raise&quot; campaign was heard far and wide last week as
President Sweeney, Secretary-Treasurer Trumka and Executive Vice
President Linda Chavez-Thompson listened to workers in town hall
meetings in Washington, Detroit, Louisville, Ky., and Nashville,
Tenn. In Washington, a woman with three college degrees has been
unable to find a full-time, permanent position, and she asked,
&quot;How can I encourage my children to seek an education when
they see what it has gotten for me?&quot; In Detroit, college
students with $20,000 in debts before they graduate, pensioners
trying to survive on as little as $50 a month and Detroit
newspaper strikers who have lost 90 percent of their salaries
told their tales to Sweeney and 300 other workers. Presidents Joe
Greene of the School Administrators and Ron Carey of the
Teamsters participated. This week, workers will tell their
stories in Chicago, Las Vegas and Houston. </p>
<p>WORKERS COUNTER GOP SOB SESSION -- Seven GOP House freshmen,
miffed that the AFL-CIO was advertising in their districts about
their votes against working families, tried to stage a publicity
event to whine in front of the federation's headquarters May 23.
But the TV cameras instead captured a spirited rally for raising
the minimum wage. While the House members holed up a block away,
several workers described their struggles, including a restaurant
worker for 15 years who lost her job for taking a vacation and a
47-year-old woman who has been downsized out of three jobs since
1990 and who challenged Republicans opposed to raising the
minimum wage to &quot;buy groceries and pay the rent on the
minimum wage. I can't.&quot; <a href="http://www.afscme.org/">AFSCME</a>
President Gerald McEntee sent emissaries with flowers to bring
the House frosh down to the event. Violins provided by the
AFL-CIO played as the Republicans spoke. Then they headed back to
Capitol Hill where six of the seven again voted against raising
the minimum wage. </p>
<p>A COLLAR ON HOPE -- An investment group headed by Maine's
former Gov. John McKernan is interested in buying a C.F. Hathaway
shirt factory in Waterville, offering hope to more than 500 <a
href="http://www.uniteunion.org/">UNITE</a> members who were told
the 159-year-old plant was closing at the end of the production
season. Meanwhile, Hillary Rodham Clinton offered her support to
workers prior to addressing the state Democratic convention. </p>
<p>HOME TO THE UNION -- <a href="http://www.afscme.org/">AFSCME </a>District
Council 1707 added 710 New York City home care workers to its
rolls when Metrocare employees voted to join the council.
Metrocare is a proprietary care agency funded primarily from
Medicare and Medicaid contracts with agencies to provide home
health aides. </p>
<p>SEIU FOR MENTAL HEALTH -- The <a href="http://www.seiu.org/">Service
Employees</a> organized their fourth mental health and
retardation facility since April when 120 workers in Boston voted
to join SEIU Local 509 under the &quot;Community Care
Campaign.&quot; </p>
<p>CHAINS OF PROTEST -- Striking Detroit newspaper workers
escalated their 10-month campaign for a fair contract by staging
nonviolent civil disobedience actions. Eight strikers chained
themselves to the front door of the Detroit Free Press building
on May 22. None were arrested. Some 200 workers, led by AFL-CIO
President John J. Sweeney, marched in the rain May 23 to the
Detroit News building. Later, 13 were arrested. The march
followed a morning rush hour traffic slowdown by the strikers on
all the city's major expressways. </p>
<p>PROTEST SPECIAL DELIVERY -- More than 2,000 Letter Carriers
converged on Washington May 23 for an emergency conference to
develop a national plan of action to block Postmaster General
Marvin Runyon's &quot;path to destruction.&quot; Aspects may
include national picketing, advertising to educate the public, a
national rally, letter writing, forming a coalition with other
unions, work to rule and a call for Runyon's resignation. Among
other actions, he unilaterally ended the 14-year-old Employee
Involvement process and implemented a new automated process for
preparing mail for carriers' routes that often results in delayed
delivery. </p>
<p>DON'T GO INN -- The AFL-CIO has placed the Four Points by
Sheraton Hotel in Waterbury, Conn., on its national boycott list
at the request of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees.
The union has been in dispute with the hotel since 1989, when
workers were fired for union activity. </p>
<p>TALKING TRASH -- Union and civic activists dumped all over
Browning Ferris Industries, a <a href="http://www.teamster.org/">Teamsters </a>organizing
target, for paying minimal wages to its largely Hispanic and
Iraqi sanitation and recycling workers in Seattle, a city where
90 percent of the garbage haulers are unionized. &quot;I know
these suckers,&quot; Executive Vice President Linda
Chavez-Thompson told a rally outside BFI's plant gate May 16.
&quot;We are talking about people who have no sense of justice
and no sense of fairness for working people in this
country.&quot; </p>
<p>BRINGIN' HOME THE BACON -- The Senate passed a resolution
supporting the Davis-Bacon Act that &quot;drives a stake through
the hearts of proponents of repeal.&quot; Senate and House budget
resolutions assume the prevailing wage law will be repealed. But
Sen. Ted Kennedy's (D-Mass.) resolution backing Davis-Bacon
passed by a 59-41 margin -- and 12 Republicans voted right. The
Davis- Bacon and Service Contract Acts have been under attack
since the GOP took control of Congress in 1994. </p>
<p>CLARIFICATION -- Painters District Council 51 filed the
complaint that resulted in an NLRB ruling upholding contract
provisions against &quot;double breasting.&quot; The ruling,
reported in the May 21 Work in Progress, will benefit about a
half-million building trades workers. </p>
<p>CHINA MFN MOST UNFAVORED -- President Sweeney May 20
criticized the White House decision to seek a waiver of legal
requirements to extend most-favored-nation status to China. The
federation opposes special trade privileges for a regime that
routinely violates human and worker rights and has benefited from
the transfer by U.S. multinational companies of capital,
technology and jobs. Earlier this month, the federation's
Executive Council called for a boycott during June of all
Chinese-made goods. </p>
<p>RIDIN' THE RAILS -- President Clinton has appointed his third
presidential emergency board in two weeks to try to resolve
contract disputes in national rail negotiations. The latest will
make recommendations toward reaching an agreement between major
carriers and the Electrical Workers, Machinists, Railroad
Signalmen and Sheet Metal Workers. Earlier PEBs were established
with respect to the Maintenance of Way Employees and TCU. </p>
<p>DISCRIMINATION AGAINST DISABLED -- The disabled face the same
discrimination as minorities and women and the solution is the
same: an economy based on sharing the wealth and valuing people
over money, President Sweeney told the President's Committee on
Employing People with Disabilities May 23 in Detroit. Another key
is to elect candidates who support America's workers at the
federal, state and local levels. Sweeney also promised that the
AFL-CIO would set an example by continuing to hire disabled
workers. </p>
<p>WORKERS' REVIVAL -- The United Methodist Church passed a
resolution calling for a programmatic approach to addressing
concerns of working Americans. It calls for a nationwide task
force and conference and encourages local parishioners to become
involved with the unemployed, underemployed and local labor.
&quot;By our actions, we seek to proclaim the sacredness of the
workplace and the dignity of its workers,&quot; the church said. </p>
<p>NEW LEADER IN L.A. -- Miguel Contreras was elected executive
secretary-treasurer of the L.A. County Federation of Labor on May
20. He succeeds Jim Wood, who died of cancer in February. </p>
<p>HAPPY ANNIVERSARIES -- May 29 marks the 50th anniversary of
the Mine Workers Health and Retirement Fund. Some 100,000 retired
coal miners, widows and dependents receive pensions and health
benefits through the UMWA Funds. Union Privilege, labor's
benefits provider and key organizing tool, marks its 10th
anniversary. Mortgages, legal services, health care, life
insurance, a credit card, auto club services, loans and assorted
product discounts are available for union members and prospective
members, with new benefits added constantly. </p>

<h2 align=center>AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h2>
<p>BLACK FLAG FOR BRIDGESTONE -- The Steelworkers will disqualify Bridgestone/Firestone 
at the Indianapolis 500 and its rival race, the U.S. 500 in Brooklyn, Mich., by dropping the &quot;black 
flag&quot;, the racing symbol for disqualifying a car for outrageous rules violations. &quot;We intend to drop it 
on this company throughout the Indy car racing season,&quot; said USWA President George Becker. 
The campaign will ask consumers not to buy Bridgestone/Firestone products or services, such as 
tires, golfing equipment, sporting goods or auto repairs at MasterCare centers around the country. 
The company won't get the green flag until all the workers replaced during a 10-month strike that 
ended a year ago are returned to work with back wages and a fair contract is negotiated. </p>
<p>TO GREEDY FROM NEEDY -- With nearly 15,000 Food and Commercial Workers at most 
Denver grocery stores going on strike one day earlier, there was plenty of anger May 15 to fire up 
the AFL-CIO's fifth &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; town hall meeting. &quot;The greedy are taking from the 
needy,&quot; said Marje Lidalda, whose disability prevents her from continuing her construction trade, 
and now she looks at the $612 a month after taxes from minimum wage jobs. AFL- CIO Executive 
Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson said the Denver grocery strike is an example of an 
employer trying to &quot;cheapen&quot; its work force by hiring part-time help. &quot;How can you raise a family 
on part-time work?&quot; she asked. This week, the town halls move to Detroit and Washington, with 
President John Sweeney, and to Louisville and Nashville, with Secretary-Treasurer Richard 
Trumka. </p>
<p>TEAM IN PLAY -- Senate Republicans, bitterly resentful at labor's stunning success in getting a 
minimum wage bill to the floor, will strike back with a vote on the company union bill, the so-called 
TEAM Act, probably Thursday. Last week, the AFL-CIO's Sweeney and Trumka were joined by 
Presidents Gerald McEntee of AFSCME, Arthur Coia of LIUNA, Mac Fleming of BMWE, Andy 
Stern of SEIU and John Sturdivant of AFGE at meetings with Democratic senators about the 
TEAM Act. Call your senators and tell them the TEAM Act would allow employers to hand-pick 
employees to represent other employees and should be voted down. Call 1-800-972-3524. 
Senators who need special attention are Hollings (S.C), Nunn (Ga.), Feinstein (Calif.), Lieberman 
(Conn.), Breaux (La.), Bingaman (N.M.), Bradley (N.J.), Graham (Fla.), Kerrey (Neb.), Leahy 
(Vt.), Pyror (Ark.), Reid (Nev.) and Robb. (Va.). </p>
<p>ORGANIZE, ORGANIZE, ORGANIZE -- Workers around the country keep saying &quot;Union 
YES!&quot; Here are some of the most recent wins: </p>
<ul>
<li>City workers in Las Cruces, N.M., voted 202-17 for the Steelworkers, while 180 
administrative support employees with the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority also won 
representation rights with the USWA. And in Pennsylvania, sirens are ringing as employees 
of the Citizens Ambulance Service turned out at three sites to vote for the USWA. </li>
<li>The Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Culinary Local 226 and the Stratosphere 
Corp. in Las Vegas reached an agreement on union representation for 1,350 cooks, maids, 
dishwashers, food servers, bell persons and slot change personnel. </li>
<li>Workers at Flambeau Airmold in Roanoke Rapids, N.C., voted for <a href="http://www.uniteunion.org/">UNITE </a>representation. 
Campaign issues included a high rate of carpal tunnel syndrome among workers, mandatory 
tests in order to get raises and a profound lack of respect. </li>
<li>Surfing the Internet helped bring dignity to workers at Concepts for Living in Trenton, N.J. 
A counselor working in the group homes for developmentally disabled adults learned about 
the Communications Workers by reading the <a href="http://www.cwa.org/">union's Home Page</a>. The workers voted 32-5 
for representation in CWA Local 1040. In Louisville, Ky., workers at Alltel voted to join 
CWA Local 3310. </li>
</ul>
<p>STEALING FOOD FROM FAMILIES -- Working families and community groups in 27 key 
congressional districts are telling lawmakers that voting against the minimum wage is like stealing 
food from working families' tables. Backed by AFL-CIO television and radio ads, they will be 
outside grocery stores, congressional offices or food banks with shopping carts filled with $40 
worth of groceries -- the extra food a worker could buy for the family each week if the minimum 
wage was increased by a dollar. Symbolic $40 grocery coupons, &quot;Good only if Congress passes 
the minimum wage bill,&quot; will be passed out at the events. In the TV spot, UFCW member Gary 
Cease tells viewers that such votes are &quot;. . . just wrong. Our congressman should stop playing 
political games and start voting for working families for a change.&quot; Call 1-800-97AFL-CIO and tell 
Congress to increase the minimum wage. </p>
<p>HATHAWAY SHIRTS THREADBARE -- C.F. Hathaway plans to take the shirts off the backs 
of more than 500 workers by shutting down its shirt factory in Waterville, Maine. <a href="http://www.uniteunion.org/">UNITE </a>is trying 
to identify potential buyers for the plant, where shirts have been made since 1837. Two years ago, 
workers gave up their first year of wage increases as part of a joint labor-management effort to 
increase productivity and secure employment. But despite the workers' best efforts, Hathaway 
pulled its eye-patched model from advertising pages and quietly made plans to go down the tubes. </p>
<p>SPECIAL AT BLOOMIES -- Solidarity and determination by members of Retail, Wholesale and 
Department Store Union Local 3 to protect past contract gains at Bloomingdale's brought them a 
new four-year agreement that provides job security for workers who face job loss due to the 
planned closing of two warehouses. The workers showed their strength by demonstrating and tying 
up traffic for an hour in front of the flagship store on 59th Street in New York City. </p>
<p>HOT TIME, SUMMER IN THE UNION -- On May 31, hundreds of young union activists will 
begin to organize workers for social and economic justice in the first leg of the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/usummer">AFL-CIO's Union 
Summer</a>. Nearly 30 site coordinators are being trained to lead the 18-city venture. &quot;These are the 
role models who we hope will inspire these young people to want to continue to be involved in the 
labor movement,&quot; said Andy Levin, the project director. Applications for the campaign will be 
accepted until June 1. For more information call 1-800-952-2550 or click on the link above. </p>
<p>PHD FOR THE PEOPLE -- The AFL-CIO has organized a &quot;People's Graduation&quot; in a major 
show of solidarity for the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Locals 34 and 35 at Yale 
University, which conducted separate four-week strikes this year over job security and 
outsourcing. Thousands of unionists, community activists and religious leaders will rally during the 
May 27 commencement ceremonies in an effort to win a fair contract for 3,700 Yale employees. 
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Trumka and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson are expected to speak. A 
bus will be leaving Washington, D.C. on the 27th at 2:30 a.m. and returning that evening. For more 
information, call Mike Murphy at 202-393-7939. </p>
<p>BUDGET DEJA VU -- The GOP budget resolution passed by the House last week and under 
consideration this week in the Senate parallels the Medicare-cutting, budget-slashing document that 
fueled last year's bitter budget battle. The House bill would eliminate the Mine Safety and Health 
Administration and NIOSH, drastically cut job training programs and terminate Trade Adjustment 
Assistance for workers who lose jobs due to unfair trade. The Senate bill calls for repeal of the 
Davis-Bacon Act. Rep. John Kasich vows that a capital gains tax cuts aimed at the wealthy will be 
added later. </p>
<p>NEW MOBILIZATION -- State field directors are the centerpiece of the new AFL-CIO Field 
Mobilization Department's restructured operations, Marilyn Sneiderman, field mobilization director, 
told the Executive Council in Portland. Field directors will work closely with state and local 
AFL-CIOs, operating as organizers and mobilizers in strategic campaigns, organizing, legislative 
and political action, membership mobilization and coalition building. Plans are under way now for a 
state federation conference in the fall and a national conference for central labor councils July 11- 
14 in Denver. </p>
<p>BMWE'S FREIGHT -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney will testify May 28 for the second time 
before a Presidential Emergency Board on behalf of rail workers, this time for the Brotherhood of 
Maintenance of Way Employees. On May 13, he argued for the Transportation Communications 
Union, noting that the wages of rail workers, like those of most Americans, have stagnated, while 
railroads are reaping enormous profits. &quot;Nowhere is the disparity between the fortunes of 
executives and shareholders on the one hand and the workers on the other more glaring than in the 
railroad industry,&quot; Sweeney said. </p>
<p>BUILDING TRADES VICTORY -- Building trades unions won a big victory May 10 when the 
National Labor Relations Board upheld a contract provision that protects construction workers 
from losing their jobs to &quot;double breasting.&quot; The clause requires signatory companies to apply the 
union contract to all work it controls and which the union members would usually perform. </p>
<p>UNION WARN RIGHTS UPHELD -- The U.S. Supreme Court removed an obstacle to 
organized labor's fight against companies that close plants without warning. The court unanimously 
ruled May 13 in Food and Commercial Workers Local 751 vs. Brown Group Inc., that unions 
could sue for money damages on behalf of their members when an employer violates the Worker 
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, better known as the WARN Act. The law requires 
companies to give 60 days advance notice before closing a plant or conducting mass layoffs. </p>
<p>BEVERLY NEEDS LABOR RELATIONS REHAB -- The National Labor relations Board has 
issued a massive complaint against nursing home giant Beverly Enterprises for hundreds of federal 
labor law violations. The board said Beverly made unilateral changes in the terms and conditions of 
employment at 20 Pennsylvania nursing homes after a three-day strike in early April by the Service 
Employees. A trial is scheduled for July 15. </p>
<p>APALA WORKERS LEARN ORGANIZING -- More than 30 Asian Pacific American union 
members participated in the fifth organizing training program in Los Angeles sponsored by the 
Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance and the AFL-CIO Organizing Institute. </p>
<p>HELP FOR 'BAMA TEXTILE WORKERS -- The <a href="http://www.dol.gov/">U.S. Labor Department</a> awarded a grant of 
$3.4 million for 1,200 textile workers who are losing their jobs as a result of closures of 25 apparel 
and textile plants in Alabama. The grant authorized under the Job Training Partnership Act will 
provide skills assessment and training, help finding jobs, counseling, support services such as day 
care and transportation. </p>

<h1 align="center">AFL-CIO Work in Progress -- May 14, 1996</h1>
<p>USA UNION BUSTER _ Last week, some 500 trade unionists told
Gannett's stockholders: If there is no fair contract with
striking workers at the Detroit News, there will be no peace. The
marchers demonstrated outside Gannett's corporate headquarters in
Arlington, Va., during the May 7 stockholders' meeting. Inside,
the stockholders were addressed by representatives and supporters
of the strikers, including the 13-year-old daughter of a striker,
who simply asked Gannett to negotiate an end to the strike so her
family could &quot;have a normal life.&quot; But Gannett
officials cut the girl off before she could finish her statement.
Outside, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney was joined by Presidents
Linda Foley of The Newspaper Guild, James Norton of Graphic
Communications Union and Vincent Sombrotto of the Letter
Carriers, Teamsters Secretary-Treasurer Tom Sever and
Metropolitan Washington AFL-CIO President Joslyn Williams. The
2,000 workers at Gannett's News and Knight-Ridder's Free Press
have been on strike since July 1995. </p>
<p>CONTEMPTUOUS CEO JAILED _ Thomas R. Hochschild, president of
Crystal Window Cleaning Co. in Cleveland, was sentenced to 18
months imprisonment for felonious contempt of court after failing
to obey a federal appeals court order enforcing an NLRB ruling.
This is the first time a company or union has been tried by a
jury for failing to obey an NLRB order, the board's general
counsel said. The NLRB found that Crystal Window illegally
discharged employees and failed to honor a collective bargaining
agreement with the Service Employees. On Sept. 23, 1991, the 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Hochschild to reinstate the
workers, give them back pay and follow the contract. After he
failed to follow the order for almost two years, a jury found him
guilty of felonious contempt. </p>
<p>AMERICA NEEDS A RAISE _ Liz Clybourne is a registered nurse
who works the 7-70 night shift at Kaiser Permanente _ seven
10-hour nights in a row so she can get a week off with her
children. For the past two years, she has been working under a
&quot;garbage contract&quot; _ a 1.5 percent annual wage increase
when the cost of living in Portland, Ore., is averaging increases
between 3 percent and 4 percent. &quot;Now, we may go on strike,
which might wipe me out,&quot; she said. &quot;But that's okay. I
just can't eat the bowl of (crap) that Kaiser is giving me. Some
people might say I'm lucky to have a job. No. They're lucky to
have me,&quot; she said to a rousing ovation by more than 300
people who crowded in the Lutheran Community Center for the
AFL-CIO's fourth &quot;America Needs A Raise&quot; town hall
meeting on May 9. President Sweeney opened the meeting after
rallying Kaiser workers for a fair contract and quality patient
care. &quot;If the AFL-CIO is to speak for working Americans, we
must first take the time to listen,&quot; Sweeney said.
Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka went on to a town hall meeting
May 11 in Billings, Mont., where he listened to more workers
describe their efforts to find dignity and livelihood in work.
This week, Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson hears
from workers in Denver and Seattle. </p>
<p>MORE KAISER CRAP _ The rally led by President Sweeney against
Kaiser Permanente in Portland May 9 boosted some 850 nurses at a
hospital and outpatient clinics who have been without a contract
since April 30. The company is seeking to take away $2 million in
benefits from active and retired nurses, wants to impose a
three-year wage freeze and refuses to give nurses a voice in the
redesign and restructuring of health care services. Contracts
with Kaiser involving some 3,500 workers in Oregon and Washington
expire this year. Already, more than 30,000 Kaiser workers in
California are laboring without a contract. </p>
<p>ALERT FROM THE OREGON TRAIL _ The AFL-CIO Executive Council,
meeting in Portland last week, kept its eye on the outrageous
efforts by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (RKan.) to package the
company union bill, the so-called TEAM Act, with an increase in
the minimum wage and a repeal of the 1994 gas tax. Council
members broke from the May 8 session to place emergency telephone
calls to key Democratic senators preparing to caucus on the
issue. Those senators argued persuasively to continue the
filibuster against Dole_s political shenanigans. Another vote is
scheduled this week. Call your senators and urge them to vote
against the TEAM Act and for an increase in the minimum wage, and
insist that these issues be voted on separately. Call 1-800- <strong>96AFLCIO.</strong> </p>
<p>MINERS TURN ON THE JUICE _ The Mine Workers scored a big
organizing win as more than 180 workers at American Electric
Power's Philip Sporn generating station in New Haven, W.Va.,
voted for UMWA representation. Rank-and-file coal miners at Arch
Mineral's Ruffner mine and Peabody Coal Co. helped put the union
over the top at Sporn. </p>
<p>NURSES UNITE _ Licensed practical nurses at Hebrew Home for
the Aged in North Miami Beach voted unanimously to join UNITE.
The LPNs' vote followed a March 21 vote to join UNITE by
certified nursing assistants, housekeeping, laundry and food
workers. </p>
<p>HERE'S THE BEEF _ After a 16-year organizing fight, Food and
Commercial Workers Local 22 has been recognized by the National
Labor Relations Board as the bargaining agent for more than 1,600
employees at the Monfort Inc. beef slaughtering plant in Grand
Island, Neb. Kurt Brandt, an organizer for the local, attributed
the win to the determination of the workers, many of whom have
worked at the plant for the entire time the union has been
attempting to organize. </p>
<p>RAIL WORKERS NEED A RAISE _ The AFL-CIO went to bat for rail
workers May 13 as President Sweeney told a Presidential Emergency
Board the concerns of the Transportation Communications Union
members _ &quot;declining real wages, jobs lost to outsourcing,
attacks on workers' health insurance _ are the same issues
bedeviling all of America's workers.&quot; The White House had
appointed the board after imposing a 60- day cooling off period
one day before the May 9 strike deadline. TCU has been trying to
get many of the nation's large rail carriers off the mark after
more than 18 months of fruitless negotiations. &quot;There is no
question the railroads have the ability to pay TCU's economic
proposals, TCU President Robert A. Scardelletti told the board.
The emergency board has 30 days to investigate the dispute and
make its report. </p>
<p>MOTHERS ON THE MOVE _ Hundreds of women gathered in protest
May 8 at Wal-Marts and Kmarts across the nation to urge shoppers
to seek their Mother's Day remembrances elsewhere. The protesters
highlighted the two companies' opposition to a minimum wage
increase, noting that more than 60 percent of those earning the
minimum wage are women, and that women are concentrated in
low-wage industries like retail. Led by the Women's Network of
the Food and Commercial Workers, working women were urged to
fight back &quot;not with a clenched fist, but with a closed
pocketbook.&quot; </p>
<p>POSTMASTER DOESN'T DELIVER _ Letter Carriers President Vincent
Sombrotto has called an emergency NALC conference for May 23
&quot;to block irresponsible U.S. Postal Service officials from
destroying mail delivery in the United States.&quot; Despite
Postmaster General Runyon's promise to end dictatorial policies
of postal managers and replace them with a new culture, Runyon
has made a &quot;180-degree flipflop,&quot; Sombrotto said. This
is the first step for a National Plan of Action in all 50 states
to galvanize postal employees. </p>
<p>NO PLACE FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT _ The AFL-CIO reaffirmed its
condemnation of sexual harassment &quot;as an illegal violation
of human dignity&quot; in a statement recommended by the new
Committee on Working Women. Gloria Johnson, the committee chair,
urged unions not only to hold employers responsible for providing
a work environment that supports working women, but also to
educate union members on the issue of sexual harassment. </p>
<p>JOBLESS RATE CREEPS DOWNWARD _ Unemployment edged down in
April but was &quot;essentially unchanged&quot; at 5.4 percent,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although at its
lowest level since June 1990, it has fluctuated narrowly between
5.4 percent and 5.8 percent since October 1994, and is still
above a pre-recession low of 5 percent registered in March 1989.
Employment grew by a scant 2,000 jobs in April, compared with
first quarter average monthly increases of 206,000. </p>
<p>DON'T BUY CHINESE GOODS _ Responding to the Chinese
government's persistent refusal to stop ongoing and serious
violations of human and union rights, the AFL-CIO has called for
a boycott of all Chinese-made goods during the month of June. In
Portland, the federation's Executive Council noted that American
corporations have mounted a massive campaign to grant China
most-favored-nation trading status, which significantly lowers
import duties on Chinese goods. &quot;We oppose extending MFN to
China,&quot; it said. &quot;We urge the Congress to recognize the
need to send a strong message to the Chinese government by
rejecting MFN extension.&quot; The boycott is intended &quot;as a
concrete statement of our support for human rights in China, and
our call for American corporations to insist on a minimum
standard of decency for workers in China,&quot; the council said. </p>
<p>NATIONAL NURSES WEEK NOTED _ The Federation of Nurses and
Health Professionals met in Linthicum, Md., May 4-7 to discuss
professional issues, including how to get the public involved in
the health professionals' fight to ensure quality care.
Meanwhile, nurses from the Service Employees, AFSCME, AFT,
Communications Workers and other groups met with First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton at the White House to urge access to safe
and quality care for all Americans. In addition, the Service
Employees released a report titled &quot;Demanding Quality,&quot;
and organized a &quot;speak-out&quot; and rally on Capitol Hill
May 10 for safety, security and quality in health care. </p>
<p>MAY IS FOR LABOR _ President Clinton proclaimed May Labor
History Month. &quot;Each new generation must embrace the
activism that has characterized labor's rich history, and all
Americans should recognize the role that labor has played in the
continuing progress of our democracy,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>GOLD MEDAL FINISH _ The Painters are giving Atlanta an
&quot;Olympic Finish&quot; as part of their volunteer effort to
paint more than 200 homes surrounding the Olympic Stadium.
&quot;Operation Clean Brush&quot; involves labor, industry,
government and the homeless working together to spruce up the
area for the games. </p>

<h1 align="center">AFL-CIO Work in Progress -- May 6, 1996</h1>
<p>UNION SUMMER IN THE CITIES _ The first 18 sites where 1,000
college students and workers will carry the banner of Union
Summer were announced May 1 at a festive barbecue at AFL-CIO
headquarters. And the cities are: Akron, Ohio; Atlanta; Boston;
Charleston, S.C.; Chicago; Denver; Detroit; Washington; Los
Angeles; Miami; New Orleans; Oakland; Sacramento, Calif.; St.
Louis; San Diego; San Jose, Calif.; Seattle and Watsonville,
Calif. More sites are likely to be added during the summer. The
federation announced two unique aspects to the campaign _ a bus
tour through the Deep South to register voters and support
ongoing organizing campaigns, and a &quot;Labor-to-Neighbor&quot;
drive in San Diego to educate and organize rank-and-file members. </p>
<p>MARCH ON USA TODAY _ For the second time since the Detroit
newspaper strike began, the AFL-CIO and affiliated unions plan to
hold a mass demonstration outside Gannett's headquarters in
Arlington, Va., to support the strikers. Gannett owns the Detroit
News and publishes USA TODAY, and the AFL-CIO is mounting a
&quot;do not buy, do not advertise&quot; campaign against the
national daily. The May 7 march will coincide with Gannett's
annual stockholders' meeting. In Detroit, the combined
circulation of the Free Press and News has dropped 50 percent
overall since the strike began, the unions said. </p>
<p>UMWA GIDDYUPS IN GALLUP _ City workers in Gallup, N.M., voted
162-9 to join the Mine Workers. The UMWA used rank-and-file
members from its P&amp;M mine in the Navajo Nation to help build
support for the union among the Gallup city workers. &quot;This
victory builds on our effort to represent working families in the
coalfields, not only coal miners,&quot; said UMWA President Cecil
Roberts. </p>
<p>ADVOCATE FOR THE UAW _ Newsroom employees at the Advocate in
Stamford, Conn., voted 20-12 to join the UAW, making it the first
daily newspaper editorial staff to be represented by the union.
&quot;We were tired of being treated arbitrarily and
unilaterally,&quot; said Dan Mangan, an Advocate reporter. </p>
<p>UNION HOME WORK _ In the latest chapter of the Service
Employees dramatic home-care organizing sweep across California,
the union gained 5,700 San Francisco home-care workers. The vote
was 1,358-143 to join SEIU Local 250. Previously, 2,000 San Mateo
home-care workers joined SEIU Local 715 and 6,000 Alameda County
workers joined Local 616. </p>
<p>KAISER CUTS CHALLENGED _ Kaiser Permanente's
&quot;restructuring&quot; plans have been challenged in a
petition signed by members of the U.S. Congress, California
lawmakers, consumers and the Service Employees, among others, and
filed with the state's Department of Corporations. The HMO, which
has 4.8 million California members, has proposed to close or
convert hospitals and clinics, increasing referrals to non-Kaiser
contractors, shortening hospital stays, moving surgeries to
less-regulated outpatient settings and limiting access to care
through restrictive policies. </p>
<p>MOM NEEDS A RAISE - On May 8 at more than two dozen Wal-Mart,
Kmart and Sam's Club's stores, women will blow the whistle on
those corporate opponents to raising the minimum wage. Organized
by the Women's Network of the United Food and Commercial Workers,
the protest will make public the heavy behind-the-scenes lobbying
by these big stores against the minimum wage raise. The protest
also will mark Mother's Day as a time to think about a living
wage for working mothers. Two out of three minimum-wage workers
are women. </p>
<p>LIES, DAMN LIES AND STATISTICS _ Several recent reports
attempt to paint a rosy picture of American living standards. But
according to Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute,
&quot;they each serve to obscure the simple truth that hourly
wage rates have fallen for most American workers.&quot; AFL-CIO
President John J. Sweeney said, &quot;Many indicators show that
the economy is moving again. But now we have to put prosperity in
people's paychecks. America needs a raise.&quot; </p>
<p>ON ROLL FOR RAISE: The Executive Council meets in Portland,
Ore., on Wednesday and Thursday, turning Thursday afternoon to a
regional conference and then to the fourth &quot;America Needs A
Raise&quot; town hall meeting, with President Sweeney presiding.
SecretaryTreasurer Richard Trumka chaired the first two, in
Birmingham, Ala., and Los Angeles, and Executive Vice President
Linda ChavezThompson presided in Columbus, Ohio. Among the
workers telling their stories in Columbus was Rhonda Ware, who
said has worked her way off welfare, but &quot;I lost health
benefits and I'm currently working at a low-paying job at a fast
food restaurant without any benefits at all for my daughter or
myself. . . . If people are willing to work, they just need a
living wage so that they can support their families and they also
need benefits.&quot; </p>
<p>DON'T FEED THE LION _ Food and Commercial Workers demonstrated
May 1 outside the Belgian Embassy to protest the treatment of
U.S. workers by Belgian-based multinational Delhaize, parent of
Food Lion. In solidarity, Belgian employees of Delhaize marched
in front of the U.S. Embassy in Brussels. &quot;Delhaize is an
international hypocrite,&quot; said UFCW Local 400 President
Thomas R. McNutt. &quot;They observe worker rights in Belgium and
France and Greece, but not in America,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>SNAKE EYES FOR FLAMINGO _ The NLRB ruled that the Flamingo
Hilton Casino in Laughlin, Nev., tried to rig the game during a
Steelworkers organizing drive. An administrative law judge upheld
charges by the USW of anti-union actions conducted by the hotel
and ordered the casino to start dealing from the top of the deck
and cease such actions. </p>
<p>HOSTILE HOTEL CHARGED _ The illegal firing of three union
supporters who had worked at New Otani hotel in Los Angeles for
16 years was cited in a complaint filed by the NLRB charging
hotel management with violating federal labor law. &quot;This
action confirms what Local 11 has known for many months _ that
the New Otani workers do not have the liberty to express their
opinions about the union without fear of harassment and
termination from their jobs,&quot; said Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Employees Local 11 President Maria Elena Durazo. </p>
<p>CHEERS FOR FAMILY LEAVE _ Employers have found that
implementing the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act
hasn't cost much, has had almost no noticeable effect on
productivity, profitability and growth, and that most workers
took only an average two weeks of leave. A report delivered to
Congress May 1 by the Department of Labor detailed those
findings, with Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich summarizing
that &quot;none of the dire predictions made by family leave
opponents came true.&quot; Copies of the report are available
from the Women's Bureau, U.S. Department of Labor, 200
Constitution Ave. N.W., Suite S3002, Washington, D.C. 20210. </p>
<p>PLEASE SIR, MORE? _ Giveaways for businesses and the wealthy
hidden in the tax code _ like tax breaks for certain industries
and investments, loopholes, write-offs and accelerated
depreciation _ will cost the federal government $455 billion this
fiscal year, three times the budget deficit. A new study reveals
that these entitlements for the wealthy and corporations cost 2.5
times as much as direct means-tested entitlements like welfare
and Medicaid. &quot;A Congress that is eager to challenge
low-income welfare entitlements ought to be at least as tough _
if not tougher _ on welfare entitlements for the well-heeled and
politically powerful if it truly wants to bring the budget
deficit under control,&quot; said Robert McIntyre, director of
Citizens for Tax Justice, which prepared the report. </p>
<p>DOWNSIDE TO THE DOWNSIZE _ Legislation that would require
corporations with more than 100 employees to provide permanently
laid-off workers with two months of severance for each year of
service was introduced May 2 in the New Jersey Assembly. The Job
Destruction Penalty Act would also levy a $4,000-per-layoff fine
on downsizing companies, to be given to affected communities to
help compensate for lost jobs and tax revenues. The New Jersey
Industrial Union Council is launching a grass-roots campaign for
the initiative. </p>
<p>CHEMICAL REACTION _ The Chemical Workers approved a merger
with the UFCW at a special convention with 91 percent of the
delegates voting for the new alliance. &quot;From everything
we've seen and learned in a year of dealing with the UFCW, the
ICWU, its members and employees will only benefit from the
merger,&quot; said ICWU President Frank D. Martino. UFCW
President Douglas Dority said it &quot;provides positive benefits
for both organizations, and will reinvigorate the bargaining
power of the ICWU and service to its members.&quot; </p>
<p>RUN FOR THE BORDER _ The AFL-CIO will urge changes in the
illegal immigration bill passed by the Senate that also will
affect legal immigrants, children and employers when the bill
goes to conference. The House passed a similar bill earlier.
Controversial provisions in the bills include denial of public
education for children of illegal immigrants, the cut off of
various welfare benefits for both illegal and legal immigrants
and employment verification provisions which could deny legal
immigrants work. </p>
<p>BARNARD WORKERS RALLY _ About 400 unionists rallied May 2 in
support of striking clerical workers at Barnard College in New
York City. The college has adopted an aggressive anti-union
approach, forcing the Technical and Office Professional UAW Local
2110 to strike for the first time since 1978 over labor
practices, health care and pay equity. </p>
<p>POLITICAL CLUW _ AFL-CIO President John Sweeney told the
Coalition of Labor Union Women conference on political
empowerment that the labor movement is counting on working women
to make the difference in the 1996 elections. Labor will demand
&quot;that candidates who run with the union label wear it on the
outside of their lapel . . . rather than hidden in their
pockets,&quot; he said. Other speakers included CLUW President
Gloria Johnson and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) </p>
<p>NO TAINTED MUSHROOMS _ Harvey's supermarket chain is dropping
Quincy Farms mushrooms from its vegetable bins in response to
Quincy's firing of 85 Farm Workers who were arrested for
participating in a lunch break protest of working conditions.
Harvey's operates 40 stores in northern Florida and southern
Georgia. </p>
<p>BMWE RELEASED _ The National Mediation Board April 29 released
the Maintenance of Way Employees from mediation in talks with
most of the nation's major freight carriers, and the union is
consulting with its bargaining committees as to whether to accept
the agency's offer of arbitration. &quot;We are dedicated to
moving the bargaining process forward,&quot; said BMWE President
Mac Fleming. &quot;At the same time, we are a democratic union
and must act accordingly.&quot; The union has been negotiating
locally with each railroad, and 10 different committees are
involved. So far, only the United Transportation Union has
accepted arbitration, a step it took after members turned down an
earlier contract offer. Arbitration has been rejected by the
Electrical Workers, Machinists, Railroad Signalmen and Sheet
Metal Workers. </p>

<h1 align="center">AFL-CIO Work in Progress -- April 29, 1996</h1>
<p>UNION SUMMER BBQ _ Union Summer will be celebrated at an open
house and barbecue between 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m. at AFL-CIO
headquarters Wednesday, with the announcement of the first round
of sites. The official kickoff of the campaign to put up to a
thousand young unionists and students in communities for
organizing and other social activism will be hosted by President
John Sweeney, Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka and Executive
Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson. You're invited! </p>
<p>HONOR THE DEAD, FIGHT FOR THE LIVING _ Across the nation this
past weekend, workers gathered to renew labor's fight for safe
workplaces on the 8th annual Workers Memorial Day. President
Sweeney on Saturday was in Milwaukee and Madison, Wis., where
about 300 workers and their families gathered at the Madison
Labor Temple's symbolic cemetery for workers killed on the job in
that state. In a moving ceremony, their names and cause of death
were read and placards honoring them were placed at the site. In
Milwaukee, Sweeney told a crowd of 500 that unions are
&quot;fighting a relentless attack by congressional Republicans,
at the behest of their corporate allies, who want to weaken&quot;
safety laws and turn back the clock to a more deadly time.
ChavezThompson also attended job safety rallies in Alton, Ill.,
and St. Louis, Mo., on Sunday, and Trumka attended the annual
Workers Memorial Day breakfast in Los Angeles on Monday. </p>
<p>PROMISES, PROMISES _ Workers and survivors of workplace
accidents and deaths were at the Department of Labor last Friday
for a ceremony honoring Workers Memorial Day and the 25th
anniversary of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. They heard
Vice President Gore promise the administration would fight for
OSHA against the GOP-led onslaught in Congress. Sweeney noted
that safety laws have saved lives, but with continuing deadly
workplace conditions, &quot;It's still not enough.&quot; Labor
Secretary Robert Reich said OSHA's job will not be over, &quot;as
long as the prospect of death and injury stalk the
workplace.&quot; A newly released AFL-CIO study on the
25-year-old safety act, Promises Kept, Promises Broken notes the
industries where progress has been made _ and where the biggest
dangers remain. Copies of the 121-page report may be ordered
through the AFL-CIO's Support Services Department, 202-637-5041. </p>
<p>DETROIT GOES THROUGH MIAMI _ Striking Detroit newspaper
employees and their supporters turned out in force at
Knight-Ridder's annual stockholders' meeting in Miami. Susan
Watson, a 30-year veteran of the Detroit Free Press, told the
stockholders &quot;short-sighted corporate managers have done
terrible damage to a great newspaper and to its reputation for
truth and integrity.&quot; Community and religious leaders also
attacked the company's insensitivity and their plans to retain
scab workers. Knight-Ridder, which owns the Free Press, announced
it has lost $46 million as a result of the strike and expects to
lose $20 million more this year. Gannett, owner of the Detroit
News, has the same amount of losses, since the two papers split
costs under a joint operating agreement.</p>
<p>AMERICA NEEDS A RAISE _ The sprinklers erupted in the room an
hour before the AFL-CIO was to hold the first of about 30 town
hall meetings on America's growing wage gap, then the power went
out just as SecretaryTreasurer Trumka was preparing to open the
meeting in suburban Birmingham, Ala. When the lights came back on
30 minutes into the program, more than 400 people were on the
edge of their seats, listening to the gripping testimony from
people including an ex-gang member, a nurse and a homeless day
laborer Trumka had invited in off the street. A student told
about his mother's struggle to keep the family together as she
worked two and sometimes three jobs at a time. AFSCME
Secretary-Treasurer Bill Lucy proclaimed, &quot;There is no
justification for the continued maldistribution of wealth in our
society. There comes a time when common people with a common
problem need to come together. America needs a raise.&quot; Up
this week: Town hall meetings in Los Angeles and Columbus, Ohio. </p>
<p>STILL JUST $4.25 _ House Democrats tried again last week to
force a vote on raising the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour over
the next two years. They failed, but picked up eight votes over
the previous vote on March 28. Union volunteers were working
phone banks to contact members on the issue, and the AFL-CIO was
preparing to go back on the air with radio ads in 29 districts,
asking listeners to call their member of Congress and insist on a
direct vote to raise the minimum wage. For more information, call
Linda Miller at 202/637- 5211. </p>
<p>TAX POLICY SHELL GAME _ Labor Secretary Reich, speaking at the
Service Employees convention, said a Republican proposal aimed at
ducking the growing demand for a minimum wage hike &quot;goes
from bad to worse.&quot; The plan to cut single workers and
childless adults from the Earned Income Tax Credit sends the
message to 4 million workers earning near the minimum wage: `You
don't get a minimum wage increase, you get a tax increase
instead.' </p>
<p>HOLLY NOT FARMING _ The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that workers
who catch, load and haul chickens for slaughter are covered by
the National Labor Relations Act. The April 23 decision affirmed
an NLRB ruling that ordered Holly Farms, a subsidiary of giant
poultry producer Tyson Foods, to bargain with the Teamsters,
which represents the live-chicken haulers. The company had argued
the workers were agricultural workers and exempt from the NLRA.
But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the 5-4 majority,
said the work was tied to Holly Farms' slaughtering and
processing operations, activities that do not constitute
`farming' under the statute. The case is Holly Farms vs. NLRB. </p>
<p>THE GOOD SIDE OF POULTRY _ Religious leaders will meet with
poultry workers who have been fighting for a year to gain a
contract with Case Farms Processing Plant in Morganton, N.C. The
workers voted for representation with the Laborers last July. The
clergy, organized by the National Interfaith Committee for Worker
Justice, hope to meet with the CEO at Case. For more information,
call Kim Bobo at 312/381-2832. </p>
<p>TOP-HEAVY _ Here's a nugget from Business Week's annual survey
of executive pay: When nursing home owner Vencor Inc. acquired
Hillhaven Corp. last year, CEO W. Bruce Lunsford's compensation
jumped from $1.8 million to more than $4.9 million. But the
company's 2,000 workers, without a contract since 1994, are still
denied a 15 percent increase on wages that start below $6 an
hour. The Service Employees announced a major campaign against
VencorHillhaven and two other health care giants, Beverly
Enterprises and Kaiser Permanente, at its convention last week in
Chicago. </p>
<p>SEIU ELECTS STERN _ Delegates to the 75th SEIU convention set
the stage for renewed union activism with the election of Andy
Stern as president, at 45 the youngest person ever to hold the
post. They also re-elected SecretaryTreasurer Betty Bednarcyzk,
the first woman to be elected to one of the top two offices at
the union. The new officers led more than 1,000 delegates on a
onemile march from the convention hotel through downtown Chicago
to join a rally in support of a proposed city ordinance that
would limit city tax breaks, subsidies and contracts to
businesses willing to pay workers $7.60 an hour, the rate
required to put a family of four at the national poverty level.
AFL-CIO President Sweeney and SEIU Local 73 President Tom
Balanoff met with Chicago Mayor Richard Daley to discuss the
living wage initiative. </p>
<p>YALE FIGHT _ A bitter labor dispute between Yale University
and 3,700 members of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
Locals 34 and 35, did not stop 120 &quot;on call&quot; workers
from voting to join the union on April 26. The new members plan
to be a part of a massive demonstration against the university on
May 27, graduation day. The union is hoping to draw crowds from
the tri-state area. For more information, call 203/624-5161. </p>
<p>DOLE/GINGRICH PRESCRIBE BAD MEDICINE _ The fate of bipartisan
health insurance reform appears to depend on Sen. Bob Dole's
(R-Kan.) and Speaker Newt Gingrich's (R-GA) insistence on
maintaining two controversial provisions. Passed by the Senate
last week and the House in March, the bill would allow workers to
maintain their insurance coverage when they change or lose jobs
and would also limit exclusions of workers and their families
from health coverage because of pre-existing medical conditions.
But Gingrich and Dole want to add tax breaks aimed mostly at well
off healthy people and cap medical malpractice awards, something
long sought by the medical community. These provisions would
certainly provoke a veto. </p>
<p>DEEP-SIX DE-REG _ Without so much as a hearing, the
GOP-controlled House is ready to vote on a maritime deregulation
bill. Maritime unions have urged their members to contact their
lawmakers to oppose H.R. 2149, the Ocean Reform Shipping Act. The
bill &quot;threatens the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands or
port and maritime workers through the country,&quot; said Brian
McWilliams, president of the Longshoremen and Warehousemen. The
bill is scheduled to be on the House floor this week. You can
help by calling 1-800- 97AFL-CIO and urge your House member to
oppose the bill. </p>
<p>LANDMARK AGREEMENT _ In the Carpenters' first cooperative
training initiative with a major manufacturer, the union
announced the creation of a new program with Wilsonart
International designed to better train carpenters on the
installation of solid surface materials. Under the terms of the
agreement, the UBC, through its Apprenticeship and Training Fund,
will provide training, while Wilsonart will provide technical
support and training materials. </p>
<p>NEW GRAIN MILLERS PACTS _ Grain Millers' policy committees
have accepted new three-year agreements with General Mills and
Pillsbury. The agreements deal only with benefit changes, with
wage provisions, seniority, and work rules left to separate talks
at the individual plants. The General Mills pact covers 3,400
employees at 16 plants and increases the pension formula from $31
per month per year of service to $34, sets up an alternative
health care plan, and establishes a 401(k) plan. The Pillsbury
deal covers 800 employees at three plants and increases the
pension formula from $28 to $32, increases the lifetime maximum
health care coverage and also sets up a 401(k) plan. </p>
<p>LOVING THE WAY THEY FLY _ Air Line Pilots voted to approve a
four-year contract with Delta Air Lines that promises to increase
job security, return furloughed pilots to work, provide employees
with an enhanced retirement plan and stock options and reserve a
seat on the Board of Directors. The ratification came as the
airline seeks to meet competition from low-fare, low-wage
carriers. Delta pilots elected Capt. Bill Brown, three-term
chairman of ALPA's Master Executive Council at Delta, to fill the
board seat. </p>
<p>CONFERENCE ON BARGAINING _ The AFL-CIO Industrial Union
Department will hold a Coordinated Bargaining Conference July
8-12 at the Renaissance Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.
Registration is $55. Contact the IUD at 202/842-7862. </p>

<h2 align=center>AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h2>
<p>BARNSTORMING FOR A RAISE _ AFL-CIO President John Sweeney last week carried the 
message &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; from Boston to Minneapolis to New York to San Francisco, 
where on April 16 he joined others in presenting petitions to put a referendum for a living wage on 
California's ballot. &quot;It is time for Americans to take a look at how corporate America is downsizing 
the American dream and say three simple words: THIS IS WRONG,&quot; Sweeney told a Minneapolis 
forum on renewing the social contract between companies and workers. The first of a series of 
federation-sponsored town hall meetings to hear how working for less is affecting working families 
will be held April 26 in Birmingham, Ala.</p>
<p>WAGE ISSUE SPARKS GOP DEFECTIONS _ The AFL-CIO's pressure on lawmakers to 
raise the minimum wage is working. Last week, 20 Republican House members broke ranks with 
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), joining Democrats in support of a minimum wage. But reports 
from the Hill indicate Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) may attempt to 
sabotage the bill by attaching anti-worker provisions. On Friday, President Sweeney pulled 
together all the state AFL-CIOs in a conference call to update them and set new strategy for the 
wage battle. Leaflets were shipped over the weekend to all state feds with an urgent request to get 
them out, and to get phone calls in to Congress. You can get camera-ready art of the leaflet 
shipped overnight by calling Linda Miller at 202/637-5211.</p>
<p>BUILDING WAGES _ Sweeney personally delivered the minimum wage leaflets to delegates of 
the Building and Construction Trades legislative conference April 22, urging them to deliver the 
message to their members of Congress. Some 5,000 delegates and guests at the conference also 
participated in workshops ranging from organizing to grass-roots activism. Labor Secretary Robert 
Reich also addressed the conference, and Vice President Gore is scheduled to speak later in the 
week.</p>
<p>GOP STRIKES BACK _ Angered by labor's aggressive voter education program, Republican 
congressional leaders have launched a double-barreled attack on worker organizations. A Senate 
committee last week marked up and sent to the floor the misnamed TEAM Act, which would allow 
a return to company unions. A House subcommittee held a hearing on codifying the Supreme 
Court's eight-year-old Beck decision, a move clearly designed for retribution. Union witnesses 
argued that workers' Beck rights are established by the National Labor Relations Board and that 
unions are democratic institutions that no one is forced to join.</p>
<p>MECHANICS FLY IBT _ America West Airlines mechanics won a great victory over corporate 
greed April 17, voting 587 to 135 in favor of Teamsters representation. &quot;The workers had the last 
word on an insensitive and greedy management that fired nearly 400 mechanics last December,&quot; 
said Ron Carey, IBT president. In March, a federal mediator ruled that the fired mechanics had a 
right to cast ballots in the election.</p>
<p>OVERNITE, THEY'RE TEAMSTERS _ Workers at the fifth largest service center of Overnite 
Transportation in Lexington, Ky., also voted April 17 for Teamsters representation. The campaign, 
which began in the fall of 1994, has been marked by charges against the company alleging unlawful 
labor practices. The IBT now represents 2,000 employees at 17 Overnite facilities.</p>
<p>WEEK ON THE RUN _ President Sweeney will be in Milwaukee and Madison, Wis., April 27 to 
mark Workers Memorial Day, which falls on Sunday, April 28. Executive Vice President Linda 
Chavez-Thompson will gather with nearly 1,000 trade unionists for the commemoration April 28 
along the banks of the Mississippi River in Alton, Ill., and St. Louis. Secretary-Treasurer Trumka is 
preparing to kick off the federation's &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; town hall meetings in Birmingham 
on Friday. Sweeney starts the week at the Building and Construction Trades Department 
conference in Washington, then goes to Chicago for the Service Employees convention. 
Chavez-Thompson participates in a Ms Foundation panel in Atlanta Tuesday and addresses the 
UAW legislative conference in Washington on Wednesday. On Saturday, she is in Hartford for a 
Connecticut AFL-CIO unity rally and a labor-community-religious forum.</p>
<p>UNION SUMMER _ Friends and supporters are invited to come to a barbecue and official launch 
of Union Summer at the AFL- CIO headquarters on May 1st. President Sweeney will announce 
the first round of Union Summer sites at the event, scheduled from 11:30 a.m to 2 p.m. About 900 
young unionists, college students and children of union members have applied for the summer 
organizing campaign. June 1 is the deadline for applying for Union Summer assignments. For more 
information, call 800/952-2550.</p>
<p>ILLINOIS WORKERS MAD AS HELL _ More than 20,000 union members marched on the 
GOP-controlled legislature in Springfield April 17 to protest its attack on working families, a 
state-level version of the assault orchestrated in Washington by Gingrich, Dole and friends. 
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Rich- ard Trumka told the crowd that when the GOP took over 
the Capitol, they &quot;drew a bulls-eye on the back of every working man and woman in Illinois.&quot; 
Workplace safety, prevailing wages, un- employment comp and other issues have all come under 
attack there.</p>
<p>DON'T MOURN, ORGANIZE _ More than 2,000 Farm Workers marched in Watsonville, 
Calif., April 21 to commemorate the third anniversary of Cesar Chavez's death and kicked off a 
stepped-up union organizing drive in the Monterey Bay region. &quot;Strawberry workers endure some 
of the lowest pay and most abusive working conditions in California,&quot; UFW President Arturo 
Rodriguez told the crowd. Starting with the Watsonville march, the union will be targeting Central 
Coast strawberry growers for intensified organizing efforts.</p>
<p>MITSUBISHI HARASSMENT _ UAW President Steve Yokich described as &quot;just plain wrong&quot; 
efforts by Mitsubishi to pressure employees into demonstrating against the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission for its investigation of sexual harassment charges at the Mitsubishi plant in 
Normal, Ill. The union and its Local 2488 have been cooperating with the EEOC, Yokich noted, 
and the company &quot;would do better to work with the agency and the union to redress past wrongs 
and make whatever changes are necessary to ensure that its work force is protected from any kind 
of discrimination now and in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>FIRST LADY SPEAKS TO UAW _ The Clinton adminis- tration needs the labor movement's 
help to rebuild the American dream, Hillary Rodham Clinton told more than 1,600 cheering UAW 
activists as she opened the union's legislative conference April 21. The three-day conference 
culminates Tuesday with a day of meetings with members of Congress to urge passage of the 
minimum wage increase and defense of OSHA, Medicare, Medicaid, education and other 
programs vital to working families.</p>
<p>REACHING OUT TO WOMEN _ Karen Nussbaum, director of the AFL-CIO's new Working 
Women's Department, is going on the road to meet with women's organizations and union groups in 
Atlanta, Chicago, Portland (Ore.), Boston and New York City. Nussbaum will stress the 
importance of unions in raising living standards for the growing female work force, as well as the 
essential role women can play in the 1996 elections.</p>
<p>GETTING THE MESSAGE _ After hearing AFSCME President Gerald McEntee on PBS's The 
News Hour with Jim Lehrer outline the AFL-CIO political and legislative mobilization for 1996, a 
Sarasota, Fla., woman was inspired to send a $500 check to the AFL-CIO for use in the Labor 
`96 campaign. McEntee, who is chair of the AFL-CIO political action committee, also went 
head-to-head with Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) on CNBC's Politics with Chris Matthews April 
16. Boehner accused the AFL-CIO of illegally using funds in the Labor '96 campaign and of trying 
to buy the November elections. &quot;All we are doing,&quot; McEntee said, &quot;is getting the word out about 
the voting record of members of Congress. So, what are the Republicans afraid of?&quot;</p>
<p>STAMPING ON WORKERS _ The U.S. Postal Service has drawn the ire of both the Postal 
Workers and the Letter Carriers on separate accounts. APWU President Moe Biller accused 
USPS of &quot;bombing without notice&quot; for announcing plans to explore contracting out Priority Mail 
processing centers. NALC President Vincent Sombrotto lambasted USPS's &quot;employer arrogance&quot; 
for unilaterally terminating the 14-year-old Employee Involvement program. The NALC was 
informed of the USPS action in a two-page letter, which stated that all persons employed in 
support of the program be returned to the appropriate craft and management positions by May 25.</p>
<p>A BLUE-LIGHT SPECIAL EFFORT _ Claiming the current board has run the company into the 
ground, UNITE and the Teamsters have mounted an effort to reform Kmart's board of directors 
and to gain approval for resolutions at the May 21 annual meeting. The unions filed proxy 
resolutions to hold an annual election of all board members; eliminate the retirement plan for 
nonemployee directors; and undertake a study to examine ways to improve the stock sale.</p>
<p>LTV THREATENED WORKERS _ The Steelworkers accused LTV Steel Co. of violating labor 
law by attempting to prevent workers from attending the company's annual meeting where union 
leaders ripped management's plans for a nonunion minimill in Alabama. The union filed charges with 
the NLRB claiming that LTV threatened to deny workers time off to attend the meeting, videotape 
attendees, and ban union activities on company premises. Despite the threats, some 1,400 USWA 
members, most of them stockholders, showed up for the April 15 annual meeting in Cleveland, 
occupying most of the seats in the auditorium.</p>
<p>HELP FOR LOCKED-OUT WORKERS _ Paperworkers President Wayne E. Glenn is seeking 
help in publicizing the plight of 1,200 locked-out employees at Trailmobile's Charleston, Ill., plant. 
Members of UPIU Local 7591 were locked out three months ago after refusing to extend a 
four-year wage freeze into a full seven years. To get a packet of materials, including a fact sheet, 
press release, ad slick describing the adopt-a-family program and news stories on the lockout, 
contact UPIU Special Projects Department at 615/834-8590.</p>
<p>CONFERENCE CALLS _ Workplace Learning: The Strategic Advantage, sponsored by the 
AFL-CIO Human Resources Development Institute and several AFL-CIO affiliates, April 29-30 
at the Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee, focuses on planning, implementing, evaluating and negotiating 
workplace learning initiatives. For more information, call 608/263-2929 or 800/446-0399. 
African-Americans, Labor and Society: Organizing for a New Agenda, set for May 10-11 at 
Wayne State University in Detroit, features an address by National Labor Relations Board 
Chairman William Gould and a keynote by AFSCME Secretary-Treasurer William Lucy, president 
of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists. Contact Prof. Patrick Mason, Department of African 
Studies, at 313/577-2321.</p>

<h2 align=center>AFL-CIO Work in Progress,<br>
Tuesday, April 16, 1996 </h2>
<p>SOLIDARITY IN DETROIT -- About 3,000 people crowded into Detroit's Cobo Center April 
14 threw down a challenge to the publishing kingpins that own the struck Detroit News and Free 
Press. &quot;Did Knight-Ridder and Gannett think they could crush working families, destroy our lives 
and careers and no one would protest?&quot; AFL-CIO President John Sweeney asked the crowd. 
Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka declared that the Detroit &quot;community is revolted and 
disgusted&quot; by the behavior of the publishers. &quot;Readers are finding other things to read. Advertisers 
are finding other places to advertise.&quot; Teamsters President Ron Carey said the publishers' strategy 
to destroy the unions didn't work. &quot;They had no idea of the commitment of the labor movement or 
the strikers.&quot; Also addressing the rally were Service Employees President Richard Cordtz, UAW 
Vice President Carolyn Forrest, Graphic Communications Secretary-Treasurer Guy DeVito, 
Newspaper Guild President Linda K. Foley, Michigan AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Bertha L. 
Poe, Detroit AFL-CIO President Edgar A. Scribner, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), and Detroit 
City Council President Maryann Mahaffey. </p>
<p>BACK ON THE ATTACK -- Newt Gingrich and company are wasting no time in renewing their 
attack on workers and working families after the congressional recess. In the Senate, the Labor 
and Human Resources Committee will mark up the so-called TEAM Act (S.295) April 17. The 
company union bill, a favorite of the business community, is expected to pass the 
Republican-controlled panel, but you can still make your voice heard by using the AFL-CIO's 
toll-free number, 800/962-3524, to urge your senator to vote &quot;no.&quot; The House Employer- 
Employee Relations Subcommittee, meanwhile, is expected to attack the AFL-CIO's voter 
education and get-out-the-vote drive at a hearing April 18, using the Supreme Court's Beck 
decision as cover. While Gingrich and other GOP leaders whine about workers and unions 
exercising their rights, The New York Times reported April 12 that in 1995 alone, &quot;the Gingrich 
money machine has helped raise more than $52 million for Republican coffers.&quot; </p>
<p>FIGHTING &quot;RIGHT TO WORK&quot; -- The anti-union attack is being carried nationwide by the 
National Right to Work Committee, which is mailing letters and press releases in 21 states to 
announce a million-dollar campaign promoting passage of the national &quot;rightto -work&quot; bill. In 
Montana, the state AFL-CIO will hold a news conference Wednesday to upstage an event planned 
by the national committee. Meanwhile, in Oklahoma, the state senate voted 25-18 against a 
Republican attempt to attach a right-to-work amendment to legislation on binding arbitration for 
police and firefighters. </p>
<p>IAM, LOCKHEED AGREE -- The Machinists announced a tentative agreement with Lockheed 
Martin April 12, averting a strike by 4,800 aerospace workers that was set for Monday morning. 
The proposed settlement followed three days of around-the-clock negotiations at the Washington 
headquarters of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Full details will not be available 
until after the ratification vote, set for April 21, but union negotiators said they had succeeded in 
forcing Lockheed Martin to drop its demands to eliminate union jobs by outsourcing janitorial 
positions and related maintenance work. </p>
<p>BCTD: TOYOTA BUILDS UNION -- The AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades 
Department reached a project labor agreement covering the construction of Toyota Motor Corp.'s 
T100 pickup truck manufacturing facility near Princeton, Ind. The construction, valued in excess of 
$700 million, is scheduled to start this spring and be completed in 1998. BCTD has a similar 
agreement at Toyota's billion-dollar facility in Georgetown, Ky. </p>
<p>COALITIONS WORK -- AFSCME Council 31 in Godfrey, Ill., has gained allies in its two-year 
struggle for a contract with a privately owned agency for the developmentally disabled. Union 
members lobbied meetings and used community support to encourage the local village board not to 
issue tax-free bonds to finance a new building for the company, Beverly Farm, which receives state 
and federal operating funds. The NLRB has issued seven complaints against the company. </p>
<p>CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE -- AFL-CIO Executive Vice President ChavezThompson keynoted 
the federation's annual Civil and Human Rights Institute, held April 14-18 at the Meany Center for 
Labor Studies in Silver Spring, Md. President Sweeney and Secretary- Treasurer Trumka also are 
addressing the participants, who will hear about the AFL-CIO's plans to mobilize workers for the 
1996 elections and to beef up organizing, as well as discuss such issues as the future of affirmative 
action, immigration and working women. Other speakers include AFL-CIO Vice Presidents Gloria 
Johnson and Clayola Brown, Organizing Director Richard Bensinger and Working Women's 
Director Karen Nussbaum. </p>
<p>NLRB BACKS NURSES -- The National Labor Relations Board has gone to court to force 
Columbia/HCA Inc. to bargain with the Nurses Professional Organization, an AFSCME affiliate, at 
the Audubon Regional Medical Center in Louisville, Ky. Columbia/HCA, the nation's largest 
for-profit hospital chain, waged an illegal antiunion campaign, threatening reprisals if nurses voted in 
the union and announcing last-minute wage and benefit improvements before the election. The 
board petitioned the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky to order the 
bargaining pending its final disposition of the cases. </p>
<p>TOMA-TEK &quot;SLAPPED&quot; -- A California judge dismissed a trumped-up lawsuit by Toma-Tek 
designed to punish employees and union organizers for exercising their right of free speech. The 
tactic, known as strategic litigation against public participation, or a SLAPP suit, often is used by 
companies to try to intimidate or silence workers and community groups or tie them up in endless 
litigation. Toma-Tek, a tomato processing company, sued the Teamsters on the pretext of trespass 
and &quot;misappropriation of trade secrets&quot; after the union presented a petition signed by 2,400 
employees asking the company to obey the law and respect the right of workers in a representation 
election. INTERNATIONAL SAFETY OBSERVANCE -- April 28, the 8th annual Workers 
Memorial Day, will be marked by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions as the first 
international day of mourning in remembrance of the 200,000 workers who are killed and the 1.2 
million injured on the job each year. The ICFTU is coordinating the event in conjunction with the 
United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development. April 28 also marks the 25th anniversary 
of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. For more information, contact the AFL-CIO 
Occupational Safety and Health Department at 202/637-5367 or follow the information highway to 
LaborNET or the World Wide Web at www.aflcio.org. </p>
<p>RAIL STRIKE POSSIBLE -- The National Mediation Board released the Transportation 
Communications Union from mediation, and rail workers are bracing themselves for a possible 
national strike as management continues to resist productive negotiations. TCU opened talks Nov. 
1, 1994, only to be told by carriers that its members were overpaid and that work-rule concessions 
and huge rollbacks in health and welfare coverage would be needed. Last August, local officers 
voted 403-2 to strike, and the union declared an impasse. The United Transportation Union, 
meanwhile, agreed to binding arbitration with the carriers. </p>
<p>GM STRIKE AVERTED -- Members of Electronic Workers Local 775 on April 12 ratified a 
contract at two General Motors Delphi Chassis plants in Kettering, Ohio, averting a strike. If the 
2,700 production and maintenance workers had struck, the fallout could have shut down most of 
GM's assembly plants, the same as last month's 18-day strike by the UAW against two other 
Delphi plants in nearby Dayton. The agreement contains language strengthening subcontract 
protection for skilled employees. </p>
<p>TRAILMOBILE LOCKOUT -- Representatives of 1,200 locked-out Paperworkers at 
Trailmobile's Charleston, Ill., plant brought their case to the company's U.S. headquarters in 
Chicago April 11. Trailmobile is owned by Indonesian-based Gemala Group, which has strong ties 
to that country's repressive military regime. The workers were locked out Jan. 21 after they 
rejected company demands to continue a four-year wage freeze for another three years and to 
eliminate certain job classifications, which would cost some 300 workers as much as $1 an hour in 
wages. The UPIU has globalized their struggle by seeking help from trade unions in Australia, 
where Gemala has several joint ventures. </p>
<p>BEVERLY FIGHT ESCALATES -- Hundreds of &quot;permanently replaced&quot; Beverly nursing home 
workers from Pennsylvania will be joined Wednesday by Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and members of 
the Pennsylvania congressional delegation at a rally and protest on Capitol Hill. The Service 
Employees also took their fight for dignity on behalf of nursing home workers to major shareholders 
of Beverly Enterprises Inc. --Mellon Bank, Wellington Management Investment Co. and Loomis 
Sayles Co., a subsidiary of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. The shareholder campaign 
against unfair labor practices comes after more than 300 NLRB charges filed against the company 
for its treatment of workers in 20 Pennsylvania facilities. Trial has been scheduled for May 14. </p>
<p>CONFLICT RESOLUTION -- AFL-CIO President Emeritus Thomas R. Donahue joined with 
William L. Lurie, former president of the Business Roundtable, and veteran labor mediator 
Theodore W. Kheel in launching a new Foundation for Prevention and Early Resolution of Conflict. 
PERC's focus will include labor-management, business, community, environmental and civil rights 
dispute prevention and resolution. The organization also has entered into a strategic alliance with 
Cornell University, which plans to establish a Cornell/PERC institute to study the prevention and 
resolution of conflict. </p>
<p>PRESIDENT'S PENSION REFORM -- President Clinton last week proposed to Congress 
reforms in pension laws that would help some 51 million workers. &quot;This proposal would help stop 
the erosion of private pension coverage in America,&quot; President Sweeney said. He warned that 
Americans face a decrease in private pensions and radical proposals to privatize Social Security. 
The reform provisions include new protections for state and local government employees, increased 
penalties for corporate misuse of pensions funds, 401(k) portability and broader eligibility and 
withdrawal rules for Individual Retirement Accounts. </p>
<p>PAY EQUITY -- President Clinton issued a proclamation decreeing April 11 as National Pay 
Inequity Awareness Day. In the notice, Clinton urges &quot;all employers to review their wage-setting 
practices and to see that their employees, particularly women and people of color, are paid fairly 
for their work.&quot; </p>
<p>AMERICA SPEAKS -- Roll-ins from the AFL-CIO special convention have been combined into 
a 10-minute video with excerpts from the speeches of Sweeney and Vice President Gore. Contact 
the AFL-CIO Department of Public Affairs, Broadcast Division at 202/637-5334. </p>

<h2 align=center>AFL-CIO Work in Progress,<br>
Tuesday, April 9, 1996 </h2>
<p>FLUNKING LAWMAKERS -- This week, AFL-CIO unions will be grading 33 members of 
Congress on their actions affecting working families. Not one has a passing grade-point average -- 
cementing their status as the bottom of the class. State and local union officials will announce the 
grades at media events in many of the districts, and more than 400,000 union members in those 
areas will receive &quot;report cards&quot; on their representatives in the mail. </p>
<p>RAISING MINIMUM WAGE -- Recess activities also will include television and radio spots in 
31 districts of flunking lawmakers, focusing on lawmakers' failure to support legislation to increase 
the minimum wage. The ads note that the member of Congress &quot;voted to block a minimum wage 
increase . . . after he/she/they voted to cut Medicare and cut college loans, all to give a tax break to 
the rich.&quot; They urge viewers and listeners to tell their members of Congress to raise the minimum 
wage. </p>
<p>THE CAMPAIGN TRAIN -- Round two of the AFL-CIO's grass-roots training program gets 
under way this week, with more than 40 staffers from affiliated unions taking part in the National 
Labor Political Training Center's week-long classes. The activists will hone such vital political 
campaign skills as organizing district grass-roots committees, get-out-the-vote techniques and 
media relations. Graduates from the center will be in the field until the elections, recruiting and 
training some 3,000 rank-and-file volunteers. </p>
<p>LABORERS ORGANIZE AN INDUSTRY -- A celebration/ratification of an industrywide 
agreement covering three-fourths of New York City's asbestos workers under a Laborers contract 
will be held April 11. LIUNA Local 78 gained 1,500 new members by renewing its organizing 
efforts after coming under trusteeship as part of LIUNA's Mason Tenders District Council. During 
the past four months, the local made 1,600 house calls, exposed the lethal working conditions and 
used a variety of other tactics to gain support for the workers' cause. The union also helped the 
Polish and Latino work force understand their rights. The LIUNA general board recently 
reorganized the Mason Tenders into two newly chartered locals -- one representing building 
workers and the other covering asbestos and lead abatement workers. </p>
<p>8,000 NEW MEMBERS -- An affiliation agreement with the National Federation of Independent 
Unions will bring LIUNA 8,000 new members. Pointing to NFIU's diversity of jobs, LIUNA 
President Arthur A. Coia called the merger &quot;a perfect match.&quot; The NFIU's largest affiliate, the 
2,100-member United Independent Union based in Philadelphia, already has approved the merger, 
with the others expected to follow suit. </p>
<p>UNIONIZING DOUBLE-BREASTERS -- The <a href="http://www.teamster.org/">Teamsters,</a> which battled Ryder Corp.'s practice 
of double-breasting in a strike last fall, won the right to represent workers at QAT in Petersburg, 
Va., one of the nonunion subsidiaries the carhauler had used to avoid providing union wages and 
working conditions. In another victory, IBT gained workers at the Super Shuttle at Phoenix's Sky 
Harbor Airport last week. The election victory comes in the midst of mail balloting by more than 
700 America West mechanics, mostly in Phoenix, who also are deciding on IBT representation. </p>
<p>NAVY WORKERS GO IUE -- Some 130 Loral Training and Technical Services workers at Van 
Voorhis Naval Air Station, Nev., voted for representation by the Electronic Workers in balloting 
last month. The unit has been chartered as IUE Local 1177. In a campaign lasting 15 months, the 
workers -- who are highly specialized in the training of U.S. military combat pilots -- voted 82-40 
in favor of IUE. </p>
<p>SEIU WINS BIG -- The <a href="http://www.seiu.org/">Service Employees</a> were victors in three separate organizing campaigns, 
including one in Florida that would double the size of its Local 362. Member organizers from that 
local, representing 1,300 workers at Disney World, helped in the campaign to organize 1,300 
administrative and service employees of the Lake County, Fla., School District. The vote was 
665-189. Meanwhile, about 200 Head Start workers at the East Baton Rouge (La.) City/Parish 
Government voted 110-53 for SEIU, and the union won its third victory in a series of four elections 
necessary to represent the 450 drivers at Bernie Bus Co. in Syracuse, N.Y. </p>
<p>PRESS ON DETROIT -- AFL-CIO President Sweeney, Secretary-Treasurer Trumka and 
Executive Vice President Chavez-Thompson will add their voices to the call for justice in Detroit at 
a major rally in support of striking newspaper workers next Sunday, April 14. Sweeney also will 
address the Council on Competitiveness in Washington and the Kennedy Library Forum in Boston 
on April 11, and participate in a Minnesota Economic Forum April 12. Chavez-Thompson 
addresses a Workers' Rights Conference in Arlington, Texas, on April 10. </p>
<p>DO NOT BUY USA TODAY -- In a letter to union presidents, AFL-CIO President John 
Sweeney has urged support for a &quot;do not buy, do not advertise&quot; campaign against USA TODAY, 
the flagship of Gannett Publishing, which owns the struck Detroit News. The AFL-CIO, through its 
Strategic Approaches Committee, is coordinating a program of support for workers who have 
been on strike for nine months at Detroit's two newspapers, the News and Detroit Free Press, 
owned by Knight-Ridder. &quot;I hope you will consider asking your employers not to patronize USA 
Today until the strike is settled, and ask them to tell Gannett why they are taking the action,&quot; 
Sweeney wrote. The federation also has launched a campaign against The Miami Herald, 
Knight-Ridder's flagship, by asking South Florida union members to cancel their subscriptions. 
Sweeney urged unions to contribute to the DNA Strike Relief Fund, Detroit Metropolitan 
AFL-CIO, 2550 West Grand Blvd., Detroit, Mich. 48208. Unions and individuals wishing to 
advertise in the strikers' Sunday Journal should contact William Brown, publisher, at 3100 East 
Jefferson, Detroit, Mich. 48207; phone 313/567-9818. </p>
<p>NO PLACE FOR BRUTALITY -- The recent police beatings of two Mexican immigrants in Los 
Angeles &quot;has hit close to home for the labor movement,&quot; Executive Vice President Linda 
Chavez-Thompson said, recalling the use of police batons against janitors marching peacefully in 
Century City and on peaceful drywall construction workers in Southern California. &quot;Our movement 
will not tolerate police brutality nor will we excuse officers because the situation is volatile,&quot; she 
said. &quot;This is not a question of immigration rights, but of basic civil and human rights.&quot; </p>
<p>DIGNITY FOR NURSING HOME WORKERS -- Some 1,200 members of the Service 
Employees from 15 Beverly Enterprises nursing homes in Pennsylvania who went out on an unfair 
labor practices strike April 1 made an unconditional offer to return to work April 4 -- only for 
some to be told they would be permanently replaced. On the first shift, some 150 workers found 
they would not be allowed to return to work -- with some barred by security guards from entering 
facilities. Beverly said in an April 3 news conference it intended to replace one-third of the strikers. </p>
<p>OUTSOURCING RILES UAW -- Delegates to the <a href="http://www.uaw.org/">UAW</a> bargaining convention easily approved 
resolutions that direct union officials to get tough with the Big Three automakers over the use of 
outside, nonunion parts suppliers. Delegates also took a strong stand against health care cutbacks 
and called for less overtime in favor of hiring more workers. Contract talks with the Big Three 
begin in June. National contracts covering 400,000 UAW members at General Motors, Ford and 
Chrysler expire Sept. 14. </p>
<p>JUSTICE IN JEOPARDY -- Federal funding for the Legal Services Corp. is threatened by the 
GOP-led Congress, which also seeks to impose restrictions on legal workers for the poor. The 
National Organization of Legal Services Workers, UAW Local 2320, asks unionists to contact 
their member of Congress during the Easter recess to insist that poor people continue to have 
access to the judicial system. </p>
<p>HIT/BIT GROUND BREAKINGS -- The AFL-CIO's Housing and Investment Trusts will break 
ground for two new projects. On April 9, Executive Vice President Chavez-Thompson will join 
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros at the ground-breaking ceremony for 
El Azteca housing development in Laredo, Texas. HIT is providing $1.1 million of the $3.4 million 
total cost of the project, which will provide low-income housing for 50 families. The next day, BIT 
will break ground in West Patterson, N.J., for the West Falls Plaza retail center. BIT is providing 
the $12 million needed to build the center. </p>
<p>MECHANICS' MEDICAL FUND -- A health insurance fund has been established to assist 
America West Airline mechanics fired last December. Those who were fired and those still working 
now are participating in the IBT balloting. Contributions can be made to the &quot;Fired America West 
Family Medical Fund&quot; through Bank of America, Account No. 235176969, or may be sent to 
IBT, 4444 West Northern Ave., Suite A-2, Glendale, Ariz. 85301. </p>
<p>ELECTION EARLY BIRD -- AFGE President John N. Sturdivant handed out leaflets during the 
morning rush hour on April 8 at the Virginia Rail Express station to kick off the union's efforts to 
educate federal employees about political issues and encourage voter registration to turn out record 
numbers of government workers on Election Day. The union handouts urge federal workers to take 
advantage of their newfound political freedoms under Hatch Act reform. </p>
<p>WORKERS' FUTURE -- The National Skills Standards Board, comprised of representatives 
from labor, business, education and civil rights organizations, has scheduled public hearings across 
the country to address U.S. worker concerns as it continues its efforts to develop the skills 
standards. The hearings will be held April 9 at the Kansas City Marriot Downtown in Kansas City, 
Mo.; April 11 at the Crowne Plaza Phoenix in Arizona; and April 15 at the Crowne Plaza Miami. 
For more information, contact Sally Conway at 202/254-8628. </p>
<p>MASTER APPAREL -- Employees of Master Apparel demonstrated April 1 outside the gates of 
the Summerville, Tenn., clothing manufacturer to protest the company's refusal to bargain in good 
faith on a new contract. Willie Rudd, president of IUE's furniture workers' division, led the march. 
The AFL-CIO has placed Master Apparel men's and boys' pants on its <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/boycott.htm">boycott list.</a> The pants are 
sold under the &quot;Botany 500&quot; label at Kmart, under &quot;Hills and Archer&quot; at Montgomery Ward and 
under &quot;Blair&quot; through the Blair mail order company. </p>
<p>FREE TRADE TOO EXPENSIVE -- The Commerce Department reported the biggest jump in 
the U.S. trade deficit in January in six months. The deficit in manufactured goods reached $14.4 
billion, compared with $13.8 billion a year earlier. Meanwhile, trade ministers meeting in Colombia 
seeking extension of free trade throughout the hemisphere were greeted by a poll indicating that 
only 24 percent of U.S. citizens think that so-called free trade agreements result in more U.S. jobs. </p>

<h2 align="center">AFL-CIO Work in Progress -- April 2, 1996</h2>
<p>UNION SUMMER BLOOMS -- <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/usummer">Union
Summer</a>, which will send hundreds of young activists around
the country to participate in union organizing drives and
get-out-the-vote activity, is focusing recruitment on children of
union members and young adult union members. More than 500
applications have been received, with 80 new applications coming
in each week. While applications will be taken all summer, those
wanting to participate in the June session are urged to get their
paperwork in by April 15. Site selections will be announced
throughout the summer, with the first announcement expected in
April. For information, call 800/952-2550, <a
href="mailto:organizers@aol.com">e-mail</a>, or see the <a
href="http://www.aflcio.org/usummer">Web site</a>. </p>
<p>FOOLS ON THE HILL -- Members of Congress (who earn $140,000
annually), led by GOP stalwarts, said &quot;no&quot; to a minimum
wage increase last week in both chambers. The minimum wage, which
comes to less than $9,000 a year for a full-time worker, has been
unchanged since 1991. Even with the help of eight Republicans,
Senate Democrats were unable to shut off a filibuster led by
presidential candidate and Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
and allow a vote on a measure to raise the benchmark hourly rate
from $4.25 to $5.15 over two years. Democrats have vowed to keep
bringing up the legislation. </p>
<p>GENERAL BOARD SELECTIONS -- AFL-CIO President <a
href="http://www.aflcio.org/sweeney.htm">John Sweeney</a>
announced the selection of four regional state federation
representatives to serve on the General Board, and the formation
of a 20-member State and Central Labor Council Advisory Committee
that will make recommendations to the federation. The regional
representatives are Frank Montanaro (Rhode Island) for the
Northeast; Daniel LeBlanc (Virginia) for the South; Daniel J.
&quot;Duke&quot; McVey (Missouri) for the Midwest; and Claude
&quot;Blackie&quot; Evans (Nevada) for the West. An additional
four members of the advisory committee will be elected during a
national conference for local AFL-CIOs in July. </p>
<p>ORGANIZING CORRECTIONS -- The <a href="http://www.cwa.org/">Communications
Workers</a> now includes some 9,000 corrections and probation
officers in Florida who affiliated with the National Coalition of
Public Safety Officers. The new CWA division represents law
enforcement workers in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. </p>
<p>WALL-TO-WALL PUSH -- The <a href="http://www.seiu.org/">Service
Employees</a> are coming off two recent victories in New York and
Chicago. Service and maintenance workers at St. Bernard's
Hospital in Chicago voted 154-95 for representation by SEIU,
while the local also has filed on the clerical and technical unit
in a wall-to-wall strategy that eventually has a goal of
organizing registered nurses at the facility. Meanwhile, workers
at the George Junior rehabilitation facility in upstate New York
voted 59-53 for SEIU. They, too, have filed on the remaining unit
of about 40 teachers at the facility for troubled youth. </p>
<p>AMERICA WEST -- Sweeney added his voice and support for
mechanics at America West Airlines who are voting by mail for <a
href="http://www.teamster.org/">Teamster </a>representation after
the company fired 500 workers. &quot;The decision by the National
Mediation Board to send ballots to all America West workers --
those fired and those still working -- is a great victory for
you,&quot; he said. The ballots will be counted April 17. </p>
<p>UNION WOMEN GO TO SCHOOL -- The AFL-CIO Department of
Education and the University and College Labor Education
Association will sponsor four week-long residential schools to
educate female trade unionists. The 1996 Regional Summer Schools
for Union Women are: Western Women's Institute, June 5-9 at San
Francisco State University, contact Brenda Cochrane at 415/338-
2885; Southern School for Union Women, Aug. 11-16 at the George
Meany Center for Labor Studies, contact Brenda R. Moon at
202/637- 5331; Northeast Women's School, July 21-26 at Penn
State, contact Frieda S. Rozen at 814/865-5425; and Midwest
School for Women Workers, July 28-Aug. 2 at Indiana University,
contact Jean Troutman-Poole at 219/237-4469. </p>
<p>NEW HAVEN FOR ACTION -- Yale University food service and
custodial workers walked out March 27, shutting down 22 dining
halls and leaving trash uncollected. The strike began after talks
between Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Local 35 and the
university broke down over Yale's decision to subcontract
services. The workers, along with members of HERE Local 34, have
been without a contract since Feb 7. No more talks have been
scheduled. Local 34, which represents clerical workers, staged a
30-day strike that ended March 6. They were supported by the
1,100 workers in Local 35, who remained on the job and shared
their wages with the striking employees. </p>
<p>EYE ON SWEATSHOPS -- With news accounts documenting immigrants
locked behind closed doors and forced to work intolerable hours
in inhuman conditions, UNITE has focused attention on the renewed
fight against sweatshops with the release of art that will be
mass produced for T-shirts and shopping bags. The art, which
mixes words and images, includes a reproduction of a woman's head
in black and grey, with the message &quot;These clothes were not
made by exploited women and children in non-union
sweatshops.&quot; </p>
<p>SWEATSHOPS TWO -- AFL-CIO Executive Vice President <a
href="http://www.aflcio.org/chavez.htm">Linda Chavez-Thompson</a>
toured the L.A. sweatshop district and met with workers from the
El Monte shops, where last summer 70 Thais were discovered
working in virtual slavery conditions. Her March 29 visit
coincided with an announcement by the Labor Department and a
coalition of labor, consumer and religious organizations of a
national campaign to raise public awareness of continued worker
abuse in the U.S. garment industry. The campaign will include
&quot;NO SWEAT&quot; logos on products and &quot;Clues for
Consumers&quot; -- tips for shoppers who want to support efforts
to end sweatshops. </p>
<p>TAKING TO THE BRICKS -- More than 1,000 nursing home workers
employed at 15 homes run by Beverly Enterprises across
Pennsylvania began an unfair labor practices strike April 1. The
Service Employees members were forced out by &quot;Beverly's
flagrant disregard for the law,&quot; according to SEIU. More
than 200 charges are pending against the company, with the
National Labor Relations Board on record that &quot;Beverly is
illegally imposing harsh and restrictive work values designed to
silence Beverly workers.&quot; A rally is planned in Harrisburg
at the Capitol rotunda April 2. Unionists in Pennsylvania can
call a toll-free number for more information -- 800/797-8890. </p>
<p>DETROIT ARRESTS -- Detroit AFL-CIO President Edgar A. Scribner
and 64 other union officials were arrested outside the Detroit
Free Press building March 28 after protesting the Detroit
Newspaper Agency's failure to negotiate an end to the
nine-month-old newspaper strike. &quot;We are here to make it
clear they can't beat us in Detroit,&quot; Scribner said. The
presidents of 17 <a href="http://www.uaw.org/">UAW </a>locals
were arrested along with the leadership of UAW Region 1A and
officers of the Detroit AFL-CIO, <a href="http://www.afscme.org/">AFSCME</a>,
Seafarers, Roofers and Graphic Communications. The protest was
the fourth sponsored by Readers United, an independent Detroit
citizens group. The NLRB delayed hearings scheduled for March 25
on unfair labor practices charges filed by the workers against
the Detroit newspapers. No new date has been set. </p>
<p>NEW PACT FOR EQUITY -- Actors' Equity and the League of
Resident Theatres have reached agreement on a three-year contract
covering some 7,000 actors and stage managers at 64 theaters
across the country. The pact, which calls for salary increases of
more than 9 percent for actors in the largest-grossing theaters
and 4 percent in the smallest-grossing theaters over term,
improved safety conditions and health contributions, goes to
Equity's Council April 8 for determination of membership
ratification procedures. Theaters that operate under the LORT
agreement include Lincoln Center Theatre in New York City, the
Goodman Theatre in Chicago, the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles,
the American Repertory Theatre near Boston and Arena Stage in
Washington. </p>
<p>TIES THAT BIND -- Transportation Communications Union members
ended a 21-day strike March 28 at a Koppers Industries railroad
tie treatment facility in Somerville, Texas, after management had
threatened to hire permanent replacements. The strike had spread
to a plant in Galesburg, Ill., after the company shifted struck
work there. TCU struck March 8 after seven months of negotiations
failed to achieve any progress toward reaching a first
settlement. Union President Bob Scardelletti pledged TCU
&quot;will use the streength and experience forged in this
struggle every single day as we continue the fight for economic
justice.&quot; United Transportation Union President Charles
Little had offered UTU's support and cooperation to the Koppers
strikers. </p>
<p>PUBLIC EMPLOYEES DENIED -- State and local employees would be
denied the same job protections afforded federal or
private-sector workers if preliminary labor law recommendations
from the independent Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental
Relations are adopted, union officials said at a March 26 public
hearing. The ACIR's preliminary recommendations, which were
released Jan. 24, would repeal provisions of the Fair Labor
Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the
Family and Medical Leave Act that extend coverage of these
statutes to state and local governments. Addressing the hearing
were AFL-CIO Public Employee Department President Al Bilik and
James Sheedy, president of the Public Employees Federation of New
York State. </p>
<p>PENSION MAKE-GOODS -- The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.
announced it will inform about 135,000 people whose pension plans
ended between 1976 and 1981 that a proposed settlement is
expected to pay some 40,000 of them additional pension benefits.
The class- action suit, filed in 1988, was brought on behalf of
workers whose pension plans were not amended to comply with
shorter vesting standards required with the passage of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act in 1974. A toll-free
telephone number, 800/316-8857, is available for information. </p>
<p>UNION WOMEN GO TO SCHOOL -- The AFL-CIO Department of
Education and the University and College Labor Association will
sponsor four-week-long residential schools to educate female
trade unionists. The 1996 Regional Summer Schools for Union Women
are: Western Women's Institute, June 5-9 at San Francisco State
Univesity, contact Brenda Cochrane at 415/338-2885; Southern
School for Union Women, Aug. 11-16 at the George Meany Center for
Labor Studies, contact Brenda R. Moon at 202/637-5331 Northeast
Women's School, July 21-26 at Penn State, contact Frieda S. Rozen
at 814/865-5425; and Midwest School for Women Workers, July
28-Aug. 2 at Indiana University, contact Jean Troutman-Poole at

<h2 align="center">AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h2>
<h3 align="center">March 26, 1996</h3>
<p>WORKING FAMILIES FOR CLINTON _ An historic special convention
of the AFL-CIO overwhelmingly endorsed President Clinton and Vice
President Gore for re-election after a process that
Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka said is a signal that labor is
&quot;doing things differently when it comes to politics.&quot;
The decision to endorse Clinton came after surveys of members by
AFL-CIO unions and comparisons of the Clinton record and
positions vs. those of Sen. Bob Dole, the Republican nominee.
Polls show that workers have moved to Clinton after 14 months of
Republican attacks on working families. In a head-to-head matchup
with Dole, union members prefer Clinton 67 percent to 22 percent.
Two-thirds of members said they would approve of their union
endorsing Clinton. Candidates Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot both
are held in low regard by union members, drawing a positive
opinion from only 16 percent and 27 percent, respectively. </p>
<p>CLINTON FOR WORKING FAMILIES _ Gore, addressing the convention
after the endorsement, contrasted the &quot;glaring&quot;
difference between the Clinton record and that of the
Gingrich/Dole Republicans, and promised that he and Clinton would
&quot;speak up loudly, boldly and clearly&quot; for working
families during the campaign. Gore also sent a message to
Republicans who have trumpeted that organized labor is dead.
&quot;As long as you are out of step with the values of American
families, you will not prevail,&quot; he warned. &quot;America's
working families and those who defend them are here to stay. And
we will prevail.&quot; </p>
<p>POLITICAL ACTION _ The nearly 500 delegates to the convention,
the first special convention since the merger of the AFL and CIO,
approved an assessment on affiliated unions of 15 cents per
member per month to fund a $35 million political campaign that
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said would &quot;tell the
truth&quot; about downsizing and layoffs for short-term stock
manipulation, and the stagnant incomes for workers. Unions also
will tell the truth about Newt Gingrich and other radical GOP
congressional leaders who have attacked programs for workers
while they &quot;do the bidding of their corporate patrons.&quot;
While raising the critical issues affecting working families, the
AFL-CIO program will train 3,000 union activists for
get-out-the-vote activity this year, and build a permanent
network of grass-roots activists in every congressional district. </p>
<p>HATCHET JOB ON LABOR _ Sweeney had a warning for delegates:
&quot;Over the next few months, as our grass-roots legislative
and political program grows and begins to take hold, you are
going to witness the biggest smear campaign, the biggest
disinformation campaign in the history of American
politics.&quot; That GOP smear campaign began March 21 in the
House Oversight Committee with sham hearings to attack the
federation's legislative work. House Democrats called it an
&quot;inquisition&quot; against unions as they walked out.
&quot;The radical right . . . will attempt to convince America
our voice should be stilled _ despite the fact that ours is the
only voice in this country that speaks expressly for working
families,&quot; Sweeney said. </p>
<p>MOTHER OF REINVENTION _ AFGE President Sturdivant saluted the
Clinton-Gore administration March 25 at a conference on federal
&quot;reinvention.&quot; Clinton and Gore &quot;did not see the
federal employee as an obstacle on the road to change,&quot; he
said, &quot;and recognized that labor unions and management have
a mutual interest in making government work better.&quot; The
conference, convened by Gore and the National Performance Review,
runs through March 27 at the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md. </p>
<p>ORGANIZE AND ENFRANCHISE _ Political action for AFGE includes
an organizing campaign. &quot;Every time we sign up a new member
we will register them to vote,&quot; Sturdivant told reporters
March 20. &quot;The shutdown has taught us some hard political
lessons that we won't soon forget.&quot; Beginning April 1, a
&quot;Bonus Bucks/Passion and Power&quot; campaign will offer
cash incentives for member-organizers to sign new members. </p>
<p>&quot;THOSE WITHOUT SHAME&quot; _ Executive Vice President
Linda Chavez-Thompson, introducing the resolution to fund a $35
million political effort, said Latinos have a word for Republican
extremists who have sought to cut Medicare, Medicaid, college
loans, worker safety and health and labor protections _ sin
verg|enza<d>s, &quot;those without shame.&quot; Union members did
not realize that their votes in November 1994 would lead to this,
she said, &quot;but we exposed them with a broad communications
program. We spent $7 million educating our members and the
general public and we stopped the &quot;Contract With
America&quot; dead in its tracks. Now we need to spend about
seven times that much to bury it six feet under. </p>
<p>UAW EASES UP ON GM BRAKES _ Striking <a
href="http://www.uaw.org/">UAW</a> members returned to work March
22 after ratifying a new agreement with General Motors, ending a
17-day strike that idled most of the giant automaker's assembly
plants, forced the layoff of 177,000 workers and generated losses
to GM of up to $50 million a day. The two sides agreed that GM
would add 275 jobs to the Dayton, Ohio, brake plant to reduce
overtime and provide ergonomic relief in various jobs. The
company also agreed to replace work that was lost as a result of
contracting out antilock brake work. </p>
<p>FEDEX PACT TAKES FLIGHT _ The <a
href="http://www.fedex-alpa.org/fedex-alpa/">Air Line Pilots</a>
reached a tentative agreement with Federal Express Corp. that
features increased compensation and enhanced retirement benefits
for 3,000 pilots. The tentative pact resolves a &quot;scope&quot;
issue relating to the scheduling of bargaining-unit pilots, links
some pay raises to corporate profitability and implements
work-rule changes. No date has been set for balloting, but the
union has indicated it will move expeditiously to present the
agreement to the council and to the membership. </p>
<p>WORKERS BEAT BALLENGER _ Local union activists can take pride
in Rep. Cass Ballenger's decision to abandon legislation that
would gut the nation's job safety laws, said President Sweeney,
who credited &quot;their efforts to hold Washington accountable
that stopped this legislation.&quot; Teamsters President Ron
Carey said Ballenger's announcement means &quot;Newt Gingrich and
Bob Dole are putting their anti- worker attack dogs on a shorter
leash during the election.&quot; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.osha.gov/">OSHA</a> SILVER LINING _ April
28th, the 8th annual observance of Workers Memorial Day, marks
the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act, the nation's landmark job safety legislation.
With the statute under dire threat from extremists in Congress,
workers have a special opportunity to spotlight the need for job
safety this Workers Memorial Day. For information and materials
to help you plan your event, phone 202/637-5367 or FAX 202/508-
6978; or visit the World Wide Web site at <a
href="http://www.aflcio.org">www.aflcio.org</a>. </p>
<p>BLUE-LIGHT SPECIAL _ More than 1,000 labor and civil rights
activists protested and 41 persons were arrested March 24 at an
Atlanta Kmart store as UNITE kicked off a national campaign
against discrimination at a Kmart distribution center in
Greensboro, N.C. Workers at the Greensboro facility, mostly
African-Americans and other people of color, receive an average
of $4 less than white workers at Kmart's other hardline centers.
Those arrested included Bruce Raynor, UNITE's executive vice
president and southern regional director, Clayola Brown, the
union's civil rights director, Norman Hill, president of the A.
Philip Randolph Institute, William Lucy, <a
href="http://www.afscme.org/">AFSCME</a> secretary-treasurer,
Stewart Acuff, president of the Atlanta Labor Council and Richard
Womack, AFL-CIO civil rights director. </p>
<p>LEARN WHILE YOU EARN _ The <a href="http://www.cwa.org/">Communications
Workers</a> and US West signed a &quot;first in the
industry&quot; joint apprenticeship program establishing academic
and technical standards to help new workers gain the skills and
knowledge they need in the telecommunications industry. The
three-year apprenticeships will kick off in Washington state,
where workers will learn skills to establish and repair
telecommunications services for customers. </p>
<p>EARN WHILE YOU LEARN _ Members of the Painters will be able to
turn their union training into college credits thanks to an
agreement signed between the union and Marshall University in
West Virginia. The credits can be applied toward an associate
degree in applied science. The union &quot;is about more than
jobs in the painting and allied trades; it's about creating
careers in our industries,&quot; said A.L. &quot;Mike&quot;
Monroe, PAT president. </p>
<p>APPEALING ON SCABS _ A decision by a three-judge panel of the
U.S. Circuit of Appeals for the District of Columbia to strike
down President Clinton's executive order barring federal agencies
from doing business with companies that replace striking workers
should be reconsidered by the full court, the administration
said. &quot;The executive order is fair and based on a proper
reading of the president's procurement authority,&quot; Labor
Secretary Robert B. Reich said. &quot;Strikes involving
replacement workers are long, bitter, and pose a threat to
federal procurement. I am confident that the court will
ultimately reconsider its ruling and uphold the president's
executive order.&quot; </p>
<p>STRIKE IMMINENT AT BEVERLY _ Service Employees at Beverly
Enterprise facilities are poised to launch the largest nursing
home strike in Pennsylvania history on Friday. &quot;The workers
are fed up with Beverly's flagrant disregard for the law, and we
are prepared to strike to protest non-stop vicious attacks on our
members' rights,&quot; said District 1199P President Tom DeBruin.
Beverly, the nation's largest nursing home operator with over 700
facilities, 72 in the state, is the target of federal prosecution
for numerous labor law violations, and was cited last year by the
General Accounting Office as the nation's leading law violator
among 14 federal contractors. </p>
<p>U-6: FRIDAY, BLOODY FRIDAY _ The federal government has begun
reporting an official alternative unemployment rate that takes
into account discouraged workers, all other &quot;marginally
attached&quot; workers and persons working part time for economic
reasons. The new reporting system was urged by the AFL-CIO and
other members of the Americans for Democratic Action's First
Friday coalition. Using a methodology formally called
&quot;U-6,&quot; the new data will provide a broader, more
representative picture of those facing the uncertainties of an
imperfect economy. In February for example, the alternative rate
of all those affected was 10.7 percent, nearly double the 5.5
percent conventional rate. With the <a
href="http://stats.bls.gov/blshome.htm">BLS</a> officially
blessing the more precise measurement, the AFL-CIO hopes the
media will begin to tell the whole story. </p>
<p>MUSHROOM CLOUD _ Some 150 harvesters were fired March 14 by
the Florida mushroom ranch, Quincy Farms, after a lunch- break
march demanding an end to worker abuses and a contract with the
Farm Workers. At the urging of management, UFW Vice President
Rebecca Flores-Harrington and some 30 laborers were arrested
after the march. The union is requesting all union members to
contact Chairman Dennis Zensen at Quincy's Pennsylvania-based
parent company, Sylvan Inc., at 412/295- 3910 or via fax at
412/295-4111. </p>

<h3 align="center">March 19, 1996</h3>
<p>POLITICAL OPENER _ More than 500 delegates are expected to
converge on Washington at the Capital Hilton March 25 for a
special convention devoted to the AFL-CIO's political efforts in
1996. Delegates will consider an ambitious nationwide program of
education and mobilization around issues important to working
families, and a special assessment on national unions of 15 cents
per member per month to help fund it. A possible presidential
endorsement also is on the agenda. Activity begins Sunday with a
meeting of central labor council leaders, and spills over into
Tuesday, when state federation officers gather to consider
statewide political campaigns. </p>
<p>UAW'S MESSAGE TO GM _ The UAW strike at two Dayton, Ohio,
General Motors brake plants continues to ripple across the
country, with 24 of 29 North American assembly plants and 44
parts plants closed, leading to layoffs of 111,550 workers. GM is
contesting unemployment benefits to workers laid off because of
the strike. Talks are continuing over the key issue of
outsourcing, which is expected to be a central focus for the
union in national contract talks later this year. The labor
movement is rallying behind the strikers. &quot;The other
employees that have been laid off understand the importance of GM
investing in GM and keeping good GM jobs there,&quot; AFL-CIO
Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka said. </p>
<p>SWEET VICTORY _ Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Local
217 is celebrating a 63-40 election victory at Trinity College in
Hartford, Conn., where the union will represent about 100
cafeteria workers employed by Marriott Management Services.
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney called to congratulate HERE
organizer Laura Moye, who is spearheading an effort to organize
low-wage workers across the Hartford area. &quot;This is just the
beginning,&quot; Moye said. &quot;These workers need a union, and
we're prepared to fight for them.&quot; </p>
<p>UNION IN STYLE _ Workers at Amity Dyeing and Finishing in
Augusta, Ga., voted overwhelmingly to join UNITE, making their
plant the last of Liz Claiborne's U.S. facilities to organize.
The 184 Amity workers were working without a pension plan, sick
days, shift differential and job security provisions, all
benefits enjoyed by their union brothers and sisters at other Liz
Claiborne plants. They voted 109-68 for the union on March 12. </p>
<p>RIGHT-TO-WORK SHAM _ A national &quot;right-to-work&quot; bill
has nothing to do with protecting rights, but &quot;is about
weakening unions, destroying democracy in the workplace and
forcing workers to labor for 20 percent less than they are now
earning,&quot; Montana AFL-CIO Executive Secretary Don Judge
testified March 15 before the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee. Judge led the successful fight against right to work
in Montana last year. Meanwhile, in Oklahoma, an effort to force
a right-to-work provision into another bill was rejected, 66-34,
in the House. </p>
<p>ALL-LABOR FIGHT AT KAISER _ President Sweeney will travel from
San Diego to Los Angeles to Oakland Tuesday for a series of
events to support the 30,000 embattled workers at HMO giant
Kaiser Permanente. Sweeney promised to &quot;renovate the HMO
that labor built&quot; through an escalating series of strategic
initiatives involving all 79 unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>COMMON SENSE ON WAGES _ Secretary-Treasurer Trumka, on CNBC-TV
March 14, responding to a question about raising the minimum wage
to $5.15 an hour: &quot;We have people who are working 40 hours a
week, 52 weeks a year and they still live in poverty. That's a
sin in a country like this and it doesn't have to be that way.
And the malarkey you hear _ `We have to pay these low wages to
stay competitive' _ it's just nonsensical because corporate
profits keep going up and up and up, corporate salaries for CEOs
keep going up and up and up. We ought to be sharing that, putting
it in the hands of consumers, so we can really grow an
economy.&quot; </p>
<p>FEWER DOLLARS, MORE DEATHS _ OSHA enforcement is on the
chopping block as Congress considers a bill to fund several
government agencies for the rest of the fiscal year. The House
version slashes the safety agency's enforcement budget by 21
percent and its overall budget by 10 percent. The Senate cuts 20
percent from enforcement and 7 percent overall. Field staff could
be cut by as many as 362 and ergonomic standards are stymied in
both. Other problem areas are education and the environment.
Congress avoided another partial government shutdown by passing a
temporary spending bill Friday, but that expires March 22. Call
your representatives and senators and urge them to restore OSHA
funding. </p>
<p>WORKPLACE VIOLENCE GUIDELINES _ New OSHA guidelines aimed at
preventing violence against health care and social service
workers were announced March 14 by Labor Secretary Robert Reich,
who was joined at a news conference by Merida Rodriguez of AFSCME
Local 420, Donna Edwards of AFSCME Local 112, Marcia Stulman of
Service Employees Local 4053 and Matthew Schultz of SEIU Local
1199RC. The guidelines offer employers common-sense solutions to
prevent workplace violence in the increasingly dangerous health
care and social service fields. </p>
<p>BRIDGESTONE AGAINST THE WORLD _ Representatives of unions from
14 countries joined the Steelworkers in a mass rally and
demonstration March 14 outside the U.S. headquarters of
Bridgestone/Firestone in Nashville. The marchers demanded that
the Japanese-owned tire manufacturer negotiate a fair contract
with its employees and rehire more than 700 workers not recalled
after a 10-month strike. &quot;Give them their damn jobs back.
That's what we want,&quot; USWA President George W. Becker
proclaimed as he opened the first international conference of
unions representing Bridgestone/Firestone employees. Said Vic
Thorpe, general secretary of the Brussels-based, 21
million-member International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine
and General Workers' Unions, &quot;We are frankly shocked at the
methods the multinational company has chosen to operate here in
the United States.&quot; </p>
<p>WOMEN ARRESTED IN DETROIT _ A Detroit city councilwoman, a
former state senator and AFSCME Vice President Gloria Cobbin were
among 44 women arrested in front of the Detroit News building
March 14. The peaceful demonstration was part of an ongoing
protest in support of Detroit newspaper strikers by Readers
United, an independent citizens group. &quot;Ending this strike
with a just contract is very important,&quot; said Lana Pollack,
a former state senator and U.S. Senate candidate. &quot;It's also
important to bring an arrogant corporate empire to accountability
under the law.&quot; The NLRB has filed unfair labor practice
complaints against the Gannett-owned Detroit News and
Knight-Ridder's Free Press for various illegal acts, including
&quot;permanently replacing&quot; the strikers. </p>
<p>WORKERS AWARDED MILLIONS _ In two settlements of Fair Labor
Standards Act lawsuits, SEIU has recovered $8.5 million in back
pay for some 21,000 workers. SEIU Local 2028 won $4.5 million for
700 San Diego County workers denied overtime pay, and some 20,000
will receive the final checks from a $4 million settlement with
the state of California, which violated the FLSA by failing to
pay the in-home health care workers on time during budget
impasses in 1990 and 1992. </p>
<p>WASHINGTON INC. THINK _ Hundreds of billions of dollars have
been &quot;diverted from the pockets of working-class Americans
into the bank accounts of America's financial elite,&quot;
declared Rep. Dave Obey (D- Wis.) March 11. He blamed public
policy driven by a network of conservative foundations, think
tanks and national magazines _ what he called &quot;Washington
Inc. Think&quot; _ that over 20 years has helped reshape American
economic policy &quot;from one that was based on the belief that
the needs of working families were as important as the needs of
raw markets to one based on the belief that the only thing that
mattered was the market forces.&quot; </p>
<p>AMERICA'S MOST UNWANTED _ The Teamsters have released a list
of &quot;America's Least Valuable Directors,&quot; 23 corporate
board members at companies marked by poor performance, excessive
executive compensation or both. Topping the list are former
defense secretary Frank Carlucci, 11-board member Vernon Jordan
and Marshall Criser, whose FPL Group reportedly lobbied for legal
changes to stifle shareholder dissent. IBT's report recommends
reforms in corporate governance, disclosure and proxy voting
procedures. </p>
<p>GETTING REAL _ The nation's 60-year-old labor laws no longer
fit the realities of an economy that includes the growing use of
contingent workers, a widening gap in wages between skilled and
low-skilled and the widespread lack of job security, AFL-CIO
General Counsel Jonathan Hiatt told an American Bar Association
audience made up mainly of management lawyers. To receive a copy
of his paper, &quot;Union Survival Strategies for the 21st
Century,&quot; call 202/637-5010. </p>
<p>WE'VE GOT A CONVOY _ Representatives of millions of truck
drivers and freight workers in the United States, Canada and
Mexico adopted an action plan to continue the delay on NAFTA
provisions on cross- border trucking that would hurt jobs,
highway safety and the environment. Included are educational palm
cards, messages on the Internet and CB radio, advertisements in
trade and general publications and joint research to support
organizing and contract campaigns. The plan was launched March 13
by both unionized and nonunion trucking groups at the NAFTA
Truckers' Summit in Chicago. </p>
<p>PRIDE AT WORK _ Pride at Work, the national organization of
gay and lesbian trade unionists, is planning its second biennial
conference in Oakland June 28-29. The conference will map out an
action plan for fighting right-wing attacks against both the
labor and lesbian/gay movements. The AFL-CIO opposes
discrimination based on sexual orientation, and President Sweeney
has written affiliates and local central bodies urging their
support of the conference. For information, contact Pride at
Work, 655 14th St., San Francisco, Calif. 94114; or call
415/861-0318. </p>
<p>DAUGHTERS TO WORK _ A Labor Guide is available for workers who
participate in &quot;Take Our Daughters to Work Day&quot; on
April 25. Participants will be eligible for a college scholarship
sweepstakes. For a free copy of the guide send a self-addressed 8
x 11 envelope with 78 cents postage to: KC Wagner, Cornell
University/NYSSILR, 16 East 34th St., 4th Floor, New York, N.Y.
10016; or call 212/340-2826. </p>
<p>STAND FOR CHILDREN _ Workers from across the country will
converge on the Lincoln Memorial June 1 for Stand For Children
Day. The event will focus on spiritual, family and community
renewal and personal commitment to children. It is sponsored by
the Children's Defense Fund and endorsed by the AFL-CIO and many
of its affiliated unions. For more information, call Marc Baldwin
at 202/637-5202. </p>

<h2 align=center>AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h2>
<p>BUDGET SHOWDOWN _ President Clinton has threatened to veto a GOP-crafted omnibus 
spending bill that would force cuts in education, training, OSHA and environmental programs. 
OSHA enforcement is cut back severely and the House bill includes a total ban on development, 
issuance and data collection for an ergonomic standard. The House passed the bill March 7 and the 
Senate will act this week. Current funding expires March 15 but may be extended for two weeks 
while the omnibus bill is finished. Write or call now and demand restored OSHA funding and 
standards-setting authority. <a href="http://www.standup.westlake.com/cgi-bin/letterselect">Contact</a> the following conferees: Sen. Mark Hatfield (R- Ore.), Sen. 
Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), Sen.Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), Rep. Robert 
Livingstone (R-La.), Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.) and Rep. John Porter (R-Ill.) </p>
<p>FRIENDS HELP _ AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka helped rally Kentucky labor 
in electing Gov. Paul Patton (D) in November, and the new governor has kept his promises. Last 
week, he pushed a prevailing wage law through the legislature that unions have been working for 
since 1981. It was another collective effort by unionists in the state, said state AFL-CIO 
spokeswoman Lisa Wallace. &quot;We had fire fighters and transportation workers who aren't affected 
by the bill lobbying for it. The workers made it a fairness and justice issue and they just couldn't 
refute it.&quot; </p>
<p>BIG CITY UNION WINS _ The Service Employees have set their sights on another 1,000 
nonunion ambulance drivers in Chicago after winning the right to represent a unit of 650 emergency 
medical technicians employed by AMR. The Feb. 11 vote was an overwhelming 301-55 for SEIU. 
In New York City, meanwhile, the union won an election to represent 230 workers at New York's 
Bishop Mogavera Nursing Home. </p>
<p>FIRST SHOT AT KAISER _ Kaiser Permanente's practices have raised questions about the 
quality of care being provided to its 6.6 million subscribers nationwide. Labor participated in a 
North Carolina news conference March 7 that unveiled the problems found by state regulators 
studying Kaiser, including access to care, patient confidentiality, long waiting periods and member 
dissatisfaction. The federation's Industrial Union Department is coordinating efforts to bring about 
fair contracts for Kaiser workers and higher quality care for Kaiser subscribers. </p>
<p>DETROIT CONNECTIONS _ A March 6 demonstration by religious leaders in front of the 
Detroit News building to support striking newspaper workers led to the arrest of 24 people, 
including City Council President Maryann Mahaffey, a Catholic bishop and two Episcopal bishops. 
In Miami, where strikers have set up a phone bank to urge union members not to buy The Miami 
Herald, the flagship of Detroit Free Press owner <a href="http://www.dialog.com/">Knight-Ridder</a>, a new organization _ Sports Fans 
Against the Herald _ was announced at a home plate news conference March 11 in nearby 
Broward County. Knight-Ridder's &quot;two-faced policy toward the Cuban-American community&quot; was 
denounced by the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, which called attention to a 
Free Press editorial urging the Clinton administration not to let &quot;its policy be held any more hostage 
to the Cuban-exile community than is already the case.&quot; Meanwhile, labor's &quot;don't-buy&quot; campaign 
against <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/">USA TODAY</a>, flagship of Detroit News owner <a href="http://www.gannett.com/">Gannett</a>, is spreading to hotels, airlines and 
other advertisers and distributors. </p>
<p>NAFTA ROADBLOCK _ Representatives of millions of truck drivers and freight workers from 
the United States, Canada and Mexico will roll into Chicago this Wednesday to seek ways to 
protect jobs, highway safety and the environment. The &quot;NAFTA Truckers Summit&quot; at the Hyatt 
Regency Hotel will be the first time union and independent truckers from the three countries have 
joined together to fight for these common interests. Included will be an action plan to extend a 
temporary delay of NAFTA provisions that would allow U.S. trucking companies to shift 
operations to Mexico. </p>
<p>NEWS VIEWS OF LABOR _ CBS Sunday Morning presented a portrait of a resurgent labor 
movement poised to answer the call of anxious workers beset by economic turmoil. New 
Organizing Director Richard Bensinger, shown campaigning to organize Delta flight attendants, was 
depicted as &quot;a circuit-riding preacher&quot; and &quot;chief evangelist for born-again unionism.&quot; AFL-CIO 
President John Sweeney told reporter Martha Tiechner that &quot;the American labor movement is going 
to change with the times. We're going to take some risks. We're going to use confrontation if that's 
necessary.&quot; A New York Times report Monday, headlined &quot;Students Looking to Unions for 
Careers in Social Change,&quot; found 400 students applying since October to be union organizers. &quot;I 
want a job where I can make a difference,&quot; said one history major. </p>
<p>THE SOUND OF BOSSES WHINING _ Representatives of fast food, banking, retail and other 
chains cried to a House Small Business subcommittee that a proposed <a href="http://www.doc.gov/nlrb/homepg.html">NLRB</a> rule on what 
constitutes a single-location bargaining unit for multi-unit companies would do major harm. But a 
UFCW attorney told the committee the rule is both &quot;sound and eminently sensible.&quot; Board 
Chairman William Gould defended the rule, saying it would be more efficient and less expensive to 
settle disputes. </p>
<p>STILL UNION _ Even scabs know a good thing when they see it. Employees at two Pirelli 
Armstrong plants, including more than 100 hired as replacement workers during an unfair labor 
practices strike last year, voted 825-32 to retain the Steelworkers as their bargaining agent after 
some of the scabs sought a decertification vote. &quot;It's a big ice cream social in the plant,&quot; said Lewis 
V. Milton, president of USWA Local 703. &quot;We just wiped them out. Even the replacements are in 
on our celebration.&quot; The vote covers Locals 703 in Hanford, Calif., and 670 in Nashville. </p>
<p>ANOTHER HARVEST OF SHAME _ A devastating plan that could flood the agriculture industry 
with low-cost foreign labor for the fields was added to an immigration bill in the House. The House 
Agriculture Committee ignored opponents who said there is no shortage of workers to harvest 
crops and that these new &quot;guest workers&quot; would drive down already low wages and lousy working 
conditions. In hypocritical fashion, many of the same people who want to give agribusiness a break 
with cheap temporary labor also call for a five-year ban on all other legal immigration. </p>
<p>FIGHTING FOR PEACE _ The <a href="../press96/pr0304.html">AFL-CIO expressed</a> deep sympathies to the nation of Israel 
over the deaths caused by four horrible terrorist bombings in nine days. &quot;It's difficult to see it on a 
day like this,&quot; President John Sweeney said, &quot;but history ultimately is on the side of the 
peacemakers. Unfortunately, the road to peace in the Middle East is a rough one that requires 
those of us who believe in it to struggle and fight to bring it about. Let us pray that day will come 
soon.&quot; </p>
<p>PARTIAL WORK AT GM PLANT _ Some of the 3,000 striking members of UAW Local 696 
at General Motors' Delphi Chassis Systems brake plants in Dayton, Ohio, agreed to return to work 
to produce parts for non-GM customers. The plants make parts for Chrysler, Saab and some other 
automakers. Disputes over subcontracting and health and safety triggered the third strike at the 
plants in five years. Other GM plants already are feeling the effects of the strike, with 11 plants 
idled Monday and others on the verge of shutting down. </p>
<p>BIPARTISAN HEALTH CARE BILL ADVANCES _ The Senate Labor and Human Resources 
Committee unanimously approved a bipartisan bill that would bar insurance companies from 
dropping people when they switch jobs or from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. It 
would guarantee access to insurance for workers who have been laid off or leave their jobs to start 
a business or take early retirement as long as they have paid premiums for at least 18 months. 
AFL-CIO Legislative Director Peggy Taylor called the bill's provisions &quot;critically important first 
steps towards increased health security at minimal cost.&quot; The measure, S. 1028, is tentatively 
scheduled for floor action April 18. The House companion version, H.R. 2893, was introduced by 
Rep. Marge Roukema (R-N.J.) But House GOP leaders appear to be ignoring her bill _ which has 
the backing of many Democrats _ in favor of others that carry controversial provisions on medical 
malpractice and other issues. </p>
<p>SCHOOL VOUCHER THREAT REVIVED _ Backers of public school quality and funding were 
able to beat back an attempt to set up a voucher program in the District of Columbia that would 
have used public money to send students to private and religious schools. The experimental 
program was part of the fiscal 1996 appropriations bill for Washington that voucher opponents 
were able to stall, but was included in the omnibus spending bill passed by the House. The Senate 
is expected to vote on the spending bill this week and vouchers aren't in its bill. The fight will be in 
the House-Senate conference. </p>
<p>THE $4 CHISEL _ Postal Workers President Moe Biller blasted the Postal Service for using bad 
weather and the federal government shutdown as excuses for delaying by two weeks a 
cost-of-living adjustment negotiated in the latest national agreement. By delaying the COLA from 
the pay period ending March 2 to the pay period ending March 16, the USPS will chisel each 
APWU member out of $4.00, Biller said. The union plans to grieve the delay. </p>
<p>DON'T BUY THESE PANTS _ At the request of the Electronic Workers, Master Apparel was 
added to the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/boycott.htm">AFL-CIO national boycott list</a> on March 4. IUE has filed unfair labor practices 
charges against Master Apparel, which makes Botany 500 boys pants, because of the company's 
failure to bargain in good faith. </p>
<p>AD CAMPAIGN _ <a href="http://www.seiu.org/">SEIU</a> and the Congress of California Seniors launched a series of print 
advertisements to support their campaign against Vencor/Hillhaven health care facilities. The ads 
will appear in weekly and monthly publications that reach 675,000 seniors. Vencor, which operates 
40 nursing homes and six hospitals in the state, refuses to acknowledge health care workers' 
solutions to patient care problems such as inadequate staffing and training. </p>
<p>ROOM FOR SISTERS _ <a href="http://www.teamster.org/">International Brotherhood of Teamsters</a> President Ron Carey will ask 
the union's July convention to change the name of the organization to include the role of its many 
female members. &quot;The current name has a lot of proud history behind it,&quot; Carey said. &quot;But it leaves 
out hundreds of thousands of Teamsters who are women.&quot; Carey is using the union's publications to 
ask members for their ideas for a new name. </p>

<h2 align=center>AFL-CIO Work in Progress</h2>
<p>SPECIAL CONVENTION _ The call and credentials have gone out for a special convention in 
Washington March 25 to give all federation unions and union leaders a full voice in determining the 
scope and direction of the AFL-CIO political program for 1996. Delegates will discuss an 
ambitious program to &quot;reclaim America,&quot; and consider a special assessment for one year of 15 
cents per member per month to pay for the new activity. The convention also will consider whether 
to endorse President Clinton and Vice President Gore for re-election. </p>
<p>FALL TRAINING _ The first session of the National Labor Political Training Center started 
March 2 at the George Meany Center. The weeklong session is taking 43 AFL-CIO field staffers 
through campaign basics in preparation for this year's unprecedented political push. Eventually, 
3,000 staff and union volunteers will be trained and deployed in the fall get-out-the-vote campaign. </p>
<p>SPRING MEANING _ Groundwork for the federation's political activity will be laid with an 
exploration of a defining political issue _ the growing wage gap between the rich and average 
working families. The AFL-CIO will convene town hall meetings in 29 cities beginning in late 
March to hear from workers about the impact of stagnating wages on their families. </p>
<p>SUMMER ACTIVISM _ Union Summer, the AFL-CIO's program to get the next generation 
involved in the labor movement, is looking for potential participants and potential sites. Some 1,000 
young unionists and students will spend some of their time working on organizing campaigns, and 
will be available for get-out-the-vote and other activity. See the letter from AFL-CIO Executive 
Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson at the end of this bulletin. </p>
<p>HAIL! HAIL! ROCK AND ROLL _ The Theatrical Stage Employees signed an agreement with 
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland to represent about 40 workers in visitor service, 
security and audio- visual technicians. Museum Board Co-Chair and CEO William H. Hulett said 
the agreement was a natural outcropping of relationships with labor established during the 
construction of the building, designed by architect I.M. Pei. &quot;We are delighted to enlist in a 
partnership with labor, who has already done so much to support the museum,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>PULLING TOGETHER _ Steelworkers President George Becker and Aluminum, Brick and 
Glass President Ernest J. LaBaff have reached a &quot;handshake agreement&quot; on the basic elements of a 
merger agreement between their two unions. The next step, LaBaff said, would be for the ABG to 
go through its own internal procedures culminating in a convention vote on the proposal, with &quot;the 
prospects good for our merger to be consummated.&quot; The USWA executive board will discuss 
details at its next meeting. </p>
<p>JOINING FORCES _ The AFL-CIO and the Rainbow Coalition will work together to defeat 
corporate greed and the extremists in control of Congress, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney told 
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a Rainbow Coalition Conference in Chicago last week. Sweeney 
vowed to fight for affirmative action, saying &quot;If affirmative action goes down, Davis Bacon, the 
Service Contract Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the minimum wage bill will all follow.&quot; 
The coalition also honored Detroit's striking newspaper workers with an award and condemned 
media barons Knight Ridder and Gannett. Earlier in the week, Sweeney spoke to top CEOs at a 
meeting of the Business Council and to the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference, and participated in a 
forum on corporate citizenship sponsored by Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.). </p>
<p>ON THE ROAD _ President Sweeney addresses the Food and Commercial Workers' legislative 
and political conference Wednesday and travels to Philadelphia to address the AFL-CIO 
Education Conference on Thursday. He returns to Washington that evening as the guest of honor at 
the DC Friends of Ireland dinner. Secretary-Treasurer Trumka will address the Pennsylvania 
AFL-CIO convention Tuesday and travel to Los Angeles Friday for a series of events. Executive 
Vice President Chavez-Thompson is in Baton Rouge, La., Monday for the Louisiana AFL-CIO 
convention and will travel to Chicago for events with the Carpenters, Steelworkers and UNITE 
before receiving the Chicago AFL-CIO Labor Woman of the Year award. She is in Detroit on 
Thursday to talk with newspaper strikers and travels to Springfield, Ill., Friday for a rally. On 
Saturday, she's in Denver for a Labor Council for Latin American Advancement conference. </p>
<p>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION _ Trade unionists and civil rights advocates gathered at the Louisiana 
State Capitol Feb. 24 to protest Gov. Mike Foster's moves against affirmative action and black 
majority congressional districts. The Louisiana demonstration was a preview of the mass 
grass-roots actions planned across the country to defeat efforts in many states to eliminate 
affirmative action. The biggest test will be in California, where Gov. Pete Wilson successfully led a 
drive to get a ballot initiative to end affirmative action. President Sweeney has urged affiliates to 
help pull together resources and people to help a new coalition of women's and civil rights groups 
that has come together to fight the California proposal. </p>
<p>UNION LABEL BONDS _ Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday will sew the first union label 
into a garment made by workers represented by UNITE at a midtown New York City garment 
manufacturer. Union labels have been used in the garment industry since the 1930s as a way to 
guarantee consumers that the clothing they purchase is made in the United States under decent 
working conditions. In joining UNITE President Jay Mazur and designer Nicole Miller of Nicole 
Miller Ltd., the first lady will be following in the footsteps of Eleanor Roosevelt, who in 1933 
sewed the first such label into a coat as part of the National Recovery Act.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, UNITE announced a new campaign to organize 10,000 nursing home workers in 
Florida. Rep. Carrie Meek (D-Fla.) helped to kick off the campaign Monday, joining Miami 
nursing home workers and religious and community leaders to present a five-foot tall Florida 
Nursing Home Workers' Bill of Rights. </p>
<p>SAVE OUR HOMES _ Unionists and other social activists will gather outside the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development Wednesday, March 6, to protest an attempt to eliminate the 
HUD Assignment Program, which provides mortgage assistance to homeowners who face 
foreclosure due to unemployment, illness, family breakup or other circumstances beyond their 
control. The 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. rally, sponsored by the Philadelphia Unemployment Project, will be 
followed by lobbying by homeowners and their supporters to urge continuation of a program to 
keep families in their homes. You can help by contacting HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros at HUD, 
Room 9100, 751 7th St. SW, Washington, D.C. 20410, or call 202/708-0417. </p>
<p>EARNINGS SHOULD GET REAL _ Average weekly earnings took another nosedive in January, 
falling 1.7 percent for the month and 15.7 percent since January 1979. Stagnant wages, not rising 
prices, are largely to blame. Except for energy prices, there was little if any evidence of inflation. 
Meanwhile, the merchandise trade deficit hit a new record last year at $159.6 billion, up from 
$150.6 billion in 1994. </p>
<p>COFFEE TALK _ CBS Sunday Morning will feature a segment on the labor movement's new 
organizing and political programs. The show, airing at 9 a.m. EST on Sunday, March 10, is 
expected to include reports from organizing campaigns and the AFL-CIO Executive Council 
meeting in Florida. </p>
<p>PUT RAIL SAFETY ON TRACK _ Locomotive Engineers President Ronald McLaughlin told the 
Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee that safety problems that may have 
contributed to the recent spate of rail accidents are not new. &quot;We constantly meet roadblocks from 
the industry and FRA to our recommendations for adequate safety protection for our members and 
the public,&quot; he said. McLaughlin cited fatigue, crew size, substandard radio communications and 
inadequate signal systems. </p>
<p>STANDING BEHIND OSHA _ About 40 Mine Workers, Painters, Postal Workers, Service 
Employees and Plumbers and Pipefitters crowded into a hearing room Feb. 28 as the Senate 
Labor and Human Resources Committee met to mark up legislation that would emasculate OSHA 
protections for workers. But lengthy discussions forced postponement of a final vote until this 
week. </p>
<p>THE OREGON TRIAL _ Besides the &quot;right-to-work&quot; referendum drive, anti-worker forces in 
Oregon are using a ballot initiatives to raise the retirement age for workers in the Public Employees 
Retirement System and to reduce some benefits. Oregon public employee unions, AFSCME 
District Council 75 and Service Employees Local 503, believe the measure is an attempt to divert 
attention from the right-to-work ballot initiative. Backers of the constitutional amendment to 
increase the retirement age have until July 5 to gather 97,681 signatures to place the measure on the 
November general election ballot. </p>
<p>KEYSTONE STATE WELCOMES TRUMKA _ Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka 
returns to his home commonwealth for the Pennsylvania AFL- CIO convention this week in 
Philadelphia, where Trumka attended law school (at Villanova). Also scheduled to address the 
1,000 delegates to the biennial convention are AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee, U.S. 
Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, state federation officers William George and Richard 
Bloomingdale, Philadelphia Council President Joseph Rauscher, U.S. Rep. Thomas Foglietta (D- 
Pa.), Gov. Tom Ridge (R) and numerous other national and state labor and political leaders. 
Trumka last week was in Pittsburgh for a Mine Workers testimonial dinner in his honor. </p>
<p>ORGANIZING ANSWERS _ The AFL-CIO and Cornell University are joining forces for a 
Union/University Research Conference March 31-April 2 at the Sheraton Washington Hotel. 
Participants whose registration fee has been received by the deadline, March 19, will receive 
copies of abstracts of the more than 35 papers being specially prepared for the conference. A 
registration fee of $125 covers all conference materials, workshops and plenary session, as well as 
working lunches and dinners. Space at the conference is limited, and it may be necessary to restrict 
attendance. For further information, contact Kate Bronfenbrenner at Cornell (607/255-7581), or 
<a href="mailto:lb23@postoffice3.mail.cornell.edu">E-mail</a>; or Sheldon Friedman at the AFL-CIO (202/637-5310), or <a href="mailto:71112.675@compuserve.com">E-mail</a>; or Vinnie O'Brien at 
the AFL-CIO (202/637-5287 or FAX 202/637-5012). </p>
<p>The following letter from Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson was included in the 
distribution of the Work in Progress bulletin: </p>
<p>Dear Trade Unionists, </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO is planning an exciting Union Summer designed to bring the next generation into the 
labor movement. You can help by guiding young unionists or students to the program, or by 
providing the organizing campaigns in which they can work. </p>
<p>The federation plans to recruit 1,000 young workers and students to work in organizing campaigns 
and political projects at 10 or more sites round the country between June and August. Recruitment 
efforts are focused on young rank-and-file workers, the sons and daughters of union members, and 
college students. </p>
<p>Those who are accepted to the program will intern for three weeks at a Union Summer site, getting 
training, free housing and a $210 per week stipend. Affiliates soon will receive materials, including a 
video and articles and ads for their publications. Please help spread the word. </p>
<p>The best proposals for Union Summer projects include new organizing or first-contract fights in 
units of 500 or more, as well as campaigns that involve innovative tactics, multiple unions, whole 
industries or regions. </p>
<p>Applicants must be able to host as many as 20 young people in two or three waves and be willing 
to share costs with the AFL-CIO. Submit proposals by March 15 to Union Summer, 815 16th St. 
NW, Washington, D.C. 20006. FAX 202/408-0303. For further information, phone 
1-800/952-2550 or 202/408-0300. To order a video, call 1-800/242UNION. </p>
<p>Together, we can make Union Summer a transforming experience for young people and the labor 
movement. </p>
<p>In solidarity,<br>
Linda Chavez-Thompson<br>

<h1 align=center>2-27-96 AFL-CIO &quot;Work in Progress&quot; 
Newsletter</h1>
<p>FULL SPEED AHEAD _ The AFL-CIO Executive Council launched major organizing, legislative, 
political and public affairs campaigns to build a strong new force on behalf of working families. The 
federation will help fund innovative and well-planned organizing drives, as well as recruit and place 
a thousand young workers and students for an activist Union Summer. Town hall meetings will be 
held in 29 U.S. cities between mid-March and May to air the problems of wage stagnation. 
Thousands of union activists will be trained in message and political tactics, beginning with field staff 
training Saturday, March 2, at the George Meany Center for Labor Studies, and thousands more 
will be enlisted for a massive get-out-the-vote campaign this year. </p>
<p>REORGANIZING _ President John Sweeney announced next steps in AFL- CIO reorganization 
with sweeping changes designed to streamline operations and make them more responsive to the 
needs of affiliated unions. All field services will be brought under one department, headed by 
Marilyn Sneiderman, 39, currently Teamsters education director and a former staffer at <a href="http://www.afscme.org/">AFSCME</a> 
and then the George Meany Center. Field services will be organized into four or five regions, rather 
than the current 12. These changes include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Economic research and employee benefits will be consolidated into a new Public Policy 
Department and all communications are being consolidated in a Department of Public 
Affairs, with divisions for media relations, speechwriting, publications and electronic media 
production. Michael Byrne, 47, editor of the AFL- CIO News since 1989, was named to 
head the publications division, and Richard Foster, 45, assistant director of the former Labor 
Institute of Public Affairs for five years, will head the electronic media division. </li>
<li>Sweeney also announced that a new Department of Corporate Affairs will assist unions 
through three divisions: a center for strategic research, providing research on multinational 
corporations, worker ownership and pension investment strategies; a center for collective 
bargaining, tracking bargaining developments and helping to train union negotiators; and a 
center for workplace democracy, focusing on the voice of workers in technology, job design 
and labor-management issues. </li>
</ul>
<p>EMPOWERED _ Workers at the Gavin Power Plant in Cheshire, Ohio, voted overwhelmingly for 
representation by the Utility Workers. The 176-98 vote on Feb. 22 is just the first step for the 
workers, said <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~miner/">UWUA</a> President Donald E. Wightman, who said he expected cooperation in 
bargaining with American Electric Power, the parent company that also operates other 
UWUA-represented sites. &quot;We are not just interested in winning elections,&quot; Wightman said. &quot;It is 
our desire to maintain and create good union jobs for the benefit of our members and their 
communities.&quot; </p>
<p>DON'T TURN OUT LIGHTS _ The AFL-CIO warned of a dangerous trend toward deregulation 
of the electric utility industry that threatens hundreds of thousands of jobs, electrical service and 
years of environmental progress. The Executive Council statement also noted that radical 
deregulation of the industry would result in higher rates for residential users. </p>
<p>WORKERS ON THE MOVE _ Nearly 10,000 unionists braved heavy rains Feb. 19 to Rally for 
Working Families at the state Capitol in Olympia, Wash. Speakers included Sen. Patty Murray 
(D), Gov. Mike Lowry (D) and state AFL-CIO President Rick Bender, who decried the &quot;class 
war&quot; being waged on working people by corporations and legislators. &quot;The power of solidarity is 
unions,&quot; the leading banner declared _ with the word &quot;unions&quot; spelled out with logos from 78 
national and international unions. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, more than 20,000 union construction 
workers took the day off Feb. 26 to protest Gov. Pete Wilson's proposal to lower the prevailing 
wage, the second major California rally over the issue. </p>
<p>COMING TOGETHER _ President John Sweeney addresses the U.S. Catholic Conference 
Tuesday and a business forum on corporate leadership Thursday, both in Washington, and travels 
to Chicago Friday for the Rainbow Coalition National Conference. Secretary- Treasurer Rich 
Trumka is interviewed on Wisconsin Public Radio today and addresses the Utility Workers 
legislative conference Wednesday. Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson is in 
Washington for the National Hispanic School Fund gala Wednesday, then travels to Massachusetts 
Thursday for the Harvard Trade Union Program. She will address UNITE's Women's Institute for 
Leadership Development Friday before joining Sweeney and Trumka in Pittsburgh Saturday for a 
testimonial dinner for Trumka. </p>
<p>TAKING ON GIANTS _ The villain publishers of Detroit, Gannett and Knight-Ridder, are being 
followed to their home turf by labor's campaign to win justice for strikers at the Detroit News and 
Detroit Free Press. Several airlines have agreed to stop distributing Gannett's USA TODAY, and 
South Florida activists have set up phone banks to urge readers to boycott The Miami Herald, 
Knight-Ridder's flagship newspaper. That campaign also is informing Hispanic readers they are 
being double-charged for the Spanish version, El Nuevo Herald. Gannett is the nation's largest 
publisher and Knight-Ridder is the third-largest. </p>
<p>BLACK MARK ON SAFE JOBS _ The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on 
Wednesday takes up legislation sponsored by committee Chairman Sen. Nancy Kassebaum 
(R-Kan.) and Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) that would emasculate the nation's job safety laws. 
Unionists are urged to call committee members today to voice displeasure at the 
Gregg-Kassebaum bill, which would strip workplace safety and health protections from two out of 
three workers. On this 25th anniversary of the 1971 Occupational Safety and Health Act, unionists 
also are urged to continue making plans to remember fallen co-workers and rally for safe jobs on 
April 28, Workers Memorial Day. For more information, contact Keith Mestrich at 
202/637-5210, or e-mail at <a href="mailto:71363.1544@compuserve.com">71363.1544@compuserve.com</a>. </p>
<p>LOOSE BUCHANAN _ A New York Times poll shows that while GOP presidential candidate 
Patrick Buchanan is trying to tap into the frustration of workers over stagnant wages and bad trade 
deals, his supporters mostly are focused on his social views. Sweeney told reporters at the 
Executive Council meeting last week that Buchanan is anything but a friend of workers: he opposes 
raising the minimum wage, wage standards, worker health and safety protections and the right of 
workers to freely join and form unions. </p>
<p>SPRINT HANGUP _ The <a href="http://dol.gov">Labor Department</a> is holding a hearing today in San Francisco over 
allegations by Hispanic workers that they were fired illegally by Sprint Corp. during a union 
organizing drive at the company's La Conexion Familiar subsidiary. The hearing is the first under the 
North American Free Trade Agreement for complaints brought by the Mexican government over 
violations of U.S. labor laws, and was pursued by the Mexican telephone union in consultation with 
the Communications Workers. Four complaints have been pursued by U.S. unions for violation of 
Mexican labor laws. Under NAFTA, there are no penalties for such violations _ just hearings. </p>
<p>PARTNERS FOR HEALTH _ Sweeney closed out the federation's winter meeting in Bal Harbour 
with a tour of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, where workers are represented by the Service 
Employees, AFSCME and the Office and Professional Employees. He held a community meeting 
with Jackson Memorial CEO Ira Clark to talk about how labor and management can work 
together to save the public health safety net. Jackson Memorial, the country's second-largest public 
hospital, receives nearly half of its revenues from Medicare and Medicaid funding, now under 
attack from Republicans in Congress, to serve the many seniors who have retired to South Florida. </p>
<p>NURSING HOME DRIVE _ The Food and Commercial Workers and Service Employees are 
working together to help improve patient care conditions in Beverly Enterprises nursing homes. The 
two unions brought Beverly workers from Pennsylvania, Georgia and Connecticut to rally with their 
counterparts in Alabama, where they announced a national campaign to improve conditions at 
Beverly facilities. The unions have documented the poor quality care at Beverly, the nation's largest 
nursing home operator which has been cited for numerous labor law violations going back to 1979. </p>
<p>NO SOLUTION FOR EDUCATION _ School voucher programs like the one that Congress is 
trying to ram down the throat of the Washington, D.C., school system &quot;undermine the system of 
public education that working families have fought so hard to obtain,&quot; the Executive Council said in 
a statement issued last week. Pointing to the failed voucher system in Milwaukee, where activist 
parents took their children to private schools and left the public school system fragmented, the 
council called on legislators to seek real reform of the public schools, rather than inviting their 
abandonment. </p>
<p>THIS CARD AN ACE _ The Executive Council approved a new MasterCard proposal from 
Household International that is &quot;a better deal for our members and it sends a good portion of what 
are now the bank's profits back into our movement so we can help build a more secure future for 
work Americans,&quot; Sweeney said. Unless the Bank of New York matches the offer, it is effective in 
February 1997, when the federation and participating unions also begin to collect royalty payments 
for use of the AFL-CIO name on the cards, used by 2 million union members. Sweeney told the 
council those payments could reach $375 million over five years. The card rate will stay at prime 
plus 5 percent (13.5 percent, more than 4 percent below the national average), and it features other 
new benefits. </p>
<p>NEW COMMITTEES _ Issues of the changing workplace will be addressed by a new Executive 
Council Committee on Workplace Democracy, which will be headed by Communications Workers 
President Morty Bahr. Sweeney also created a new Committee 2000, which he will chair, to 
consider the structure and role of the AFL-CIO and its trade and industrial departments, and how 
best to integrate the work of the labor movement. Several committees and subcommittees were 
eliminated and a number of others were combined or renamed. </p>

2/22/96 </h3>
<p>The full text of AFL-CIO Executive Council statements and press conferences are available on 
LaborNET's &quot;News and Views&quot; library on CompuServe, or on the AFL-CIO web page at 
<a href="http://www.aflcio.org">http://www.aflcio.org</a>. </p>
<p>RECLAIM AMERICA _ The Executive Council committed $35 million to mount an issues-driven 
political campaign in 1996 to take back America for working families. The goal: to build a 
permanent grassroots structure this political season that will carry over into the legislative battles of 
1997 and beyond. The federation will strengthen state and local AFL-CIOs, train thousands of 
union activists in message and political tactics and involve thousands more rank-and-file members in 
an intensive get-out the vote effort. The AFL-CIO also will go public with a $15-$25 million buy of 
national television and radio advertising that will champion economic and social justice. </p>
<p>SPECIAL CONVENTION _ The council authorized President John Sweeney to call a special 
constitutional convention to consider a one-year assessment on national unions of 15 cents per 
member per month to help finance the political campaign, and to consider endorsements for 
president and vice president. The convention will be held in Washington, tentatively on March 25. </p>
<p>THE OREGON MODEL _ Labor already has a successful political model for 1996, Sen. Ron 
Wyden told the council as he thanked the labor movement for putting him over the top in a special 
Oregon election in January. &quot;Labor ran a textbook campaign,&quot; he said. &quot;You ignited a grass-roots 
revolution.&quot; Political Director Steve Rosenthal and Deputy Director Rich Walsh directed 40 field 
staff and hundreds of volunteers, turning out 80 percent of union voters in suburban districts and 
giving Wyden an 18,220-vote margin in the mail ballot. </p>
<p>BUCHANAN UNDRESSED _ &quot;Patrick Buchanan is a racist, he's antisemitic, he bashes women 
right along with labor and immigrants and he's a believer in supply-side economics. We are none of 
those things,&quot; Sweeney told reporters after Buchanan beat Bob Dole in the New Hampshire 
Republican primary. &quot;Our movement isn't about dividing people through fear, it's about bringing 
people together through compassion.&quot; </p>
<p>A FIGHT FOR YOUNG AND OLD _ The council explored political coalition-building at both 
ends of the age spectrum, hearing from Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund 
and Steve Protulis of the National Council of Senior Citizens. The union leaders were moved by 
Edelman's impassioned plea for support for her organization's June 1 Stand For Children Day at 
the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, cosponsored by the AFL-CIO and 33 affiliated unions, and 
reinvigorated by Protulis's presentation on the role seniors have played in the Medicare debate, and 
will play in the general election. </p>
<p>MOTOWN SPIRIT _ The council welcomed six strikers from the Detroit News and Detroit Free 
Press as it heard Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka report on a wide range of strategic activity 
under way and being planned against publishers Gannett and Knight-Ridder to help the workers 
gain a fair contract. Knight-Ridder's flagship newspaper, the Miami Herald, was banned from the 
hotel, and south Florida unionists are developing a boycott campaign against the Herald and fighting 
discrimination in the distribution of its sister publication, El Nuevo Herald. Unions also are working 
with airlines and hotels to ban Gannett's flagship publication, USA TODAY. Council members 
pledged tens of thousands of dollars to the AFL-CIO &quot;adopt-a-striking-family&quot; program, and to 
publicize the availability by mail subscription of the strikers' alternative paper, The Sunday Journal. </p>
<p>SMALL WORLD _ The impact of foreign trade on American workers is severe and unrelenting, 
the AFL-CIO said as it outlined a fair trade policy that would insist on worker rights as a 
precondition to trade with other countries. The federation also urged the Clinton administration not 
to renew China's most-favored-nation trade status. </p>
<p>EARLY REVIEWS ARE IN _ The nation's eyes are on the Executive Council's last meeting in Bal 
Harbour, Fla., with about 20 reporters from around the country on the scene. Frank Swoboda of 
the Washington Post on Sunday quoted John Sweeney as offering two yardsticks for measuring his 
first year as president of the AFL-CIO: the level of &quot;success in the November elections and 
whether we're starting to show membership growth.&quot; In a Feb. 16 New York Times piece by 
Steven Greenhouse, Sweeney scoffed at the notion that representing working people makes 
organized labor a &quot;special interest.&quot; &quot;I don't get upset being referred to as representing a special 
interest,&quot; he said. &quot;If representing American workers is a special interest, then I'm proud to 
represent that special interest.&quot;</p>

<p>AMERICA NEEDS A RAISE _ The AFL-CIO linked its legislative, organizing, bargaining and 
political efforts under a single, powerful theme: &quot;America Needs a Raise.&quot; The Executive Council 
statement came after a panel discussion on the growing wage gap. &quot;The gap between the rich and 
the rest of us is becoming a sinkhole of social and economic conflict, and if we don't fill it in, it is 
going to swallow us all,&quot; AFL-CIO President John Sweeney told reporters. </p>
<p>GOING ON THE ROAD _ Sweeney also announced that he and other federation officials will 
chair town hall meetings in 29 cities around the country from March 15 through May to hear from 
workers on the impact of stagnant wages on their families. &quot;Our goal,&quot; he said, &quot;is to transform 
individual concerns into a compelling national cause, sensitizing politicians and policy-makers as we 
mount a massive educational campaign to motivate unrepresented as well as represented workers.&quot; </p>
<p>MESSAGE FROM REICH _ &quot;We have the beginnings of a movement in this country that is not 
just a trade union movement, although it is led by unions,&quot; Labor Secretary Bob Reich told the 
Executive Council. &quot;It is a movement of working people who are fed up.&quot; Reich said he believes the 
future of American society is at stake in the campaign. &quot;What you are doing is terrific _ you are 
going to be the difference between a just society and an unjust society. </p>
<p>100,000 NEW MEMBERS _ District 1199, the National Health and Human Services Union, was 
welcomed home Tuesday as President Dennis Rivera dedicated his activist membership of more 
than 100,000 New York City hospital workers to help the labor movement achieve its ambitious 
political and economic goals this year. The union began as a unit of 5,000 pharmacists in the Retail, 
Wholesale and Department Store Union, then grew dramatically to serve low-paid health care 
workers. Part of the union later merged with both the Service Employees and AFSCME, then the 
New York unit went out on its own in an amicable split with RWDSU in 1991. &quot;This union has 
done remarkable things for its workers,&quot; said RWDSU President Lenore Miller. &quot;We welcome 
them back.&quot; </p>
<p>SENIORS RALLY IN BAL HARBOUR _ Organized labor will keep fighting to &quot;protect 
Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security _ benefits you have earned,&quot; Sweeney told more than 600 
members of the National Council of Senior Citizens, who rallied in an overflowing ballroom at the 
Sheraton Bal Harbour. Efforts by the AFL-CIO and the NCSC to dramatize the plight of seniors 
as congressional Republicans threaten their programs with deep cuts was praised by House 
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.), who told the council on Monday that the AFL-CIO 
television advertising and NCSC rallies around the country had forced the GOP to retreat on those 
issues. </p>
<p>NATURAL ALLIANCE _ Susan Bianchi-Sand, chair of the Council of Presidents of National 
Women's Organizations, proposed an alliance of the labor movement and the women's movement 
centered on the issue of economic justice. The proposal will be taken up by the new Women's 
Committee, chaired by Electronic Workers Vice President Gloria Johnson, president of the 
Coalition of Labor Union Women. </p>
<p>TREASURY FIRST _ Bob Rubin, the first Secretary of the Treasury to meet with the executive 
council, said he welcomed a continuing dialogue with leaders of the AFL-CIO. &quot;It will be most 
helpful for us to know what's on your minds as we deal with economic policy,&quot; he said. Labor's 
views are especially important because the current &quot;public policy debate on the budget and 
economic issues may be the most important since the end of World War II,&quot; he said. The council 
praised Rubin for his skill at holding off Republican budget cutters but criticized the monetary 
policies of the Federal Reserve Board and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, and warned that further 
efforts to negotiate trade agreements without provisions for worker rights would outrage American 
workers. </p>
<p>COMING UP _ The AFL-CIO will unveil its 1996 political program today and welcome Ron 
Wyden, who last month became Oregon's first Democratic senator since the `50s largely because 
of labor's political support. Also visiting the Executive Council are Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) 
and Marian Wright Edelman, executive director of the Children's Defense Fund, who will tell of 
plans for a march on Washington for children this summer. </p>

<h1 align=center>2-20-96 AFL-CIO &quot;Work in Progress&quot; 
Newsletter</h1>
<p>ORGANIZE! SHIFT RESOURCES, SPEND SMART _ The AFL-CIO Executive Council this 
week outlined a broad plan for the federation to lead unions to &quot;Build Power for Workers By 
Organizing.&quot; The plan includes guidelines for a new AFL-CIO fund to help support innovative, 
well-planned organizing projects. The project is designed to help unions build an organizing 
infrastructure and foster a new &quot;culture of organizing&quot; _ down to the local level. The full text of the 
statement is available in the LaborNET &quot;News and Views&quot; library on CompuServe, or on the 
AFL-CIO web page at http://<a href="http://www.aflcio.org">www.aflcio.org</a>. </p>
<p>RISK, FIGHT, WIN _ Workers and organizers from AFSCME, UNITE, CWA, IBEW and the 
Laborers told the council about the fights they're waging to bring justice to workers across the 
country. Monica Russo, UNITE's southern organizing director, summed up euphoria organizers feel 
with the AFL-CIO's plans to lead massive new activity: &quot;Out in the field, we are thrilled because 
we see a new direction in the labor movement. We've been banging away long and hard for many, 
many, many years, and we look forward to working in an environment where we can take more 
risks, pick more and bigger fights, and win bigger victories for workers in the South and all across 
America.&quot; </p>
<p>BONIOR ON ORGANIZING _ Among those listening to the organizers' inspiring stories was 
House Minority Whip David E. Bonior (D- Mich.), who had asked to come early (he was 
scheduled to address the council later in the day) to hear the report on organizing. Later, at a news 
conference, he explained his personal excitement with the reinvigoration of the labor movement, 
saying he senses a &quot;real hunger for community&quot; among the American people. &quot;The labor movement 
is the vehicle that can make that happen.&quot; </p>
<p>A STEAL FOR WOMEN _ The AFL-CIO again raided the U.S. Department of Labor, naming 
Women's Bureau Director Karen Nussbaum to head a new AFL-CIO Working Women's 
Department. Nussbaum, founder of 9-to-5, the National Association of Working Women, and 
subsequently of District 925 of the Service Employees recalled thinking, when listening to the 
problems of working women as head of the Women's Bureau, &quot;this woman shouldn't be talking to 
me. She should be talking to a union organizer.&quot; Steve Rosenthal, now AFL-CIO political director, 
also was an advisor to Labor Secretary Bob Reich, who addressed the council. </p>
<p>LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD CAMPAIGNS _ The coordinator for Union Summer told the 
Executive Council that he will help put a thousand young unionists and college students into 
organizing campaigns to help also with get-out-the-vote activity and social and economic activism. 
Union Summer Director Andy Levin said the young activists will transport themselves to the sites, 
then receive $200 a week, with affiliated unions and state and local central bodies asked to provide 
lodging and transportation during the intensive three-week campaigns. </p>
<p>SUPPORT FROM THE TOP _ President Clinton will veto any attempt by the Republicans in 
Congress to weaken the nation's job safety laws, Vice President Gore told the Executive Council. 
Gore also reiterated the president's pledge to veto the company union bill (the so-called TEAM 
Act) if it is passed, as well as any weakening of the nation's two prevailing-wage laws _ the 
Davis-Bacon Act and Service Contract Act. Clinton will take the case for an increase in the 
minimum wage to the American people during the 1996 political campaign, Gore said. </p>
<p>DEFINING ISSUE _ Sweeney on Tuesday will announce details of his plans for a series of town 
hall meetings around the country to hear the concerns and ideas of workers about the growing 
wage gap separating the nation's rich and average working families. BLS reported last week that 
pay and benefits together in the private sector rose only 2.8 percent in 1995, down from 3.1 
percent in 1994 and the smallest increase since the agency began tracking the numbers in 1980. </p>
<p>EARLY REVIEWS ARE IN _ The nation's eyes are on the Executive Council's last meeting in Bal 
Harbour, Fla., with about 20 reporters from around the country on the scene. Frank Swoboda of 
the Washington Post on Sunday quoted John Sweeney as offering two yardsticks for measuring his 
first year as president of the AFL-CIO: the level of &quot;success in the November elections and 
whether we're starting to show membership growth.&quot; In a Feb. 16 New York Times piece by 
Steven Greenhouse, Sweeney scoffed at the notion that representing working people makes 
organized labor a &quot;special interest.&quot; &quot;I don't get upset being referred to as representing a special 
interest,&quot; he said. &quot;If representing American workers is a special interest, then I'm proud to 
represent that special interest.&quot; </p>
<p>WAGES NOT PREVAILING _ More than 12,000 union members converged on the Capitol 
steps in Sacramento, Calif., to protest Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's plans to slash prevailing rates 
for construction workers. Under Wilson's plan, construction workers' salaries stand to drop from 
$28,000 a year to $22,000, &quot;hardly a living wage for a working family,&quot; one speaker said. New 
wage rates are expected by July from a Wilson-appointed Industrial Welfare Commission. </p>
<p>A GOOD SIGNAL _ Workers at Allied Signal's Safety Restraint Systems in Knoxville, Tenn. 
ratified a contract that raises wages 12 percent over three years. The 600 members of UNITE 
Local 1742 preserved health care benefits and added pension and vacation improvements, bringing 
the wage benefit increase to nearly twice the national average, the union said. </p>
<p>WORK WITHOUT RIGHTS _ Workers have gone to the barricades in Oklahoma and Oregon, 
trying to beat back so-called &quot;right-to-work&quot; initiatives. More than 200 people rallied Feb. 5 under 
the aegis of the Working Families Coalition of Oklahoma, with TV, radio and newspaper ads 
running and phone banks, education drives and postcard initiatives planned. In Oregon, the 
National Right to Work Committee is paying volunteers $5 for each signature they gather on a 
petition to put right to work on the November ballot. Similar legislation was carried over from the 
last session in Pennsylvania, and may reappear in California, Colorado, Indiana, Montana and New 
Mexico. </p>
<p>UFW'S VALENTINE'S VINDICATION: An Arizona appeals court on Feb. 14 threw out a $3.7 
million judgment against the Farm Workers in their boycott against lettuce grower Bruce Church 
Inc. The decision &quot;is a triumph for the United Farm Workers and a vindication of Cesar Chavez,&quot; 
said union President Arturo S. Rodriguez of his predecessor, who died in April 1993 after a day of 
giving testimony in the case. Rodriguez thanked the Executive Council for its support, particularly 
the unions that came forward to back the UFW financially. </p>
<p>MORALITY IN DETROIT _ More than 200 clergy in the Detroit area issued a renewed call to 
their neighbors to boycott the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press, denouncing as immoral 
plans by the publishers to &quot;permanently replace&quot; striking workers. The Executive Council 
welcomed Detroit strikers to exhibit fliers and other material, including the strikers' Sunday Journal, 
which may be ordered via mail. Send a check for $15, or VISA or MasterCard number and 
expiration date, with name, address and telephone number to The Detroit Sunday Journal, 
Attention: Subscriptions, 3100 E. Jefferson, Detroit, Mich. 48207. </p>
<p>FRIENDLY SKIES? _ Flight Attendants have reached a tentative four-year agreement with 
United Airlines that puts a halt to the establishment of international bases, a long contentious issue, 
and caps the growth of existing overseas operations. United's plans for the overseas bases were the 
major reason the union opted out of an employee buyout of the airline in 1993. Mail ballot returns 
on the agreement are due in April. </p>
<p>AFSCME SCORES IN NEW YORK _ Forgoing wage increases for two years in exchange for 
keeping their jobs, some 125,000 members of AFSCME District Council 37 in New York City 
voted 19,513-14,438, or 57 percent, in favor of a new five-year contract. The agreement contains 
strong layoff protection through June 30, 1998, and provisional and part-time city employees are, 
for the first time, protected from layoff. Wages will advance 11.13 percent in the three years after 
the two-year freeze. </p>
<p>&quot;TEAM COMCEPT&quot; ILL-CONCEIVED _ United Parcel Service Inc. has drawn heat for its 
&quot;Team Concept&quot; program, which aims to divide union members, increase workloads and 
undermine basic contractual rights, the Teamsters say. The union is concerned that self-directed 
teams will be pressured to discipline fellow union members and assume other supervisory tasks, all 
the while without regard to seniority or compensation. IBT has demanded that UPS provide 
complete program details and objectives, in the meantime directing local unions not to participate. </p>
<p>BRIDGESTONE LAWBREAKING _ The National Labor Relations Board has accused 
Bridgestone/Firestone of a wide range of unfair labor practices that could cost the company &quot;tens 
of millions of dollars&quot; to correct. The charges claim Bridgestone/Firestone prolonged a strike by the 
Steelworkers and illegally fired striking workers. The NLRB will seek an order requiring the 
company to reinstate all the illegally fired workers along with back pay and benefits. </p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL CONNECTION _ Joaquin (Jack) Otero, former AFL-CIO vice president 
and vice president of the Transportation Communications Union, will be nominated to serve as the 
Department of Labor's assistant secretary for international labor affairs, the White House said. 
Otero, a Cuban native, joined the Clinton administration in 1993 as the deputy undersecretary of 
labor. </p>
<p>DEATHS IN THE FAMILY _ Jim Wood, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles 
AFL-CIO died of cancer Monday. &quot;He's made a great contribution to the labor movement in 
California,&quot; President Sweeney told the Executive Council. Last week, labor lost Marshall M. 
Hicks, the former president of the Utility Workers, who died of cancer Feb. 12. Hicks, who was 
re-elected to a second term last year, &quot;was a tireless worker . . . always available to take phone 
calls, help with stalled negotiations or arbitration,&quot; said Donald E. Wightman, who took the union's 
reins from Hicks in January, when Hicks retired due to the illness.&quot; </p>

<h3 align=center>Work in Progress for Tuesday, Feb. 13, 1996 </h3>
<p>GOOD NEWS ON LEGISLATIVE FRONT . . . A Sunday Washington Post article notes that 
business lobbyists are licking their wounds after having nothing to show for the first session of the 
GOP- dominated 104th Congress. &quot;Basically, these (corporate) people have bitten off too much,&quot; 
AFL-CIO Legislative Director Peggy Taylor is quoted as saying. &quot;The Republicans have 
accomplished almost nothing and we feel we've played an important role in that.&quot; </p>
<p>. . . BUT NUMBERS STILL DOWN -- BLS figures on union membership for 1995 reinforce the 
need for the massive organizing effort planned by the AFL-CIO. Union rolls declined by 388,000 
last year, from 16.7 million to 16.4 million. That means the rate of unionization fell from 15.5 
percent to 14.9 percent of employed wage and salary workers. The rate for private industry was 
10.4 percent, and for government it was 37.8 percent. The union advantage remained strong: 
Unionized workers earned 35 percent more than nonunion workers. </p>
<p>YOU CAN HELP IN DETROIT -- Support the more than 2,000 union members striking the 
Detroit newspapers by subscribing to the Detroit Sunday Journal, a full-scale weekly newspaper 
that is written, edited, produced and distributed by union members. For a three-month subscription, 
send a check for $15 or VISA or MasterCard number and expiration date, along with your name, 
address and telephone number, to: The Detroit Sunday Journal, Attention: Mail Subscriptions, 
3100 E. Jefferson, Detroit, Mich. 48207. </p>
<p>YALE OFFICE, MAINTENANCE WORKERS STICK TOGETHER -- SuperGlue can't begin 
to touch the bonding power of members of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Locals 
34 and 35 at Yale University. Members of Local 34, representing 2,600 clerical and technical 
workers, began a six-week strike on Feb. 7 over work rules, wages, pay scales and retiree 
benefits. Meanwhile, some 1,100 members of Local 35 remained on the job, bringing in wages to 
support both groups. If a contract agreement is not reached by late March, Local 35 may strike the 
university while members of Local 34 return to work. Contract negotiations for both locals have 
been unsuccessful since November. </p>
<p>DON'T SLEEP WITH THE ENEMY -- Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Local 11 
has launched a consumer boycott of New Otani Hotel and Garden in Los Angeles. The hotel 
refuses to negotiate with its workers and has created a &quot;climate of intimidation&quot; among its mostly 
women and immigrant employees that makes a free election nearly impossible, said HERE Local 
11 President Maria Elena Durazo. </p>
<p>OFF THE MARK -- The National Governor's Association weighed in on the congressional budget 
debate last week with a series of bipartisan proposals unacceptable to working families. Most 
egregious is the agreement on Medicaid cuts that weakens guaranteed requirements for eligibility, 
scope of benefits and standards of care. The governors also endorsed a slashed welfare plan that 
would cost jobs and supported eliminating overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act for 
public employees. Call your U.S. senator and representative to tell them you oppose the governors' 
deals. </p>
<p>HITS KEEP COMING ON NLRB -- The assault by Congressional Republicans on the National 
Labor Relations Board budget &quot;has less to do with balancing the federal budget than with 
preserving the imbalance of power that exists in America and in American workplaces,&quot; AFL-CIO 
Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka told a Senate subcommittee Feb. 7. So long as the nation &quot;holds 
out to working men and women the promise of a legal right to organize and bargain collectively&quot; 
through the National Labor Relations Act, then it has an obligation to, provide enough money for 
the NLRB to do its job, he said. . </p>
<p>GOIN' SOUTH -- Before heading to Bal Harbour, Fla., for the Feb. 19-22 Executive Council and 
other union meetings, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney will be interviewed this week by CNN 
and CNBC. Secretary- Treasurer Rich Trumka will be interviewed on a segment of the syndicated 
&quot;America's Talking&quot; TV program, and Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson will be 
on radio in Chicago's &quot;Liz First Show.&quot; </p>
<p>BRINGING IN FREIGHT -- With the vote by workers at Kentucky and New York terminals of 
Union Pacific's Overnite Transportation Co. to join the Teamsters, more than 1,600 workers at 17 
Overnite terminals now have voted for the union. Overnite is the largest nonunion 
less-than-truckload freight carrier in the nation. The NLRB, which is seeking bargaining orders at 
15 other locations where Overnite broke the law, begins a court hearing in Minneapolis this week 
on more than 100 unfair labor practice complaints against the company. Overnite, meanwhile, has 
given workers two pay raises since the campaign began, but that has not stopped the drive's 
momentum. </p>
<p>NURSES NOT SUPERVISORS -- The NLRB ruled last week that nurses at an Anchorage, 
Alaska, hospital and LPNs at a New York State nursing home are employees, not supervisors. It 
was the first nurse classification ruling by the board since the Supreme Court in 1994 boxed some 
nurses into the supervisor category, and it could pave the way to resolve 70 similar cases now 
before the NLRB. </p>
<p>THIS TEAM DESERVES TO LOSE -- Unions are countering a massive selling job by employers 
for the misnamed TEAM Act, which would &quot;give carte blanche to unscrupulous employers to 
establish phony, company-dominated committees in which management would effectively dictate 
who would speak for the workers,&quot; UAW Legislative Director Alan Reuther told a Senate 
committee Feb. 8. AFL-CIO General Counsel Jonathan Hiatt testified that companies have used 
these types of worker committees to create the form, but not the substance, of joint 
decision-making. The employer groups are trying to win veto-proof support for the bill, which 
President Clinton has vowed to fight. Make your feelings known by calling your senator through the 
AFL-CIO's toll-free number: 1-800/97-AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>CALL FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY -- Union activists can help send the message to Congress 
and the White House that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration must be spared the 
massive budget cuts included in the current continuing resolution. Under the CR, which funds the 
Labor Department and other agencies through March 16, OSHA is operating at a 15.5 percent 
budget cut from 1995 levels, while the Mine Safety and Health Administration's budget has been 
cut by 8 percent. It is especially important to contact -- at 1-800-97-AFL-CIO -- the following 
members of Congress: Reps. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), David E. Bonior (D-Mich.), Vic 
Fazio (D-Calif.), David R. Obey (D-Wis.) and John E. Porter (R-Ill.); and Sens. Thomas A. 
Daschle (D-S.D.), Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.), Barbara </p>
<ol>
<li>Mikulski (D-Md.), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), Mark O. Hatfield 
(R-Ore.) and Arlen Specter (R-Pa.). The White House may be reached by calling 
202/456-1111 or through e-mail, at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">http://www.whitehouse.gov/</a> Action materials for the job 
safety campaign are available in the LaborNET safety and health library or by calling Keith 
Mestrich at 202/637-5210. </li>
</ol>
<p>CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP -- In major policy speeches, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and 
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass) have called for using tax incentives to persuade companies to 
better meet the needs of their workers by sharing profits, improving benefits, preserving jobs and 
increasing training. Kennedy also called for stiff penalties for employers who engage in anti-union 
activity. Reich will continue to push for &quot;corporate citizenship&quot; in media interviews this week, 
including an appearance tonight, on CNN's Larry King Live. </p>
<p>A BREAK FOR WORKING FAMILIES -- Unions can help spread the word about a tax benefit 
for working families with modest incomes, working either full time or part time. Information about 
the Earned Income Tax Credit is available from Alan Bosch in the AFL-CIO Department of 
Community Services at 202/637-5193. Meanwhile, the AFL-CIO is fighting efforts by the 
Republicans in Congress to roll back eligibility of this progressive income tax feature while trying to 
give more tax breaks to the rich and big business. President Clinton vetoed legislation that 
contained cuts in the EITC, calling its protection one of his top priorities. </p>
<p>FLOOD RELIEF $$ FLOWING -- Pennsylvania AFL-CIO President William M. George and 
other labor leaders joined President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of Labor 
Robert Reich in a Feb. 7 press conference to announce a U.S. Department of Labor grant for $7 
million for flood cleanup and to assist nearly 700 workers who lost their jobs due to widespread 
flooding in January. </p>
<p>ROTATING THE RUBBER -- Steelworkers President George Becker has named former Rubber 
Workers Organizational Director John Sellers as executive vice president of the Rubber/Plastics 
Industry Conference, filling a vacancy created by the retirement of Kenneth L. Coss, effective 
March 1. Coss, 60, is the former URW president who helped lead the union to merge with USWA 
in July 1995. </p>
<p>CALL WAITING ON AT&amp;T -- Communications Workers and Electrical Workers have blasted 
AT&amp;T for its persistent refusal to release details of its planned reorganization. The unions promised 
to do &quot;whatever is necessary&quot; to help their 100,000 members weather the massive changes coming 
with the layoff of 40,000 workers and the corporate restructuring that will split AT&amp;T into three 
companies. The unions said they would contact the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
pursue legal actions if necessary to shake loose the information. </p>
<p>NEW TACTICS FOR BIG PROBLEM -- The Wall Street Journal last week profiled new 
AFL-CIO Organizing Director Richard Bensinger under the headline, &quot;Chief AFL-CIO Organizer 
to Try Civil Rights Tactics.&quot; Said Bensinger of the labor movement's massive drive to organize 
workers and improve living standards, &quot;If somebody has another way of rebuilding the middle class 
in this country, please tell me.&quot; </p>

<h3 align=center>Work in Progress, Feb. 5, 1996 </h3>
<p>BIG WIN IN NEW YORK -- Some 35,000 striking New York building service workers came in 
from their cold picket-line posts after their month-long perseverance and solidarity resulted in a 
tentative contract between Service Employees Local 32B-32J and city building owners and 
managers. The state and city central labor councils were credited with organizing solidarity activity. 
The breakthrough came just days after New York building trades unions agreed not to cross picket 
lines. Special thanks go to the Operating Engineers and Electrical Workers. </p>
<p>OCAW, AMOCO AGREE -- The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers have reached agreement 
with Amoco in what is expected to set a pattern for the current round of negotiations with the oil 
industry, OCAW President Robert E. Wages said. Amoco employs 4,500 workers covered by 
OCAW contracts. The tentative pact, which would increase wages by $1.51 per hour over three 
years, came after the union rejected three offers last week, then extended talks beyond the contract 
expiration date. </p>
<p>OREGON MODEL FOR 1996 -- Working families were crucial for Ron Wyden, who became 
the first Democratic senator from Oregon since 1962. Turnout for the state's 120,000 registered 
union voters appeared to be higher than the overall 65 percent level, contributing significantly to 
Wyden's 17,000-vote margin. &quot;We put together an unparalleled political effort,&quot; said AFL-CIO 
President John Sweeney, who pointed to &quot;a new textbook on politics we're going to write this year, 
as we recruit and train activists to build the core of a powerful new grass-roots movement to 
improve the lives of American working families.&quot; The Executive Council has approved a plan to 
raise $35 million devoted to political training and advertising. </p>
<p>ON TO IOWA! -- With the Iowa caucuses coming up, SecretaryTreasurer Rich Trumka rallied 
the state AFL-CIO COPE convention to fight to return Tom Harkin to the Senate and &quot;return Greg 
Ganske and Jim Nussle to Iowa. . . . Use this challenging election year to rejuvenate the labor 
movement here just as we are rebuilding it at the national level.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;RIGHT-TO-WORK&quot; FIGHT -- The Oregon campaign also was a model in coalition-building 
with environmentalists, women's and other progressive groups, a critical help in the fight against an 
openshop ballot initiative spawned by the anti-union National Right to Work Committee. Another 
state where labor is seeking to check &quot;right-to-work&quot; forces is Oklahoma, where the state 
federation is holding a rally at the state capitol today to castigate Gov. William Keating (R) for a 
right-to-work call in his State of the State address. </p>
<p>LABORERS ADD 1,027 -- Professional and nonprofessional employees at six Phoenix-area 
Indian Health Service facilities have voted for representation by the Laborers. The Jan. 30 vote -- 
268 for LIUNA, 38 for the incumbent National Federation of Federal Employees and 24 against 
union representation (with 35 ballots challenged -- was delayed because of the government 
shutdown. The Federal Labor Relations Authority said 1,027 were eligible to vote. </p>
<p>PAY EQUITY IN TRADES -- Aggressive enforcement and higher affirmative action goals are key 
to achieving pay equity in the construction industry, according to &quot;Building Equal Opportunity,&quot; a 
report by Chicago Women in the Trades. A survey of six construction sites found that men earn as 
much as 19 times more than women. For copies, contact CWIT, 220 South Ashland Avenue, 
Suite 101, Chicago, Ill. 60607-1805; or call 312/942-1444. </p>
<p>EMPOWERING -- Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson talked about the role of 
unions in empowering women at an EXPO '96 forum sponsored by the Feminist Majority, noting 
that the women's movement and the labor movement belong together. &quot;One of the best friends of 
American women is the labor movement . . . I'm talking about the millions of women who teach our 
kids, drive our buses, make our clothes, work the assembly lines and take care of us when we're 
sick,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>COMING THIS WEEK -- President Sweeney will address Postal Workers at APWU 
headquarters on Wednesday and travel to New York for a meeting of the city's central body 
Thursday. Secretary-Treasurer Trumka testifies to Congress Tuesday about the impact of NLRB 
budget cuts and travels to San Jose, Calif., Friday for a regional conference of central labor 
councils. Executive Vice President Chavez-Thompson speaks to the National Association of 
Government Labor Officials Monday and goes to Minnesota Friday for an AFSCME leadership 
conference. All three executive officers join other Executive Council members in meeting with 
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, who will deliver a major speech on corporate responsibility on 
Tuesday. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy also is scheduled to address the issue of wages on 
Wednesday. </p>
<p>COURT STRIKES OUT -- The AFL-CIO intends to fight the Feb. 2 appeals court decision to 
overturn President Clinton's executive order barring federal contractors that permanently replace 
striking workers. Sweeney said the decision is &quot;simply wrong&quot; because it serves those &quot;employers 
who want to wage war on workers and hurts the rest of us.&quot; </p>
<p>WAR ON WORKERS -- The NLRB estimates that more than 40,000 workers, unions and 
employers across the country were adversely affected by the two government shutdowns. The 
NLRB was forced to reschedule approximately 250 representation elections and 350 hearings in 
representation and unfair labor practice cases. When offices opened Jan. 8, NLRB staff faced 720 
new unfair labor practice charges and 120 representation case petitions that had been filed by mail 
during the shutdown, which began Dec. 18. </p>
<p>BECK RULING DECRIED -- The AFL-CIO will appeal a part of a National Labor Relations 
Board ruling on how unions inform workers of their right to object to paying dues for some 
activities, the board's first ruling on the U.S. Supreme Court's 1988 Communications Workers vs. 
Beck decision. Unions object to a provision requiring them to inform employees they have a right 
not to join the union, since employers aren't required to inform workers of their right to join a union, 
said AFL-CIO General Counsel Jon Hiatt. The NLRB decision does give unions a break in the 
way they calculate the reduced dues and litigation costs. </p>
<p>AGAINST BAD LAWS -- On Wednesday, Teamsters General Counsel Judy Scott will testify on 
behalf of the AFL-CIO against a bill by Rep. Peter Hoekstra (R-Mich.) that would bar workers 
from leafleting in front of retail stores. AFL-CIO General Counsel Jon Hiatt will testify Thursday 
against the so-called TEAM Act, which would legalize company unions. </p>
<p>IN THE DOCK ON THE BAY -- SEIU President Richard W. Cordtz was among 42 
demonstrators arrested Jan. 31 in San Francisco's financial district while protesting the quality of 
patient care at California's Vencor-Hillhaven nursing homes. The union also is running radio ads in 
cities throughout the country where the company operates facilities, calling it a &quot;heartless profit 
machine.&quot; </p>
<p>GRASS-ROOTS GAIN -- Public employee grass-roots lobbying efforts are credited with 
convincing the Fair Labor Standards Act task force of the U.S. Conference of Mayors to oppose 
any efforts to strike public employee overtime requirements from the FLSA. The vote was 6-3. </p>
<p>IBT AIRS TRUCK ROADBLOCK -- The Teamsters are sponsoring national radio ads to 
support rallies and a letter-writing campaign calling on the White House and Congress to make 
permanent a temporary delay of a NAFTA provision that would allow thousands of unsafe 
Mexican trucks to enter U.S. highways. Trucks from Mexico are three times as old on the average, 
up to twice as heavy and don't have to meet the same emissions standards or insurance 
requirements. Drivers also don't have to be trained in handling hazardous materials and aren't 
subject to U.S. rules for drug and alcohol testing or hours on the road. A video and fliers are 
available from the IBT Communications Department at 202/624-6911. </p>
<p>FUN IN ACAPULCO -- Mexico has become the top destination for transferring executives, and 
Chile, which has never been in the top 10 but is now the subject of a proposed NAFTA expansion, 
holds the No. 2 spot. As of Jan. 22, the Labor Department had received petitions for NAFTA 
trade adjustment assistance from 768 firms in 48 states. Certifications have been made in 380 
cases covering more than 53,000 workers, but the actual number of workers dislocated by the 
pact has been estimated to be much higher. </p>
<p>A CHILL ON JOBS -- Unemployment was up sharply (0.2 percent to 5.8 percent) in January as 
severe winter weather in the East helped to siphon off 200,000 jobs, pushing the unemployment 
rate up. Even in December, when the jobless rate remained unchanged at 5.6 percent, the economy 
appeared to be sputtering. &quot;There's just no damn work out there,&quot; said New Jersey AFL-CIO 
President Charles Marciante. </p>
<p>MOVING UP ON D STREET - J. Davitt McAteer, a former safety director at the Mine 
Workers, has been named acting solicitor of the Labor Department. Ida Castro, the deputy 
assistant for workers' compensation, was named acting deputy solicitor. David St. John, who 
previously served as an assistant to former AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, has been named 
chief writer for the assistant secretary for policy. </p>
<p>FEARS FOR SAFETY -- Although four leaders of one of Nigeria's oil workers unions were 
released from prison earlier this month, NUPENG's General Secretary, Frank Kokori, remains in 
prison without counsel or communication with the outside. He and other trade unionists were 
arrested for organizing and leading a strike in opposition to the military regime in July and August 
1994. There are growing fears Kokori will be condemned to death by the Nigerian regime, which 
recently executed nine human rights activists. Please send letters of protest to: Honorable Alhaji 
Uba Ahmed, Minister of Labour and Productivity, Federal Government of Nigeria, Ministry of 
Labour, Republic of Nigeria; FAX to 011-234-126-92293 or 011- 234-129-9281. </p>

<body>
<h3 align=center>Work in Progress<br>
Monday, Jan. 29, 1996 </h3>
<p><b>TURNING POINT</b> - In what AFL-CIO President John Sweeney described as &quot;an historic 
turning point,&quot; the Executive Council on Jan. 24 considered a number of sweeping structural and 
program changes at the federation. Summaries of recommendations by five transition work groups 
are available in the Public Statements libary of LaborNET on CompuServe, or by calling 
202/637-5010. </p>
<p>PRIORITY NO. 1: ORGANIZING - The AFL-CIO's top priority is organizing, Sweeney said in 
naming Richard Bensinger, 45, to head a new Organizing Department. Bensinger, who has directed 
the federation's successful Organizing Institute since 1989, is charged with administering a $20 
million organizing fund to help affiliates bring in new union members. The new department also will 
oversee the work of the institute, which will be headed by Allison Porter, 35, who has been deputy 
director of the institute since its founding. </p>
<p>TURN, TURN, TURN _ Among key recommendations already in the works are a new Center for 
Strategic Campaigns, which will help unions apply economic leverage in organizing drives, 
bargaining campaigns and strikes, as well as a Worker Ownership and Governance Institute to 
assist unions with employee buyouts, corporate restructuring schemes and pension fund investment. 
The federation's communications structure will be reorganized into four divisions, beefing up our 
ability to speak out for working families. </p>
<p>POLITICAL MIRACLE? _ Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka traveled to Oregon Friday to help 
with the 11th hour push to get union members to turn in their mail ballots for Rep. Ron Wyden (D). 
Results in this uphill race will be known late tomorrow. Labor's efforts in Oregon are 
unprecedented, said Political Director Steve Rosenthal, who unveiled to the council a plan for the 
AFL-CIO to invest $35 million into campaigning this year and to organize a cadre of 100 
permanent activists in each congressional district. </p>
<p>PRESSING THE NEWS _ Five major auto dealers have pulled their ads from Detroit's scab 
newspapers, bringing to more than 90 the number of dealers that have dropped out and to more 
than 800 the total number of advertisers that deserted the papers. Meanwhile, the NLRB added 
five more unfair labor practices charges against the papers. On Monday, Jan. 29, the AFL-CIO 
amended its anti-trust complaint against the newspapers, asking the Justice Department to disallow 
a proposed shutdown of the Riverside printing plant. The strikers' newspaper, The Sunday Journal, 
is looking for a few good advertisers. Contact William Brown, publisher, 3100 East Jefferson, 
Detroit MI 48207; Phone: 313/567-9818. </p>
<p>COMMITTEE CHAIRS _ Sweeney announced the appointment of new committee chairs in four 
key areas addressed by the transition work groups: Laborers' President Arthur Coia, to head the 
Organizing Committee; AFSCME President Gerry McEntee, leading the Political Education 
Committee; Food and Commercial Workers President Doug Dority, to direct the Public Affairs 
Committee; and AFT President Al Shanker, to head the Education Committee. </p>
<p>HIGH MARKS FOR CLINTON _ President Clinton received praise from union officers for his 
State of the Union address last Tuesday. The UFCW's Dority said the president was &quot;keeping the 
American Dream alive for average Americans.&quot; Sweeney said that &quot;after 20 years of stagnant 
wages in this country, it was good to see a president who will fight to make sure that hard work still 
pays. We particularly welcome his commitment to raise the minimum wage, to protect pension 
security and health care. </p>
<p>BACK TO GRASS ROOTS _ The council approved a statement to implement a constitutional 
amendment providing for regional representation of state federations on the General Board, which 
will meet sometime in March to consider an endorsement for president and vice president. 
Individual representatives from the four regions must be selected by Feb. 15, with their terms 
running for two years. </p>
<p>TOWN HALL MEETING _ Just prior to a vote that averted a third government shutdown, 10 
members of Congress participated Jan. 25 in a forum with more than 400 Government Employees 
and AFSCME members on Capitol Hill. The representatives, all from the Washington metropolitan 
area, denounced the actions of Congress and called for a picket around the Capitol if the 
government is shut down again. The forum included two Republicans, Reps. Thomas M. Davis 
(Va.) and Constance A. Morella (Md.), who later cast their votes for a continuing resolution to 
keep the government running. That resolution, however, forces many agencies to sharply cut back 
services and may force layoffs. </p>
<p>OSHA, WE'D HARDLY KNOW YA _ Congressional Republicans will be setting strategy over 
the next several weeks for legislation to emasculate OSHA, MSHA and NIOSH, as well as 
_reform&quot; the regulatory process. Labor and its allies also are holding strategy sessions to seize the 
rhetoric and the campaign over regulatory reform. This week, 50 editorial boards across 
Pennsylvania will be receiving material on Rep. Cass Ballenger's OSHA-gutting measure, with such 
mailings planned in other states. Follow-up letters sent locally are encouraged. For information, call 
Keith Mestrich at 202/637- 5210. </p>
<p>UNION REPRESENTATION PAYS _ The Postal Workers won an estimated $63 million in 
back pay for 25,000 transitional employees when an NLRB arbitrator ruled that the U.S. Postal 
Service violated the union contract and federal law. Under the Jan. 9 ruling, the transitional 
employees are entitled to be paid $1.26 per hour for every hour worked since the first full pay 
period in February 1995. </p>
<p>WRITE FOR RIGHTS _ The AFL-CIO is urging unionists to write letters calling for the release of 
Roliati Harefa, vice chair of Indonesia's independent SBSI union. Harefa was fired without 
explanation from her job at a wood factory, twice beaten by company management, and then jailed 
when she reported the second beating. Amnesty International expects that Harefa, like other 
imprisoned trade union activists, will suffer ill-treatment in prison. Letters of protest may be sent to 
H.E. Dr. Abdul Latief, Minister of Manpower; J. Gen. Gatto Subroto; Jakarta Pusat; Jakarta, 
Indonesia. Or FAX to 62 21 840-2746. </p>
<p>SMART STRATEGY _ The $7 million spent by the Communications Workers on a five-month 
corporate campaign, ending in a good contract with Bell Atlantic, is the same amount the union 
would have spent for just one week of strike benefits, CWA President Morton Bahr told the 
Executive Council. The campaign included shareholder and customer outreach, as well as a TV 
advertising campaign that put the company on the spot. If CWA had paid the same benefits to 
workers in the 1989 strike against Nynex, it would have cost close to $170 million, the union said. </p>
<p>UNITE AD CAMPAIGN _ The Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees today 
launches its first national advertising campaign. &quot;The Face of Change&quot; is intended to increase 
familiarity with the new 300,000-member union and to position it as a force for social and political 
action. Ads will run on CNN and on major TV networks in New York, Washington and Atlanta. </p>
<p>STRIKING BUILDINGS _ Some 35,000 New York building service workers remain on strike 
after talks broke off with owners of the posh high-rises. Gus Bevona, president of Service 
Employees Local 32B-32J, said the employers' demand for a two-tier wage system is a &quot;prelude to 
replacing long-term office cleaners and other workers with low-paid strangers.&quot; </p>
<p>STAGE SET FOR TALKS _ Actors' Equity has begun negotiations with 64 theaters in major 
cities and states to replace an agreement that expires Feb. 25. Some 7,000 actors are involved, 
working at the regional and repertory theaters in 29 states, including the Lincoln Center Theatre in 
New York and the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. </p>
<p>RALLY FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY _ Members of the Service Employees Local 250 and 
supporters in the San Francisco area take to the streets this week in the fight for quality patient care 
at Vencor-Hillhaven nursing homes. More than 1,000 workers throughout 25 Vencor-Hillhaven 
homes have worked for a year without a contract. </p>
<p>GOOD NEWS AT NLRB _ The White House announced that former union attorney Sarah M. 
Fox will serve as a recess appointee to the National Labor Relations Board. Fox, who previously 
served as chief counsel to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, will be able to 
keep a seat on the five-member board through the fall of 1997. She served as general counsel to 
the Bricklayers from 1982 to 1990. </p>

<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS January 23, 1996 </h3>
<p><em>THE FIRST BULLETIN</em> -- In an effort to communicate
more quickly and effectively with union leaders, supporters and
activists across the country, the AFL-CIO today begins
distribution of a weekly FAX bulletin, which also goes to the
media and a variety of outside audiences. Work in Progress will
arrive at your office the first of every week. For further
information, or to send information for inclusion, please send
FAX to 202/508-6908. </p>
<p><em>COUNCIL NOW, GENERAL BOARD LATER</em> -- The new AFL-CIO
Executive Council meets Wednesday, Jan. 24, at the Sheraton
Washington hotel for its first full session since the 1995
convention. Meanwhile, meetings of the General Board and state
federations on the 1996 elections have been delayed because of
scheduling conflicts -- probably until mid-March. At a 12:15 p.m.
press briefing at the break of the council meeting, President
John Sweeney will discuss proposed changes in AFL- CIO programs. </p>
<p><em>THEY'RE BACK, AFTER TAKING FLAK</em> -- Congress returns
this week after many in the Gingrich camp were lambasted with
another wave of advertising and grass-roots activity sponsored by
the AFL-CIO and its affiliates. TV and radio ads, which ran in 25
major cities and nationally, n Republican leaders for using a
government shutdown in an effort to blackmail President Clinton
into accepting their dangerous budget plan. The message: No cuts
in Medicare, Medicaid, education and worker protections to pay
for big tax breaks for the rich and big business. </p>
<p><em>UNIONS STATE CASE</em> -- State and local AFL-CIO
officials have been asked to offer the perspective of working
families to local reporters after President Clinton's State of
the Union address Tuesday evening. &quot;While the White House
and congressional press corps will focus on `inside' reactions
from Washington, the media in the rest of the country should be
much more open to doing stories about public reactions to
Clinton's message,&quot; Sweeney wrote. </p>
<p><em>BIG WIN FOR CWA</em> -- The Communications Workers
announced a tentative agreement with Bell Atlantic after five
months of contentious bargaining. The company had resisted
matching contracts offered by other regional Bell operating
companies, but relented in the face of CWA's massive membership
mobilization and a $7 million corporate campaign that included a
memorable TV ad featuring a bumbling subcontracted repairman
named Larry. CWA President Morton Bahr, meanwhile, denounced
AT&amp;T's plans to lay off 40,000 workers. &quot;This is yet
another case of the kind of mindless job destruction that has
terrorized working Americans in recent years as corporate
executives play to Wall Street,&quot; he said. </p>
<p><em>THE BOSS: UNIONS ARE THE BEST</em> -- Rock superstar Bruce
Springsteen, at a concert in Detroit, donated proceeds from
souvenir sales and matched that amount with a contribution of his
own to striking workers at the Detroit News and Free Press.
Advertisers continue to desert the sinking Detroit papers, owned
by Gannett and Knight-Ridder. Top officials of those companies
sold about $3 million worth of company stock shortly before
admitting to Wall Street that they had severely underestimated
some $250 million in strike losses, reported the strikers' own
newspaper, the Detroit Sunday Journal. </p>
<p><em>RIGHTS TO ACTION</em> -- Executive Vice President Linda
Chavez-Thompson and Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka were in
Atlanta last week marching with the King family on the Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday. Honored at the annual King
labor-management breakfast were AFL-CIO President John Sweeney,
UNITE President Jay Mazur and Laborers President Arthur Coia.
Chavez-Thompson later joined Georgia Rep. Cynthia McKinney and
labor's environmental and civil rights allies in a rally against
the exploitative kaolin industry, and spoke at an Industrial
Union Department regional conference on organizing. She finished
the week in Oregon traveling with Rep. Ron Wyden, who is labor's
choice to replace Sen. Bob Packwood (R). The mail balloting ends
there Jan. 30. </p>
<p><em>LOOKING AHEAD</em> -- Trumka travels to Boston Monday for
an address to the Harvard Trade Union Program class and to Lynn,
Mass., to speak to the North Shore AFL-CIO. Sweeney, who joined
the Operating Engineers for their 100th anniversary celebration
in Orlando last week, on Tuesday will address the domestic policy
committee of the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington. </p>
<p><em>WHAT ABOUT WORKER SAFETY?</em> -- The business lobby will
not get away with their campaign to stop OSHA from creating an
ergonomics standard, Sweeney has declared. An
&quot;analysis&quot; by a coalition led by trucking and
manufacturing industries &quot;is the latest effort in its
ongoing campaign to use power, money and distortions to keep the
government from protecting workers from crippling repetitive
strain injuries and illnesses,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;This is
not about science. It's about industry trying to rid itself of
all regulations and gut job safety protections. </p>
<p><em>UNIONS UP TO TASK</em> -- Secretary-Treasurer Trumka, in a
front-page story in the Jan. 22 Wall Street Journal, warned that
if corporations &quot;fail to share more of their windfall
profits with workers, they do so at their peril.&quot; The
article, previewing upcoming negotiations with the oil and
airline industries, notes that the new leadership of the AFL-CIO
hopes to turn the growing anger of ordinary workers into
victories at the bargaining table. </p>
<p><em>NEW PRESIDENTS</em> -- The Utility Workers and Police
Associations got new presidents last week. Donald Wightman of
Boston was elected by UWUA to fill the unexpired term of Marshall
Hicks, who retired due to illness. Sam Cabral moved up to
president from secretary-treasurer of the IUPA after Robert
Kliesmet was appointed sheriff of Milwaukee County, a management
position. </p>
<p><em>PBS PROFILES A. PHILIP RANDOLPH</em> -- Public television
will celebrate Black History Month with &quot;A. Philip Randolph:
For Jobs and Freedom,&quot; a 90-minute film documentary produced
by WETA, Feb. 2 at 9 p.m. on PBS stations nationwide. Randolph,
an AFL-CIO vice president and founder of the Brotherhood of
Sleeping Car Porters, led the fight against legal discrimination
in government and the military and helped to organize the 1963
March on Washington. </p>

AFL-CIO</title>

<body>
<p align="center">Remarks by John J. Sweeney President of the
AFL-CIO<br>
The Commonwealth Club San Francisco February 7, 1997</p>
<p>Thank you for that kind introduction and your warm welcome --
and also thank you for the warm weather and the chance to escape
the mean streets of Washington, DC. And when I say &quot;mean
streets,&quot; I'm not talking about those broad boulevards
outside the United States Capitol where drugs are bought and sold
by night. No, I'm talking about those narrow corridors inside the
Capitol, where the American Dream is bought and sold by day, and
where the working families of America have been getting mugged
for the past two years by a gang of thugs masquerading as members
of the United States Congress. </p>
<p>Well, that's all changed now and we're putting a stop to all
the bad stuff. And it's not because the AFL-CIO did such a great
job in the elections last fall, although we certainly took more
ground than we took fire. And it's not because the Speaker of the
House was reprimanded by the House ethics committee and fined
$300,000, although he certainly deserved it. </p>
<p>No, it's because last Tuesday night, the President of the
United States delivered one of the finest &quot;State of the
Union&quot; addresses in the history of our country, and because
the State of California did its part in assuring the President of
the largest television audience in peacetime history. </p>
<p>I was watching CBS cover the speech live and I have to
confess, I was furious when they cut into his final summation
with the results of the O.J. Simpson trial. But I knew something
extraordinary had happened when I asked my son John the next
morning why he had taken my car the night before without
permission and he replied: &quot;We must be shapers of events,
not observers, for if we do not act, the moment will pass and we
will lose the best possibilities of our future.&quot; </p>
<p>So the President got his message through to a new and bigger
audience and I'm sure that members of the 105th Congress are now
scrambling to get on that train that is going to take us all
across that bridge into the 21st Century, which, as the President
pointed out, is just 1,000 days away. </p>
<p>And because time is running out and we're getting closer and
closer, I hope you'll allow me to skip over all the things the
President said he's going to do to stoke the engine and keep the
train running and keep the construction of the bridge on time and
on budget -- which I'm sure is going to happen if he's using
union labor and paying Davis-Bacon wages. What I want to talk
about are the dangers we face -- not the things we could do
right, but three things we could do wrong, three ways we could
&quot;lose the best possibilities of our future.&quot; We could
pass the balanced budget amendment and privatize Social Security
and derail the train, sending it all the way back to the turning
of the 20th century. Or we could fail to narrow the wage and
wealth gap and watch it swallow up the bridge altogether. All
three are more than just bad for workers and their families --
they are bad public policy, bad economics, bad financial
management, bad business and bad for business. </p>
<p>The balanced budget amendment has for many years been a
favorite war drum for the new right, the far right and the not-
quite-so-right. &quot;You have to manage our country's budget the
way you manage your family budget. You have to run the country
like you run a business.&quot; </p>
<p>Robert Eisner did a good job of exposing their gibberish a few
weks ago in the Wall Street Journal and all of you in this room
understood what he wrote. Run our government like a business?
Then what is a current expense, how fast do you depreciate, what
do you amortize, how do you price inventories, when do you put in
special charges, how do you handle pension funds? Should Social
Security be off budget? Shouldn't our government have a separate
capital budget if we're going to run it like a business? Manage
our country like we manage our family budgets? Where would we all
be without borrowing to finance our homes, to send our kids to
college, to buy durable goods? Businesses borrow, and even state
and local governments have separate capital accounts. </p>
<p>The truth is that if you applied the balanced budget amendment
to a business, you would be out of business. And if we did the
same to our family budgets, half of us would be living in tents.
Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin is against the balanced
budget amendment: he knows it would create more layers of
government regulation and whack state and local governments every
other year. Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan is against the
balanced budget amendment: he knows that as soon as we hit a
little recession Congress would run it into a big depression by
raising taxes or cutting spending or both. 1,000 leading
economists, including 11 Nobel prize winners, are against the
balanced budget because, among other things, it just isn't
needed. And John Sweeney is against the balanced budget
amendment: I know, just like you know, that it is a reckless,
indefensible ploy to cut the services and programs and
protections working families depend upon most. </p>
<p>How about you? Which side are you on? I don't mean on the
question of downsizing government -- feel free to take your best
shot on that. I mean on the question of putting our country in an
economic straight-jacket that would prevent federal borrowing to
finance any sort of infrastructure, much less a bridge to a new
century. No, I'm not going to take a show of hands. I don't have
to, because I know most of you are businessmen, not ideologues
and you know what's right when it comes to the balanced budget
amendment. </p>
<p>Now let's look at a second way we can kill the goose that has
laid so many golden eggs for so many of the people in this room,
another way to screw around recklessly with an economy that is
providing a greater standard of living for a greater percent of
our population than at any time in our history: let's privatize
Social Security. </p>
<p>Situation: for 60 years, our Old Age, Survivors and Disability
Insurance system helps build a national community where our
citizens pull together to help everybody, instead of a society
where I look out for myself and the rest be damned. It lifts four
generations of senior citizens out of poverty, allows them to
live in dignity and not have to depend on their ungrateful
children. A few bumps along the way, but we fix them. Unlike many
government programs, it is incredibly efficient, with an
administrative cost of only seven-tenths of one percent. Never
contributes to the national debt. Enjoys the support of 90
percent of the American people. </p>
<p>Problem: the program gets out of whack. It will only provide
full benefits for everyone through 2030, only 75 percent after
that, because the Baby Boomers will be well into their
retirements. You could fix the entire problem with a 2.17 percent
increase in the FICA contribution, but nobody in Congress, and
certainly nobody in California wants a tax increase. </p>
<p>Here's the solution a majority of members of the Social
Security Advisory Council came up with last month: cut benefits
30 percent, increase the payroll tax 26 percent, give individuals
back two to five percent of the contribution and force them to
play our national lottery. If they find a good investment
counselor, and if they buy the right stocks, they come out with
bigger pensions. If they aren't so lucky, they end up in the
county poorhouses, which, of course, we closed down shortly after
we passed Social Security 60 years ago. </p>
<p>Did I run through those numbers too fast? Did you hear the
kicker up there? A 30 percent cut in benefits and a 26 percent
increase in the payroll tax? That's 1.6 percent more under one
plan, 1.5 percent under another, one for 72 years, the other
forever. For a nation that won't tolerate a tax increase! To pay,
in the first 12 years alone, $240 billion in fees and commissions
on more than $4 trillion dollars into the market! </p>
<p>But what about the Chilean model? It works, doesn't it? Sure
it does: the workers pay 20 percent for old age, disability and
survivors insurance and health care, while employers pay nothing.
The for-profit businesses which run the program get a three
percent administrative fee, their investors earn a 22 percent
annual profit, and 70 percent of the workers have less than
$2,500 in their retirement accounts. </p>
<p>Now I really am tempted to ask for a show of hands and ask
everyone in this room how smart it is to invest our future in a
Bull market being fueled by the savings of Baby Boomers who in 30
years, just when we need the money most, are going to be pulling
all that dough out of the market. But I'm not going to ask
because I know what you think. Whether you're conservative or
liberal or neither one, you are sons and daughters and you have
mothers and fathers and children of your own and you know what's
right. </p>
<p>So let's look at a third issue, something that is already
draining away our economic vitality and threatening to send our
children and our grandchildren to the poorhouse right along with
our mothers and fathers. We call it the wage and wealth gap. </p>
<p>For almost 30 years after winning World War II, we all
prospered because we prospered together. We were concerned with
raising the standard of living for all Americans -- not just
accumulating money for a fortunate few. Our social compact was a
formula for the strongest economy, the largest middle class, and
the most successful society this world has ever known. </p>
<p>Those days began to come to an end in the early 1970s when
corporate America made a fateful decision to compete in the new
global economy, not through team-work and know-how, but by
driving down labor costs. Rather than compete on the basis of
quality and expand the markets for their goods and services,
corporations chose to increase their profit margins by moving
plants into low-wage markets and by outsourcing and shipping jobs
overseas. Even employers with proud histories of doing right by
their workers joined the rush to speed up work, freeze wages,
slash health benefits and eliminate pensions. </p>
<p>As a result, the rich got richer, while America_s working
families got left behind. Over the last 20 years, real earnings
declined, average family income stagnated and purchasing power
eroded, leaving the U.S. with the most uneven distribution of
wealth of any major industrialized nation. By 1992, the top 20
percent controlled 80 percent of the wealth! </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the wealthiest Americans are doing better than
ever. Between 1980 and 1995, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose 404 percent. That provided huge payoffs for investors -- but
no wage gains for workers. Corporate profits have risen 165
percent since 1980. Corporate chief executive officers are raking
in 499 percent more -- and now they earn 145 times more than the
average factory worker. And that's in spite of the fact that
workers' productivity has risen 24 percent since 1979 -- while
their real wages fell! And now, instead of merely depressing
wages, profitable corporations are wiping out jobs in a frenzy to
jack up their stock prices by taking short-term profits instead
of long-term profitability. </p>
<p>American families tried all kinds of coping mechanisms. They
sent husbands, wives, and teen-age kids into the labor force.
They took second and third jobs. Despite their efforts, median
family income fell five percent between 1989 and 1994. </p>
<p>For American workers and their families, these statistics
paint an ugly portrait of a country that has lost respect for
workers and the jobs they do. American workers are running out of
money, running out of options and running out of hope. They've
exhausted their savings, and they are loaded with debt. They have
little time off from work to spend with their children or their
friends, and they can't afford little things like eating out once
a week, much less a real vacation. They see 20 percent of our
society paying $3.00 for cups of coffee and driving $40,000
automobiles and they wonder, &quot;Who's getting my share?&quot;
They are frustrated and bitter, and their anger is exceeded only
by anxiety over keeping their jobs. </p>
<p>The human toll has been staggering. But in case you are not a
bleeding-heart liberal let me throw up another caution flag: I'm
convinced that at some point our nation will face even harsher
consequences from the reckless pursuit of lower and lower wages
by American business. People who don't have money can't spend
money, and that can be disastrous for an economy historically
driven by optimism and consumer purchases. People who make less
money pay less taxes, and 20 years of depressed wages are taking
a toll on local, state and federal tax coffers and undermining
our Social Security system. Finally, people who have no money
can't save money and our savings rate is already flagging. </p>
<p>Bob Reich, our retiring Secretary of Labor, acknowledged the
wage and wealth gap on behalf of the Clinton administration in
his final speech in office when he said, &quot;Incomes have
become less unequal partly because more people are employed and
they are working more hours and because elderly retirees are
doing better. But earnings inequality among adult wage earners
has continued to widen, right up to the third quarter of 1996,
the latest data we have.&quot; Erskine Bowles, the president's
new chief of staff and a conservative businessman, said of second
term priorities the other day: &quot;We simply have to do
something about that darned wage stagnation that has been
bedeviling the economy.&quot; </p>
<p>Now I am really tempted to take a show of hands. But I'm not
going to take a show of hands because every one of you in this
room knows the basics of macroeconomics better than I do and you
know what's right. </p>
<p>The balanced budget amendment. Privatizing Social Security.
The wage and wealth gap. They make up a devil's brew for our
economy and for our country. But what about you and me? We're in
that upper 20 percent, we're in that upper 10 percent, so what do
we have to worry about? </p>
<p>Let me remind you that, no matter what the new paradigm
suggests, we are still in this together. On a personal level,
many of you in this room between the ages of 35 and 55 belong to
what I call the &quot;club sandwich&quot; generation. </p>
<p>Here's how it works. We privatize Social Security and our
parents come home to live with us. We fail to close the wage and
wealth gap and our children come home to live with us. We pass
the balanced budget amendment and our ignorance comes home to
live with us. </p>
<p>How can we prevent it from happening? As leaders from business
and leaders from labor, we have our legitimate differences, but
we also have a mututal responsibility to work together on issues
like this that transcend all other considerations. Together, we
can find ways to protect and preserve Medicare and Social
Security. Together, we can balance the legitimate demand for
government services and protections against our national
willingness to pay for them. Together, we can create a new high
wage economy, make healthcare and education affordable and
accessible to all and create new respect for workers and the jobs
they do. </p>
<p>Together, we can insist on reason and sanity in our
legislative bodies, so we can get on with the business of making
this a country dedicated to raising the standard of living for
everyone, instead of just building up wealth for a few, a country
where you don't have to hold down three jobs to raise your
family, a country where what you do, rather than who you are,
gets you where you want to go. </p>
<p>Thank you very much .... </p>

Meeting of Trade Union Leaders<br>
Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace<br>
December 2-3, 1996</p>
<p><br>
I. The principal problems for the world of work resulting from<br>
the process of globalization of the economy.<br>
<br>
I want to thank Cardinal Etchegaray and the Pontifical<br>
Council for the great honor of participating in this meeting.<br>
<br>
I am here as president of the AFL-CIO, the more than 13<br>
million-member labor federation of the United States. As we do in<br>
our work every day, I will try to speak for the values and the<br>
interests of working Americans -- people of every faith and<br>
viewpoint, union and non-union. And I will speak out of a deep<br>
belief that we share those concerns with our sisters and brothers<br>
throughout the world. <br>
<br>
Cardinal Etchegaray has set the tone for this discussion in<br>
his article calling upon us all to &quot;re-establish the
concepts of<br>
solidarity and common responsibility as essential principles of<br>
the human endeavor.&quot; As he writes, &quot;These principles
must be<br>
placed not just at the center of international development<br>
policy, but so much more so in the hearts of citizens and of<br>
societies, especially in the wealthier countries.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let us begin this discussion by facing the facts: There has<br>
been a collapse of social solidarity, not only between the<br>
wealthiest and the poorest countries but within the wealthiest<br>
societies themselves. <br>
<br>
For a quarter century or more after the end of world War II,<br>
there was extraordinary social solidarity in the United States<br>
and in most other advanced industrial societies. Most people<br>
lived by common values and shared understandings -- a social<br>
compact, if you will. Business, labor, and government all agreed<br>
that working people were entitled to a fair share of the wealth<br>
they produced. Our economies grew. Living standards rose. And the<br>
social fabric was strengthened, as working people gained the<br>
means to support their families and communities.<br>
<br>
Now, our world has been transformed beyond recognition. Many<br>
of the causes are well known. New technologies are miraculous.<br>
Modern communications are instantaneous. And investment crosses<br>
national boundaries with a keystroke on a computer.<br>
<br>
In the United States, the globalization of the economy has<br>
gone hand-in-hand with the stagnation of living standards for<br>
working families. Working people's productivity has increased.<br>
Stock prices are soaring. Executive salaries are skyrocketing.<br>
But most people are working longer hours, just to stay even.<br>
<br>
Husbands and wives, fathers and mothers are working longer<br>
hours and frequently holding several jobs. Almost three-fifths of<br>
mothers with young children work outside the home. In answering a<br>
survey for the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Labor Department, a<br>
woman who is the mother of two children described a day that<br>
begins at 5:45 in the morning and ends just before 11:00 at<br>
night, with scarcely a moment of rest. <br>
<br>
Some of the greatest challenges are the startling abuses<br>
perpetrated against women workers. They suffer from consistently<br>
low wages, discrimination in hiring and promotions, unsafe and<br>
even abusive working conditions, and widespread sexual harassment<br>
as well. And, often, when they come home, they work an unpaid,<br>
&quot;second shift,&quot; caring for their families, their
children, and,<br>
frequently, for aging parents or grandparents as well.<br>
<br>
These all are social, as well as economic, problems.<br>
Parents worry about whether they have the time to teach their<br>
children the difference between right and wrong. They have less<br>
time to give to their churches and to civic and community<br>
organizations. As Cardinal Etchegaray has written, if we do not<br>
address the social and economic concerns of working women and<br>
men, they may become vulnerable to demagogues who preach<br>
intolerance at home and isolationism abroad.<br>
<br>
Let me be clear: The problem really isn't the new global<br>
economy. The problem is how corporations are answering the<br>
challenge. We see this in the United States.<br>
<br>
Too many companies are taking the low road in international<br>
competition. They are cutting their workforces, their wages, and<br>
their benefits. They are fighting against working people and<br>
their unions. They scour the globe in search of places where<br>
working people have low wages and no rights.<br>
<br>
Under the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush,<br>
our government developed what is called the &quot;American
model&quot;: <br>
They restricted the role of government in protecting working<br>
people, consumers, and the environment. They weakened unions.<br>
They negotiated trade agreements that protect the rights of the<br>
millionaire who sings a popular song but not of the worker who<br>
assembles the compact disk on which that song is recorded.<br>
<br>
Wherever you live and work, our struggles in the United<br>
States are your struggles, too. In other advanced countries, the<br>
&quot;American model&quot; has been used to drive down wages and
living<br>
standards. In developing countries, corporations headquartered in<br>
the United States too often exploit working women, working men,<br>
and even child labor. <br>
<br>
At this meeting, I hope we can strengthen the ties among<br>
the unions, our churches, and all people of good will throughout<br>
the world. Let's work together for a global economy that lifts<br>
the living standards and honors the human dignity of every man,<br>
woman, and child.<br>
<br>
II. The role of the trade union in today's world<br>
<br>
If I may speak personally, I learned about the mission of<br>
the labor movement by attending union meetings with my father --<br>
and by studying the social teachings of the Church.<br>
<br>
In his encyclical, On Human Work, Pope John Paul II writes<br>
of the importance of &quot;a wide range of intermediate
bodies,&quot; with<br>
economic purposes, enjoying &quot;real autonomy&quot; from
government and<br>
pursuing their goals &quot;in honest collaboration with each
other and<br>
in subordination to the demands of the common good.&quot; <br>
<br>
And, in their recent statement, &quot;A Catholic Framework for<br>
Economic Life,&quot; the U.S. Catholic Bishops declare: &quot;All
people<br>
have the right to economic initiative, to productive work, to<br>
just wages and benefits, to decent working conditions, as well as<br>
to organize and join unions or other associations.&quot;<br>
<br>
Our labor movement is truly an independent, &quot;Intermediate<br>
body.&quot; We are not tied to government or to any political
party.<br>
Our members espouse every religious creed and political<br>
philosophy. Our commitment is to advance the interests and the<br>
values of working women and men.<br>
<br>
We believe there is dignity in all work and that there must<br>
be dignity for all workers. Unions protect working people's<br>
dignity by providing them with a voice -- in the workplace, in<br>
the political process, and throughout society.<br>
<br>
That is why public policy should encourage the growth of<br>
unions throughout the world. Free and effective trade unions<br>
promote a fair distribution of wealth and protect fundamental<br>
freedoms. Where unions are absent or suppressed, economic justice<br>
and human rights are at risk.<br>
<br>
We see this, for instance, in Indonesia where young people<br>
work at appallingly low wages to make running shoes that are sold<br>
at appallingly high prices to young people in my own country. The<br>
leader of Indonesia's largest independent union, Muchtar Pakpahan<br>
was arrested without even being told what he was accused of<br>
having done. And the Catholic Bishop of East Timor, Carlos Belo,<br>
won the Nobel Peace Prize this year for his advocacy of human<br>
rights in the face of oppression and exploitation.<br>
<br>
Even in advanced, democratic societies, unions have to<br>
defend the principle that working people do not forfeit their<br>
rights when they go to work each day.<br>
<br>
Without extensive and expensive government intervention in<br>
the economy, unions offer a way for working people to reduce<br>
inequalities in wages and wealth. It is no accident that, in the<br>
United States, as the share of the workforce represented by<br>
unions has declined, inequalities in income and wealth have<br>
grown. <br>
<br>
And unions offer a means for workers to defend their<br>
dignity, as well as raise their wages. Dignity means a hospital<br>
worker winning the right to be addressed as an adult -- to be<br>
called &quot;Mrs. Smith&quot; -- and no longer be called by her
first name,<br>
as if she were a child or a servant. Dignity means the right of<br>
auto workers to stop the assembly line, if they see a defect in<br>
quality or a hazard to safety. And dignity means the opportunity<br>
for social workers to control the size of their caseloads and<br>
teachers to control the size of their classes, so that they all<br>
can do their jobs better.<br>
<br>
In some of the best and most successful companies, working<br>
people and their unions are winning a voice in decisionmaking at<br>
the corporate level. With this power, they are improving the<br>
quality of the goods they produce and the services they offer.<br>
They are helping their companies and their country compete in the<br>
world marketplace. And this is possible because it is a<br>
partnership of equals -- and working people understand their<br>
efforts and insights will be used for them, and not against them.<br>
<br>
With unions, working people don't have to settle for scraps<br>
from the table. They have a seat at the table -- from the<br>
bargaining table to corporate decisionmaking and public policy.<br>
And unions have a corresponding responsibility to raise the<br>
concerns of working women and men to national -- and even<br>
international -- consideration.<br>
<br>
To do this, we must speak for a large and growing share of<br>
the working people in our own countries. We must address the<br>
issues of the present and the future, not reminisce about the<br>
glories of the past. The world and the workplace are changing,<br>
and we must change and grow -- or stagnate and die.<br>
<br>
At the AFL-CIO, we are devoting an increasing share of our<br>
resources to organize working women and men throughout the<br>
economy, especially in the fastest-growing industries. We are<br>
challenging national unions and local unions to do the same. Here<br>
at this meeting, I would like to offer a friendly challenge to<br>
labor federations in every country to increase their efforts and<br>
devote more resources to organizing. And I would like to extend<br>
an invitation to work together, especially in the multinational<br>
corporations where we share common interests, common problems,<br>
and common employers.<br>
<br>
III. The promotion of the values of social justice and<br>
solidarity <br>
<br>
Cardinal Etchegaray writes that what is at issue in the<br>
world today is how we will answer that ancient question, &quot;Am
I my<br>
brother's keeper?&quot; At its best, the labor movement offers a
way<br>
to affirm and honor our obligations to our sisters and brothers.<br>
<br>
We believe that organizing is a practical expression of the<br>
obligations of those who are more fortunate to those who are less<br>
fortunate. It is a practical necessity as well as a moral<br>
obligation because the exploitation of working people anywhere<br>
undercuts the security of working people everywhere. That is why<br>
organizing is not an act of charity -- it is an act of<br>
solidarity. <br>
<br>
That is why the labor movement in the United States is<br>
organizing workers from the strawberry fields of California, to<br>
the poultry factories and textile mills of the South, to workers<br>
in hospitals, nursing homes, and home care agencies, school<br>
systems and state and local governments throughout the nation.<br>
<br>
We try to reflect the spirit of solidarity in everything we<br>
do. In public debate, we try to speak for all working Americans<br>
and their families, not just for union members. In fact, many of<br>
the victories we helped to win this year -- raising the minimum<br>
wage, protecting tax credits for the working poor, and extending<br>
health insurance to many families without coverage -- are at<br>
least as beneficial to low-wage workers outside our movement as<br>
for our current members.<br>
<br>
But we are well aware that much more must be done,<br>
especially in the international arena. Corporations are<br>
increasingly global in scope. But the efforts of working people<br>
and their unions, and others of good will, are too often limited<br>
to our own countries.<br>
<br>
That is why it is so important to strengthen the mediating<br>
institutions of government both at a national and transnational<br>
level and insist that they must intensify their efforts to<br>
defend working people in this ultra-competitive global economy.<br>
That is why the I.L.O. and the W.T.O. need to strengthen their<br>
commitments to the rule of law and the rights of working people.<br>
<br>
That is why labor federations and labor unions need to<br>
expand our efforts to work with our sisters and brothers<br>
throughout the world. This means organizing and bargaining on an<br>
international scale. We need a new global vision for all of our<br>
labor movements.<br>
<br>
I have spoken of our responsibilities in the labor movement<br>
to promote solidarity at home and abroad. Now, if I may, I would<br>
like to speak about the Church.<br>
<br>
First, I would like to thank the Church for its service and<br>
struggle in behalf of working women and men in the United States<br>
and throughout the world.<br>
<br>
In our organizing efforts, we receive strong support from<br>
religious institutions and religious leaders, especially the<br>
Catholic Church. For instance, the AFL-CIO is working with the<br>
United Farm Workers -- the union founded by the late and<br>
legendary Cesar Chavez -- to organize workers in the strawberry<br>
fields of California. The pay is low. Conditions are often<br>
unsafe. And women working in the fields regularly suffer sexual<br>
harassment. The organizing campaign is being supported by many<br>
religious leaders of all faiths, including many Catholic bishops.<br>
<br>
But, still, we must strengthen the relationship between the<br>
labor movement and the Church. Our close ties came naturally when<br>
our Church was disproportionately working class and consisted<br>
largely of immigrants, such as my own mother and father. In those<br>
days, priests and union leaders were natural allies. Catholic<br>
parishes and institutions were natural homes for those organizing<br>
and defending workers.<br>
<br>
Now, the task is more challenging, but even more urgent.<br>
Much remains to be done:<br>
<br>
o The Church should continue to teach its social doctrine on<br>
the dignity of work and the rights of workers in the<br>
seminaries, universities, and schools. The U.S. Bishops'<br>
Economic Framework can be a real help.<br>
<br>
o We need more visible signs of the Church's support for the<br>
dignity of workers and their rights, especially for those<br>
who suffer the most severe exploitation. Priests and<br>
religious should be encouraged by their bishops to know and<br>
support the labor movement. <br>
<br>
o And Church investment portfolios should be used to support<br>
working people. Investments, shareholder activity, and, if<br>
necessary, disinvestment -- all can be used to promote<br>
economic justice.<br>
<br>
But, most of all, the Church must address clearly and<br>
without compromise the moral dimensions of economic life. And it<br>
must maintain that the moral measure is how &quot;the least of
these&quot;<br>
are faring.<br>
<br>
That is why the Church must challenge those who, by their<br>
business dealings and corporate decision-making, push people to<br>
the margins of society. Many of the corporate leaders making the<br>
decisions we lament around this table today join in prayer every<br>
Sunday. <br>
<br>
They are respected members of our congregations. Some good<br>
Catholics, indeed some professed religious, actively engage in<br>
practices that deny the rights to organize and bargain<br>
collectively to the workers who clean the floors of our hospitals<br>
and nursing homes, dig the graves in our cemeteries, and care for<br>
our ill and aged. They keep these working women and men from<br>
participating in the decisions that shape their lives.<br>
<br>
The Church knows better. The Church must teach that justice<br>
demands more than charity and that, for the Gospel to come alive,<br>
it must be practiced in our policies as well as preached in our<br>
pulpits. <br>
<br>
Together, we can build a world in the image of our oldest<br>
values and our bravest dreams. A world where children stretch<br>
their minds in classrooms, instead of straining their muscles in<br>
mines and mills, factories and fields. A world where every man<br>
and woman can live and labor in dignity. And a world where every<br>
society honors what is best and noblest in the human spirit.<br>
<br>
I, for one, will leave this meeting with my commitment to<br>
these goals strengthened and renewed. For that -- and for so much<br>
else -- I thank you all.</p>

<p align="center">Remarks by Richard Trumka<br>
Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO<br>
Labor and the Global Economy Conference<br>
Berkeley, California<br>
November 21, 1996</p>
<p>Thank you for that kind introduction and that warm welcome.<br>
And thank you for inviting me to be keynote speaker for this<br>
ambitious and important conference. &quot;Labor and the Global<br>
Economy&quot; not only describes the agenda for this conference,
it is<br>
the agenda for the AFL-CIO as we attempt to rebuild and<br>
revitalize our movement.<br>
<br>
But before I talk about the global economy, I want to revel<br>
in some good news from one very important small part of the world<br>
and that's Orange County, California. Now this is one of the most<br>
right-wing counties in our country, the home of &quot;tax cut
fever&quot;<br>
and the &quot;Reagan Revolution.&quot; When we got the news back
in<br>
Washington that Loretta Sanchez was going to the House of<br>
Representatives, it put a fitting cap on the most successful<br>
political season we have had in decades. And I want to say, on<br>
behalf of President John Sweeney and Executive Vice President<br>
Linda Chavez-Thompson, &quot;Thank you for sending Bob Dornan to
the<br>
shower he so badly needed!&quot;<br>
<br>
In fact, I'd like to thank the labor movement throughout the<br>
state of California for the great job you did. Nationally, we<br>
took out 17 of the ugliest Americans ever to serve in the United<br>
States Congress and we missed 12 additional targets by a total, I<br>
said a total of 14,000 votes. On election day, union households<br>
accounted for 23 percent of the overall vote, up from 14 percent<br>
in 1994 and 19 percent in 1992. Those 21 million voters were the<br>
key in many Congressional races, where 68 percent of union<br>
members voted for Democrats and 32 percent for Republicans --<br>
down from 40 percent in 1992.<br>
<br>
But here in California, you went beyond that performance by<br>
mobilizing 12,000 union volunteers, contacting 300,000 voters in<br>
key districts, winning three hard-fought Congressional races,<br>
passing a living wage and taking back a state assembly that had<br>
become a &quot;skunk works&quot; for the kind of crap Newt
Gingrich has<br>
been trying to peddle on the national level. They say good<br>
things, as well as bad things, always start in California and<br>
blow east and I'd like to thank Art Pulaski and the California<br>
labor movement for creating a Santa Ana we're glad is blowing our<br>
way!<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, we all know that unrestricted<br>
global trade -- just like any other unregulated market place --<br>
inevitably drives down living standards and denies basic human<br>
rights. But I don't think any of us ever imagined that we would<br>
reach the point we have reached today where workers who have<br>
built the strongest and most competitive economy in the world<br>
find ourselves chained by the simple-minded notions that free<br>
markets are fair and that the government that governs least,<br>
governs best.<br>
<br>
<br>
In our high-tech global economy, investment can travel<br>
around the world in a micro-second with a keystroke on a<br>
computer. But working people are bound to their communities and<br>
their countries by ties of family, loyalty and necessity. This<br>
means multinational corporations can circle the globe in search<br>
of cheap labor, settling like vultures on the most vulnerable<br>
targets they spot.<br>
<br>
Working people from every country find themselves in what<br>
has been called &quot;the global hiring hall.&quot; They are
forced to<br>
compete with men and women and children throughout the world who<br>
are forced by poverty or tyranny to work for longer hours at<br>
lower rates with fewer rights. The result is a race to the bottom<br>
and working people in every country are the losers.<br>
<br>
The only winners are multinational corporations that pledge<br>
allegiance to no flag but their profit statement. They move<br>
factories, jobs and investment capital at a moment's notice to<br>
escape national laws, collective bargaining agreements and simple<br>
standards of human decency.<br>
<br>
These corporations are unlike ordinary companies: every<br>
element of an ordinary enterprise -- employees, equipment and<br>
human values -- has been hollowed out, leaving little but an<br>
insatiable appetite for profit. A corporation headquartered in<br>
the United States can sell its products here and rack up billions<br>
in profits, without owning a single factory in this country. In<br>
fact, it doesn't have to own a single factory anywhere. Instead,<br>
by contracting and sub-contracting to factories in low-wage<br>
nations such as Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia and China, it<br>
avoids any of the traditional responsibilities of an employer.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you what this unrestricted access to the &quot;global<br>
marketplace&quot; has meant for American workers over the past 20<br>
years. From 1979 through 1995, more than 43 million jobs were<br>
eliminated in corporate downsizings -- mass firings by giant<br>
corporations that are supposed to be models of corporate<br>
responsibility. General Motors, IBM, AT&amp;T, Boeing, Chemical
and<br>
Chase Manhattan Banks. And two-thirds of the workers fired ended<br>
up at jobs that pay less than their old ones.<br>
<br>
And we took another hit last week: 12,000 workers in the<br>
street at Sunbeam, courtesy of Albert &quot;Chain Saw&quot;
Dunlap, the man<br>
who claims to be a &quot;doctor fixit&quot; for sick
corporations, but who,<br>
in reality, is the Dr. Kevorkian of a sick American business<br>
community.<br>
<br>
Average hourly wages have fallen -- in 1995 dollars -- from<br>
$12.85 in 1978 to $11.64 in 1995. In order to stay even, working<br>
men and women are working longer hours, taking second jobs,<br>
spending less time with their families, their children, their<br>
churches and schools and PTA's and the result is a profound sense<br>
that the fabric of American life is being torn apart at the<br>
seams. Fringe benefits are also being driven down. From 1987 to<br>
1994, a million people a year lost their health coverage. The<br>
percentage of workers covered by employer-paid pension plans<br>
dropped from 63 to 56 percent.<br>
<br>
During this same period of time, however, worker<br>
productivity in our country increased 24 percent -- 24 percent!<br>
Where did it go? It fattened corporate profits -- up 205 percent<br>
between 1980 and 1985. It fattened executive salaries -- they<br>
went up 500 percent since 1980.<br>
<br>
The result? The biggest economic inequality of any advanced<br>
industrial society in the entire world. Worse than Germany. Worse<br>
than Japan. Worse than Italy and France and the United Kingdom<br>
and Australia.<br>
<br>
Our wage and wealth gap is growing by the day. Working<br>
families have little money to spend and they are loaded down with<br>
debt. They are threatened by restructuring, downsizing, pension<br>
raids, privatizing and outsourcing schemes and runaway plants and<br>
their anger is exceeded only by anxiety over keeping their jobs.<br>
They see the rich getting richer and they are disgusted with<br>
business and with government.<br>
<br>
You don't have to be an economist to know this is a<br>
prescription for social and economic disaster -- when workers<br>
can't secure economic justice through reasonable means, they<br>
either take unreasonable actions on their own, or they fall prey<br>
to right-wing demagogues like Patrick Buchanan and David Duke, or<br>
nutty corporate stooges like Ross Perot and Steve Forbes.<br>
<br>
With working-class Americans and their families hurting as<br>
never before, the labor movement has to respond as never before.<br>
We have to fill the vacuum in national leadership because we are<br>
the only legitimate representatives of those working families.<br>
The problem: America needs a raise -- in wages and benefits and<br>
pensions and security, but also in spirit, and ethics and morals.<br>
The solution: a bigger, stronger labor movement, one that can<br>
restore some sanity to a society that has lost all respect for<br>
workers and the jobs they do. That's why John and Linda and I ran<br>
for the highest offices in the AFL-CIO, that is why we won, and<br>
that is why we are shaking up the AFL-CIO in Washington, DC and<br>
in every state in this country.<br>
<br>
With the help of all our unions and state feds and central<br>
labor councils, we're making the changes that are needed to help<br>
us achieve our goals of organizing more workers, building a<br>
national political force for working families, and providing a<br>
new voice for workers in the global economy as well as in our<br>
local communities.<br>
<br>
We started off by creating the first organizing department<br>
in the history of the AFL-CIO, with a commitment to spend $20<br>
million on organizing during our first two years -- 10 times what<br>
has been spent in the past. We tripled the size of our highly-<br>
successful Organizing Institute, which recruits young workers and<br>
college graduates and trains them for careers in union<br>
organizing. In March of this year, we held the first special<br>
convention in our history and voted a $25 million assessment to<br>
help finance a media and grassroots lobbying effort to defeat the<br>
&quot;Contract With America&quot; and to expose the politicians
behind it.<br>
<br>
In May and June, we hosted a series of 30 town hall meetings<br>
around the country under the banner of &quot;America Needs a
Raise,&quot;<br>
taking testimony from union workers and non-union workers alike<br>
and publicizing the meetings to begin building a new base of<br>
public support for workers and their families. During June, July<br>
and August, we sponsored a watershed program called &quot;Union<br>
Summer,&quot; which we envisioned putting 1,000 young workers and<br>
college students through an experience like &quot;Freedom
Summer&quot; in<br>
the 1960s. We got nearly 4,000 applications and had to expand to<br>
1,500 participants. From the strawberry fields of northern<br>
California to nursing homes and poultry plants in the Deep South<br>
to sweatshops in New York City, these &quot;Union
Summeristas,&quot; as<br>
they called themselves, helped us jump-start a new wave of union<br>
organizing and I can report to you that we've decided one of our<br>
biggest priorities next year will be &quot;Union Summer
1997!&quot;<br>
<br>
By the time fall rolled around, we were ready for big<br>
changes in our structure and the way we do politics and<br>
organizing.<br>
<br>
We decided to transform the AFL-CIO from a Washington-based,<br>
policy-oriented institution to a grass-roots legislative and<br>
political fighting machine. Early in the year, we began<br>
confronting members of Congress with aggressive visits,<br>
demonstrations and sit-ins back home where it hurts. Then we put<br>
138 field coordinators in 110 Congressional districts and asked<br>
them to form standing local committees of at least 100 union<br>
activists to help elect friends of working families to office and<br>
to hold those friends accountable once they were elected.<br>
Finally, we decided to spend our money on an independent, issue-<br>
based television, direct mail, and door-knocking campaign, rather<br>
than donating it to any political party. <br>
<br>
The results, I hope, are obvious: America's unions are back<br>
and we are going to build those grassroots committees in every<br>
Congressional district and regain political strength and<br>
influence on behalf of working families! Our goal is to transform<br>
our movement from one that agonizes to one that organizes, from<br>
one that curries favor with politicians to one that demands<br>
respect from them, from one that lacks diversity to one that<br>
revels in it, from a movement that is slowing to one that is<br>
growing, from a movement that is stuck in the past to one that is<br>
tackling the future.<br>
<br>
On the organizing front, we're urging local and national<br>
unions to increase their organizing expenditures from an average<br>
of 5 percent of their budget to 30 percent of their budget. We've<br>
established a new organizing fund to help jump-start new<br>
campaigns. We're planning to go after entire industries and<br>
entire cities, rather than running piecemeal campaigns scattered<br>
around the country. And we've decided to organize over, around<br>
and beyond our ineffective and unfair labor laws.<br>
<br>
An example is our new campaign by the United Farm Workers to<br>
organize 20,000 strawberry workers in northern California. We're<br>
conducting a national campaign to persuade the owners it is in<br>
their interest to recognize the union for the workers and we've<br>
set up a &quot;National Strawberry Commission for Workers
Rights&quot; to<br>
marshall public opinion on our side.<br>
<br>
More than 100 prominent individuals and organizations have<br>
signed on and we're asking all AFL-CIO unions, central labor<br>
councils and state feds to get involved. As our Organizing<br>
Director, Richard Bensinger, told the press when we announced,<br>
&quot;We'll be in your face and on your conscience until these
workers<br>
get a union.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now I don't want you to think that the new AFL-CIO is all<br>
brawn and no brains. We also revamped our Public Affairs<br>
Department to get us into the 21st Century when it comes to<br>
waging the war over public opinion and I hope you've seen the<br>
results -- we've gotten more positive publicity for workers and<br>
their unions in the past year than we got in the 20 previous<br>
years. And we created a new Working Womens' Department to help us<br>
close a gender gap that is as wide as the Grand Canyon and<br>
revamped our Field Mobilization Department to put more people in<br>
the field and less in Washington.<br>
<br>
We've also created a new Department of Corporate Affairs to<br>
give us the firepower we need for doing battle with the multi-<br>
national corporations who have turned our economy and the world<br>
economy into a jungle. Our goal is to help affiliates deal with<br>
employers on multiple levels -- from corporate ownership and<br>
competitive strategy to collective bargaining, to workplace<br>
organization and technology -- and to find new ways to use our<br>
enormous financial resources to help working families in this<br>
country and around the world. <br>
<br>
Finally, we've made sweeping changes in our international<br>
affairs structure and programming. All of the international<br>
affairs institutes have been collapsed into one Department of<br>
International Affairs and we're now devoting all of our time and<br>
energy and staff to mobilizing world-wide in support of<br>
organizing and bargaining. For too many years, idealology has<br>
been the chief export of the AFL-CIO when it comes to<br>
International affairs. We've changed that and now the chief<br>
export and import of the department will be a far more precious<br>
and relevant commodity, one called &quot;international
solidarity.&quot;<br>
<br>
Our new Corporate Affairs Department and our revamped<br>
Department of International Affairs are the twin engines of<br>
economic justice we're going to use to lead our nation and our<br>
president across that bridge into the 21st century!<br>
<br>
When it comes to using global solidarity to bring employers<br>
to justice, we'll be building on the success and relationships of<br>
many of our affiliated unions. Back during my union's strike<br>
against the Bituminous Coal Operators, trade unions in Australia<br>
and South Africa struck transnational corporations like Hanson<br>
and DuPont on behalf of the UMWA. Recently, the steelworkers led<br>
a successful worldwide corporate campaign against Bridgestone-<br>
Firestone and won because of substantial help from unions in<br>
Argentia, Brazil, Turkey, France, Japan, Spain and a dozen other<br>
countries where the company has plants. <br>
<br>
When Sprint crushed an organizing drive by the<br>
communications workers in San Francsico, Mexican communications<br>
unions came to the CWA's defense by filing a complaint under the<br>
labor-said accords of NAFTA.<br>
<br>
We will also be building on the success of many of our<br>
affiliates when it comes to dealing with Wall Street's obsession<br>
with short-term profiteering through downsizings and<br>
restructuring. Last week when &quot;Chainsaw&quot; Dunlap
announced his<br>
plans for Sunbeam, union-controlled and public pension funds were<br>
the first to challenge him. Last April, the Teamsters and UNITE<br>
ran a candidate for K-Mart's board and led a successful campaign<br>
to remove another director. After the Teamster/UNITE proposal<br>
received 57 percent of the vote, K-Mart conveniently
&quot;lost&quot; 8<br>
percent of the votes, but UNITE and the IBT successfully sued the<br>
company in court. And union-controlled pension funds are leading<br>
the charge against irresponsible corporate citizens like Texaco,<br>
where shareholders are challenging management's toleration of<br>
discrimination against African American workers.<br>
<br>
Let me close with a few comments about two global trends<br>
that are of enormous consequences to the future of workers and<br>
their unions around the world and I'm talking about the<br>
privatization of social security systems and the creation of<br>
individual retirement accounts for workers.<br>
<br>
Both of these trends are being driven by Wall Street firms<br>
like State Street Bank, Oppenheimer, Goldman-Sachs, the<br>
Balckstone Group and T. Rowe Price for their own greedy purposes.<br>
If the American social security system is privatized, for<br>
instance, up to $100 billion would flow into the markets. If<br>
individual retirement accounts are a part of the scheme, it will<br>
mean additional billions of dollars and fees from the 10 percent<br>
that Wall Street charges to manage small accounts.<br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO opposes privatization and we oppose individual<br>
retirement accounts because they threaten workers in many ways.<br>
They injure workers and their families by raising the retirement<br>
age, reducing retirement income, creating retirement insecurity<br>
and undermining solidarity. They undermine the leverage worker-<br>
owners have on corporations. And they channel investment in ways<br>
which are indifferent, even hostile, to worker interests.<br>
<br>
The labor movement around the world is fighting these trends<br>
and I think we should develop and agree to a set of &quot;fair<br>
investment&quot; standards and rank them right up there with our
&quot;fair<br>
trade standards&quot;. These standards should include four
important<br>
ingredients. First, if pensions are privatized, workers should<br>
resist individual funds. If we allow workers to be broken up into<br>
little funds, there is no hope for marshalling the potential<br>
power of labor's capital -- workers will be divided, they will<br>
pay high fees, and they will make bad decisions<br>
<br>
Second, workers should insist on co-managing their pension<br>
funds. The right of workers to do so was passed by the ILO in the<br>
1930s. Last year the ILO rightfully condemned Chile -- the poster<br>
child for the World Bank -- and Peru for violations.<br>
<br>
Third, private pensions should not mean workers must work<br>
longer. Pensions are there because people get to old to work and<br>
because employers do not hire older workers. This is the chief<br>
reason for government programs -- individual accounts cannot<br>
guarantee retirement security.<br>
<br>
Fourth, workers and their unions should fight capital with<br>
capital and not allow our pension funds to be used against us --<br>
voting proxy shares, monitoring corporate executives, taking on<br>
corporations as shareholders.<br>
<br>
Over the next few years, the American labor movement bears<br>
the responsibility for driving a stake through the ugly hearts of<br>
the privatization and individual retirement account movements. We<br>
can start by urging our pension fund trustees and our<br>
international and local unions and our local unions to inform<br>
State Street, Oppenheimer, Goldman-Sachs and T. Rowe Price and<br>
other investment managers that we will no longer allow them to<br>
earn commissions from our fund and then use those commissions to<br>
fund the Wall Street campaign to privatize social security. Then<br>
we must complete the job of building our new grass-roots<br>
legislative and political machinery, because we're going to close<br>
out this century with the fight of the century. In one corner<br>
will be the &quot;Wizards of Wall Street,&quot; and they are the
heavy<br>
favorites because they have heavy pocketbooks and they are big<br>
and ugly and loud. In the other corner will be the &quot;New
Voice for<br>
American Labor,&quot; and that's all of us and we're more like a
short<br>
little guy with a balding head, a big heart and a quiet voice.<br>
<br>
I don't know about you, but I'm putting my money on the<br>
little guy and on every one of us. Because this fight is going to<br>
be just like Tyson and Holyfield. It will go 11 rounds and there<br>
will be blood all over the place. But we will win for the same<br>
reason that we beat Bob Dornan, for the same reason that we<br>
passed that living wage, for the same reason that we will defeat<br>
the California business community in their drive to destroy the<br>
40 hour week, for the same reason we will stop Pete Wilson from<br>
gutting the prevailing wage.<br>
<br>
We will win because we are fed up with scraps from the table<br>
and we want a seat at the table! Because we are 40 million union<br>
members and our families and we are fighting for our future.<br>
Because we are men and women, young and old, black and white,<br>
African-American, Latino, Asian-Pacific and we are fighting for<br>
our families. All of us together! Working together, organizing<br>
together, fighting together, winning together!<br>
<br>
Thank you and Godspeed .....</p>

and thank you for taking me on a tour of the College of Law<br>
construction site preceding this forum. It's great seeing this<br>
wonderful university grow and prosper, and it's even better<br>
seeing it done with 100 percent union labor! I note with pride<br>
that this is the second time I've been introduced by the<br>
president of a major university in the past six weeks. The<br>
president of Columbia University introduced me at our teach-in<br>
there in October and I'll repeat what I said then: this is pretty<br>
rarified air for a bus driver's son from Iona College!<br>
<br>
I'm delighted to be here with all of you today to help<br>
inaugurate this labor forum, which will honor Dale Brickner for<br>
many, many years after he retires this December. I hope my<br>
remarks this morning will live up to the standards he has set for<br>
all of us during his 23 years as head of the MSU labor education<br>
program.<br>
<br>
I'm also glad to be here with labor leaders like Frank<br>
Garrison and Bertha Poe from the Michigan State AFL-CIO, Paul<br>
Policicchio from SEIU, and our courageous leaders from the<br>
Detroit Newspaper Council, Ed Scribner and Gloria Corbin. It<br>
gives me a chance to thank them publicly for what they did for<br>
the working families of this country on election day. We had a<br>
huge turnout of union members and their families here and across<br>
the country and we picked up 9 seats in the House by pro-working<br>
family candidates and re-elected a Democratic president for the<br>
first time since Franklin D. Roosevelt. Most of all, I want to<br>
thank them and you for sending Dick Chrysler to the shower he so<br>
badly needed!<br>
<br>
Ed and Gloria, I want to thank you publicly for your<br>
continuing leadership in what is turning out to be one of the<br>
ugliest confrontations in recent labor history at the Detroit<br>
News. And for those who doubt that we are right and that we will<br>
win, I point you to the tremendous victory we just won at<br>
Bridgestone-Firestone after 28 months!<br>
<br>
It has been, to say the least, a very eventful year and I<br>
want to begin by giving you my spin on what just happened at the<br>
ballot box: we won and they lost. I use the word &quot;they&quot;
advisedly<br>
because I know we have at least one prominent Republican here<br>
with us today! The AFL-CIO is a fiercely non-partisan<br>
organization and we don't operate in a framework of right vs.<br>
left, or conservatives vs. liberals, or Republicans vs.<br>
Democrats. Our political axis is bottom vs. the top, and we<br>
represent those on the bottom, which tends to make everyone mad<br>
at us. This past two years, however, we've been forced into what<br>
seems like an anti-Republican stance because the Republicans in<br>
the House of Representatives almost unanimously supported Speaker<br>
Gingrich in his frenzied attack on virtually every federal<br>
program that helps working families, seniors, young people, the<br>
poor, the disadvantaged and the disabled. So when we targeted the<br>
House and Senate seats occupied by anti-worker, anti-family<br>
office holders, all of our opponents turned out to be<br>
Republicans. How did we fare? After starting out the year<br>
electing Ron Wyden to the Senate in Oregon, we ended it by<br>
electing Tim Johnson in South Dakota, and re-electing Paul<br>
Wellstone in Minnesota and John Kerry in Massachusetts. And we<br>
defeated 17 of the ugliest Americans ever to serve in the United<br>
States House of Representatives.<br>
<br>
On election day, union households accounted for 23 percent<br>
of the overall vote, up from 14 percent in 1994 and 19 percent in<br>
1992. These 21 million voters were the key in many Congressional<br>
races, where 68 percent of AFL-CIO union members voted for<br>
Democrats and 32 percent for Republicans, down from 40 percent in<br>
1994. The 68 percent Democratic is compared to 45 percent for the<br>
general population.<br>
<br>
Few analysts, however, figured out just how close we came to<br>
retiring Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House. In addition to<br>
the 17 House races we won, we lost 12 more by a total of just<br>
14,000 votes, and those would have been enough for progressive<br>
forces to reclaim the majority!<br>
<br>
But the story of this election is more than just numbers.<br>
From start to finish, we drove the national agenda and made<br>
Medicare and education and pensions the issues of 1996. In races<br>
across the country, right wing incumbents ran away from the<br>
Gingrich agenda and the next Congress will be a Congress that<br>
respects workers and their families!<br>
<br>
As you all know, our efforts attracted a lot of attention<br>
from our adversaries and from the media. Over the months, I was<br>
called a lot of things, including a crook and a communist and<br>
even an &quot;old-fashioned liberal.&quot; And as most of you
know, the<br>
Republican Party produced a television commercial and ran it all<br>
over the country calling me a &quot;big labor boss.&quot; Well, I
want<br>
you to know, it beats the hell out of being called a &quot;small
labor<br>
boss.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why did we undertake such an unprecedented political effort,<br>
risking charges of partisanship and the chance we might take on<br>
the Congressional majority and lose? Let me share some of the<br>
background with you.<br>
<br>
If you travelled around the country as I do, you would hear<br>
the same story over and over again from women and men making<br>
$40,000 a year as well as from those making $12,000 a year: _I_m<br>
working harder and harder and I_m making less and less._ <br>
<br>
Over the past 20 years, while productivity and corporate<br>
profits have been going steadily up, family incomes have been<br>
going down. Why? Because our employers have chosen to compete in<br>
the new global economy not by ingenuity and teamwork, but by<br>
cutting wages and benefits. The result? Working families have<br>
little money to spend, they are loaded down with debt and because<br>
more family members are working, they have little time to spend<br>
with their children. They are threatened by restructuring,<br>
downsizing, pension raids, privatizing and outsourcing schemes<br>
and runaway plants, and their anger is exceeded only by anxiety<br>
about keeping their jobs. They are fed up with government and<br>
business and you don't have to be an expert to know this is a<br>
prescription for social and economic disaster.<br>
<br>
And can you imagine in the middle of all of this, the<br>
Republicans giving a tax break to the rich by declaring all-out<br>
war on the programs and policies workers and their families<br>
depend on just for survival?<br>
<br>
When workers can't secure economic justice through<br>
reasonable means, they either take unreasonable actions on their<br>
own or they fall prey to right-wing demagogues like Patrick<br>
Buchanan and David Duke, or nutty corporate stooges like Ross<br>
Perot and Steve Forbes. And so with working-class Americans and<br>
their families hurting as never before, the labor movement had to<br>
respond as never before. We had to fill the vacuum in national<br>
leadership because we are the only legitimate representatives of<br>
those working families.<br>
<br>
Our problem: America needs a raise. And not just in wages<br>
and benefits, but in hope for the future and in respect for<br>
workers and the jobs they do. The solution: a bigger, stronger<br>
labor movement, one that provides more muscle for working<br>
families at the ballot box and at the bargaining table. That_s<br>
why I ran for president of the AFL-CIO, and that_s why we_re<br>
shaking up our movement to rebuild our membership base and<br>
restore our political power. <br>
<br>
It's not just a coincidence that the decline in family<br>
incomes in this country mirrored a decline in the labor movement.<br>
In 1980, 27 percent of our workforce was covered by union<br>
contracts guaranteeing decent rates of pay, adequate health<br>
benefits and retirement security. Today that figure is 15 percent<br>
and it is still going down. In those 15 years, we lost more than<br>
members, we lost our voice and we lost our political power. And<br>
so with the backing of some of the largest and most progressive<br>
unions in this country, Rich Trumka, Linda Chavez-Thompson and I<br>
ran for the top offices in the AFL-CIO in the first publicly-<br>
contested race in the history of our federation and we won with a<br>
platform mandating sweeping changes.<br>
<br>
And we concluded it is axiomatic that if we are going to<br>
build a bigger, stronger labor movement, we must change the way<br>
we do things --- because what we've been doing isn't working. And<br>
so, with the backing of our Executive Council, we're making the<br>
changes that are needed to help us achieve our goals of<br>
organizing more workers, building a national political force for<br>
working families, and providing a new voice for workers in the<br>
global economy as well as in our local communities.<br>
<br>
We started off by creating the first organizing department<br>
in the history of the AFL-CIO, with a commitment to spend $20<br>
million on organizing during our first two years --- 10 times<br>
what has been spent in the past. We tripled the size of our<br>
highly-successful Organizing Institute, which recruits young<br>
workers and college graduates and trains them for careers in<br>
union organizing. In March of this year, we held the first<br>
special convention in our history and voted a $25 million<br>
assessment to help finance a media and grassroots lobbying effort<br>
to defeat the &quot;Contract With America&quot; and to expose the<br>
politicians behind it.<br>
<br>
<br>
In May and June, we hosted a series of 30 town hall meetings<br>
around the country under the banner of &quot;America Needs a
Raise,&quot;<br>
taking testimony from union workers and non-union workers alike<br>
and publicizing the meetings to begin building a new base of<br>
public support for workers and their families.<br>
<br>
During June, July and August, we sponsored a watershed<br>
program called &quot;Union Summer,&quot; which we envisioned
putting 1,000<br>
young workers and college students through an experience like<br>
&quot;Freedom Summer&quot; in the 1960s. We got nearly 4000
applications<br>
and had to expand to 1,500 participants. From the strawberry<br>
fields of northern California to nursing homes and poultry plants<br>
in the Deep South to sweatshops in New York City, these
&quot;Union<br>
Summeristas,&quot; as they called themselves, helped us
jump-start a<br>
new wave of union organizing and I can report to you that we've<br>
decided one of our biggest priorities next year will be
&quot;Union<br>
Summer 1997!&quot;<br>
<br>
By the time fall rolled around, we were ready for big<br>
changes in our structure and the way we do politics and<br>
organizing.<br>
<br>
When it came to political and legislative action, we decided<br>
to transform the AFL-CIO from a Washington-based, policy-oriented<br>
institution to a grass-roots fighting machine. Early in the year,<br>
we began confronting members of Congress with aggressive visits,<br>
demonstrations and sit-ins back home where it hurts. Then we put<br>
138 field coordinators in 110 Congressional districts and asked<br>
them to form standing local committees of at least 100 union<br>
activists to help elect friends of working families to office and<br>
to hold those friends accountable once they were elected.<br>
Finally, we decided to spend our money on an independent, issue-<br>
based television, direct mail, and door=knocking campaign, rather<br>
than donating it to any political party. <br>
<br>
The results, I hope, are obvious: America's unions are back<br>
and we are going to build those grassroots committees in every<br>
Congressional district and regain political strength and<br>
influence on behalf of working families!<br>
<br>
On the organizing front, we began the year with an<br>
educational and motivational program to convince our local and<br>
national unions to increase their organizing expenditures from 5<br>
percent of their budget to 30 percent of their budget. We<br>
established a new local union organizing fund to help start new<br>
campaigns. We decided to go after entire industries and entire<br>
cities, rather than running piecemeal campaigns scattered around<br>
the country. And we decided we had to organize over, around and<br>
beyond our ineffective labor laws, which give the advantage to<br>
employers.<br>
<br>
An example is our new campaign by the United Farm Workers to<br>
organize 20,000 strawberry workers in northern California. When<br>
the UFW tries to organize such workers, the growers get together<br>
and conduct vicious campaigns of intimidation, harassment and<br>
job terminations to stop the workers from gaining decent wages,<br>
health benefits, better sanitation and sexual abuse protections<br>
in the fields.<br>
We're conducting a national campaign to persuade the owners<br>
it is in their interest to recognize the union for the workers<br>
and we've set up a &quot;National Strawberry Commission for
Workers<br>
Rights&quot; to marshall public opinion on our side.<br>
<br>
As our Organizing Director, Richard Bensinger, told the<br>
press when we announced, &quot;We'll be in your face and on your<br>
conscience until these workers get a union.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now I don't want you to think that the new AFL-CIO is all<br>
brawn and no brains. We also revamped our Public Affairs<br>
Department to get us into the 21st Century when it comes to<br>
waging the war over public opinion and I hope you've seen the<br>
results --- we've gotten more positive publicity for workers and<br>
their unions in the past year than we got in the 20 previous<br>
years.<br>
<br>
We created a new Department of Corporate Affairs to help us<br>
do battle with the giant multinational employers that now<br>
dominate the global economy. We brought in four of the most<br>
brilliant young people in our movement to provide us with<br>
strategic research, leverage strategies, a voice on Wall Street<br>
and new strategies to use our enormous financial resources to<br>
help us achieve organizing, bargaining and political goals.<br>
<br>
We also created a new Womens' Department to help us close a<br>
gender gap that is as wide as the Grand Canyon, consolidated our<br>
far-flung international operations into one central department<br>
with the job of exporting solidarity instead of ideology, and<br>
revamped our Field Mobilization Department to put more people in<br>
the field and less in Washington.<br>
<br>
Our goal is to transform our movement from one that agonizes<br>
to one that organizes, from one that curries favor with<br>
politicians to one that demands respect from them, from one that<br>
lacks diversity to one that revels in it, from a movement that is<br>
slowing to one that is growing, from a movement that is stuck in<br>
the past to one that is tackling the future.<br>
<br>
Here's the truth: The weakness of labor encouraged employers<br>
to take the low road. And only by rebuilding our strength can we<br>
bring American business back to the high road of high wages,<br>
health care and pensions. We can no longer afford the luxury of<br>
pretending that productivity, quality, and competitiveness are<br>
not our business. They are our business, our jobs, and our<br>
paychecks. Too many workers have suffered because of failed and<br>
foolish shortsighted management policies.<br>
<br>
As labor becomes stronger and smarter, we will be in a<br>
position to offer business a challenge: take some of your profits<br>
and invest them in growing the American economy and American<br>
wages. Offer your workers the training they need for tomorrow's<br>
jobs -- not just the big-shots in the executive suites, but all<br>
your employees.<br>
<br>
Work with your employees and their unions. Give us a voice<br>
in decision-making. Give us half a chance to improve the quality<br>
of our goods and services. That is the path to lasting prosperity<br>
-- and we want to walk down that road with you.<br>
<br>
Now that we have demonstrated a reawakening of our political<br>
power, we also want to issue a challenge to our government and to<br>
our elected leaders: get busy on a national industrial strategy<br>
that reverses the erosion of our manufacturing base and provides<br>
fair export-import policies. Replace free trade with fair trade.<br>
Restore some sanity to a tax code that has reduced taxes on<br>
millionaires by one-third over the past 15 years while raising<br>
taxes by a similar amount on middle-income Americans. Support the<br>
concept of a living wage. Put some new parameters around the Wall<br>
Street wizards who are operating dangerously beyond the fringe of<br>
current regulation. Beef up Social Security and Medicare, don't<br>
give them up to the privateers --- when the Baby Boomers got<br>
ready to go to kindergarten, this nation didn't tear down<br>
schools, we built more and those Baby Boomers built the strongest<br>
economy the world has ever known. Stop giving away our sweat and<br>
our blood to our trading partners. Stop beating up on the poor,<br>
the young and the elderly. And for God's sake, help us put the<br>
sweatshops out of business and help us stop child labor!<br>
<br>
I hope you all noted the nature of the issues I just cited,<br>
because it is neither widely known, nor greatly appreciated that<br>
organized labor has always been more concerned with the society<br>
around us than with our own narrow interests. Nearly a century<br>
ago, the first president of the AFL-CIO, Samuel Gompers, was<br>
asked, &quot;What does labor want?&quot; His answer,
&quot;more,&quot; has often been<br>
misquoted and used to defame unions. What he actually said was,<br>
&quot;More schoolhouses and less jail, more books and less
arsenals,<br>
more learning and less vice, more constant work and less crime,<br>
more leisure and less greed, more justice and less revenge._ It<br>
was an eloquent statement of values trade unionists still hold<br>
dear. <br>
<br>
And what do working Americans and their unions want as we<br>
draw close to a new century? We want to live in a country where<br>
you can raise a family without having to hold down three jobs to<br>
do it. Where you don_t have to spend so much time at work that<br>
you have no time left to go to a movie or to a ball game with<br>
your kids or your grandchildren. Where health care and retirement<br>
are guaranteed for all, rather than reserved for a chosen few.<br>
Where your lot in life is determined by what you do, and not by<br>
the color of your skin or the accident of your birth. Where our<br>
children and grandchildren can look forward to pay raises instead<br>
of layoff notices. Where we can take things like good schools and<br>
public health and environmental protections for granted. Our idea<br>
of a just society is one in which honest labor raises the<br>
standard of living for all, rather than enormous wealth for a<br>
few. And our notion of a moral nation is one which cares for its<br>
young, its old and its poor and leaves the rich to fend for<br>
themselves.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much ....</p>

<body>
<p>John J. Sweeney, AFL-CIO President<br>
Speech to 1996 Democratic Convention, Chicago<br>
August 28, 1996<br>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters. You met some of the convention<br>
workers on Monday night. Standing with me tonight are Miaisha<br>
Evans, Sophie Kowalczyk, and Al Molina. They are members of the<br>
Service Employees Union and they represent the cleaners, ushers,<br>
vendors, and parking attendants here at United Center.<br>
<br>
I'm here tonight to speak for them and for all American<br>
workers, those who belong to unions as well as those who do not. <br>
<br>
They want you to know that they are proud of their country,<br>
and the contributions they are making to it. But they also want<br>
you to know that our country can do better. That we have to do<br>
more.<br>
<br>
Over the past two decades, American workers rose to the<br>
challenge of global competition and they increased productivity<br>
24 percent. But it didn_t help them -- family incomes went down<br>
15 percent!<br>
<br>
With Bill Clinton and Al Gore at the helm, our economy has<br>
rebounded, more jobs have been created and we_ve turned the<br>
corner on the tax giveaways of the 1980s. <br>
<br>
But millions of workers are still struggling to catch up.<br>
Families worry constantly about choosing between their work and<br>
their children. With employers downsizing, cutting benefits, and<br>
raiding pension funds, it_s no wonder millions of workers are<br>
getting involved in politics as never before.<br>
<br>
What do working families want? <br>
<br>
They don't want to run the Congress, or the White House or<br>
the political parties. They want to be compensated and respected<br>
for the contributions they make. They want to send their children<br>
to decent schools. They want to go to a safe workplace every day.<br>
They want a doctor when they need one, a little rest when they<br>
are weary, and a pension after a lifetime of work.<br>
<br>
What do working families want of their unions? <br>
<br>
They want us to be a bigger force, to fiercely champion<br>
their values and their interests, independent of party or<br>
candidate. They want us to stick to the issues, and skip the<br>
rhetoric. <br>
<br>
They want us to get after the corporations who force them to<br>
choose between being underpaid and unemployed -- corporations<br>
like Bridgestone-Firestone, which illegally replaced 2,300<br>
striking workers.<br>
<br>
And what do they want of their elected leaders? <br>
<br>
More jobs and more growth, with a greater share for working<br>
families. Greater responsibility from corporate America.<br>
Restoration of the right of workers to organize unions and<br>
bargain for a better future. An economy that works for all of us.<br>
They want to support candidates who listen to them and their<br>
concerns.<br>
<br>
Why do working families support Bill Clinton? <br>
<br>
Because he listened and vetoed the Medicare cuts and vetoed<br>
the TEAM Act and signed a minimum wage increase which Bob Dole<br>
and his colleagues tried to block. <br>
<br>
Because he listened to Kathy Wilkinson, a West Virginia<br>
community college worker, who said as the President signed the<br>
minimum wage bill: &quot;It's going to be such a relief to be
able to<br>
pay the gas and electric all in one month.&quot;<br>
<br>
Working Americans want to live in a country where you don_t<br>
have to hold down three jobs just to pay the gas and electric. A<br>
country where you have enough time left over from work to go to<br>
church and enough money in your pocket to take your kids to a<br>
ballgame. Where your lot in life is determined by what you do,<br>
and not by the color of your skin, the accident of your birth, or<br>
the selection of your partner.<br>
<br>
Our idea of a just society is one in which honest labor<br>
raises the standard of living for all, rather than enormous<br>
wealth for a few.<br>
<br>
And our vision of a moral nation is one which cares for its<br>
young, its old, its disabled and its poor and leaves the rich to<br>
fend for themselves.<br>
<br>
That's the kind of country working Americans want. That's<br>
the kind of country all Americans need. And that's the kind of<br>
America Bill Clinton, Al Gore and a new Congress will deliver!<br>
<br>
Thank you, and Godspeed.</p>

President of the AFL-CIO</h2>
<h1 align="center">27th Annual National Education Conference<br>
A. Philip Randolph Institute</h1>
<h2 align="center">Washington, D.C.<br>
July 18, 1996</h2>
<p>[Acknowledgements: Leon Lynch, APRI chairman and member of
AFL-CIO executive council; Norman Hill, APRI president; Gloria
Johnson, APRI vice president and AFL-CIO executive council
member; Barbara Van Blake, APRI vice president and AFT civil
rights director; Edgar Romney, secretary of APRI and executive
vice president of UNITE.] </p>
<p>Thank you for that kind introduction, and thanks to all of you
for your warm welcome. I bring you the greetings of
Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka, Executive Vice President
Linda Chavez Thompson and the 13.1 million men and women of the
AFL-CIO who share your commitment to social and economic justice. </p>
<p>The theme you have chosen for this conference -- &quot;The
Black- Labor Alliance in the 1996 Election: Mobilize, Motivate,
and Militate&quot; -- couldn't be more appropriate. </p>
<p>The Black/Labor alliance that A. Philip Randolph did so much
to create is build on a solid foundation. We share the same
values and the same goals. And, Lord knows, we have the same
enemies -- the race-haters and the labor-baiters, the church-
burners and the union-busters. </p>
<p>With your help, the labor movement is showing the Newt
Gingriches, the Trent Lotts, and the Haley Barbours of the land
that they can lambaste us and lie about us -- but they can no
longer ignore us. And that is why I hope you are finding this an
inspiring and exciting time to be here in Washington. </p>
<p>After nearly 20 years of decline, our labor movement has begun
to find our footing again on Capitol Hill. And we just pumped
home five slam-dunks on our political opponents. </p>
<p>The week before last -- at the decisive moment in the battle
to raise the minimum wage -- I made an emergency call to all the
unions in the AFL-CIO. And our sisters and brothers answered the
call. We swarmed Washington with 1500 rank-and-file lobbyists and
more than a dozen international union presidents. We hit the
airwaves with paid and free media. And union members around the
country volunteered the time and made thousands of telephone
calls. </p>
<p>Together, we made history. We passed the minimum wage in the
Senate. We won a huge victory for the 12 million working men and
women -- 30% of them African-American or Hispanic -- who stand to
benefit directly from an increase in the minimum wage. And we won
a victory for millions more who are also struggling to support
themselves and their families -- and who will benefit from any
upward push on wages. </p>
<p>You know as well as anyone what a mockery it makes of the
American dream when people who work fulltime still live and labor
in poverty. You know what raising the minimum wage will mean for
the women and men who do America's most difficult and dangerous
jobs. You know what a great thing it is to put more dollars in
their paychecks and more dignity in their lives. </p>
<p>Just after our victory on the minimum wage, we won another
one. We defeated a national &quot;right-to-work&quot; bill in the
Senate by another huge margin. And every union member in this
country can breathe a little easier. </p>
<p>Then came our third victory: Newt Gingrich and his radical
right-wing wrecking crew in the House were trying to eliminate
the new OSHA repetitive stress injury regulations that we all
have worked so hard to win. But -- with your help -- we beat
them. We won a big victory for every man and woman in this
country who works with their hands and their backs. </p>
<p>And, for our fourth victory, we defeated the so-called
&quot;TEAM Act,&quot; which would bring back company unions. It
got too few votes to override a presidential veto. And the
working men and women of this country thank President Clinton in
advance for this veto. </p>
<p>Fifth and finally, on Friday, the Gingrich gang read the
handwriting on the floor. They decided to crawl back under their
rocks, and not support a bill before Congress to get rid of
federal affirmative action programs. </p>
<p>I believe they did that because they understood that the labor
movement and the civil rights movement are prepared to fight them
every inch of the way. On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I testified
before a committee of Congress in support of affirmative action.
And I want you to know that we are prepared to continue the fight
from the halls of Congress to the streets of California. Whether
the issue is a federal regulation or a statewide referendum, we
will never let anyone turn back the clock on simple justice. </p>
<p>Every member of this movement can take pride in these
achievements. So I ask you to stand up and give yourselves a
hand. </p>
<p>The victories we're winning make us proud -- but we must
remain vigilant. As you know so well, in the fight for social
justice, there are no lasting victories -- only continuing
struggles. </p>
<p>That is why we will not rest until the minimum wage increase
is signed into law and provided in the paychecks of 12 million
low-wage workers. That is why we will not rest until the so-
called &quot;TEAM Act&quot; is in the wastebasket of history,
along with company unions and company towns. And that is why we
will not rest until this society reaffirms its commitment to
affirmative action. </p>
<p>You know, those right-wingers really have a gift for giving
ugly ideas beautiful names. These are the same people who called
ketchup a vegetable and called union-busting the &quot;right to
work.&quot; Now, they're calling a scheme to bring back company
unions the &quot;TEAM Act.&quot; And they even have the nerve to
call a referendum to gut affirmative action &quot;The California
Civil Rights Initiative.&quot; They want to deceive, divide, and
conquer, but we won't let them get away with it. </p>
<p>We have a message for those who would turn back the clock on
civil rights, workers' rights, or women's rights: If you take one
of us on, you take all of us on. And we_ll beat you, once and for
all, now and forever. </p>
<p>The politicians are finding out that, as Ted Koppel said on
&quot;Nightline&quot; not too many weeks ago, &quot;Labor is
back!&quot; And the best way to tell that we're coming back and
fighting back is to hear how our enemies are crying and
complaining. Our efforts have come under fire from a host of
civic-minded, non-partisan organizations concerned with fairness
and balance in the political process. Organizations like the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent
Business, and the National Association of Manufacturers. Rich
Trumka calls them the &quot;Harry, Larry, and Moe&quot; of the
American economy. </p>
<p>These three organizations and the big business, anti-worker
forces in Congress have targeted the labor movement and all
working Americans. They're using every half-truth and big-lie
they can find to try to discredit our effort to speak out on
behalf of working families. </p>
<p>Well, I'm proud to be their target. I'm proud to take my place
beside all their other targets: the young, the old, working
families, and the poor. I stand before you today and say I'm
proud to take my lumps for speaking out for simple justice. Will
you stand up and speak out and bear witness with me? </p>
<p>As you can tell, I'm having fun. It feels good to win a few
after years of defeat and retreat. Sisters and brothers, we're
turning the labor movement around -- and we're beginning to turn
our country around. </p>
<p>We're doing it because we're fighting harder and smarter.
Instead of playing by the old political rules, we're lifting the
lid off the House and Senate and letting in some sunshine.
Instead of being victimized by outmoded traditions of collective
bargaining, we're exposing the actions and the motives of our
employers. </p>
<p>We're spending more time and money telling the people and our
own members how their elected officials are voting and how their
business leaders are performing. We've moved our legislative
emphasis from Washington out into the districts where the
politicians have to listen. We've taken our contract fights out
of the streets and into the suites. When a politician or an
employer crosses us, we take them on -- aggressively and
publicly. We are on their doorsteps, in their faces, and on their
consciences. </p>
<p>We're fighting back -- and fighting together. When a group of
workers in one union is in danger, members from other unions
respond, instinctively and effectively. </p>
<p>A good example is the Bridgestone/Firestone boycott. The
rubber workers fought this Japanese conglomerate with all they
had. Then they merged with the Steelworkers and took on new life.
Last weekend, on the second anniversary of the strike, I spoke to
a rally of 2,500 union activists and supporters in Nashville. You
could see the hats and jackets and signs of three dozen different
unions in the crowd. </p>
<p>That morning -- with the help of dozens of unions in 40 cities
-- the Steelworkers handbilled a thousand Firestone Mastercare
centers simultaneously. The United Auto Workers local at Saturn
persuaded their management to offer a free tire swap, nationwide,
for any Saturn buyer who doesn't want Firestone tires. </p>
<p>Another example of a revitalized labor movement is the success
of Union Summer. We started out trying to recruit 1,000 young
workers and students. We ended up getting more than 3,000
applications. So we've put 1,500 in the field. And they've
restored our faith in the young people of this country. They're
organizing nursing home, leather goods, garment and hotel
workers. They're walking picket lines at the Detroit News and
McDonnell-Douglas. And they're registering voters and working on
living-wage campaigns from New Orleans to Seattle. </p>
<p>Sisters and brothers: Labor is back. Over the past seven
months, we've proven we can fight back and win. And now we're
turning our attention to the biggest fight we face this year. </p>
<p>The choice is clear. All the cards are on the table. The chips
are down. </p>
<p>On one side of the table, we have Bob Dole. He's acting kinder
and gentler and pretending he's from outside the Beltway. But
he's still the Darth Vader of American politics, the ultimate
insider. He voted against the Workplace Fairness Bill, against
Davis-Bacon, and against saving Social Security from the Balanced
Budget Amendment. He wants to abolish the Department of
Education, cut student loans, dismantle OSHA, and cut Medicare by
$270 billion and Medicaid by $170 billion to give a tax cut to
the rich. </p>
<p>On the other side of the table is Bill Clinton. He's for
saving Social Security, helping Head Start, and keeping college
loans. He supported the Workplace Fairness Bill, comprehensive
national health care reform, and prohibitions against pension
raids. He vetoed the massive Dole cuts in Medicare and Medicaid,
he vetoed tax cuts for the rich, and he's going to veto the TEAM
Act, as well as any bills that damage OSHA. He's leading our
nation to economic recovery. But he isn't satisfied because he
knows our economy has left too many working families behind. </p>
<p>That is why 70% of our members in a national poll support Bill
Clinton and Al Gore, and that is why the AFL-CIO has voted
overwhelmingly to endorse their re-election. That is why we are
conducting an unprecedented grassroots legislative and political
education program. And that is why we're going to fight and win,
from the courthouse to the White House. </p>
<p>But you know as well as anyone that our fight for social and
economic justice must continue well beyond November. We will not
rest until we organized working people all across America,
rebuilding our labor movement and restoring the spirit of
community in this country. </p>
<p>This year, we held &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; town hall
meetings in 30 cities, where working people told us about what is
happening to their jobs, their paychecks, and their family
budgets. </p>
<p>At a meeting in Birmingham, Alabama, Nathaniel Jackson II
explained that, even with a business degree from Tuskeegee
Institute and 20 years' experience as a salesman, he is
struggling to say even in the cruel new economy. Mr. Jackson
said: &quot;Now, it's 1996. I've worked as a doorman, a sub, and
now I'm working two and three jobs trying to make a living for
myself. What happens is people are more concerned with filling
their pockets, rather than taking care of others.&quot; </p>
<p>The fabric of social and economic justice in this country has
always been frail. But now, it is becoming torn and tattered, as
we enter a new economy with a handful of winners, too many
losers, and too few standards of decency. </p>
<p>We know that working men and women have seen their wages
stagnate for the past 20 years or more. And we know that
African-Americans still earn only 80% of the average hourly wage
in this country. </p>
<p>As middle class working people find the ground cracking
beneath their feet, too often they turn their anger and anxiety
against those even less fortunate than themselves. And for those
who have suffered from discrimination and exploitation in good
times and bad, there is a harsher economy and a meaner society. </p>
<p>You can see the meanness in the burnings of houses of worship
in the South and across this country. Many unions have pledged
their money and their muscle to rebuild these church buildings.
We can do it -- and we will. </p>
<p>And, just as we can restore the spirit of community in America
by rebuilding our churches, we can restore the spirit of
solidarity by rebuilding our labor movement. We need to raise the
wages of every working American so that, once again, we can turn
to each other and stop turning against each other. </p>
<p>The future of our labor movement depends on how well unions
can convince people of color, women, immigrants and everyone else
who is underpaid and overlooked to join together and join with
us. </p>
<p>I am here to ask for your leadership and your help for a
mighty wave of organizing that will renew and restore the dream
of justice and equality for millions of working men and women,
from the hospitals and nursing homes to the office buildings and
textile mills, to our schools and government agencies. </p>
<p>As you know so well, African-American workers make 18% more
with a union. And unions help workers win not only dollars but
dignity -- the right to hold your head higher, to speak your mind
without fear, and to join together with your sisters and brothers
against every form of injustice. </p>
<p>With your help, we will be everywhere working people are
crying out for a stronger voice, a better deal, and simple </p>
<p>justice. And, as we ask working people to join with us, we
must make sure that the face of this movement reflects the face
of working Americans. </p>
<p>That is why our new leadership team at the AFL-CIO is
absolutely committed to openness and inclusion at every level of
this movement... and why we believe that organizations like the
A. Philip Randolph Institute deserve a place at the table of
labor's leadership. </p>
<p>You probably hear this over and over -- but it is well worth
repeating over and over. </p>
<p>We believe that, as A. Philip Randolph said: &quot;At the
banquet table of nature, there are no reserved seats. You get
what you can take, and you keep what you can hold. If you can't
take anything, you won't get anything, and, if you can't hold
anything, you won't keep anything. And you can't take anything
without organization.&quot; </p>
<p>Together, we can mobilize, energize, and organize. Together,
we can take hold onto the presidency, take back the Congress, and
take back America. Together we can build a movement so strong, so
inclusive, and so energetic that we can raise wages, lift the
spirit, and strengthen the solidarity of all Americans.</p>

Opening Statement</h3>
<h1 align="center">Panel Discussion on Women and Economic Change<br>
Leadership Conference on Women, the Economy, and the Elections</h1>
<h2 align="center">Institute for Women's Policy Research<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
July 25, 1996</h2>
<p>Thank you, Gloria Johnson, for that fine introduction. As the
president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women, as a member of
the AFL-CIO Executive Council, and as director of social action
at the International Union of Electronic Workers, Gloria Johnson
is a leader in the fights for women's rights and workers' rights. </p>
<p>I am also honored to participate in a panel that includes:
Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, who is a leader on so many issues of
concern to working families; Julianne Malveaux, who is one
economist and commentator who speaks out for working Americans;
Prema Mathai-Davis, national executive director of the YWCA-USA;
and Patricia Harrison, of Capital Legislative Services. </p>
<p>And I want to thank the sponsor of this event, the Institute
for Women's Policy Research, and its director, Dr. Heidi Hartman,
for their outstanding research and advocacy. I understand that,
in connection with this conference, the Institute is releasing a
report on the wage gap which still remains between working women
and working men. </p>
<p>This morning, I'd like to talk briefly about how the labor
movement is revitalizing itself by rededicating itself to the
cause of working women. </p>
<p>As you know so well, women are on the frontlines of economic
change -- from the growth of new technologies and global trade,
to stagnant wages, downsizing corporations, vanishing health
coverage, and the burgeoning temporary workforce. The most
important social, economic, and political story of our times will
be how women respond to these changes. The anxious working woman
holds the future of the labor movement -- and, indeed, the future
of American politics -- in her hands. </p>
<p>The same hands that make America work will write the history
of our society as it enters the new century. As leaders like
Gloria Johnson have been insisting for many years, the labor
movement's commitment to working women is not only a moral
imperative -- it is a practical necessity. </p>
<p>Here's why unions have a moral responsibility to working
women. I often say that working Americans need a raise -- and
that's especially true for working women. To cite a statistic
which the Institute may update, women who work fulltime outside
the home are still paid only 72 cents for every dollar earned by
working men. </p>
<p>Too few women work at secure, good-paying jobs with health
insurance, reliable pensions, and other benefits. Too many
working women are caught in the so-called &quot;contingent&quot;
workforce, being bounced around from one part-time, low-wage
insecure job to another, with little or no health care or pension
rights and few labor protections. </p>
<p>As you know, women's wages are absolutely essential for
American families -- and not only for households that are headed
by women. In most families, it is necessary for husbands and
wives to work -- so, when women are underpaid and exploited,
everyone suffers. That is one reason why families are sending
more members into the work force, working longer hours and,
often, second jobs, as well. </p>
<p>Women, in particular, are working longer hours -- outside and
inside the home. In what Americans still think of as the typical
household -- a husband, wife, and children all living under the
same roof -- the mother is now working 32.3 percent more hours
outside the home per year than she'd done in 1979. And, because
women still shoulder heavier responsibilities at home, the
average woman spends another 2.6 hours on chores and 3.75 hours
with the children during the workweek. </p>
<p>All this means that working women are hardpressed for time as
well as money. For instance, listen to Marina Foley, a grocery
buyer and mother of two young daughters in Tallahassee, Florida,
describing her daily routine: </p>
<p>&quot;This morning, my alarm went off at 5:45. I hit snooze
and squeaked out another fifteen minutes. Put the coffee on and
then walked the dog and fed him. Started a load of laundry.
Emptied the dishwasher. Daughter #1 has a huge track meet at
school, so she had to be driven today, then head to work. At 4:45
p.m., I leave work to rush home to my latch-key nine- year-old
daughter...I usually don't sit down until 10:30 p.m.&quot; </p>
<p>There's a new movie out, called &quot;Multiplicity,&quot; in
which a working man played by Michael Keaton has so many demands
on his time that he clones himself. That movie would be even more </p>
<p>timely if the leading character were a working woman.
Listening to working women like Marina Foley talk about the
demands on their time, at home and on the job, I'm tempted to
change my slogan from &quot;America needs a raise&quot; to
&quot;America needs a nap.&quot; </p>
<p>Because working women are desperately squeezed for time and
money, they are urgently in need of union representation. One
other wage fact says it all: Union women earn 37 percent more
than nonunion women -- and even earn 4 percent more than nonunion
men. </p>
<p>Now, here's why it's a practical necessity for unions to reach
out to working women. </p>
<p>First, women work in the fastest-growing part of the economy
-- the service sector. When you look at the industries that are
gaining rather than shedding employees -- health care, data
processing, telecommunications, building services, hotels and
restaurants, to name just a few -- all have large numbers of
working women. When you look at the handful of unions that have
gained members over the past two decades -- such as my old union,
the Service Employees, as well as unions representing teachers,
government workers, and retail workers -- they have all grown by
organizing working women. </p>
<p>Second, it's not only where women work - it's what they
believe. The AFL-CIO's surveys of working Americans show that
women are more likely than men to support the idea of organizing
a union where they work. This finding is borne out by a simple
fact: From 1985 through 1995, more women than men joined unions
through elections conducted by the National Labor Relations
Board. At this moment in history, women may be more receptive
than men to the labor movement's message of fairness, community,
and solidarity. </p>
<p>And, third, working women are determining the future of
political campaigns as well as union organizing. We have all
heard a lot about the so-called &quot;angry white men,&quot; but
the most important segment of the electorate this year could be
called the &quot;anxious working women.&quot; </p>
<p>In a paper she prepared for the AFL-CIO, the public opinion
analyst Celinda Lake explained that one of the most volatile
groups in the electorate is younger working women without four-
year college degrees. These women supported Bill Clinton for
President in 1992. But, in 1994, many stayed home, and others
shifted to the Republicans. They are concerned about the economy
and jobs, Social Security, education, and health care -- and also
about crime and drugs and moral decline. The common element among
their concerns is security for themselves and their families and
a better future for their children. </p>
<p>These are some of the reasons why the labor movement needs to
reach out to working women. So what are we doing about it? </p>
<p>First, we are making an unprecedented effort to put the needs
of working families at the center of public debate. Earlier this
year, we held &quot;America needs a raise&quot; hearings in 30
cities across this country, where working women and men told
about the pressures on their family budgets and family lives. </p>
<p>For instance, in Columbus, Ohio, a college graduate and single
mother named Karen Meadows talked about how she works at two
low-wage jobs just so her family can make ends meet. She said she
wants he four sons to know that hard work makes a difference. But
she said: &quot;They see me working two jobs, and they can't see
where it makes a difference. I want better for my sons, but a
two-room trailer is all I can afford.&quot; </p>
<p>Our effort also includes everything from paid advertising
promoting working families' priorities to grassroots organizing
and education on political and legislative issues. </p>
<p>Already, our efforts have helped to win an important victory
-- the votes in the House and Senate to raise the minimum wage by
90 cents over two years. Increasing the minimum wage will lift
the living standards of 12 million working Americans -- and at
least 60% of them are women. </p>
<p>This summer and fall, we will keep union members informed
about where their representatives stand on the issues that shape
their lives and livelihoods, from the minimum wage to education
and training, health and safety, Medicare and Medicaid. We will
help working Americans, including the anxious working women, make
informed decisions, based on their own interests and values. </p>
<p>Second, we are beginning to organize at a scale and pace that
are unprecedented. </p>
<p>These are some of the workers whom unions are organizing or
preparing to organize: Clothing and textile workers -- from the
sweatshops of our major cities to the mill towns of the South.
Hospital workers, nursing home workers, and home care workers.
Poultry workers throughout the South. Strawberry workers in
California. And hotel workers in Nevada. </p>
<p>As you know, most of these workers are women. And </p>
<p>unions are appealing on the full range of issues that concern
working women -- from better pay and benefits to more dignity and
opportunity on the job. </p>
<p>Third, the faces of our leadership and staff are beginning to
reflect the faces of Americans at work. </p>
<p>I was elected president of the AFL-CIO in a contested campaign
that emerged from an effort to revitalize the labor movement, so
that we can better organize and represent the new American
workforce. </p>
<p>Among other changes, the AFL-CIO convention created a new
position, executive vice president, to work with state and local
labor councils and our allies across the country. To fill that
position, the delegates elected Linda Chavez-Thompson, who served
as president of the public employee union, AFSCME, for the states
of Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and
Utah. In addition, we expanded the executive council from 35 to
54, with the proportion of women and minorities rising from 17 to
27 percent. We're not where we need to be, but we're better than
we were. </p>
<p>At the AFL-CIO headquarters, women serve as directors of
communications, legislation, field mobilization, occupational
safety and health, and the Organizing Institute. We have also
created a new Working Women's Department to inject the issues and
concerns of working women into every major program at the AFL-CIO
and to develop programs that speak specifically to working women. </p>
<p>I'm sure many of you know the director of the Working Women's
Department, Karen Nussbaum, and admire her as much as I do. She
spent 20 years as an organizer and president of her local union,
District 925 of the Service Employees. Most recently, she served
as the director of the Women's Bureau in the U.S. Department of
Labor. I'm pleased and proud that she decided to come home, to a
labor movement that is trying to do more than ever before to
organize, represent, and empower working women. </p>
<p>The test of our efforts will be whether we help working women
make tangible improvements in their jobs and their lives, their
communities and their country. With leaders like Gloria Johnson,
Linda Chavez-Thompson, and Karen Nussbaum -- and with the hard
work and strong support of many of you here today -- I am hopeful
that working women will revitalize the labor movement and change
America, forever and for the better.</p>

<h3 align=center>John J. Sweeney<br>
President, AFL-CIO</h3>
<h1 align=center>Ministerial Conference<br>
International Labor Organization</h1>
<h2 align=center>Geneva, Switzerland<br>
June 12, 1996</h2>
<p>I am proud to be here with the International Labor Organization. For more than three-quarters of a 
century, the ILO has brought together business, unions, and government to improve the conditions 
of life and labor throughout the world. </p>
<p>The insight that guided the ILO at its founding in 1919 is just as true today, at the dawning of the 
information age, as it was 77 years ago, at the height of the industrial age. </p>
<p>That timeless insight is this: The best way to promote world peace is to advance the cause of 
economic security and social justice, not only in the most prosperous societies but everywhere on 
this planet. </p>
<p>I am here today, on behalf of the more than 13 million men and women of the American labor 
movement, to speak for a cause that is very much in the spirit of the history and heritage of the 
ILO. I am here to urge the ILO to adopt a convention to ban child labor in its most dangerous, 
degrading, and exploitative forms. </p>
<p>The problem we must address is part of the central issue facing humanity as we hurtle into the 
global economy of the 21st Century. </p>
<p>At a time when new technologies allow investment to cross national borders with a keystroke on a 
computer, where capital can shop the world for the least expensive and most vulnerable workers, 
we must make sure that we continue to honor our human values -- the dignity of working men and 
women and our dreams for our children. </p>
<p>We must not allow international economic competition to degenerate into a race to the bottom 
where we sacrifice the standards under which most people live and labor on the altar of private 
profit for a privileged few. </p>
<p>Truly, the challenge of our times is to make sure that every man, woman, and child can benefit and 
not suffer from the new opportunities of global trade and advanced technology. It is in this larger 
context that I ask you to address the problem of child labor. </p>
<p>Throughout the world, an estimated two hundred million children are at work -- and too many of 
them work under conditions that should move us to shame, to anger, and to action. </p>
<p>Let me make clear what I don't mean when I'm talking about exploitation: I'm not talking about 
young people who work after school. And I'm not talking about young people who work alongside 
their parents, on farms, or in stores, or family businesses. </p>
<p>I am talking about children working in the fields and factories, in the mines and mills -- sometimes 
even in bondage or in brothels. </p>
<p>I am talking about a system of child labor that distorts and degrades an entire society. Where 
children are cheated out of their childhoods, denied even the most basic education, and sent out, 
often at an early age, to difficult and dangerous work at pitifully low wages. Where most grown 
men and women may have a hard time finding work because employers would rather hire and 
exploit their sons and daughters. And where a fortunate few are enriched by the sweated labor of 
young boys and girls who can look forward to nothing better than virtual servitude for their entire 
lives. </p>
<p>Those of us here today cannot plead ignorance of this problem. We know the horrors: Children as 
young as four, working fifteen hours a day, seven days a week. Children scrambling for food, 
drugged so that they can work longer and faster, bent and cowed and crippled. Treated as chattel, 
these children are dying from overwork, accidents, and starvation. </p>
<p>And all this happens in spite of good intentions that have too often failed to produce effective 
actions. Despite formal prohibitions against child labor in almost every country, despite laws, 
conventions, studies, documents, seminars, and despite the good works of the ILO and 
innumerable organizations, the problem persists. </p>
<p>That is why we must all do better. The responsibility must not fall on the shoulders of parents in the 
poorest countries. As the ILO has always understood, the responsibility rests with business, labor, 
and governments throughout the world -- and with the leaders of the world community, gathered in 
meetings such as this one. </p>
<p>Let me speak as a citizen of the United States and as the leader of our labor federation, the 
AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>Child labor has been -- and, shamefully, still is -- a problem in the United States, within our own 
borders and especially in the actions beyond our borders of multinational corporations 
headquartered in our country. </p>
<p>I freely admit that business, labor, and government in our </p>
<p>country need to do more, but I am also here to say that many of us are redoubling our efforts. 
Under the leadership of President Clinton and Secretary Reich, the U.S. government is taking 
action against sweatshops and child labor in our own country. And they are beginning to hold U.S. 
companies accountable for the actions of their contractors at home and abroad. A growing number 
of U.S. companies -- although not nearly enough -- are answering the call to corporate 
responsibility. </p>
<p>As for our labor movement, we are fighting on every front. The American labor movement is 
working with the ILO, the ICFTU, the international trade secretariats, the Child Labor Coalition, 
and many more labor, human rights, children's rights, and religious groups to end the exploitation of 
children worldwide. We work with business and government as we challenge them to do more. </p>
<p>And let me speak also as a citizen of the world. </p>
<p>Sometimes, we are told that it is a kind of &quot;cultural imperialism&quot; for working people in prosperous 
countries to call for the abolition of child labor. As it happens, the members of our movement have 
their origins in every continent, every country, and every culture on the face of this earth. </p>
<p>We know of no culture or creed that tolerates the exploitation of children. We know of no culture 
or creed that teaches that children should lose their health, their promise, and their innocence 
laboring in the mines and mills. We know of no culture that holds that the proper place for children 
to spend their days is not in schools but in sweatshops. </p>
<p>It is not our oldest traditions that produce this injustice but the demands of the modern 
marketplace, untamed by the values and standards that humanity has developed over the ages. If 
there is anything that is universal to the human race and inspired by our Creator is our love for our 
children and our willingness to do whatever is necessary to guard their safety and nurture their 
promise. That is the cause we must serve in our deliberations here today. </p>
<p>And we are also told that setting standards against child labor would benefit some economies 
against others. The truth is: At the dawn of the Information Age, no economy on earth benefits from 
exploiting, rather than educating, its children. No economy on earth benefits from impoverishing its 
working men and women. In the race to the bottom, there are no winners -- only losers. </p>
<p>Yes, we will hear arguments that it is not feasible or expedient to set standards which prohibit the 
most dangerous and exploitative forms of child labor. These arguments are familiar - - and so are 
the refutations -- for this battle has been fought in every society that enters the industrial age, as well 
as in worldwide forums such as this one. </p>
<p>At this meeting -- and at this moment in history -- it is our responsibility to make sure that we do 
the right thing and not just the easy thing. That is what every honored heritage on earth would have 
us do -- and what the mission and tradition of the ILO call up us to do. We must make sure that 
working men and women and their children throughout the world do not enter the 21st Century 
burdened by the injustices of the 19th Century. </p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<h3 align=center>Remarks by John J. Sweeney<br>
President of the AFL-CIO</h3>
<p align=center>Cleveland City Club<br>
June 7, 1996 </p>
<p>Thank you, Sheldon, for that kind introduction and thanks to the City Club for inviting us into your 
meeting today. This is one of the great forums in our country and we appreciate the opportunity for 
some reasoned discourse on a subject of huge importance to each of us and to our families and to 
our country. </p>
<p>I'm going to take about 20 minutes for a presentation and then I understand we'll have a chunk of 
time for questions. After this meeting adjourns, we'll be holding a &quot;town hall meeting&quot; to listen to 
testimony from many people whom our allegedly surging economy has left behind, and I want to 
personally invite all of you to stay with us and hear what they have to say. </p>
<p>From Sheldon's introduction, you can probably guess that I, like many of you, am a product of the 
social compact that lifted America out of the Great Depression and lifted working Americans into 
the middle class. My father was an Irish immigrant, a New York City bus driver, and a proud 
member of the Transport Workers Union. </p>
<p>My father lived and worked in tough times. But working people, business people, and public 
officials back then shared certain understandings -- a social contract, if you will. </p>
<p>Here's what working people knew: If we got up every morning and did our jobs, then we could 
earn a better life for ourselves and a better chance for our children. Here's what business people 
knew: If they paid their workers fairly and plowed some of their profits back into their communities, 
they could count on loyal employees and loyal consumers. For companies back then, good 
citizenship was good business. </p>
<p>And here's what our leaders in government understood -- and President Kennedy said it best: &quot;A 
rising tide lifts all boats.&quot; </p>
<p>For almost 30 years after winning World War II, we all prospered because we prospered together. 
And for those among us with no boats to be lifted --- the young, the old, the disabled and the poor 
--- we generated enough extra money to provide safety nets. We were concerned with raising the 
standard of living for all Americans -- not just accumulating enormous wealth for a fortunate few. 
That social compact was a formula for the strongest economy, the largest middle class, and the 
most successful society this world has ever known. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, those days are gone. And we all know what happened. In the early 1970s, business 
was forced to find new ways to compete in a new world marketplace and for the most part they 
decided to do so not by American team-work and American know-how, but by driving down 
labor costs. Government did its share of picking workers' pockets with 12 years of Reaganomics 
-- - massive tax giveaways to wealthy taxpayers and to big corporations that created a budget 
deficit that is now being used as justification for cuts in safety nets, wage standards and income 
protections working people depend on most. </p>
<p>The result? A radical redistribution of incomes and wealth. Over the past 20 years, 97 percent of 
the income increase in our country went to the top 20 percent of wage earners. </p>
<p>The gap between the rich and everyone else keeps getting wider --- the top 10 percent now 
control almost 68 percent of the wealth. Since 1980, productivity went up 24 percent, and 
American workers should have been able to enjoy a significant increase in purchasing power. 
Instead, the productivity was converted into increases in corporate profits, which went up 200 
percent between 1980 and 1995, and into executive compensation, which is up 400 percent. </p>
<p>For the past five years, our economy has been &quot;recovering.&quot; But the recovery hasn't reached 
workers. Working families have little money to spend, they are loaded with debt and they have NO 
TIME to spend with their children or their families. They are threatened by downsizing, pension 
raids, outsourcing and runaway plants and their anger is exceeded only by anxiety over keeping 
their jobs. </p>
<p>Consider the stories we've been reading on the business page over the past year. Mobil Oil 
announces big layoffs and their stock goes up. Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank announce a 
merger that puts 12,000 people out of work and their stock goes up. AT&amp;T says they plan to lay 
off 40,000 men and women and their stock goes up. Does a rising tide now sink all ships --- 
except for the luxury yachts? </p>
<p>And what's wrong with this picture? Caterpillar is doing great, racking up record profits, enjoying 
great productivity. Instead of sharing their prosperity, they decide to squeeze a little harder with a 
two-tier wage system, more work on the weekends without paying overtime pay. They force 
thousands of workers out on strike, commit 300 unfair labor practices, and make even bigger 
profits. </p>
<p>Caterpillar says it did it to stay &quot;competitive&quot; with Kamatsu. That's not true. Kamatsu is struggling 
with a global market share below three percent, while Caterpillar has the lion's share. Know why? 
Because the United States government has spent American tax dollars fronting them into emerging 
nations in Europe, including Russia, and helping arrange financing for their operations through the 
World Bank! </p>
<p>And how about this picture, right here in Cleveland: the county workers who get paid as little as 
$6.81 an hour for handling child support payments present their case to a fact- finder, who notes 
that their wages lag behind those of other county employees and recommends a six percent pay 
raise, retroactive to January. </p>
<p>The workers and their union are ready to accept, because 32 of their members make so little they 
are eligible for food stamps. The county says &quot;no&quot; and sticks with its offer of three percent and now 
the clerks will probably have to strike to get the fact-finder's offer. </p>
<p>For American workers and their families, these are snapshots from hell. They paint an ugly portrait 
of an economy that has lost respect for workers and the jobs they do. And the captions are written 
in clinical terms like outsourcing, downsizing, right-sizing and contracting-out that workers now 
know are code words for &quot;laid off and out-of-luck.&quot; </p>
<p>For a personal view on how our economy is treating workers and their families, I've invited Sharon 
Brown from here in Cleveland to share her story with you. Sharon? </p>
<p>Just in case you think the wage and wealth gap is between the very rich and the very poor in our 
society, I've also invited Don Chadwick, also from Cleveland, to tell you his story. Don? </p>
<p>Like Sharon and Don, millions of American workers are running out of money, running out of 
options and running out of hope. They've exhausted their savings accounts, they are working two 
and three jobs and they are loaded with debt. They see the stock market soaring and profits 
roaring and they wonder, &quot;Who the hell is getting my share?&quot; </p>
<p>Lucio Noto and Allen Murray of Mobil got $2.3 million dollars of it --- that's how much their net 
wealth increased the day after they announced their layoffs. Chase Manhattan's Thomas Labreque 
and Chemical Bank's Walter Shipley made off with $6.7 million of it after they fired 12,000 loyal 
employees. And the executives of AT&amp;T increased their personal wealth by $7.9 million the day 
after they announced their intention to throw 40,000 working men and women into the street. </p>
<p>Workers read these reports every day and it makes them cynical and bitter and vulnerable to 
appeals from demagogues like Pat Buchanan and, before him, David Duke. Their frustration and 
anxiety is eating away at our economy, which depends on consumer confidence and business 
optimism in order to thrive, and it is destroying faith and confidence in the government institutions 
that keep our society civilized. America is becoming edgier, angrier, and meaner. Until we ease the 
growing gaps in work, wages, and wealth, we will be reading more dispatches from a wounded 
nation -- more militia movements, more bombings, more hate crimes, and more of the quiet anguish 
of Americans losing their sense of a common destiny and a common purpose. America will become 
more like the trouble spots where we send our sons and daughters to keep the peace. </p>
<p>I believe the wage and wealth gap to be bad business, and bad for business. In a large national poll 
taken this spring by the AFL-CIO, we asked a cross section of workers, union and non- union, 
what they believed to be the root cause of their economic problems. Out of 12 possible causes, 70 
percent of the respondents ranked &quot;corporations have become too greedy&quot; number one. </p>
<p>The poll further showed that the vast majority of workers believe companies aren't loyal to their 
employees and that companies are choosing to boost short-term profits, stock prices and executive 
salaries at the expense of their employees. Only 29 percent believe American companies are 
squeezing more productivity out of workers, downsizing and outsourcing because they are &quot;doing 
what they have to do&quot; to compete in the new global economy. </p>
<p>In the same poll, workers fingered government as the second culprit behind an economy that is 
making some people rich, while causing others to work two and three jobs and put more and more 
family members to work just to survive. They believe government is taking too much in taxes from 
working families, allowing too much speculation and too many corporate takeovers, not making the 
wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, not demanding a level playing field in trade and not fixing the 
health care system. </p>
<p>So what can we do about it? On the most basic level, American business must change the way it 
does business. When we asked workers in focus groups to tell us what should be done, here's the 
solution they agree with most: </p>
<p>&quot;We need to get back to basic values like responsibility and loyalty: when a company is doing well 
and making profits, it should raise wages; when workers have been loyal and worked hard, the 
company shouldn't abandon them.&quot; </p>
<p>These same focus groups --- which we held in Pittsburgh, Birmingham, Los Angeles and here in 
Cleveland --- are helping us draw a common-sense blueprint for restoring corporate responsibility. </p>
<p>Workers think business needs to abide by simple rules, that they shouldn't replace full-time jobs 
with part-time, no-benefit jobs, or lay off thousands of workers when they are making a good 
profit. They think government should make some new rules that encourage companies to invest in 
America instead of shipping jobs overseas and that guarantee fair trade, where countries that sell 
products here also open their markets to us and agree to basic human rights and worker 
protections. New rules that level a management-worker playing field on which employers today 
seem always to hold the upper hand. </p>
<p>Of course, American labor must also change. That is why I ran for President of the AFL-CIO, and 
that is why I won. We understand, that while the world and the workplace have changed, labor 
stood still and lost ground. Just as today I challenge business to change, every day on my job I 
challenge labor to change. </p>
<p>Here's the truth: The weakness of labor encouraged employers to take the low road. And only by 
rebuilding our strength can we bring American business back to the high road of high wages. That is 
why I am challenging every union and every level of our labor movement to do what the 
fastest-growing unions do: Put at least 30 percent of our resources into organizing. That is why we 
will be training at least a thousand organizers a year, pouring millions into organizing programs; and 
organizing from the sunbelt to the rustbelt and from health care to high tech. </p>
<p>We also realize that we have to reach out to business, to management -- from a position of strength 
-- because that is the only way we can build a stronger, high-wage economy. We can no longer 
afford the luxury of pretending that productivity, quality, and competitiveness are not our business. 
They are our business, our jobs, and our paychecks. Too many workers have suffered because of 
failed and foolish shortsighted management policies. </p>
<p>As labor becomes stronger and smarter, we will be in a position to offer business a challenge: take 
some of your profits and invest them in growing the American economy and American wages. 
Offer your workers the training they need for tomorrow's jobs -- not just the big-shots in the 
executive suites, but all your employees. </p>
<p>Work with your employees and their unions. Give us a voice in decision-making. Give us half a 
chance to improve the quality of our goods and services. That is the path to lasting prosperity -- 
and we want to walk down that road with you. Our challenge to management is to avoid conflict, 
not promote it; let's spend our time and our money and our energy pursuing higher profits and 
higher wages. </p>
<p>As we go through this election year and demonstrate that working Americans are regaining our 
political power, we also want to issue a challenge to our federal government: Restore some sanity 
to a tax code that has reduced taxes on millionaires by one-third over the past 15 years while 
raising taxes by a similar amount on middle-income Americans. Put some new parameters around 
the Wall Street wizards who are operating dangerously beyond the fringe of current regulation. 
Stop beating up on the poor, the young and the elderly. Beef up Social Security and Medicare, 
don't destroy them. When the Baby Boomers got ready to go to kindergarten, we didn't tear down 
schools, we built more! And for God's sake, honor the wishes of 84 percent of the American 
people and raise our paltry minimum wage to $5.15 an hour. </p>
<p>With a little respect -- as that song says -- we can help business compete in the global economy. 
We are going to challenge American business to use our brains as well as our backs, to let workers 
and their unions contribute to the decision-making process, to let us help you make the hard 
choices that affect our family budgets as well as your bottom lines. </p>
<p>I ran for president of the AFL-CIO with a vow to &quot;create a new voice for American workers,&quot; and 
I want you to know the labor movement will do everything in its power to accomplish just that. We 
will not shrink from any opportunity to speak for working families and to provide education and 
information about the issues that affect our lives and our children's futures. </p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in a country where workers have to hold down 
three jobs just to feed and clothe their families. </p>
<p>I want to live in a country where you have enough time left over from work and enough money in 
your pocket to take your kids to a ballgame, or a movie. </p>
<p>Where your employer respects you and the work you do and allows you to contribute your brain 
as well as your back to a common enterprise. </p>
<p>Where your lot in life is determined by what you do, and not by the color of your skin, the accident 
of your birth, or the selection of your partner. </p>
<p>And where you can look forward to a secure retirement regardless of how you fared during your 
working years. </p>
<p>I want my children and my grandchildren to look forward to notices of pay raises instead of layoff 
notices. </p>
<p>To go to college, instead of to a dead-end job. To enjoy life more, not less, than I've been able to. </p>
<p>My idea of a just society is one in which honest labor raises the standard of living for all, rather than 
enormous wealth for a few. </p>
<p>My notion of a moral nation is one which cares for its young, its old and its poor and leaves the rich 
to fend for themselves. </p>
<p>And my vision of a perfect labor movement is one which constantly examines and corrects its own 
imperfections. </p>
<p>We should expect no less from business... or from government. Thank you very much.</p>

<h1 align="center">THE LABOR MOVEMENT IN `96 -- THE NEW ACTIVISM</h1>
<h2 align="center">JOHN J. SWEENEY<br>
PRESIDENT OF THE AFL-CIO<br>
THE NEW SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH</h2>
<p align="center">JUNE 3, 1996 </p>
<p>Thank you, Dean Krauskopf, for that very kind welcome and
introduction, and for the invitation to participate in this most
important discussion. </p>
<p>It is, as always, both a pleasure and an inspiration to come
home to New York City. </p>
<p>A pleasure and an inspiration because coming home again makes
even more vivid the wonderful memories I have of growing up here. </p>
<p>And because it also makes even more vivid the lessons about
life and the meaning and value of work that I first learned here. </p>
<p>Those lessons are still valid, and still vivid in a city where
Wall Street and Park Avenue and Harlem and Chinatown and the
garment district and Flatbush and Forest Hills and the South
Bronx and Carnarsie and Staten Island are in reality little more
than a brisk walking distance from each other. </p>
<p>New York is where my family built a new life in a new land.
Where I got my education and my start in the labor movement. And
where, last fall, I gained the honor and privilege of leading the
national labor federation, the AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>My father was an Irish immigrant, a New York City bus driver
and a proud member of the Transport Workers Union. </p>
<p>Some of my earliest memories are of going to union meetings
with him, where we'd listen to Mike Quill explain paycheck
economics to workers and their families. </p>
<p>In those years after World War II, working people, business
people, and public officials shared a certain understanding -- a
&quot;social compact.&quot; </p>
<p>Working people knew that if they did their jobs, the
businesses which employed them would prosper, and they could earn
a better life for themselves and a better chance for their
children. </p>
<p>Business people knew that if they paid their workers fairly
and plowed some of their profits back into their communities,
they could count on loyal employees, and loyal consumers. They
understood that good citizenship is good business. </p>
<p>And government officials understood that a compact between
business and labor, in which each side contributed to the well-
being of the other, was good for the society as a whole. This was
the proof that, as President Kennedy put it, &quot;a rising tide
lifts all boats.&quot; </p>
<p>That social compact held despite the differences between us
and the bumps along the way, and produced a tremendous increase
in the standard of living for millions and millions of Americans,
not just a fortunate few. That was the reason that, when things
went broke, we fixed them -- together. </p>
<p>It was a social compact that produced the strongest economy,
the largest middle class, and the most successful society the
world has ever seen. </p>
<p>Now, however, the stresses of global economic competition in
the era after the oil shocks of the 1970s, of the new
technologies and of the deregulation of the domestic economies
have led some to think that the way for businesses to compete is
to shred that compact, to use workers up and then throw them
away. </p>
<p>That is the reason we are in a crisis today. </p>
<p>It is both a real crisis and a crisis of confidence. </p>
<p>It is a real crisis because of where a growing number of
American workers -- whether they wear a blue collar, or white
collar, or no collar -- find themselves in an economy that has
lost respect for workers and the jobs they do. </p>
<p>The impact on American workers and on their communities which
has resulted from that loss of respect, that shredding of the
social compact was achingly evident in the extraordinary
seven-part series the New York Times published in March called
&quot;The Downsizing of America.&quot; </p>
<p>That series told a large part of the story of the American
worker today: of people who want to work and want to contribute,
and who have wonderful, profitable ideas to contribute to their
companies, and to the society as a whole . . . people who have
suddenly found themselves bereft. </p>
<p>But the desperate straits a growing number of American workers
find themselves in -- and their courageous efforts to hold on to
a faith in the future -- was actually foreshadowed more than a
year earlier in a prophetic article in the Times in January of
1995. </p>
<p>There Lou Uchitelle wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Something is wrong with America's economic boom. After
    four years of ever-stronger growth, people's wages should be
    going up faster than their expenses. For most people, they're
    not, and this is the first time in decades that a recovery
    has gone on so long without putting more money in more
    pockets. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, workers' wages and health benefits and pension
security have lagged far behind the large productivity gains made
in American business since 1980, creating a sense of unease and
outright fear of the future among many Americans who are
employed, and a sense of desperation among that growing number of
other workers who have already been laid off, or
&quot;downsized&quot; -- workers who are running out of money,
running out of options, and running out of hope. </p>
<p>While many workers in both groups have exhausted their savings
and are loaded with debt -- despite working two and sometimes
three jobs -- they see the stock market soaring and company
profits roaring, and they wonder, &quot;Who the hell is getting
my share?&quot; </p>
<p>The asking of that haunting question by more and more workers
has produced the widespread free-floating anger against and
distrust of government that is at the heart of the crisis of
confidence in American society. It is a question which reveals
how deep the connection is between having a decent job and
feeling oneself a citizen of the United States of America. </p>
<p>We should not think that the crisis of confidence in our
political system and the crisis in the American workplace are not
related -- that the latter is not at least partly a result of the
growing inequality in opportunity and compensation in the
workplace. </p>
<p>Some people say this inequality is okay. </p>
<p>Some politicians and business leaders today advocate an
atomized, divided society, one in which the rule is a war of all
against all. They offer a world where security belongs to those
who can buy it. Where hard work and loyalty are merely weaknesses
to be exploited by the quick and well-connected. Where the only
hope offered to the downsized is the chance to hate those even
less well off. </p>
<p>But we cannot give in to a short-sighted economic strategy
motivated by individual and corporate greed. </p>
<p>American workers cannot afford it. </p>
<p>America cannot afford it. </p>
<p>As President of the AFL-CIO, I stand with many others in
offering a humane and profitable alternative to the noxious ideas
of the apostles of downsizing and the apologists for the low-wage
economy. </p>
<p>I offer the idea of a corporate economy guided by the proven
truth that a productive partnership produces greater stability
and greater profitability in the long term for companies and for
the economy as a whole. </p>
<p>I propose an economy made up of companies that give workers
tangible, positive incentives to produce to their maximum
efforts. </p>
<p>An economy where workers and other consumers can feel a sense
of loyalty to American companies -- loyalty that translates into
the purchase of those companies' products -- because all are
contributing to the strengthening of American society. </p>
<p>Remember that consumer spending has always made up about
two-thirds of the American economy. What kind of shape is the
American economy going to be in if American consumers don't have
the wherewithal to spend! </p>
<p>When companies squeeze the last possible ounce of productivity
out of their workers, and then throw them on the scrap-heap of
unemployment or old age, with reduced pensions and health
coverage . . . who else are they hurting? </p>
<p><strong>This is a case where what goes around is going to come
around! </strong></p>
<p>Only a healthy American economy that raises workers and
consumers up can sustain the long-run profitability companies
need and the prosperity America needs. </p>
<p>The facts which have produced this crisis are stark and deeply
worrisome. Many of you already know them as well as I do. </p>
<p>But let me cite a few of them before I discuss some of the
things we in the AFL-CIO are doing and intend to do in order to
arrest the disruption of the American economy and the downward
slide of American workers and their families: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Corporate profits rose 64 percent from 1989 to 1995, to a
        45-year high, according to Business Week. And executive
        compensation is up 400 percent since 1980. But workers'
        wages and health benefits and pension security are way
        down. </li>
    <li>Since 1995 workers' wages have increased only 2.8
        percent, in contrast to productivity, which has gone up
        3.4 percent. </li>
    <li>Between 1947 and 1973, the median paychecks of American
        workers more than doubled -- and the bottom 20 percent
        enjoyed the biggest gains. But since 1973 median earnings
        have fallen by about 15 percent, and the bottom 20
        percent have fallen the furthest behind. More than 40
        percent of all earnings gains have gone to the richest 1
        percent of the American population. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, wealth has become even more concentrated. The
        top 20 percent of all households now control more than 55
        percent of all wealth. The rest of us -- the 80 percent
        -- get to split the rest. Yet, the Republicans in
        Congress showed in the recent battle to -- finally --
        increase the minimum wage that they believe that those
        least well-off should continue to bear the greatest
        financial burden in the society. </li>
    <li>Henry Ford used to say that he wanted to pay his workers
        enough to afford the cars They were building. Well, in
        the last 10 years the average price of a car has jumped
        70 percent, while family incomes have climbed only 40
        percent! </li>
</ul>
<p>And there are even more dangerous developments at work in the
American workplace. </p>
<p>One has to do with the growing gap the Dunlop Commission found
in the earnings of American workers who constitute the high wage
skilled workers and those who make up the increasing `underclass'
of low paid labor. </p>
<p>This `underclass,' it should be noted, is not some small
minority of the workforce. Rather, it actually includes all
workers whose formal education ended with high school -- which is
a majority of the American workforce! The wages of high school
educated workers have been in free fall for the past two decades
-- with the result that one in five full-time full-year workers
in America today earns wages below the poverty level -- a 50
percent increase since 1979. </p>
<p>A second worrisome development is the trends which have much
more sharply divided the workforce into four, identifiable
groups: </p>
<ul>
    <li>&quot;core, skilled workers,&quot; </li>
    <li>&quot;peripheral, skilled workers&quot; -- a group which
        includes both those who are skilled but work on a
        contingent or temporary basis, such as lawyers, nurses,
        accountants and other professionals who are unable to
        find permanent employment -- and those who are unskilled. </li>
    <li>&quot;unskilled, core workers&quot; such as hotel bellmen
        and maids, and dishwashers and waiters, and </li>
    <li>&quot;unskilled peripheral workers&quot; -- a category
        which includes taxi drivers, and office-cleaning workers,
        and many temporary and part-time employees. </li>
</ul>
<p>Representing each one of these groups -- and all of them do
need representation -- raises its own set of challenges for the
labor movement. </p>
<p>But let me end this particular focus on statistics by citing
some from a poll conducted by the Times-Mirror organization late
last year. </p>
<p>Their survey found that 66 percent of Americans were concerned
about being able to pay for health care if a family member gets
sick . . . that 57 percent were concerned that their children
will not have good job opportunities . . . that 48 percent were
worried they wouldn't have enough money for retirement . . . that
44 percent worried that they would not have enough to afford
college . . . that 34 percent were worried about losing their job
or having to take a cut in pay. </p>
<p>All of those numbers were up 6 and 7 percent from March of
1994. </p>
<p>These are not the measures of a society brimming with
confidence. </p>
<p>Instead, these survey results show that working Americans know
that an economy like this won't work for long. A lot of the
run-up in stock prices seems to be based on the expectation that
our economy is structurally in a downward wage spiral that will
keep putting more money in investors' pockets forever. The
markets seem to be calculating that working people will just keep
on producing more and more for less and less pay. </p>
<p>But American workers and those with common sense know better.
They know that an economy where growth is not shared will soon
collapse upon itself. </p>
<p>The American worker's problem is stagnant wages -- America
needs a raise! </p>
<p>And the solution is a larger, stronger, smarter labor
movement, one that forcefully articulates and works to achieve
the idea that the common path to long-term value -- for
companies, for workers, for the nation itself -- lies in the
investment in those things which benefit the common good. </p>
<p>It lies in the re-building of a partnership between workers
and owners based on mutual respect, cooperation, and gain. </p>
<p>So we in the labor movement will reach out to management --
from a position of strength --because that is the only way we can
build a stronger, high-wage economy. </p>
<p>We will tell management that they -- and we -- need to follow
the examples of workers and their unions in companies and
government agencies and school systems across the country who are
winning a voice in improving the products they make and the
services they deliver. </p>
<p>That is the way to avoid foolish and shortsighted management
policies </p>
<p>And the AFL-CIO is going to work to increase the incentives
for business to do that by challenging the climate of hostility
to the American worker in the political arena. </p>
<p>We are mounting a campaign of unprecedented scale to involve
working families in the governance of this nation. This year, as
I announced earlier this spring and as Republican operatives in
Washington have often repeated and twisted, we are going to spend
$35 million dollars providing information and education around
the issues that affect working people's lives and our children's
futures. That's more than three times what we've ever spent. </p>
<p>But it's not going to candidates. And it's not going to
political parties. It's going to educate and motivate our members
and other working families. And it includes our new national
political training institute, which is already recruiting and
training political organizers, campaign managers and candidates. </p>
<p>Every union is going to do its share by contributing ideas,
money, and staff so that we can work to identify candidates who
stand with working people -- and more importantly, so that we can
build a base of working people who hold elected officials,
regardless of party, accountable for insuring that workers'
rights and values be represented properly in our national debate. </p>
<p>Most of all, the AFL-CIO is going to work for the American
worker by rebuilding our labor movement . . . by pouring vast
resources into organizing new members, from the Sun Belt to the
Rust Belt, and from software writers to sweatshop workers. </p>
<p>We are going to reach out to unorganized workers -- because
that is the only way we can build a stronger movement. For too
long, too many unions have been satisfied with a shrinking
membership base. As our membership strength has declined, so has
our bargaining power. </p>
<p>It used to be that strong unions lifted all workers up. Now,
non-union employees are dragging all workers down. </p>
<p>Yes, the truth is, our weakness encouraged employers to take
the low road. Only by rebuilding our strength can we bring
American business back to the high road of high wages. </p>
<p>That's why I have challenged every union and every level of
our labor movement to do what the fastest-growing unions do: Put
at least 30 percent of your resources into organizing. That is
why we are training at least a thousand organizers a year, and
pouring $20 million into organizing programs. </p>
<p>Our message to the American worker is simple, but powerful:
Whether you wear a blue collar, a white collar, a new collar, or
no collar, we can help you make your job better. </p>
<p>And our message to the American people is simple, too: This is
the way to build a better, stronger economy and a better,
stronger America. An America that honors work and rewards
workers. <strong>ALL its workers. </strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2 align="center">Remarks by John J. Sweeney<br>
President of the AFL-CIO</h2>
<h1 align="center">Conference on Prospects for a Global Economy</h1>
<h2 align="center">Boston College<br>
June 3, 1996</h2>
<p>I've been asked to give a workers' perspective on SOURCES OF
AND SOLUTIONS TO UNCERTAINTY, so I'll start with
&quot;sources.&quot; Workers believe, quite simply, that business
and government are the sources, that they've conspired to create
a wage and wealth gap that's eating away at the economic and
social fabric of our nation. </p>
<p>In a large national poll taken this spring by the AFL-CIO, we
asked a cross section of workers, union and non-union, what they
believed to be the root cause of their economic problems. Out of
12 possible causes, 70 percent of the respondents ranked
&quot;corporations have become too greedy&quot; number one. </p>
<p>The poll further showed that the vast majority of workers
believe companies aren't loyal to their employees and that
companies are choosing to boost short-term profits, stock prices
and executive salaries at the expense of their employees. Only 29
percent believe American companies are squeezing more
productivity out of workers, downsizing and outsourcing because
they're &quot;doing what they have to do&quot; to compete in the
global economy. </p>
<p>In the same poll, workers fingered government as the second
culprit behind an economy that is making some people rich, while
causing others to work two and three jobs and put more and more
family members to work just to survive. They believe government
is taking too much in taxes from working families, allowing too
much speculation and too many corporate takeovers, not making the
wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, not demanding a level
playing field in trade and not fixing the health care system. </p>
<p>There are those in business and in government who would have
us think these are only perceptions, the result of media hype
about a wage and wealth gap that really doesn't exist and,
therefore, couldn't have been caused by either government or
business. But, based on my visits with workers all across this
country, I believe these attitudes are correct reflections of
reality. The only thing that surprises me is that workers are not
more critical, given the 10, 15 and 20 years of punishment
they've endured. We can't begin to address the question of
&quot;solutions to uncertainty&quot; until we understand the
bleak economic realities faced by average-wage Americans. </p>
<p>In the early 1970s, business was forced to find new ways to
compete in a new world marketplace and for the most part they
decided to do so not by American team-work and American know-how,
but by driving down labor costs. Government did its share of
picking workers' pockets with 12 years of Reaganomics --- massive
tax giveaways to wealthy taxpayers and to big corporations that
created a budget deficit that is now being used as justification
for cuts in safety nets, wage standards and income protections
working people depend on most. </p>
<p>The result? A radical redistribution of incomes and wealth.
Over the past 20 years, 97 percent of the income increase in our
country went to the top 20 percent of wage earners. </p>
<p>The gap between the rich and everyone else keeps getting wider
--- the top 10 percent now control almost 68 percent of the
wealth. Since 1980, productivity went up 24 percent, and American
workers should have been able to enjoy a significant increase in
purchasing power. Instead, the productivity was converted into
increases in corporate profits, which went up 200 percent between
1980 and 1995, and into executive compensation, which is up 400
percent. </p>
<p>For the past five years, our economy has been
&quot;recovering.&quot; But the recovery hasn't reached workers.
Working families have little money to spend, they are loaded with
debt and they have NO TIME to spend with their children or their
families. They are threatened by downsizing, pension raids,
outsourcing and runaway plants and their anger is exceeded only
by anxiety over keeping their jobs. </p>
<p>&quot;Economic uncertainty&quot; and &quot;economic
insecurity&quot; are terms now being used to describe the mood of
working America, and they suggest that most Americans are doing
pretty well, but somehow unsure of their future. The truth is
that working Americans are insecure, and angry, not because of
perceptions, but because of the harsh reality that our nation has
lost respect for workers and the jobs they do. </p>
<p>Our problem: America needs a raise --- people can't spend
money or save money unless they HAVE money. The solution: we need
to find new ways to grow the American economy, American
companies, and American wages in the new world economy. And to
bridge the growing gap between the great majority of Americans
who are working longer and harder for less and the fortunate few
who are prospering as never before. </p>
<p>The solutions needed from labor: we have to grow ourselves, on
a massive scale, because we can no longer afford the luxury of
pretending that productivity, quality, and competitiveness are
not our business. They are our business, our jobs, and our
paychecks. We must gain a voice in improving the products we
make, the services we deliver and in the decisions that affect
our futures and our families. </p>
<p>The solutions needed from business: take more of your profits
and invest them in American workers. Offer them the training they
need for tomorrow's jobs. Work with your employees and their
unions. Give them a voice in decision-making. Give them half a
chance to improve the quality of your goods and services. That is
the path to lasting prosperity. And Put some money in their
pockets so they can buy your refrigerators, and mobile homes. </p>
<p>The solutions needed from government: restore some sanity to a
tax code that has reduced taxes on millionaires by one-third over
the past 15 years while raising taxes by a similar amount on
middle-income Americans. Put an end to corporate welfare. Put
some new fences around the Wall Street wizards who are operating
dangerously beyond the fringe of current regulation. Reform
health care so we can begin to control costs. And raise our
paltry minimum wage to $5.15 an hour! </p>
<p>What do workers say we need to do? Workers think business
needs to abide by simple rules, that they shouldn't replace full-
time jobs with part-time no-benefit jobs, or lay off thousands of
workers when they are making a good profit. </p>
<p>They think government should make some new rules that
encourage companies to invest in America instead of shipping jobs
overseas and that guarantee fair trade, where countries that sell
products here also open their markets to us and agree to basic
human rights and worker protections. New rules that level a
playing field on which employers today hold the upper hand. </p>
<p>These are common-sense solutions and they would go a long way
toward closing the wage and wealth gap and putting us back on a
track of prospering together. </p>

<p align=center>Remarks by AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney<br>
</p>
<h1 align=center>Presidential Emergency Board 228</h1>
<p align=center><br>
</p>
<h2 align=center>May 13, 1996</h2>
<p>Thank you, Bob. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the members of the Presidential 
Emergency Board today, and I especially appreciate the opportunity to speak on behalf of the rail 
workers represented by TCU. </p>
<p>As Bob noted, this is, to my knowledge, the first time in history that a President of the AFL-CIO 
has appeared before a Presidential Emergency Board on behalf of a rail union. I do not do this 
lightly. A fair settlement of the issues facing our nation's transportation industry workers will 
reverberate far beyond TCU's 30,000 affected members. </p>
<p>TCU's negotiations with the railroad industry are a microcosm of what's happening to American 
workers everywhere. </p>
<p>The issues that will be brought before you -- declining real wages, jobs lost to outsourcing, attacks 
on workers' health insurance -- are the same issues bedeviling all of American workers. </p>
<p>The workers I talk with as I travel around the country are desperate for some re-balancing of the 
scales. They are filled with a profound sense that things are badly out of kilter -- that America 
doesn't work for them anymore. </p>
<p>Things weren't always this way. For nearly 30 years after winning World War II, businesses and 
workers enjoyed a kind of social compact. We all prospered because we prospered together. </p>
<p>Here's what working people knew back then: if we worked hard and played by the rules, we could 
count on a better life for ourselves and a better future for our children. </p>
<p>Here's what business knew: if they paid their workers fairly and plowed some of their profits back 
into their communities, they could count on loyal employees and loyal consumers. </p>
<p>That social compact was a formula for the strongest economy, the largest middle class, and the 
most successful society this world has ever known. </p>
<p>A lot has changed since then: global economic competition . . . new technologies, and more. </p>
<p>But those changes spawned another, bigger threat: too many employers have discarded any sense 
of loyalty or respect for their employees. </p>
<p>It is the #1 theme I hear from workers . . . &quot;No loyalty&quot;. . . &quot;No respect&quot; . . . even when companies 
and their top executives are doing very well. Employees are treated like expenses on a balance 
sheet -- instead of assets to be invested in. </p>
<p>And the #1 answer workers give to the question of what is wrong with the economy is corporate 
greed. </p>
<p>The result is that at a time when productivity is up, when profits have soared to a forty year high, 
and when executive compensation has risen to obscene levels, wages and benefits for most 
workers are stagnant or declining. </p>
<p>Workers have no money to spend, no time to spend with their families, and they are loaded with 
debt. </p>
<p>That is a recipe for economic and social disaster. And that is why the AFL-CIO and our 13.1 
million members are taking the message of &quot;America Needs A Raise&quot; to communities across this 
country. </p>
<p>Nowhere is the disparity between the fortunes of executives and shareholders on the one hand and 
workers on the other more glaring than in the railroad industry. </p>
<p>When CEO compensation climbs 50 percent and rail profits charge up 78 percent since 1990 -- 
while workers' real wages decline 10 percent -- it is simply wrong. </p>
<p>When Drew Lewis, the CEO of Union Pacific, makes 335 times what a TCU worker on Union 
Pacific makes --as he did in 1994 -- it is simply wrong. </p>
<p>Rail shareholders have enjoyed the gravy train -- they've seen their rail stocks double in value since 
1990. </p>
<p>The only ones who haven't shared in the railroad renaissance are the workers who made it 
possible. They have not only seen their real wages decline, they have also suffered drastic cuts in 
their employment levels, as jobs have been lost to outsourcing, technology, and merger mania. </p>
<p>That is why this Board is so critically important -- to TCU, its members and workers throughout 
this country. You have the power to redress these wrongs. </p>
<p>Frankly, this forum is not of our choosing. We would have preferred to see this dispute settled 
through traditional collective bargaining. </p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that if TCU were permitted to exert economic pressure -- to strike 
these railroads -- we would not be here today. This contract would have been settled long ago. </p>
<p>That is because TCU's demands are not pie in the sky. They are measured, reasonable requests for 
across the board percentage wage increases, instead of lump sums, from an industry that can easily 
afford them. </p>
<p>I know Bob Scardelletti. He is not unreasonable. His whole history has been to negotiate 
agreements. He led the way in this round of rail bargaining by making an agreement with the only 
Class I railroad -- Illinois Central -- willing to negotiate in good faith. </p>
<p>But the railroads in this room represent the worst aspect of America's corporate greed culture. 
They have cynically manipulated the fact that their industry has such strategic economic importance 
that the government will not allow a strike of duration to occur. </p>
<p>Thus insulated from any economic pressure, they have refused to bargain in good faith, secure that 
the worst that can happen is they'd wind up -- a year and a half after bargaining began -- before a 
panel such as this one. </p>
<p>They remember what happened last time, in 1991, when they testified with a straight face before 
Presidential Emergency Board 219 that their industry was on the verge of economic collapse and 
they needed to hold the line on workers' wages. PEB 219 bought their bill of goods -- yet every 
economic prediction the railroads made has since been proved wrong. The recommendations of 
that last Board are a major part of the story as to why rail workers have been the only economic 
casualty in the railroads' prosperity. </p>
<p>The railroads are counting on history repeating itself. But you have the opportunity to leave a 
different history. </p>
<p>You are in a unique position. Even Wall Street is now publishing articles about the imbalance 
between corporate profits and workers' wages. </p>
<p>Politicians of every stripe are suddenly discovering the plight of America's middle class. They are 
talking about it. You can do something about it. </p>
<p align=center>You have the power to send a message: &quot;America needs a raise.&quot; I urge you to send that message. 
I urge you to recommend TCU's contract proposals as the basis on which to settle this dispute. 
Thank you.</p>

<h2 align="center">Remarks by AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney</h2>
<h1 align="center">OSHA 25th Anniversary Event<br>
Friday, April 26, 1996</h1>
<p>Mr. Secretary, Vice President Gore . . . </p>
<p>I was lucky to be able to spend a little time earlier this
morning with the workers and family members here with us. They
are from a diverse group of occupations and states: Mississippi,
West Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Indiana,
Kansas, Maryland, Ohio, Virginia, D.C., New York, Oklahoma,
Vermont, and New Hampshire. </p>
<p>But they share a common message: the Occupational Health and
Safety Act is one of the most important laws ever passed for
working people. Workplaces are safer. Fewer people die on the
job. Fewer people are injured. But it's still not enough. </p>
<p>The working men and women here, like too many working people
across our nation, have had their lives turned upside down by
jobs that are unsafe. Some have lost the use of limbs; many have
lost jobs and income. </p>
<p>We still have construction workers like carpenter Ron Taylor
who lost his job this month after he suffered respiratory damage
from toxic fumes. We still have workers like Jackie Whittaker
whose life was dramatically altered by a mine explosion. Workers
like James Haynes, tragically disabled by a contruction accident.
And workers like David Cain, whose wife Jamie can tell of the
horror of the burns David suffered from an unsafe job -- David is
still in critical condition in a Pittsburgh hospital. We still
have deaths from lung cancer caused by exposure to radioactive
materials -- Corrilla Kelly, widow of machinist Herb Kelly, can
speak volumes about that loss. </p>
<p>And there is a whole host of new problems we haven't even
begun to attack. Repetitive stress injuries like carpal tunnel
syndrome cripple hundreds of thousands of workers each year, as
Josephine Smith, Marie Torres, Martha Edmonds, and Betty Green
can testify. And workplace assaults are claiming more casualties
every year, as nurse Mark Allen and social worker Marcia Stulbaum
can tell you. In the service sector, where I come from, injuries
and illnesses continue to mount. Nursing homes are now one of the
most dangerous industries in America. </p>
<p>All this is documented in this new report from the AFL-CIO
that tells the story of the last 25 years in health and safety in
facts and figures. </p>
<p>We know the basic law works, but we know it needs to work even
better. </p>
<p>Yet we have spent the last year and a half fighting a
relentless attack by Congressional Republicans, at the behest of
their corporate allies, who want to weaken the law and take us
back in time. </p>
<p>The Clinton administration has stood its ground and vowed to
veto any legislation that would weaken job safety laws. </p>
<p>When the OSHA law was passed, this nation made a commitment
that every worker has the right to a safe job. That's a promise
worth keeping. And working families across America thank and
commend you, Secretary Reich, and you, Vice President Gore, for
committing not only to honor this promise, but to strengthen it. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

President of the AFL-CIO</h3>
<h1 align="center">Renewing the Social Contract Forum</h1>
<h2 align="center">Minneapolis, MN<br>
April 12, 1996<br>
</h2>
<p>Thank you for, Congressman Sabo, for that cordial introduction
and for inviting me here to speak on behalf of American workers
and their families. </p>
<p>And thank you for continuing to be a beacon of hope for social
justice in a United States Congress that has grown stormy and
dark with the politics of greed and hatred. </p>
<p>By hosting this event here today, you have once again
demonstrated the kind of leadership that is going to bring us
through these troubling waters and once again into the sunshine -
- and the entire labor movement thanks you. </p>
<p>Likewise, I'd like to recognize the terrific leadership being
shown here in Minnesota by our state federation president, Bernie
Brommer, as well as by Kristine Jacobs of the Minnesota Now
Coalition and Chuck Collins of Share the Wealth. If we could
recreate this kind of partnership in every state in the country,
it wouldn't be long before we took our country back. </p>
<p>I am grateful for the chance to speak today on the subject of
&quot;Renewing the Social Contract&quot; because I am a product
of that contract -- one that lifted America out of the Great
Depression and lifted working Americans into the middle class. </p>
<p>My father was an Irish immigrant, a New York City bus driver,
and a proud member of the Transport Workers Union. My earliest
memories are of going with him to union meetings and listening to
Mike Quill explain checkbook economics in his thick Irish brogue.
My father lived and worked in tough times. </p>
<p>But working people, business people, and public officials
shared certain understandings -- a social contract, if you will. </p>
<p>Here's what working people knew: If we got up every morning
and did our jobs, then we could earn a better life for ourselves
and a better chance for our children. </p>
<p>Here's what business people knew: If they paid their workers
fairly and plowed some of their profits back into their
communities, they could count on loyal employees and loyal
consumers. </p>
<p>For companies back then, good citizenship was good business.
And here's what our leaders in government understood -- and
President Kennedy said it best: &quot;A rising tide lifts all
boats.&quot; </p>
<p>For almost 30 years after winning World War II, we all
prospered because we prospered together. We were concerned with
raising the standard of living for all Americans -- not just
accumulating enormous wealth for a fortunate few. That social
contract was a formula for the strongest economy, the largest
middle class, and the most successful society this world has ever
known. </p>
<p>In the early 1970s, however, we began drifting from our
course. The oil embargo . . . global competition . . . new
technologies . . . and deregulation of the domestic economy --
all these put the squeeze on American business. Then business
made a fateful decision to compete, not by American team-work and
know-how, but by driving down labor costs -- by squeezing the
last possible ounce of productivity out of workers . . . then
throwing them on the scrap-heap of unemployment or old age . . .
with reduced pensions and health coverage. </p>
<p>The result? Working family incomes have declined greatly and
we now have a shocking maldistribution of wealth in this country.
Between 1947 and 1973, the median paychecks of American workers
more than doubled -- and the bottom 20 percent enjoyed the
biggest gains. But since 1973, median earnings have fallen by
about 15 percent, and the bottom 20% have fallen the furthest
behind. </p>
<p>More than 40 percent of all earnings gains have gone to the
richest one percent, and 97 percent of the income increase in our
country has gone to the top 20 percent. During the past two
decades productivity went up 24 percent, and American workers
should have been able to enjoy a substantial increase in
purchasing power. Instead, the productivity was converted into
increases in corporate profits, which went up 205 percent since
1980 and are now at an all-time high. And it was converted into
executive compensation, which is up 360 percent since 1980. While
productivity, profits, executive pay and the stock market keep
going up . . . working family incomes keep going down, widening
the gap between the rich and the rest of us. </p>
<p>Workers are having to labor harder and longer just to keep
even, and more and more family members are having to work in
order to maintain living standards. Working families have little
money to spend, they are loaded with debt and they have no time
to spend with their children. They feel threatened by
restructuring . . . downsizing . . . pension raids . . .
privatization schemes and runaway plants . . . they are disgusted
with business and government and their disillusionment is
straining the fabric of our society. And more than 12 million
workers at the bottom of the wage structure have lost hope
altogether -- victims of a federal minimum wage that in real
terms is now 25 percent below its 1981 level. </p>
<p>To add insult to injury, we've been hit this past year and a
half with an all-out assault on all the government programs and
policies that protect the standard of living for workers and
their families . . . and a safety net for the young, the old, the
poor and the disabled. Cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and student
loans. Attempts to repeal the 40-hour work week, overtime pay,
OSHA, affirmative action and Davis-Bacon. So-called
&quot;reform&quot; of welfare and the National Labor Relations
Act. All capped off with another tax cut for the rich and an
insidious movement to undermine the most successful
income-protection program in history by privatizing Social
Security. </p>
<p>Add to this witch's brew the stories we've been reading on the
business page over the past year. Mobil Oil announces big layoffs
and their stock goes up. Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank
announce a merger that puts 12,000 people out of work and their
stock goes up. AT&amp;T says they plan to lay off 40,000 men and
women and their stock goes up. </p>
<p>Does a rising tide now sink all ships --- except for the
luxury yachts? </p>
<p>And what's wrong with this picture: Caterpillar is doing
great, racking up record profits, enjoying great productivity.
Instead of sharing their prosperity, they decide to squeeze a
little harder with a two-tier wage system and more work on the
weekends without paying overtime pay. They force thousands of
workers out on strike, commit 300 unfair labor practices, and
make even bigger profits. Caterpillar says it did it to stay
&quot;competitive&quot; with Komatsu. That's not true. Komatsu is
struggling with a global market share below three percent, while
Caterpillar has the lion's share. Know why? Because the United
States government has spent American tax dollars fronting them
into emerging nations in Europe, including Russia, and helping
arrange financing for their operations through the World Bank! </p>
<p>And how about this picture: over a period of nearly 50 years,
organized labor is an outright sponsor of Kaiser Permanente as a
low-cost, high-quality health plan for working families. We bring
members in by the hundreds of thousands through our Taft-Hartley
plans because Kaiser promises to buy union, build union and hire
union --- a great social contract. Then suddenly, HMOs enter a
new world of competition, similar to what corporations
encountered in the early 1970s. Kaiser decides to take the same
low-road to the bottom by slashing labor costs - -- restructuring
. . . outsourcing . . . right-sizing . . . closing hospitals and
changing patient care standards without consulting either the
plan members or the workers that deliver their care. What
happens? A huge labor-management crisis is created. We now have
30,000 AFL-CIO union members with open contracts in the HMO that
labor built. </p>
<p>I appealed personally to CEO David Lawrence for a
&quot;strategic partnership&quot; to keep Kaiser from destroying
itself and its relationship with labor. He rejected me and said
that union members would never have a say in patient care
decisions --- meaning Kaiser employees will continue to have less
input into the vital services they deliver than auto workers have
into the cars they make! </p>
<p>For American workers and their families, these are snapshots
from hell. They paint an ugly portrait of an economy that has
lost respect for workers and the jobs they do. And the captions
are written in clinical terms like outsourcing . . . downsizing .
. . right-sizing . . . and contracting out that workers now know
are code words for <em>laid off and out-of-luck.</em> </p>
<p>Corporate horror stories like these do more than disrupt the
lives of working Americans and their families. They violate our
most basic values -- and tear at the fabric of American life. </p>
<p>People who get up every day, put in a decent day's work, and
give a lifetime of loyalty to their employers have been treated
like disposable parts or plant equipment, to be trashed and
forgotten. </p>
<p>Imagine what they must tell their children when they come home
on the day they've gotten their downsizing notice: 'Your dad
worked for the company all his life . . . now, they've told me to
clean out my desk tomorrow.' </p>
<p>Imagine how hard it must be for these parents to tell their
kids that, if they study hard, work hard, and do right by their
companies and their colleagues . . . the world will do right by
them. </p>
<p>Imagine the lesson their kids must really be learning from all
this: that playing by the rules is just for fools. </p>
<p>It is time for Americans to take a look at how corporate
America is downsizing the American dream and say three simple
words: <strong>THIS IS WRONG</strong>. And seven more: <strong>WE'VE
GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. </strong></p>
<p>So what can we do about it? On the most basic level, American
business must change the way it does business. There are still
responsible business people, but far too much of Corporate
America has spent the last decade going after Working America.
American labor must also change. The fact is that it takes at
least two sides to make a social compact, and that is why we are
rebuilding and revitalizing our labor movement. </p>
<p>The years when American wages stagnated are the years when our
labor movement declined from 35 percent to 16 percent of the
total work force. Here's the truth: The weakness of labor
encouraged employers to take the low road. And only by rebuilding
our strength can we bring American business back to the high road
of high wages. That is why I am challenging every union and every
level of our labor movement to do what the fastest-growing unions
do: Put at least 30 percent of our resources into organizing. </p>
<p>That is why we will be training at least a thousand organizers
a year . . . pouring millions into organizing programs . . . and
organizing from the sunbelt to the rustbelt and from health care
to high tech. That is why we are rebuilding our grassroots
political strength . . . training candidates . . . and training
political organizers. We have to be able to reach out to
business, to management -- from a position of strength -- because
that is the only way we can build a stronger, high-wage economy. </p>
<p>We can no longer afford the luxury of pretending that
productivity, quality, and competitiveness are not our business.
They are our business, our jobs, and our paychecks. </p>
<p>As America's unions become stronger and smarter, we will be in
a position to offer business a challenge: Take some of your
profits and invest them in growing the American economy, American
workers, and American wages. Offer your workers the training they
need for tomorrow's jobs -- not just the big-shots in the
executive suites -- but all your employees. </p>
<p>Work with your employees and their unions. Give us a voice in
decision-making. Give us half a chance to improve the quality of
our goods and services. That is the path to lasting prosperity -
- and we want to walk down that road with you. </p>
<p>This year, we will begin to offer these challenges not only to
the leaders of labor and business but to all Americans. </p>
<p>This month, the AFL-CIO will begin to hold a series of town
hall meetings on falling living standards in 29 communities
across the country to put the issue of wages and wealth at the
center of political debate. </p>
<p>We will listen to working men and women talk about what is
happening to their jobs, their paychecks, and their family
budgets. And we will listen to working Americans' ideas on how to
address the issues that affect our lives and our children's
futures -- together. </p>
<p>As we go through this election year and demonstrate that
working Americans are regaining our political power, we also want
to issue a few challenges to government at every level -- but
especially to the United States Congress. Restore some sanity to
a tax code that has reduced taxes on millionaires by one-third
over the past 15 years while raising taxes by a similar amount on
middle-income Americans. Put some new parameters around the Wall
Street wizards who are operating dangerously beyond the fringe of
current regulation. </p>
<p>Stop beating up on the poor, the young and the elderly. Beef
up Social Security and Medicare, don't destroy them. </p>
<p>When the Baby Boomers got ready to go to kindergarten, we
didn't tear down schools, we built more! </p>
<p>And for God's sake, honor the wishes of 83 percent of the
American people and raise our paltry minimum wage to $5.15 an
hour. </p>
<p>In every speech I give, from this forum to picket lines across
the country, I'm trying to make this simple point: America needs
a raise. And the sooner we get together and deliver one, the
better off we will be, labor and business and government alike. </p>
<p>As I travel the country, I've seen how eager working men and
women are to come together to answer the assault on their jobs
and wages. And I can tell you this: working Americans are ready
for the messages we are delivering today -- and they are ready to
come together with real leaders like Martin Sabo so he can
continue to champion the cause of working Americans and their
families. </p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<h3 align="center">Remarks by John J. Sweeney<br>
President of the AFL-CIO</h3>
<h1 align="center">New Vigor in the Labor Movement</h1>
<h2 align="center">Kennedy Library Public Forum<br>
Boston, Massachusetts<br>
April 11, 1996</h2>
<p>Thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of American
workers and their families. </p>
<p>I know there are many friends and allies from inside and
outside the labor movement here with us tonight. I want to thank
all of you for the support you have given Rich Trumka, Linda
Chavez-Thompson, and me as we work to create a &quot;New Voice
for American Workers.&quot; </p>
<p>On behalf of the 13.1 million members of the AFL-CIO, I would
also like to express our support for the workers who have been
locked-out at the Commonwealth Gas Company since March 31st.
Management tactics like that lock-out explain why American
workers need a labor movement with as much vigor as possible. </p>
<p>I would also like to thank one of the people who helped bring
me here, a friend and scholar of the labor movement, Professor
Barry Bluestone. </p>
<p>Tonight, I would like to make three points: First, America
owes much of its progress and prosperity to the social contract
that existed for roughly three decades after World War II. During
that era -- thanks, in large measure, to a strong labor movement
and the understandings it achieved with business and government
-- workers shared in the gains of a growing economy. Second, for
at least the past two decades, Corporate America has gone after
Working America. The result has been stagnant living standards,
increasing inequality, and the sense that our social fabric is
fraying and our political system isn't working. And, third, at
long last, working Americans are fighting back -- and finding
their voice. The labor movement is reviving itself, from
organizing drives at workplaces around the country to
long-overdue changes in national unions and in the AFL-CIO. As we
regain our strength, we will strive to create a new social
contract of shared power and shared prosperity. All this may
sound like abstract rhetoric, but I've seen these things happen
in my own life. </p>
<p>My background is similar to many families here in Boston. My
father was an Irish immigrant, a New York City bus driver, and a
proud member of the Transport Workers Union -- the TWU. </p>
<p>The union helped him win the building blocks of a decent life:
a living wage, a stable job, more vacation days, and secure
health and pension benefits. When he was able to buy a home for
our family or spend a few more days with us at the beach, he'd
say: &quot;Thank God for the union.&quot; </p>
<p>Because the union helped him climb the first few rungs on the
ladder of opportunity, he was able to see his kids go to college.
So you could say that I'm a product of the post-war social
contract that lifted America out of the Great Depression - - and
lifted working people into the middle class. </p>
<p>Here's what working people knew: If we got up every morning
and did our jobs, then we could earn a better life for ourselves
and a better chance for our children. </p>
<p>Here's what business people knew: If they paid their workers
fairly and plowed some of their profits back into their
communities, they could count on loyal employees and loyal
consumers. For companies back then, good citizenship was good
business. </p>
<p>And here's what our leaders in government understood -- and
President Kennedy said it best: &quot;A rising tide lifts all
boats.&quot; </p>
<p>For almost 30 years after winning World War II, most Americans
prospered because we prospered together. That social compact was
a formula for the strongest economy, the largest middle class,
and the most successful society this world has ever known. </p>
<p>But now, those days are gone -- long gone. </p>
<p>You know what happened: The oil embargo of 1973. Global
economic competition. New technologies. The deregulation of the
domestic economy, from transportation to communications. And the
decline of basic industries, from auto and steel to electronic
appliances. </p>
<p>It seemed that, all at once, there was a new economy, with new
rules or none at all, a few winners, and lots more losers. </p>
<p>All that is true, but the real problem is: Corporate America
made a fateful decision to compete in the new global economy, not
by American team-work and American know-how, but by driving down
labor costs. Too often, companies chose to squeeze the last
possible ounce of productivity out of American workers, then
throw them on the scrap-heap of unemployment or old age, with
reduced pensions and health coverage. </p>
<p>That is why, from 1978 through 1995, the buying power of
workers' hourly earnings fell by 12%. American families tried all
kinds of coping mechanisms. They sent husbands, wives, and teen-
age kids into the labor force. They took second and third jobs.
They went deeper into debt. But, in spite of it all, median
family income fell 5 percent between 1989 and 1994. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the wealthiest Americans are doing better than
ever. Between 1980 and 1995, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose 404 percent. That provided huge payoffs for investors -- but
no wage gains for workers. </p>
<p>Corporate profits have risen 205 percent since 1980. Corporate
chief executive officers are raking in 360 more -- and now they
earn 187 times more than the average worker. And that's in spite
of the fact that workers' productivity has risen 24% since 1979
-- while their real wages fell! </p>
<p>It seems something is way out of kilter. And now, instead of
raising workers' wages, profitable corporations are wiping out
workers' jobs. </p>
<p>You've seen the stories -- and I hope you and your friends and
families haven't suffered personally. Mobil Oil announces big
layoffs and their stock goes up. Chase Manhattan and Chemical
Bank announce a merger that puts 12,000 people out of work and
their stock goes up. AT&amp;T says they plan to lay off 40,000
men and women and their stock goes up. Does a rising tide now
sink all ships --- except for the luxury yachts? </p>
<p>And what's wrong with this picture: Caterpillar is doing
great, racking up record profits, enjoying great productivity.
Instead of sharing their prosperity, they decide to squeeze a
little harder with a two-tier wage system, more work on the
weekends without paying overtime pay. They force thousands of
workers out on strike, commit 300 unfair labor practices, and
make even bigger profits. </p>
<p>Caterpillar says it did it to stay &quot;competitive&quot;
with Komatsu. That's not true. </p>
<p>Komatsu is struggling with a global market share below three
percent, while Caterpillar has the lion's share. Know why?
Because the United States government has spent American tax
dollars fronting them into emerging nations in Europe, including
Russia, and helping arrange financing for their operations
through the World Bank! </p>
<p>And how about these stories, right here in Massachusetts:
Boston City Hospital and Boston University Medical Center are
planning to merge so they can save B.C.H. through downsizing.
Last year, the people who come to work every day and take care of
desperately ill patients in these hospitals had to fight like
hell to protect the public mission of these institutions and to
get some protections for the patients and themselves. Yet, for
nine months, they've been kept totally in the dark, awaiting
specific information on the merger, just 82 days from now.
Yesterday, Mayor Menino released his plan, but refused to
guarantee &quot;no layoffs,&quot; or, in fact, job protections. </p>
<p>I guess the workers at N.E.C. Technologies just up the road in
Northboro are a little luckier --- they know they are going to
lose their jobs, 500 of them. The company says it is going to
contract out for desktop computers from a &quot;domestic
source,&quot; but the decision was &quot;driven more by global
market factors&quot; than by business costs in Massachusetts. </p>
<p>When you translate that into English, it means N.E.C. is going
to &quot;outsource&quot; from non-union manufacturers in Georgia,
rather than producing its own computers with full-time, decently-
paid union workers in Massachusetts. </p>
<p>For working families, these are snapshots from hell. They
paint an ugly portrait of an economy that has lost respect for
workers. And the captions are written in clinical terms like
outsourcing, downsizing, right-sizing and contracting-out that
workers now know are code words for &quot;laid off and
out-of-luck.&quot; </p>
<p>And corporate horror stories like these do more than disrupt
the lives of working Americans and their families. They violate
our most basic values -- and tear at the fabric of American life. </p>
<p>People who get up every day, put in a decent day_s work, and
give a lifetime of loyalty to their employers have been treated
like disposable parts or plant equipment, to be trashed and
forgotten. Imagine what they must tell their children when they
come home on the day they've gotten their downsizing notice:
&quot;Your dad worked for the company all his life . . . now,
they've told me to clean out my desk tomorrow.&quot; Imagine how
hard it must be for parents caught in this calamity to tell their
kids that, if they study hard, work hard, and do right by their
companies and their colleagues, the world will do right by them.
Imagine the lesson their kids must really be learning from all
this: that playing by the rules is just for fools. </p>
<p>It is time for Americans to take a look at how corporate
America is downsizing the American dream and say three simple
words: This is wrong. And seven more: We've got to do something
about this. </p>
<p>So what can we do about it? On the most basic level, American
business must change the way it does business. There are still
responsible business people, like Aaron Feuerstein who refused to
move his textile mill out of Methuen, Massachusetts, in search of
cheap labor. Instead, Feuerstein modernized the product line,
keeping the company profitable. </p>
<p>As you all have heard, even when his plant was destroyed by
fire last December, Feuerstein rebuilt it and continued to pay
the 2,400 employees. Hailed as a national hero, he said: &quot;I
haven't really done anything. I don't deserve credit. Corporate
America has made it so that, when you behave the way I did, it's
abnormal.&quot; </p>
<p>President Clinton, Senator Kennedy, and Labor Secretary Reich
are right: America should honor and reward responsible business
people like Aaron Feuerstein. But it takes at least two sides to
make a social compact -- and that is why we are rebuilding and
revitalizing our labor movement. </p>
<p>Here's the truth: The weakness of labor encouraged employers
to take the low road. And only by rebuilding our strength can we
bring American business back to the high road of high wages. </p>
<p>The years when American wages stagnated are the years when our
labor movement declined from 35% to 16% of the total work force
-- and only 11% of the workers in private industry. </p>
<p>To put it bluntly, that is no accident. As part of the
policies that drove down wages, Corporate America and their
allies in Washington did their best to break existing unions and
prevent working people from organizing new ones. </p>
<p>That is why the Reagan Administration broke PATCO and packed
the National Labor Relations Board with sworn enemies of
collective bargaining. That is why Corporate America tried a
whole new tactic -- permanently replacing workers who exercised
their right to strike. And that is why a whole new industry
emerged of attorneys, publicists, and pop psychologists who
advise companies on how to keep out unions. </p>
<p>But it is also true that our labor movement must change. That
is why I ran for President of the AFL-CIO, and that is why I won.
We understand, that while the world and the workplace have
changed, labor stood still and lost ground. Just as I challenge
business to change, every day on my job I challenge labor to
change. </p>
<p>That is why I am asking every union and every level of our
labor movement to do what the fastest-growing unions do: Put at
least 30 percent of our resources into organizing. That is why we
will be training at least a thousand organizers a year, pouring
millions into organizing programs; and organizing from the
sunbelt to the rustbelt and from health care to high tech. </p>
<p>That is why we are rebuilding our grassroots political
strength, training candidates and political organizers, educating
our members and the public on a scale that has Radical Right and
the Chamber of Commerce screaming &quot;foul.&quot;</p>
<p>And that is why unions across the country are changing
themselves, with a view to building more power for working
people. </p>
<p>Last year, the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and
the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union joined
together and formed a new union appropriately called UNITE.
They're pouring $20 million into organizing drives, from the
sweatshops of New York City and Los Angeles to the mill towns of
the South. </p>
<p>On an even larger scale, the <a href="http://www.uaw.org/">United
Auto Workers,</a> United Steelworkers, and International
Association of Machinists have announced plans to merge by the
year 2000 --- and form a two- million-member union. That will
give them the clout to confront global companies, from General
Motors to Boeing. </p>
<p>Working Americans are angry at how they're being treated on
the job. The AFL-CIO has been talking in discussion groups with
working people across the country. </p>
<p>A 50-year-old Cleveland man said: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;My company makes $72 million dollars a year. And
    still they're telling us, &quot;Well, you're overpaid. You
    may have been there for 29 or 30 years. You may have the
    experience. But that doesn't mean a damn thing. We can always
    replace you with somebody else. That's what we hear,&quot; he
    said. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A 39-year-old Georgia woman said: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;It's not like it used to be. Where raises were
    expected. You really have to kill yourself to get
    anything.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stories like these explain why working people nod in agreement
when union representatives -- from leaders like me to the
organizers who leaflet them at plant gates and visit them at
their homes -- say these four simple words: &quot;America needs a
raise.&quot; </p>
<p>And there are also signs that working people in every industry
and every walk of life are turning to unions. Here in the Boston
area, several years ago, the clerical and technical workers at
Harvard, with help from the national union, <a
href="http://www.afscme.org/">AFSCME,</a> organized a union of
their own, won an election, and bargained a trailblazing
contract. </p>
<p>Far away, in Martinsville, Virginia, more than 2,000 workers
at the textile company, Tultex, won a union election and
bargained their first contract. As <a
href="http://www.boston.com/">Boston Globe</a> columnist Bob
Kuttner reported, soon after Tultex signed a contract that raised
workers' wages, several non-union employers in the area also
raised their workers' wages. That's a sign of how a stronger
labor movement can raise living standards and change lives well
beyond our own ranks. </p>
<p>My old union, the <a href="http://www.seiu.org/">Service
Employees,</a> is doing its best to make sure that a rising tide
of unionism lifts all the workers in its industries. In industry
after industry -- building service, nursing homes, and home care
-- the union is conducting national campaigns to organize
workers, raise wages, and improve conditions. </p>
<p>I truly believe that, for all the hurt in this country, this
is the beginning of hopeful times for working Americans, if only
because they have suffered so much that they have no choice but
to fight back. Just as previous generations have done, they will
build new unions, revitalize old ones, and restore the labor
movement. </p>
<p>And, as we rebuild our strength, we will regain the power to
influence corporate policies at the bargaing table and government
policies in the political process. We can build an America with
more Aaron Feuersteins and fewer corporate cut-throats. We can
forge a new social contract where working men and women take
greater responsibility for the quality of the products they make
and the services they provide -- in return for a fair share of
power, profits, and prosperity. </p>
<p>I am reminded of the prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney, who
once wrote these words: &quot;History says don't hope on this
side of the grave. But, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal
wave of justice can rise up -- and hope and history rhyme.&quot; </p>
<p>Soon, in answer to the assault on their jobs and wages,
working men and women will once again &quot;rise up&quot; like
&quot;the longed- for tidal wave of justice.&quot; And we can
make this one of those rare moments when &quot;hope and history
rhyme.&quot; </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h1 align="center">Remarks by John J. Sweeney<br>
President, AFL-CIO<br>
</h1>
<p align="center">Council of Institutional Investors<br>
April 2, 1996 </p>
<h2 align="center">Challenging Chain Saw Management:<br>
A Common Path for Working Americans <br>
and Their Money Managers</h2>
<p align="center">Thank you very much, Bill, for that kind
introduction. Whether marching with Martin Luther King or Nelson
Mandela, or marshaling our pension fund billions, Bill Lucy has
led the labor movement at some of our finest hours, and I am
always honored to share the podium with him. </p>
<p>Let me say what a great pleasure it is to be here with the
people who take seriously the promise of a secure retirement for
America's workers. It's a major responsibility to be a fiduciary
for thousands of people's futures, as I have found in my twenty
years as trustee for the <a href="http://www.seiu.org/">Service
Employees</a> pension funds. Because I know how important the job
you all do is, I have always been particularly proud of the work
of SEIU members like Chuck Valdez and Bill Crist. Chuck and Bill
serve on the board of CALPERS, and are just two of literally
thousands of AFL-CIO union members helping to oversee America's
public and Taft-Hartley pension funds. </p>
<p>I want to take a few minutes of your time here today to bring
you some good news and some bad news, and then to talk about what
we can and should do about both. </p>
<p>First the good news. America's pension funds, and particularly
the organized funds of the Council of Institutional Investors,
are the patient capital our economy needs. Pension fund
investment objectives are measured in decades, not in quarters.
You have to invest your funds in companies that are planning for
the long-term, companies that will make the American economy the
same engine of prosperity for our children and grandchildren it
was for us. </p>
<p>Unlike so many people who play the market, pension funds are
genuine investors. But for too many years long-term investors
were a silent presence in the capital markets. </p>
<p>The Council has changed all that. The Council is creating a
collaborative vision of the future of corporate America -- a
vision that seeks common ground between shareholders and other
corporate constituents in the pursuit of long-term value. </p>
<p>Where that vision can lead was recently displayed in Business
Week's cover story on <a href="http://www.ual.com/">United
Airlines</a>, where workers, managers and investors have together
revitalized a major company to everyone's benefit. Together, they
have shared the rewards of their success. </p>
<p>So the rise of the Council as a forceful advocate for long-
term value is definitely good news. </p>
<p>But the bad news is this: our economy as a whole is headed in
a very different and destructive direction -- one that will
ultimately endanger your funds' ability to meet their
obligations. And some people are even using pension funds' recent
prosperity as an excuse for the path we are taking. </p>
<p>We all know the last few years on Wall Street has been one
long party. It's made the pension board meetings I've attended
more cheery, and I'm sure that's been true for most of you too.
But where is all this expected new value coming from?
Technological change is creating new value, and productivity is
going up -- but it's not being shared with the people who do the
producing. </p>
<p>The truth is that working Americans' paychecks haven't seen
any of the large productivity gains made in American business
since 1980. Meantime, corporate profits were up 64 percent from
1989 to 1995. Executive compensation? Up 360 percent since 1980.
But worker wages and health benefits and pension security are
down. Way down. </p>
<p>Think about the millions of American workers who are running
out of money, running out of options, and running out of hope.
They've exhausted their savings, they're working two and three
jobs, and they're loaded with debt. They see the stock market
soaring and profits roaring and they wonder: &quot;Who the hell
is getting my share?&quot; </p>
<p>Think about the one million additional Americans who lose
health coverage every year . . . forty million total with no
coverage now. They're frustrated and bitter and their anger is
exceeded only by anxiety over losing their jobs. </p>
<p>And can you imagine, in the middle of all this, the Republican
leaders in Congress voting not to consider an increase in the
minimum wage of $4 dollars and 25 cents an hour -- that's less
than $9000 a year -- after five years with no increase? I don't
know if that's more callous or stupid. </p>
<p>Working Americans know an economy that works like this won't
work for long. Last week the AFL-CIO gathered together a group of
working men and women to talk about their lives and their
economic futures, and to a person they told us one thing: an
economy where growth is not shared will soon collapse on itself. </p>
<p>Working people get it. Yet a lot of the run-up in stock prices
seems to be based upon the expectation that our economy is
structurally in a downward wage spiral that will keep putting
more money in investors' pockets forever. The markets seem to
calculate that working people will just keep on producing more
and more for less and less pay. </p>
<p>Well, part of the bad news I have to deliver is that if rising
equity prices reflect expectations of an infinity of falling
wages driving rising profits, then the bull market is exactly
that -- and long-term investors will be the losers when the
bubble bursts. </p>
<p>When the apostles of downsizing and the apologists for the low
wage economy want to shift the blame, they say, &quot;we only do
what we do because the institutional investors make us do
it.&quot; Some have even had the stupidity to say that the very
people they are putting on the unemployment lines are the real
winners from downsizing because of their pension plans. </p>
<p>Well let me assure you, as far as the union pension community
is concerned, we don't believe the downsizing trend is going to
create much sustainable value. And whatever working people gain
through their benefit plans is dwarfed by their losses-- in jobs,
wages, benefits, and security. </p>
<p>Downsizing is a negative sum game. I cannot say this strongly
enough. Chain saw managers like Scott Paper's Al Dunlap have no
mandate from America's union pension funds to destroy the
American middle class. </p>
<p>Rather, my mandate as president of the AFL-CIO is to lead a
reinvigorated labor movement in a great struggle for economic and
social justice. Justice for the 13.1 million members of the AFL-
CIO, and for every working American, and for every American who
wants to work and can't. And the first step to justice is a fair
share of the wealth working Americans create. </p>
<p>By this time some of you must be thinking, justice for workers
means money out of shareholder pockets. And I don't want to
suggest there are never conflicts between workers and
shareholders. But I do want to take most of the rest of my time
today to talk about a few steps workers and shareholders can take
together on a path toward a healthier corporate economy that can
generate long-term value for all of us. </p>
<p>Think for a moment how far we have come since the mid-1980s.
In those days, the capital markets were an arena of struggle
between entrenched, self-interested managers on one side and
short-term-focused financial buyers and arbitragers on the other.
Ten years ago words like proxies and independent directors had
not entered the corporate governance dictionary. No public or
union pension fund had ever filed a shareholder proposal. The
notion that a corporate CEO would return the phone call, let
alone meet with pension fund representatives, was unthinkable.
Some funds were uncritical supporters of existing management,
often under pressure from their plan sponsors. Others funded LBO
funds and junk bond entrepreneurs that ended up destabilizing the
entire American financial system. </p>
<p>In this difficult environment, institutional investors with a
long-term perspective came together in the Council to forge our
own independent, long-term perspective. These investors favored
neither the short term-ism of the corporate raiders, nor the
complacency of entrenched managers. It was natural, then, that
the Council, through the bold leadership of the public pension
funds, was the driving force in the transition from corporate
governance by hostile takeover . . . to proxy contests over
specific governance issues . . . to efforts at developing
sustained, productive relationships with company managers. . </p>
<p>America's union-affiliated pension funds, jointly governed by
labor and management under the Taft-Hartley Act, brought a unique
perspective to the Council. Union funds and their worker trustees
see companies differently than other outsider investment
analysts. Our experiences inside the companies we invest in lead
us to see long-term mutually beneficial economic cooperation
among shareholders and other corporate constituencies as the
source of value. I should note that this perspective lies at the
heart of our skepticism about downsizing's effect on value. </p>
<p>In the second wave of shareholder activism that followed the
public funds' initiatives of the late 1980's, this Taft-Hartley
perspective has been critical in helping the institutional
investor community as a whole find its own voice. </p>
<p>Just last year, we saw a number of major initiatives that grew
out of Council members sharing perspectives and strategies:
During the last proxy season, Taft-Hartley funds affiliated with
the AFL-CIO sponsored 43 resolutions addressing corporate
governance issues in America's major companies, including leading
the opposition to excessive executive compensation and urging
executive evaluation policies that protect shareholder interests. </p>
<p>During the past year, CALPERS has launched The Workplace
Practices Survey initiative-- aimed directly at encouraging
corporations to add value for shareholders by developing human
capital. </p>
<p>Finally, in what may be its finest hour thus far, during 1995
the Council led Chrysler's shareholder community in opposing Kirk
Kerkorian's destructive efforts to loot the company's working
capital. The Council's leadership preserved value for
shareholders and workers alike. </p>
<p>I have been talking about a common path to long term value.
The next step on that path is clear. If we are serious about
advocating long-term value, we must ask the management of the
companies we invest in to join us and pursue a partnership with
their workforce as a whole -- a partnership based on mutual
respect, cooperation and mutual gain. </p>
<p>We must work together to reform corporations like Archer
Daniels Midland. At ADM, a business philosophy of bad corporate
citizenship risks dissipating shareholder value in a tangle of
regulatory, legal, and workplace problems. </p>
<p>More generally, we must challenge directly the two most
salient trends in corporate life today. One I have already
mentioned -- destructive downsizing. The other is the widening
gap between the pay of a handful of the very top executives in
the companies we own and everyone else in American society. </p>
<p>First let me say a few more words about downsizing.
Destructive downsizing is about breaking a critical covenant
between shareholders and other corporate constituencies -- a
covenant necessary for complex corporations to generate value. </p>
<p>Once, companies and workers had an understanding that goes
like this: workers invest in company-specific skills early in
their career in return for long-term employment. </p>
<p>The company that downsizes fires workers after having
benefitted from those skills. The company may get a one-time
gain, but no rational worker will ever invest in the firm-
specific skills that company needs again. Where does that leave
the stockholder in a company like AT&amp;T today? What are the
scientists at Bell Labs doing now -- are they spending their late
nights creating value for shareholders or keeping their resume up
to date? The rational worker's response to the shredding of that
understanding is what we in the unions call work to rule-- do the
minimum and use your brain to help yourself, not your firm.
Downsizing is a business strategy that encourages work to rule.
That's one reason downsizing destroys value. </p>
<p>There's a second reason. Destructive downsizing is also about
cutting corporate activities and resources that are vital to
long-term profitability, so that costs that are cut in one part
of the income statement end up either reappearing as larger costs
elsewhere or are more than counterbalanced by lost revenues. I
suspect the Kimberly Clark shareholders who recently paid $6.8
billion for a gutted Scott Paper are about to find out how costly
destructive downsizing can be. </p>
<p>That brings me to the second big dangerous trend in corporate
life today. Just as destructive downsizing tears at the covenant
between constituencies that is at the heart of the corporation,
so too does the orgy of greed in the executive suite --
especially in a time of often difficult technological and
organizational change. </p>
<p>Thanks to the Council's work with Graef Crystal, we all know
the extent of the problem of excessive pay to mediocre
executives. Corporate boards dominated by cronies of the CEO
award a mediocre executive multi-million dollar pay packages
while the company's stock stagnates and the firm lays off
workers. Then the board members are rewarded with generous fees,
pensions, consulting contracts, legal fees and so forth. </p>
<p>CEOs should be paid for performance. But how do we measure
performance, and how much should we pay for performance? CEO
performance-based pay should be based on three principles. </p>
<p>First, executive compensation should be based on long-term,
sustainable value creation, not short term stock market
manipulation. </p>
<p>Second, compensation should be actively managed by an alert
board. Mechanical, stock option-based compensation can have
hidden, perverse incentives. Any mechanical system encourages
manipulation and allows the board of directors to avoid genuinely
monitoring what the CEO is doing. </p>
<p>Finally, CEOs should be paid no more than necessary to attract
and retain capable people. Extraordinary people are available to
work for $1 million a year. I see no reason to pay over hyped
mediocrities like Al Dunlap one hundred times that. </p>
<p>Excessive pay creates a divisive corporate culture. It signals
frontline workers that excellence is only demanded from those
without the power to protect themselves from meaningful
evaluation. In an era of downsizing, when CEO pay goes from 41
times the average workers' pay in 1980 to 149 times in 1993,
what's the message? </p>
<p>Is the company a cooperative enterprise built on teamwork, or
a treacherous arena of struggle governed by the motto
&quot;everyone for themselves, and the devil take the
hindmost&quot;? </p>
<p>The boards that okay excessive pay are destroying value. They
are overpaying for managerial expertise and they are eroding any
basis for a partnership between shareholders, senior managers,
and the employees who do the work that makes companies valuable.
In response, the Taft-Hartley community and the unions of the
AFL-CIO have taken significant steps in the direction of board
reform in recent years. </p>
<p>Funds affiliated with the <a href="http://www.teamster.org/">Teamsters</a>
and UNITE are running former Arnold and Porter partner and
current Northwest Airlines trustee Steve Hester for the K-Mart
board, a company that has suffered from years of complacent
management. In the steel industry, the United Steel Workers have
negotiated long-term contracts with the major industry players
that have put people like former Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall
on steel company boards and aligned worker and shareholder
interests in company performance. Most recently, the Teamsters
have released a report on America' Least Valuable Directors that
we all should find interesting proxy season reading. </p>
<p>Now is the time for the Council to realize the opportunities
created by these reform efforts. Now is the time to seek
substantive changes that will renew the partnerships every
corporation depends on to create value for shareholders. </p>
<p>In closing, let me say a word about what I see as the major
challenge confronting every person in this room. </p>
<p>Over the past decade, the Council has become a powerful voice
for long-term value. Now that voice must be heard above the roar
of the short-termers. The Council must be a voice for a corporate
economy of productive partnerships. An economy of good corporate
citizens. An economy that can reach out to enfold all Americans
in an embrace of prosperity. Only such an economy, an economy
free from fear, can sustain the long-run profitability pension
funds require. </p>
<p>As President of the AFL-CIO, I intend to lead the American
labor movement in a fight on behalf of all working people to
reaffirm the social compact that made America great -- the
promise that prosperity will mean growing together, not apart. As
a trustee, I know that only a corporate economy founded on
equitable prosperity can create value for investors over the
long-run. </p>
<p>Some politicians and business leaders today point us toward an
atomized, divided society, a war of all against all. They offer a
world where security belongs to those who can buy it. Where hard
work and loyalty are merely weaknesses to be exploited by the
agile and well-connected. Where the only hope offered to the
downsized is the chance to hate those even less well off. </p>
<p>America's unions offer a different vision. We seek positive
change. But we demand that both the costs and benefits of change
are equally shared. We believe economic growth cannot be
sustained without rewarding working people's efforts with
something more than a pink slip. And we believe that only when
working people of every race, religion, gender and nationality
stand together can America move forward. </p>
<p>By helping millions of Americans enjoy a financially secure
retirement, all of you help make that vision a reality every day.
Our challenge today is to move forward and build on your daily
achievement. To meet that challenge, the Council and the larger
community of institutional investors must ask companies to forge
partnerships -- partnerships between shareholders, managers,
employees, communities and other constituencies that make
profitable corporations possible. </p>
<p>The union pension community and I look forward to
participating in the Council's efforts to meet that challenge, so
that together we can help shape an economy we can all be proud
of. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h4 align=center>Remarks by John J. Sweeney, President<br>
AFL-CIO<br>
</h4>
<h3 align=center>Older Women's League<br>
Washington, D.C. </h3>
<p>March 12, 1996 </p>
<p>Thank you very much. </p>
<p>And to all my friends from OWL, let me tell you how grateful I am to be honored by a group that I 
have admired and supported for so many years... </p>
<p>and that I know is deeply committed to promoting the welfare and dignity of all members of 
society. </p>
<p>A good friend of working people, the late Hubert Humphrey, said, &quot;The moral test of government is 
how it treats those who are in the dawn of life -- the children... </p>
<p>... those who are in the twilight of life -- the aged... </p>
<p>---and those who are in the shadows of life -- the sick, the needy, and the handicapped.&quot; </p>
<p>OWL is an organization that has worked tirelessly to hold our government to this moral standard in 
its relationship with midlife and older women. </p>
<p>And you have fought for the principle that the quality of service that older Americans receive -- 
particularly health care -- is closely linked to the quality of work life of those who provide that care. </p>
<p>We in the trade union movement share your values. </p>
<p>We, like you, are trying to build a society that is more equal, more fair, more humane. </p>
<p>We, like you, work for a society in which everyone has a right to a decent job, a secure retirement, 
the necessities of life, and basic human dignity. </p>
<p>Let me suggest that there is no institution in our society that does more to build women's economic 
security than the labor movement. </p>
<p>It is dedicated to serving the interests of millions of women -- and men -- who teach our kids, sew 
our clothes, build our houses, and take care of us when we are sick. </p>
<p>I'd like you to meet two people who represent our movement at its very best. </p>
<p>Helen Smith works at Elmwood Geriatric Village in Detroit, which is part of the Bortz chain of 
nursing homes -- and she's a steward in Local 79 of the Service Employees International Union. </p>
<p>Helen helped lead the campaign for a union contract for Bortz employees. </p>
<p>They won. </p>
<p>The result is they now have health insurance -- they have pension benefits through the union -- and 
they set the pattern for wages in nursing homes throughout Michigan. </p>
<p>Helen Miller is a home care worker for the Department of Aging and the Department of 
Rehabilitative Services in Illinois. </p>
<p>She helped organize home care workers into Local 880 of the Service Employees, and she now 
serves her local as Vice-President. </p>
<p>She has led fights for better wages and benefits for over 10,000 workers in Illinois, often against 
tremendous odds -- and I can assure you that they never would have gotten those wages and 
benefits without the dedication and tenacity of Helen Miller and many others just like her. </p>
<p>Helen Smith and Helen Miller are what the labor movement is all about. </p>
<p>They are the movement. </p>
<p>I'd like to ask each of them to say a few words. </p>
<p><strong>[AFTER SMITH AND MILLER:]</strong> </p>
<p>Thank you, Helen Smith and Helen Miller. </p>
<p>I am delighted to receive the OWL Leadership Award. </p>
<p>But I know who the real recipients are. </p>
<p>The award actually belongs to my union sisters and brothers -- to Helen Miller, Helen Smith, and 
the 13 million working people who make up the AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>On their behalf, I thank each of you for this honor.</p>

<h3 align="center">Remarks by AFL-CIO<br>
Secretary-Treasurer<br>
RICHARD TRUMKA<br>
to the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO<br>
</h3>
<h4 align="center">Philadelphia, PA * March 5, 1996</h4>
<p>Thank you, Billy, for that fine introduction. </p>
<p>You know, friendship is something that money just can't buy
and Billy has stood by me through thick and thin for so many
years. </p>
<p>When the miners squared off against the coal companies and
their police and their judges during the Pittston battle, and
again during the 1993 BCOA strike, boy, was I glad to have Billy
George in my corner. </p>
<p>He is a dear friend and a brother in the struggle. </p>
<p>I want to thank all of you for this invitation to come
&quot;home&quot; to my native Pennsylvania in my capacity as
Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>It was here, in a small coal patch town called Nemacolin,
where I was born and grew up. </p>
<p>It was there I learned the value of hard work. </p>
<p>I learned that the best social program is a job, where a
person can earn a living wage in order to feed and clothe and
house his or her kids. </p>
<p>I learned how working men and women weren't about to get a leg
up and be able to build better lives for themselves and their
families unless they joined together in a union. </p>
<p>And today, brothers and sisters, I am pleased to have the
opportunity to speak with you about the new day that's dawning
for the American labor movement. </p>
<p>Just after I was elected Secretary-Treasurer, with John
Sweeney as President, and Linda Chavez-Thompson as Executive
Vice-President, House Speaker Newt Gingrich let it be known that
he was none too happy. </p>
<p>He told a bunch of Wall Street executives that the new
leadership was -- and I quote -- &quot;potentially a
disaster.&quot; </p>
<p>He continued by saying &quot;We do not need a more
confrontational, more hostile, more divisive union leadership. We
need a union leadership that understands the world market&quot;
and works to &quot;improve the work ethic&quot; and &quot;the
efficiency of labor.&quot; </p>
<p>In other words, Newt Gingrich wanted a union movement that
would roll over and play dead while he and his minions continued
their dastardly work of diminishing opportunities for working
people and their families. </p>
<p>In your dreams, Mr. Gingrich, in your dreams. </p>
<p>What he got instead was a new AFL-CIO, determined to stand up
to every employer, every politician, every special interest who,
if given half a chance, will rob us of our dignity, our security,
our respect, and our power. </p>
<p>Our message to Newt Gingrich and to every employer, whether
public sector or private sector, is that the era of
union-busting, contract-trashing, and strikebreaking is over,
period. </p>
<p>When they push us, we push back. It's as simple as that. </p>
<p>This comeback of ours arrives just in the nick of time. The
assault on the rights and the living standards of American
working men and women is in full swing. </p>
<p>People are angry when they see productivity, profits, and the
stock market going up, while they watch their own incomes stay
the same or decline. </p>
<p>People are angry at the lack of respect given to working men
and women and their families by employers, by public officials,
and by the news media. </p>
<p>People are angry with an economic policy that disinvests in
workers here at home while aiding and abetting the export of good
American jobs to low-wage countries that forcibly deny their
workers the right to organize. </p>
<p>Working men and women want jobs that will enable them to put
food on the table and afford a decent roof over their heads. </p>
<p>They want a world of opportunity for their kids and a chance
to build for security in old age. </p>
<p>They want access to quality health care at reasonable cost.
They want a safe workplace and a decent environment. </p>
<p>Instead, American workers are being outsourced, downsized,
subcontacted and permanently replaced. </p>
<p>The other day I was reading about Robert E. Allen. </p>
<p>Mr. Allen is the chairman of AT&amp;T Corporation, who in
January announced layoffs and restructuring that will cost nearly
50,000 of his employees their jobs. </p>
<p>Last year -- a year in which AT&amp;T said they made next to
no profit -- Mr. Allen received $16 million in compensation, more
than double the $6.3 million he received in 1994. </p>
<p>Working men and women see companies merge and workers get laid
off. </p>
<p>They see stock prices skyrocket and CEOS getting big bonuses. </p>
<p>Chief executives all over are turning in lackluster
performances and eliminating jobs and being well paid for their
work. </p>
<p>Something is wrong with this picture. </p>
<p>Thomas D. O'Malley, the CEO of Tosco Corporation, is another
case in point. Bob Wages of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
told me that Mr. O'Malley bought up another oil refinery, this
time in Delaware County. </p>
<p>He refused to talk contract with his workers and shut down the
plant in retribution. </p>
<p>In doing so, he's shorted the retail market by 200,000 barrels
and pocketed an extra $20 million in profits. </p>
<p>Now, he says he'll reopen the refinery if the taxpayers ante
up $60 million in restart costs. </p>
<p>What a sweetheart. </p>
<p>Between 1993 and 1996, Fortune 500 companies have eliminated
300,000 jobs. </p>
<p>For the most part, these are not layoffs, forced on a company
because business is bad. </p>
<p>These downsizings are occurring at a time, according to
Business Week magazine, when corporate profits are the highest
they've been in 45 years. </p>
<p>Executive compensation is growing. </p>
<p>Corporate profits are booming. </p>
<p>Every time a company announces another downsizing, they pop
the champagne corks on Wall Street. </p>
<p>Bad news for workers is good news for stockbrokers and bond
traders. </p>
<p>Whose boat is stuck on the bottom during this rising tide? </p>
<p>You guessed it -- yours and mine. </p>
<p>According to the Labor Department, the rise in the cost of
labor during 1995 was the lowest ever recorded. And it isn't just
affecting blue collar workers, but also white collar employees. </p>
<p>It isn't just line workers, but also technicals who are taking
a hit.It isn't just less skilled workers hitting the streets, but
also highly trained employees. </p>
<p>To quote Business Week: &quot;All but the most elite employees
have landed in the same leaky boat.&quot; </p>
<p>Since 1979, the productivity of American workers went up by 24
percent. </p>
<p>Real earnings for workers, however, declined by 12 percent. </p>
<p>Increases in productivity should have given us a substantial
increase in buying power. Instead that productivity gain was
converted into corporate profits -- which are up 64 percent in
the last six years -- and executive compensation -- up 360
percent since 1980. </p>
<p>The rich are getting richer, the poor are falling further
behind and the middle class is treading water, with more family
members working longer and harder just to try to stay even. </p>
<p>Working families have little money to spend, lots of bills to
pay, and damn little time to spend with their kids. </p>
<p>How do we turn this around? We organize, we mobilize, and we
take this country back for working men and women! </p>
<p>The Republican majority in Congress was hellbent on cutting
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- our safety net for
retired folks and for poor families. </p>
<p>We stopped them. </p>
<p>They want to abolish the 40-hour week so that employers won't
have to pay out so much overtime. </p>
<p>We are stopping them. </p>
<p>They want to make it legal for businesses to establish phony
&quot;company unions.&quot; </p>
<p>We are stopping them. </p>
<p>They wanted to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, which requires that
decent wages be paid on federal construction projects. </p>
<p>We stopped them. </p>
<p>They want to cut billions of dollars in the college loan and
work study programs, making it even more difficult for working
families to make sure their kids get a college education. </p>
<p>So far, we've stopped them. </p>
<p>A headline in the Washington Post said it best. </p>
<p>It read: &quot;The Battle That Business Lost: Its Legislative
Agenda Was Crushed in '95 and Unions Have Mobilized for a '96
Repeat.&quot; </p>
<p>Despite Republican majorities in the House and the Senate --
bought and paid for by big business -- we beat back the agenda
big business was just sure they would win. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO conducted the most aggressive grassroots lobbying
campaign in our history against the Republicans &quot;Contract
with America.&quot; </p>
<p>Over the past six months, we've spent millions of dollars in
radio and television advertising in key districts. </p>
<p>We've sent out over two million pieces of literature in the
mail to our members and coordinated hundreds of demonstrations
and visits to members of Congress. </p>
<p>We generated over 400,000 phone calls to Senators and
Representatives about their votes on issues effecting working
families. </p>
<p>But that's just one part of our counterattack. </p>
<p>Already this year, we've won three big contract victories --
for 35,000 building service workers in New York City, 35,000
Boeing machinists, and 35,000 CWA workers at Bell Atlantic. </p>
<p>Starting this month, the AFL-CIO will kick off our
&quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; campaign with high-visibility
&quot;town hall&quot; meetings in 29 cities coast-to-coast. </p>
<p>We'll be asking workers and their families to tell their
stories about the effect that stagnant wages have on their
abilities to raise themselves up and grab a piece of the American
dream. </p>
<p>Last November, labor played the key role in electing a
pro-labor governor in Kentucky. </p>
<p>I spoke to rallies of thousands in the critical closing days
of the contest and we won a stunning victory. </p>
<p>Then, in January, we took a Senate seat away from the
Republicans in Oregon, the first time a pro-labor candidate and
Democrat won a Senate seat there since 1962. </p>
<p>Senator Ron Wyden won because he was the labor candidate. </p>
<p>He walked our picket lines, toured plants with our stewards,
and spoke to the issues that concerned working people. </p>
<p>We asked him to run with the union label and he put it right
there on his lapel. He didn't hide it away in his pocket. </p>
<p>We shifted our labor political machinery into high gear and
won a decisive victory over a reactionary, rightwing billionaire. </p>
<p>As we continue to battle the big business agenda in Congress,
we will also lay the groundwork to elect in 1996 a Congress that
listens to the voices of working people. </p>
<p>We need a Congress that will act to strengthen opportunities
for working men and women and advance a level playing field so
that we have a fighting chance to organize the unorganized. </p>
<p>We intend to build a vast grassroots network, anchored by at
least 100 labor activists in every congressional district. </p>
<p>We will register voters and talk about the issues critical to
working people. We will mobilize our members and others in
support of candidates who stand with us on working family issues. </p>
<p>At the same time, we will be rebuilding a base of working
families who can hold public officials accountable -- next year
and for years to come. </p>
<p>Finally, we must put special emphasis on organizing. </p>
<p>We must and will provide leadership, coordination, and support
for a movement-wide effort to return unions to a dominant role in
improving the lives of all Americans. </p>
<p>We will increase our spending on organizing and work with you
to enhance your organizing efforts and capabilities. </p>
<p>We will recruit and train a new generation of organizers
through our Organizing Institute. Our &quot;Union Summer&quot;
project will deploy 1,000 college and rank-andfile youth to work
in union organizing drives around the country. Enthusiasm is very
high, I can tell you. </p>
<p>We will raise the visibility and public profile of unions so
that folks can more clearly see how we are vehicles for improving
the jobs, working conditions, and lives of American families. </p>
<p>People should know that labor's victories are America's
victories. </p>
<p>Just recently, UNITE, our newly-formed union of textile and
clothing workers, won a contract -- and a raise -- for 2,300
workers in Martinsville, West Virginia. </p>
<p>Before long, 10,000 non-union textile workers in the area had
themselves a raise, too.<br>
A coincidence? I don't think so. </p>
<p>These are the kinds of stories Americans need to hear a whole
lot more about. </p>
<p>All of you are on the frontlines of this historic battle. Our
state federations are vital in the effort to build this new
AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>The dreams and the aspirations and the progress of
Pennsylvania's working men and women rely on your power. I am
talking about power on the shop floor and power on the picket
line, power in the media and power at the polling place. </p>
<p>In this critical political year, I ask you to join hands with
me in building a labor movement that will reach out and win over
young workers and women workers, African Americans, Latinos, and
Asians. We must take our message to people who live in the cities
and the suburbs, and in our small towns. </p>
<p>We have something important to say to all working people who
are angry and frustrated and looking for the energy and the
leadership we can provide. </p>
<p>We will build a lean, mean political fighting machine able to
take on and defeat politicians who turn their backs on working
men and women and their unions. </p>
<p>We do so because we know that politics isn't just about
campaigns and rallies, contributions, and get-out-the vote. </p>
<p>Politics determines whether we have an economic policy that
works for working Americans, rather than mostly for the rich and
powerful. </p>
<p>Politics determines the kind of schools our kids will attend
and whether the streets and playgrounds they play in will be as
safe and secure as they ought to be. </p>
<p>Politics determines whether our brothers and sisters will have
a fair chance to organize themselves into unions and bargain for
decent wages and safe working conditions. </p>
<p>Union folk understand the word &quot;solidarity&quot; pretty
well. </p>
<p>It means we are all in this together, this bold and historic
effort to build an America where all working people have a future
for themselves, for their kids and for their communities. </p>
<p>This is the kind of union movement that America needs and
deserves. </p>
<p>Out of our diversity and the many different roads we've
travelled, comes unity and strength and determination. </p>
<p>In the words of the old labor hymn: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;It is we who plowed the prairies, built the cities
    where they trade, dug the mines and built the workshops,
    endless miles of railroad laid...&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this country belongs to us, not to the Newt
Gingrichs and the Robert Allens and the Rush Limbaughs. </p>
<p>It's high time we took it back. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<pre>                       Remarks by John J. Sweeney
                        President of the AFL-CIO
</pre>
<h3 align=center>Rainbow Coalition Labor Breakfast Chicago March 1, 1996 </h3>
<p>Thank you, Rev. Jackson, for those very kind words and for inviting me to be with you here this 
morning. I bring you greetings from Rich Trumka and Linda Chavez-Thompson, the other members 
of our &quot;New Voice for American Workers&quot; team. They said to tell you they still think you are the 
&quot;true voice&quot; for all Americans, workers or otherwise! </p>
<p>As for me, you can call me &quot;new,&quot; you can call me &quot;true,&quot; but you cannot call me &quot;blue,&quot; because I 
am happy to report that I escaped unharmed from a fender bender on my way in from the airport. </p>
<p>The cab I was in was pulling away from the curb, and we nicked the fender of a long, white 
limousine that was parked in front of us. I got out to investigate, only to discover that it belonged to 
Mayor Daley. </p>
<p>Being from New York, I know how to handle such things, so I told the cab driver not to worry and 
I wrote a note and left it on the windshield. </p>
<p>The note said: &quot;Dear Mayor Daley, I'm sorry we caught your fender, but I'm late for a big meeting 
downtown and I don't have time to stop. Please have your office call my office and get the number 
of my insurance company and we'll get this thing settled.&quot; </p>
<p>And I signed the note, &quot;Jesse Jackson .........&quot; </p>
<p>I've been told that I am the first president of the AFL-CIO to ever address a formal event of the 
&quot;Rainbow Coalition.&quot; Well, when I got the invitation, I accepted immediately because Jesse 
Jackson always accepted my invitations to speak to my union, the Service Employees Union. 
Jesse, you have always been there for us any time working Americans and their families are in 
trouble. And union members from San Francisco to Seattle to New York to Detroit know that 
when Jesse Jackson hits town, the BOSS is gonna go down! </p>
<p>So I thank you and this great organization for your support and I want you to know that as long as 
I am president of our federation, the AFL-CIO will &quot;be there&quot; for you. </p>
<p>Serving as president of the AFL-CIO is pretty rarified air for the son of Irish immigrants who came 
to this country not too many years ago hoping for just a small slice of the American dream. My 
father was a New York City bus driver, a member of the Transport Workers Union, and my 
earliest memories were of going to union meetings with him and listening to Mike Quill explain in his 
thick brogue the harsh realities of pocketbook economics. </p>
<p>Those were still the days of &quot;No Irish Need Apply,&quot; and times were tough. But you knew that, if 
you worked hard and had a union, you could earn more money and live a better life, maybe send 
your kids to college, buy a small home. </p>
<p>Employers knew that if they paid their workers fairly and plowed a little of their profits back into 
their communities they could count on employee loyalty and healthy consumer spending --- which 
has always made up two-thirds of our economy. And they knew that if they didn't treat those 
workers fairly, there would be an accounting at the hands of their union. </p>
<p>Even though there were often bumps along the way, we had what we called a &quot;social compact&quot; 
between labor, business, government and the communities in which we lived. </p>
<p>President Kennedy found a simple but eloquent way to describe this successful social and 
economic compact: &quot;A rising tide lifts all boats.&quot; </p>
<p>When things were good -- as they were for almost 30 years after the end of World War II -- most 
of us prospered because we prospered together. We were concerned with raising the standard of 
living for working Americans, not just accumulating enormous wealth for a fortunate few. When 
things broke down, we fixed them -- together. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, those days are gone. Today, there are no rules. The only rule for employers is that 
you take what you can get away with. </p>
<p>American business decided the best way to compete in the global economy was by driving down 
labor costs. Not by innovation, not by Yankee ingenuity, not through labor-management 
cooperation, and not by insisting on international social standards and rights for workers. But by 
squeezing the last possible ounce of productivity out of American workers, and then throwing them 
on the scrap-heap of unemployment or old age with reduced pensions and health insurance 
coverage. </p>
<p>Since 1979, all of the income growth in our country has gone to the top 40 percent of households 
-- and nearly all of that went to the top 20 percent. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, corporate profits are up, up, UP. In fact, according to Business Week, they're at a 
45-year high. The stock market is up. Productivity is up -- it has been since the late 1970's -- and 
it's way out front of compensation. </p>
<p>This past year, workers' wages and benefits increased only 2.8 percent -- the lowest since 1981 -- 
while productivity was up 3.4 percent. </p>
<p>Twenty years of declining wages and disappearing benefits are taking their toll on American life. 
There's a free-floating anger among hardworking people for whom the American dream is turning 
into a nightmare of unpaid bills and unfulfilled aspirations. Increasingly, American workers are down 
on their government, down on their employers, and down on their future. American workers are 
running out of money and running out of hope. </p>
<p>And what of those American workers who never really shared in the prosperity in the first place? 
The women and minorities who couldn't ride a rising tide because they didn't even have a boat? 
Now comes American business and American politicians to declare that affirmative action -- the 
one vehicle women and minorities can use for improving their living standard -- is somehow 
un-American. And they want to destroy the safety nets for those who have been totally left behind 
--- the young, the old, the poor and the disabled who depend on Medicare, Medicaid, Social 
Security, and AFDC just to SURVIVE. All in the name of supposedly &quot;balancing the budget.&quot; </p>
<p>Writing in the New York Times last year, Lou Uchitelle gave voice to the plight of lower- and 
middle-income families. &quot;Something is wrong with America's economic boom,&quot; he wrote. &quot;After 
four years of ever-stronger growth . . . people's wages should be going up faster than their 
expenses. For most people, they're not, and this is the first time in decades that a recovery has 
gone so long without putting more money in more pockets. And now, if the recovery runs out of 
steam in 1995, as so many economists predict, that money might never show up.&quot; </p>
<p>Our problem is stagnant wages -- America needs a raise. And I think the solution is a larger, 
stronger, smarter labor movement and a revived civil rights movement. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO is going to do its part by rebuilding our labor movement, by pouring vast resources 
into organizing from the Sun Belt to the Rust Belt and from software-writers to sweatshop workers. 
Our message to American workers is simple but powerful: Whether you wear a blue collar, a white 
collar, a new collar, or no collar, we can help you make your job better. We're going to be 
stronger and we are going take it to greedy employers who've been picking our pockets and then 
trying to tell us we stupidly lost our wallets. </p>
<p>We're also going to reclaim our political power and use it to reclaim our country. Last month, we 
wrote the first chapter in a new book on electoral politics with a remarkable Senate victory in 
Oregon. Ron Wyden was more than just the first Democrat to win statewide office in Oregon in 
more than 30 years, he was an up-front, out-front LABOR candidate. </p>
<p>Ron Wyden won because we poured money and people into his campaign and because he listened 
to our advice. He won because he walked picket lines, toured plants with union leaders and made 
hundreds of phone calls to union members. </p>
<p>We asked him to run with the union label and he wore it on the outside of his lapel, not hidden in his 
pocket. We promised him that if he campaigned on the core issues of working families, we would 
boot him home. And he responded by booting a buckraking billionaire businessman right in his...... 
bank account! </p>
<p>That's the way we are going to take back the House of Representatives and take back our country 
this fall --- by supporting candidates who say, &quot;I am proud to carry the banner of working 
Americans .... I am proud to stand up for America's working families .... and I am proud to be 
UNION.&quot; </p>
<p>I don't need to tell you that this is perhaps the most critical election year in the long history of our 
great movement. Last year, we let the reactionary, anti-worker forces in this country slip up on us 
and the result is that we've been fighting for our lives ever since. </p>
<p>We've survived, but just barely. We started out by getting an ironclad commitment from President 
Clinton to veto any bill that damaged Davis-Bacon or the Service Contract Act and he has lived up 
to that commitment. But we've had to fight like hell during the budget battle that still continues. We 
spent $7 million dollars on television advertising in the districts of the radical, right-wing followers of 
Newt Gingrich. We poured direct mail into those same districts. And we generated over 500,000 
telephone calls to members of Congress carrying our core message: &quot;no cuts in Medicare, college 
loans, or worker protections to pay for a tax cut for the rich.&quot; </p>
<p>We ended up the current round by forcing the Republicans to back off and end the government 
shutdown. And we got virtually full funding for the National Labor Relations Board, at least through 
March 15th. But right now, we're getting hit hard where it hurts. OSHA's budget has been cut 22 
percent and agencies like the EPA have been cut 30 percent. They are proceeding to throw all the 
programs for poor children into block grants that will be given with no strings attached to the states 
to administer. The safety net we've worked so hard to weave over the past 50 years isn't just 
coming unravelled, it is being ripped to shreds by greedy corporations and Wall Street wizards who 
want to strip away all protections for workers, destroy the union movement as we know it, and tell 
the old, the young, the poor and the disabled to go straight to their graves. </p>
<p>I don't want to live in a country like that. That's why I announced at our first AFL-CIO Executive 
Council meeting that we are going to spend $35 million dollars on politics this year --- more than 
three times what we've ever spent. We are proceeding with plans to establish our new national 
political institute, which is charged with recruiting and training political organizers, campaign 
managers and candidates. </p>
<p>We're going to lay the groundwork for political success with an initiative called &quot;America Needs a 
Raise,&quot; holding &quot;town hall&quot; meetings in 29 cities over the next three months to show how workers 
and their families are suffering because of the wage and wealth gap, and to educate our members, 
the media and the public. </p>
<p>In June, we'll continue a high public profile with &quot;Union Summer.&quot; Our goal is to recruit and deploy 
1,000 young workers and college students into organizing and political campaigns around the 
country during June, July and August. Recruiting is already underway and we're getting a terrific 
feedback. </p>
<p>Then we're going to have a &quot;Union Fall&quot; as we regain control of our government. We will 
concentrate on up to 75 House districts, primarily where freshmen Republicans are vulnerable, and 
we will support candidates who will carry the banner of working Americans. </p>
<p>In addition, we will establish a core of at least 100 union activists in every congressional district in 
the country to carry us through this election and then become a permanent and powerful network 
for grassroots lobbying. We have to have more members involved in political action, we have to 
educate more members and we have to get more members to the polls --- it's as simple as that. </p>
<p>If we don't, we're going to see working Americans --- our members and our potential members --- 
slipping away to the likes of Steve Forbes, Ross Perot and Patrick Buchanan --- right-wing 
politicians who use populist appeals to tap into the frustrations and fears of working class people. I 
remember the last time that happened. The candidate's name was George Wallace. I remember 
that the AFL-CIO was largely silent on Wallace, because our leaders felt we might even alienate 
our members if we took him on, and he gained influence and power because of our silence. </p>
<p>That's why I decided two weeks ago to publicly respond to candidate Buchanan by saying, &quot;He is 
a racist, he's anti-semitic, he bashes women right along with labor and immigrants and he's a 
believer in supply-side economics.&quot; I wanted working people to know that candidate Buchanan has 
come very late to the issue of declining worker incomes in the midst of economic plenty and that he 
is against the minimum wage, against wage standards, against worker health and safety protections, 
and against the right of workers to freely join and form unions. </p>
<p>Likewise, I want working Americans to know that the &quot;budget battle&quot; in Washington isn't a fight 
about dollars --- we have plenty of those. It's a fight about who gets those dollars. It isn't a fight 
about government downsizing and returning power to the states, it's about a return to state's rights. 
Well, state's rights held working men and women in this country in VIRTUAL captivity for 200 
years while black men and women were being held in ABSOLUTE captivity. And it's time for us to 
tell our elected officials that as long as there is breath left in our bodies we will not go back. We will 
not return to those awful days in our history. </p>
<p>Finally, I want you to know the fight about affirmative action is more than a struggle to sustain a 
program that has put billions of richly-deserved dollars into the pockets of women and minorities 
who have been systematically cheated out of decent wages. </p>
<p>It's about whether the federal government should play a role in setting wage standards to protect 
workers from the unbridled greed of monopolistic multi-national employers. If affirmative action 
goes down, Davis-Bacon and the Service Contract Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act and the 
minimum wage will soon follow and it is time for us to tell our elected officials that as long as there 
is a breath in our bodies, we will not allow that to happen. </p>
<p>Thank you very much .....</p>

<h3 align="center">Statement by John J. Sweeney<br>
President of the AFL-CIO<br>
AFL-CIO Executive Council Meeting </h3>
<h4 align="center">Bal Harbour, Fla.<br>
February 21, 1996 </h4>
<p>JOHN SWEENEY: I know the New Hampshire primary results are a
big topic today, so I thought I'd start by sharing the statement
I made to the Executive Council this morning: </p>
<p>Quote: the media will be asking, &quot;Isn't Patrick Buchanan
really singing your song with his messages about the wage gap,
the plight of workers and the need for new trade protections. If
he gets the Republican nomination, will you endorse him? Will he
attract union votes?&quot; Here's my response: Patrick Buchanan
is a racist, he's anti-semitic, he bashes women right along with
labor and immigrants and he's a believer in supply-side
economics. </p>
<p>We are none of those things. </p>
<p>Our movement isn't about dividing people through fear, it's
about bringing people together through compassion. </p>
<p>We don't want to build a wall around our country, we want to
tear down walls in other countries ---- not so workers compete
one against the other, but so working families everywhere can
share a decent portion of what their labors produce. </p>
<p>Candidate Buchanan has come very late to the issue of
declining worker incomes in the midst of economic plenty. He is
against the minimum wage, he is against wage standards, against
worker health and safety protections, against the right of
workers to freely join and form unions and FOR the supply-side
economic policies that have transferred billions of dollars from
the tattered pocketbooks of middle-income Americans to the
silklined purses of the rich over the past 15 years. </p>
<p>And his positions on trade and immigration aren't our
positions at all. Our opposition to NAFTA wasn't opposition to
open markets, we were against the treaty because it lacked
appropriate worker protections, environmental, human rights and
union rights standards. Expanding our exports means good jobs and
we're for it. But we have to demand that we are not discriminated
against in foreign markets. And we have to insist that workers in
other countries be paid enough money to buy the goods we want to
export. </p>
<p>When it comes to immigration, our positions are also very far
from Buchanan's. We're opposed to refugee or family caps and more
restrictive laws and bureaucracies, specifically the creation of
any sort of national registry or database to track illegal
immigrants. We led the fight against immigrant-bashing in
California. We opposed President Clinton's recent executive order
on immigration and we told him so. </p>
<p>Saying Patrick Buchanan speaks for workers is like saying the
Ayatollah Khomeni speaks for priests and rabbis. I don't think
working Americans are going to be fooled by a Presidential
candidate who talks the talk, but won't walk the walk. End quote. </p>
<p>This morning we had visits from Senator Rockefeller and
Senator Wyden, along with Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's
Defense Fund. Their sobering remarks provided a fitting framework
for our deliberations, which were about our legislative and
political activities. </p>
<p>We approved three statements which will guide our program this
year, and you have them before you. </p>
<p>In the federal legislative arena, we're going to build on a
grassroots lobbying campaign that generated more than 500,000
telephone calls to members of Congress last year and repulsed
efforts by the radical right to roll back 50 years of social
progress led by labor. </p>
<p>Our aim this year is to broaden local bases of informed and
involved workers, train more members in grassroots techniques and
continue to refine our ability to monitor and hold accountable
the candidates we elect to office. </p>
<p>Our legislative agenda is very full. We're going to continue
to defend Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries from cost increases
and loss of coverage, children of working families from loss of
access to education, and workers from loss of their wage and
workplace standards protections. </p>
<p>We're going to oppose proposals on Medicaid and welfare reform
being advanced by the National Governor's Association. We're
going to oppose efforts to repeal Davis-Bacon, the Service
Contract Act, the 40-hour week and the minimum wage. We're going
to resist efforts to establish company unions, tampering with
rights of workers to freely join and form unions, diminish the
effectiveness of OSHA. We're going to attack corporate welfare
and immigrant-bashing initiatives. </p>
<p>We're going to mount a political action effort of
unprecedented scale, with every union doing its share by
contributing ideas, money, staff, media and materials. While
implementation of our plan will benefit candidates who stand with
working families, that is not our primary goal. Rather, we will
build a base of working people who hold elected officials,
regardless of party, accountable and who will inject workers'
rights and values into our national debate. </p>
<p>To help fund our efforts and consider our presidential
endorsement, the Executive Council authorized me to call a
special AFL-CIO convention and I will do so as quickly as we can
clear dates and accommodations. </p>
<p>The actions we took this morning are the component parts of a
program we think will propel working families back into the
center of American politics. </p>
<p>With me here this morning to help answer questions are Peggy
Taylor, director of the AFL-CIO department of legislation, and
Steve Rosenthal, our political director. But first I'd like to
call on Gerry McEntee, the chair of our political action
committee, to make a few comments. </p>
<p>REPORTER: You had said $35 million in January. This comes to
$23 million. Will the individual unions be making up the
difference? </p>
<p>GERRY MCENTEE: It comes a little higher than that, probably in
around $24 or $25 million. It's important to note, 1199 came in
yesterday. Dennis Rivera on behalf of that union pledged
$500,000. He also pledged 10 staffers and other unions are
pledging staff help in support. The federation has pledged that
they will come forward with dollars, as well. John, Linda
ChavezThompson and Rich Trumka have not, as of yet, decided on an
exact figure. So, we are not sure what that is going to be. But
we do know that when they do decide, it will bring us very close
to the $35 million goal and target. </p>
<p>When we are at that point, we have agreed among ourselves that
a number of unions that are better of financially and healthier
than some of our other unions will sit down and the difference
will be made up. </p>
<p>It was a target of $35 million. It was a goal of $35 million.
We believe and everybody has made the commitment to reach that
goal. </p>
<p>REPORTER: What are the current per capital payments monthly. </p>
<p>MCENTEE: Does anybody know the answer to that? I don't know
it. We'll get the answer to that back to you. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Given the strong showing of Patrick Buchanan, do you
have plans to go ahead and endorse President Clinton? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: The endorsement issue will be taken up at the special
convention. </p>
<p>REPORTER: How does this Labor '96 plan relate to the proposal
Sen. Rockefeller talked about some time back, trying to get a
unified message that would distinguish Democrats from
Republicans? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Message is just one part of the program. Steve why
don't you say a word about that. </p>
<p>STEVE ROSENTHAL: I think that this program came about as a
result of input from the political directors of a number of
unions. We convened a group of political directors of the various
affiliates following President Sweeney's election and took a look
at what everybody did well and what we needed to improve on. The
program that we came up with is a unified effort to bring
together all of our unions in a plan that will generate the kind
of energy, excitement and enthusiasm and inject back into the
national debate issues that are important to working families. </p>
<p>That's what this is really about -- informing and involving
members in getting the national debate to come back to one that
details the issues and needs of working families. </p>
<p>REPORTER: For all his warts, hasn't Pat Buchanan's campaign
brought worker issues to the forefront in the campaign? Despite
all the ugly parts of his message, hasn't he helped to elevate
worker issues? </p>
<p>MCENTEE: I personally feel like a songwriter who wrote a song
about 7 years ago and he couldn't get anybody to publish it or
sing it and then all of a sudden Pat Buchanan is singing part of
it, Bob Dole is singing part of it, probably Lamar Alexander,
once he looks at the polls in an consistent way, will be singing
part of it. </p>
<p>I think that Pat Buchanan has articulated it to a degree. But
only in a particular sphere. There are many worker issues that he
has not talked about, that he is opposed to. When you judge Pat
Buchanan's candidacy, you have to look at the whole of Pat
Buchanan. If you would go back and look at some of those
Crossfire shows and what he said about American workers -- the
minimum wage, striker replacement and a whole host of issues
pertaining to American workers -- I think you'll find that he is
not shoulder to shoulder or a friend of American workers. He's
got part of a program out there right now where he is talking
about the difference between corporate executives and
corporations in America as compared to American workers. On that
single piece he is right. He has brought it to the front burner.
We've been trying to get it on to the front burner, but that's
only a very small piece of Pat Buchanan. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Regarding him singing this song, is there a danger
that you might lose the message -- that it will be claimed by
people you consider not to be friends of labor? </p>
<p>MCENTEE: I don't know that we are afraid of losing the
message. If Bob Dole would go back to the Congress of the United
States and get them to debate the minimum wage and to pass the
minimum wage. It's wonderful to go out on the stump and make all
these promises and talks. They can return to the Congress of the
United States. There's all kinds of legislation pending that
would help American workers. The proof is in the pudding. If they
go back and do that, then that's a different kind of ball game.
To go out on the stump and look at the polls and deal with the
polls in terms of the American people is another. </p>
<p>We don't believe that the American labor movement is going
lose it's message. </p>
<p>Out message is broader than what Pat Buchanan is talking
about. It's a message that we've had for a long period of time. </p>
<p>ROSENTHAL: As a follow up to that, for the last year, plus, we
have seen the worst assault on working families ever by this
Congress. Virtually every protection for working families has
been under attack -- from Medicare and Medicaid, the eight-hour
day, health and safety on the job, the right to form unions,
student loans, education. When Pat Buchanan is ready to reject
that agenda and to come out with a progressive agenda that is
going to be good for working families ... That's what we are
about, we talking about what's good for working Americans.
Hopefully, the debate should move in that direction. </p>
<p>REPORTER: This is a question for Mr. Sweeney or Mr. McEntee.
Mr. Sweeney just issued a stinging repudiation of Mr. Buchanan.
Do you think the administration is doing enough to counter the
position of Mr. Buchanan and to address the problems of American
workers? </p>
<p>MCENTEE: I think that the president and his administration has
done any number of things in terms of American workers. When you
look at the president's legislative agenda, the minimum wage, I
think members of his administration have gone beyond the
president. Secretary of Labor Reich has put forth a program in
terms of corporate America reform, corporate responsibility in
the community. </p>
<p>But I think it's right to say that we are in the business of
prodding the president more about the issues effecting working
Americans, in terms of wage lag, in terms of a level of job
insecurity that is still out there. I think that in the recent 10
days you have heard the president speak more and more on these
issues. The positions that he has taken on the Federal Reserve
Board when he came forward with the appointment of Felix Rohatyn. </p>
<p>As you know the Federal Reserve Board has a lot to do with the
economy and with growth. He came forward with a candidate that
believes in a tad more inflation -- which would be less
unemployment in our country, which would mean a little more
scarcity in terms jobs, which would mean more growth in terms of
our country. And he was rebuffed by the same kinds of people that
we were talking about earlier -- Republicans and Bob Dole,
particularly Connie Mack of Florida. </p>
<p>We will continue to prod the president and Democratic
politicians to speak more forcefully out on these issue. But when
you compare the record of President Clinton and the Democratic
men and women in Congress to the Republicans, when you look at
the Republican's Contract with America, I don't think there is
much of a question. But we'll continue to prod. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Why are you going through the endorsement process
differently than you have in the past? And where will you have
the convention? Here in Bal Harbour? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: I've said before, the convention will be in
Washington, D.C. The reason that we are having the special
convention is because an assessment of this magnitude requires a
convention. The General Board could not approve an assessment of
15 cents. </p>
<p>Ken, you asked about the current per capita. It's 42 cents per
member, per months. This is 15 cents is on top of that. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Is the endorsement process a matter of convenience
that you will happen to have a convention at the time that you
want to make the endorsement and that's why you are using the
convention instead of a General Board? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: No, actually the convention brings together a broader
representation of the membership and since we aren't going to
have a convention for the financial considerations, it makes a
lot of sense to also take up the endorsement question. </p>
<p>REPORTER: How soon might that convention be? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We are hoping it will be on March 25th in Washington,
D.C. </p>
<p>REPORTER: You said a base of 100 activists in every
congressional district. Will you be setting up some sort of
organization for that? How does that work with your organizing
plans? </p>
<p>ROSENTHAL: We are going into every union in the district
councils and central labor councils. We'd like to organize house
visits like we do during organizing campaigns where our members
call together groups of 8 and 10 of their coworkers and come
together in the evening. We'll talk about what the issues are.
We'll talk about what's going on in the country and where we fit
in as working families. At the end there will be a pledge that we
will be asking members to sign where they will agree to work 30
hours during the course of this election to move issues to
working families forward. </p>
<p>We used this in Oregon. We signed up about 300 rank-and-file
members of our various affiliates to be active in the campaign
and beyond the campaign so that there is an organization there in
place permanently to continue to work year round on these
legislative and political issues. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Will you be endorsing particular candidates in this
campaign, or will this be just an issues campaign? </p>
<p>ROSENTHAL: This campaign itself is an issue-driven campaign.
We are going to involve our members around the issues and inject
those issues into the debate. </p>
<p>This does not change the normal process of central labor
councils and state federations endorsing candidates and working
to support those candidates. The various affiliates of the
federation will endorse candidates and provide the kind support
for them that they always have in the past. This does not
preclude that. But in this campaign what we are talking about is
really issue driven. </p>
<p>REPORTER: As a follow up to that, on the previous day, on your
America Needs a Raise statement, you set out a list of guidelines
for endorsement of candidates. If a candidate is right on six of
those issues but wrong one, where does that leave the candidate
in terms of endorsement? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Those are the decisions that will be made within
central labor councils and state federations as well local unions
and affiliates in the various congressional districts and states
around the country. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Mr. Sweeney, you said for organized labor to do what
you want to do, it needs to grow. With AFL-CIO unions
representing so few American workers, could Pat Buchanan become
the representative of working people? Is there a danger that
Buchanan could be looked to by American workers instead of to
organized labor? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: I think that with our plans for this campaign --
which is issue driven, which has a major education component, as
well as a communications component -- working within our own
organizations, with our membership, we are building up a
grassroots campaign structure of activists among our members who
will be talking to there fellow workers and working within their
own community educating folks on the issues. </p>
<p>Patrick Buchanan, as we have said 100 times, may be
articulating the values that workers are concerned about, he is
not, as Gerry McEntee said earlier, coming up with the solutions.
And the easiest one is the minimum wage. He has yet to support
the minimum wage. </p>
<p>REPORTER: When you issue the call for a special constitutional
convention, will there be any other issues besides the special
assessment? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: I believe the Council meeting is not finished yet, so
something else could come up. But as of this time, it's basically
the political issue. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Originally you said 75 congressional districts. Now
you're saying you want to put activists in every congressional
district. What happened to the 75 districts? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We are going into every congressional district, every
area of the country where we have membership. This will be a
national campaign from the bottom up. This is not a top down
campaign. We will be building on our strongest resource -- our
membership activism. </p>
<p>REPORTER: What happened to the 75 districts? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We've increased the number. </p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>

<h3 align=center>AFL-CIO Executive Council Meeting<br>
Press Briefing<br>
Tuesday, February 20, 1996<br>
Bal Harbour, Fla.<br>
</h3>
<p>JOHN J. SWEENEY: This morning the Executive Council participated in a full briefing on the 
economic situation of workers and their families, the issue we believe is central to the debate over 
the future of our country. </p>
<p>We reviewed several &quot;living wage&quot; initiatives now underway in cities and states. And we approved 
a statement, which you have before you, linking the federation's legislative, organizing, bargaining 
and political efforts under a single, powerful theme. </p>
<p>&quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; is an expression of concern on behalf of millions of workers and their 
families. While productivity, profits, executive pay and the stock market keep going up, workers' 
incomes keep going down. The gap between the rich and the rest of us is becoming a sinkhole of 
social and economic conflict, and if we don't fill it in, it is going to swallow us all. </p>
<p>Workers are having to labor harder and longer just to keep even and more and more family 
members are having to work in order to maintain living standards. Working families have little 
money to spend, they are loaded with debt, and they have no time to spend with their children. 
Threatened by restructuring, downsizing, pension raids, privatization schemes and runaway plants, 
their anger is exceeded only by their anxiety over keeping their jobs. They are disgusted with 
business and government and their disillusionment is straining the fabric of our society. </p>
<p>With the help of Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, Congressman Dave Obey and Geoff Garin of 
Garin-Hart Research, we presented a huge challenge to the Executive Council: With workers and 
their families hurting as never before, it is us, America's unions, who must take responsibility for 
closing the wage and wealth gap and restoring respect for workers and the jobs they do. </p>
<p>The Executive Council accepted the challenge and we will begin the job by asking workers to 
speak out publicly about their lives and their jobs and to offer guidance toward solutions. From 
March through May, we will hold town hall meetings in the 27 cities on the list you have before 
you. Our goal: to transform individual concerns into a compelling national cause, sensitizing 
politicians and policy-makers as we mount a massive educational campaign to motivate 
unrepresented as well as represented workers. </p>
<p>We'll take what we've learned and raise the issue of income inequality to a new level of public 
visibility. We'll use it to drive our grassroots lobbying against cuts in programs working families 
depend on. And it will fuel a nationwide organizing drive to bring union wages and benefits to 
workers who need and deserve them. </p>
<p>Finally, we will use &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; to evaluate the political candidates who want our 
support and to help them campaign on this most important of issues. </p>
<p>We also heard this morning from Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin. This afternoon, we will hear from 
Susan Bianchi-Sand, president of the &quot;Council of Presidents&quot; of women's organizations and from 
Steve Protulis, director of the National Council of Senior Citizens. </p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Executive Council meeting around 3:30, I'll come down to the press room 
and make a couple of important announcements. Then, at 4 p.m., I'll join Steve and 500 senior 
citizens at a rally here in the hotel in the Crystal Room and make my views know on the Social 
Security privatization schemes being floated by the Concord Coalition, Steve Forbes and Senators 
Kerrey and Simpson. </p>
<p>Joining me here today are our Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka, our Executive Vice President 
Linda Chavez-Thompson and George Becker the president of the Steelworkers, who is the new 
chairman of our Economic Policy Committee. </p>
<p>Questions? </p>
<p>REPORTER: In your statement, you say you will speak out and support candidates who pledge to 
support your recommendations. Will you then work against candidates to do not make such a 
pledge? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We will be motivating our membership and educating our membership as to what the 
position is among the candidates on this issue as well as other issues. We will be encouraging our 
members to be active in political campaigns and supporting candidates who are supportive of our 
recommendations. </p>
<p>REPORTER: What are some of the concerns people are expressing about the Republican 
candidates, and did you discuss the endorsement of President Clinton? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We have not discussed the endorsement of President Clinton. We have been 
developing the programs that we are announcing. Yesterday's discussion around organizing and 
today's discussion is about &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; and the economy. Tomorrow, we will have 
our political discussion. </p>
<p>REPORTER: How did you choose the sites for town meetings? Will you and other officers 
preside? Can you give us an idea of the mechanics of the meetings? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Many of these cities are cities where the income gap has been most pronounced and 
where the change that has been created over the past several years in terms of greater numbers of 
poor and working poor families, many are where we have a strong membership. We will be laying 
out more specific plans about these hearings as we develop them. But I can assure you that all the 
leadership of the federation -- the three officers as well as the members of the Executive Council -- 
will be involved in these hearings. There is a rather short time frame and many cities to cover. We 
will be calling upon all the leadership of the American labor movement. </p>
<p>REPORTER: On your criteria for endorsements, let me give you an example. In 1994, the Illinois 
AFL-CIO did not endorse Dan Rostenkowski, even though he had an 11-1 voting record, 
because he voted wrong on NAFTA. Under these guidelines, would you have endorsed 
Rostenkowski? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: You'll have to wait and see. </p>
<p>REPORTER: As part of your campaign on &quot;America Needs a Raise,&quot; will you be focusing on the 
Federal Reserve and the issue of interest rates? Will you be speaking out on who will be the chair 
of the Fed? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We will be discussing this afternoon the opposition on the Federal Reserve and our 
position on the policies of the Federal Reserve. It has been a subject for the Economic Policy 
Committee. We had hoped to get to it this morning, but we didn't. We'll have more to say about it. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Do you see publicly funded jobs programs as part of the solution in &quot;America Needs 
a Raise?&quot; </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Sure. </p>
<p>REPORTER: I think this is a laudable program. Are you intending to shame corporations into this? 
Because it is the corporations that must come forward and respond in order for America to get a 
raise. </p>
<p>SWEENEY: These are all the things you've been telling us to do. </p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see, but we intend to promote those employers who we think are doing a lot 
of what we think is in the best interest of their most precious resource, which is their work force. 
We will certainly be making examples of those who are not -- look at the cover of Newsweek 
today. </p>
<p>REPORTER: In hitting these target cities, what kind of coalitions will you be mobilizing to work 
with you? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: All of the above. We intend to mobilize all our allies and we will probably be 
developing new relationships with new allies, folks who are seriously concerned about this issue 
and the effect that it's having on American workers. </p>
<p>REPORTER: What did the Secretary of the Treasury tell you about the reappointment of Alan 
Greenspan, or the appointment of a deputy chairman? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: He acknowledged the fact that Felix Rohatyn had been under consideration and 
expressed disappointment that there was strong Republican opposition and that Felix Rohatyn had 
withdrew his name from consideration. We talked a little bit about the Federal Reserve Board, but 
there was no further discussion about any appointments to the Board. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Who are the employers who are doing a good job in dealing with their workers and 
who are not? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: I really don't want to get into that right now. We are in the process of developing a 
list. The Labor Department has been working on this as well. We expect that we will have a 
continuing development of examples of good guys and bad guys. </p>
<p>REPORTER: A list of good guys and a list of bad guys? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: There will certainly be some recognition for those who are doing good programs and 
those who have been focused on serious labor-management programs and have been addressing 
the human resource issues and the training and making sure that their workers share in the high 
productivity and high profitability of businesses. </p>
<p>REPORTER: What sort of leverage would you expect your organization to have to persuade 
companies on the bad-guy list to conform to the kind of guidelines you are talking about? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We will be using every technique and tool that we can possibly use in terms of 
promoting and communicating essentially with our membership. If employers are in violation of 
some of the laws that are meant to protect workers, we will be calling upon the Department of 
Labor to enforce those laws and to penalize those who are violating safety and health, fair labor 
standards. </p>
<p>REPORTER: I mean in terms of raising wages. </p>
<p>SWEENEY: There will be a continuing campaign. You will have to wait and see how some of 
these situations develop and how some examples are developed as well. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Are you prepared to go beyond the usual confrontational tactics? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We will build bridges..... and if necessary we will block bridges. </p>
<p>REPORTER: From all the Democrats, except the treasury secretary, we heard that they're serious 
about policies to promote corporate responsibility. Do you foresee the administration pressing the 
issue? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We are finding that there is a great deal of interest. We think that it is very sincere 
interest in focusing more and more on these issues. We have the highest expectations that there will 
be cooperation and support. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Are you happy with the way the idea is moving on Capitol Hill... </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We are continuing to be involved in those discussions and continuing to monitor the 
situation. </p>
<p>REPORTER: I mean the pace and the level of discussion, in terms of the specifics . . . </p>
<p>SWEENEY: I think that it is a little premature to really speak to that at this point, but there is 
tremendous interest and there has been close coordination and cooperation. </p>
<p>REPORTER: With regard to the good-guy, bad-guy lists, will consumer boycotts be considered? 
Where will these lists be drawn up, at the AFL-CIO or the Labor Department, I'm confused on 
that. </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We haven't arrived at the point of being able to be any more specific. As we develop 
this, we will be advising the press. But I think that you can see from the resolution that was adopted 
that this is intended to be a very comprehensive campaign. As we develop the specifics of it, we 
will be advising you. </p>
<p>REPORTER: On the wildcat strike at the Dodge plant, do you think things like that will crop up at 
other times? What do you plan to do about it? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Rich Trumka. </p>
<p>RICHARD TRUMKA: I think those types of situations are a manifestation of the continuing 
frustration. Those are what happens whenever the internal mechanism for workers and employers 
to cooperate break down. </p>
<p>Obviously, we don't want to see those happen in the future. We'd like to see every worker and 
every employer be able to sit down and work out a solution amicably without loss of work or any 
kind of disruption. That's the best thing that could happen. </p>
<p>But whenever you get an employer who short circuits that or closes off the resolution mechanisms, 
you have those kind of disruptions. Hopefully, you won't see them in the future. It's the same thing 
with raises. You're seeing people being more frustrated with it because their needs aren't being met. </p>
<p>REPORTER: At the same time, the union supported the company and not the workers. </p>
<p>TRUMKA: I disagree with your characterization. I don't think that the union didn't support the 
workers there. I think they did in fact support the worker there. </p>
<p>SWEENEY: I think George Becker will be able to answer that. </p>
<p>GEORGE BECKER: Briefly, I just know that there is a dispute going on. Certainly this is an 
internal matter with the Auto Workers. Steve Yokich is involved and knowledgeable about it. And 
he is the person that that has to be dealt with. </p>
<p>REPORTER: To some extent, the Republicans in New Hampshire are beginning to address some 
of the issues you address in this statement. I'd like to ask your views of the positions of Bob Dole 
and the rest of the Republicans. </p>
<p>SWEENEY: I think that it's great that the candidates are being educated on this issue and finally 
realizing that America's working families are in a time of crisis. </p>
<p>While they are recognizing the seriousness of the problem, or starting the recognize, I don't think 
that they are facing the serious solutions that it is going to require. </p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<h3 align=center>AFL-CIO Executive Council Meeting<br>
Press Briefing<br>
Monday, February 19, 1996<br>
Bal Harbour, Fla. </h3>
<p>JOHN J. SWEENEY: Today's morning session of the AFL-CIO Executive Council was devoted 
entirely to the most important issue facing our movement, and that is organizing. </p>
<p>In my opening remarks to the Council I said we must all face a basic fact: we cannot bargain decent 
contracts for our members, nor can we obtain public policies that protect working families, unless 
we can build a substantially larger labor movement. </p>
<p>To build a larger labor movement, we must do two things. </p>
<p>First, we have to devote considerably more resources to organizing more resources at the 
AFL-CIO, more resources from our national unions and more resources from our local unions. </p>
<p>Secondly, we need to expend these resources in smart and strategic ways, working together as a 
movement, rather than as a collection of individual unions. </p>
<p>In addition to reports from Arthur Coia, the chair of our organizing committee, and from Richard 
Bensinger, our director of organizing, we heard from Allison Porter, director of the Organizing 
Institute and from several workers and organizers who are currently involved in campaigns. </p>
<p>The Council responded by approving a strategic plan for promoting organizing among our unions as 
well as a plan for the AFL-CIO's own organizing program. </p>
<p>We also approved comprehensive guidelines for the national organizing fund we set up last fall. </p>
<p>I'm going to ask Arthur Coia to comment further on the organizing statement, which you have 
before you, and I want you to hear from Monica Russo, one of the organizers who spoke. </p>
<p>But we go any further, I have a little surprise. Karen, will you join me up here. This is Karen 
Nussbaum, and I just stole her from Bob Reich. (Applause) </p>
<p>As you all know, Karen is now the Director of the Women's Bureau at the Department of Labor. 
She is one of the most commanding and articulate leaders in the labor movement and her 
appointment is a clear statement on behalf of the AFL-CIO that we are there for the working 
women of our nation. </p>
<p>Karen has agreed to be the director of a newly formed Working Women's Department at the 
AFL-CIO and I've charged her with developing a program that will inject the issues and concerns 
of working women into every nook and cranny of our movement and with making the labor 
movement a strong, activist voice for working women. </p>
<p>She will be coming to the Federation in early March. Karen, would you like to say a few words? </p>
<p>KAREN NUSSBAUM: Thank you very much, President Sweeney. I started as a young clerk 
typist in the early 1970s and I was caught up then in the belief that if you came across injustice, it 
was both your right and your obligation to do something about it. And that it was also possible to 
make change. And I took those beliefs into the workplace and with friends started 9-to-5, National 
Association of Working Women which is now a national organization representing women office 
workers. </p>
<p>But we needed more, so we built a new home for office workers in the trade union movement, 
District 925 of the Service Employees International Union, which combines the character and the 
concerns of the working woments movement with the clout of a union. And it is there that I 
experienced first hand John Sweeneyts leadership and itts been my privilege to be able to work 
with him these many years. </p>
<p>I was honored to be chosen by President Clinton to be the 13th director of the Woments Bureau of 
the Department of Labor. I couldntt have enjoyed it more. I might have enjoyed it more if wetd had 
a Democratic Congress, I still enjoyed it greatly. Bob Reich is a great Secretary of Labor and itts 
been a privilege to work for him. </p>
<p>But itts the working women Itve met who have meant the most to me. Over the last three years, 
Itve crossed the country and met with women from many, almost every kind of job -- casino 
workers in Las Vegas, construction workers in Cleveland, clericals in Richmond, nurses in Boston, 
executives, poultry workers, flight attendants, machinists. Over a quarter of a million women 
personally filled out a survey for the Woments Bureau, many of them pouring out their hearts not 
long ago. </p>
<p>Herets what Itve learned. That though their jobs could not be more different and their working 
conditions more different, what they want and what they need is very much the same. And though 
they are eloquent about their problems, they have very little idea about what to do about them. 
Many times after an hourts conversation with a group of working women I think to myself -- they 
dontt need to be meeting with the director of the Woments Bureau, they need an organizer. </p>
<p>And the new Working Woments Department of the AFL-CIO is for these women. I know that 
they are waiting for us. Many of those conversations will stay with me, but in conclusion I just want 
tell you about one women who I think of especially today. Who when asked what she needed to 
make things better on the job, said, tItve got plenty of information, itts power I dontt have.t And I 
want to tell her today, tLinda, hold on, wetre coming and wetre going to make things better soon.t </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Thanks, Karen. Next, Itd like to call on Monica Russo, the Southern Regional 
Organizing Director for UNITE, to share with us some of the remarks she made to the Executive 
Council this morning. Monica. </p>
<p>MONICA RUSSO: Good morning everybody. First Itd like to take this opportunity to recognize 
my brother and sister organizers who are here with us and who also spoke this morning -- Bob 
Gorman with the IBEW, Yanira Merino with the Laborerts International Union and Joanne Joycline 
who is a UNITE volunteer. </p>
<p>I bring you greetings from UNITE, particularly from the southern region of UNITE which is where I 
live and have worked for the last 10 years. Itd like to share with you somewhat a little tidbit, a slice 
of life, a view from the trenches. </p>
<p>We talk to unorganized workers in the South every day. And what wetre seeing out there is that 
workers are tired. Workers are tired of getting their wages cut. Workers are tired of being 
understaffed, stretched out, fed up. Workers are tired of contracting out. Workers are tired of 
racism and sexual harassment. Theytre tired of temporary labor. Workers are tired of the abuse. 
What theytre most tired of is waiting. </p>
<p>Workers are waiting on us, the labor movement, to provide the leadership to fight back. The 
people are ready so, it is incumbent upon us as a labor movement to get out there in the street, roll 
our sleeves up, get our hands dirty, dig in and start fighting back. Wetve got to be ready to take 
some hits, because itts not easy out there. The only thing is that we cantt let them knock us out. We 
have to keep on fighting, keep on fighting, keep on fighting until we win. </p>
<p>For example, at Tultex in Martinsville, Va., where there are 2,500 workers who knit, dye, cut, sew 
and finish sweats for one of the largest fleece wear manufacturers in the world. UNITE, with the 
enormous help of the Organizing Institute and scores of our own rank-and-file activists members, 
ran three NLRB elections against this textile giant in five years before we won. And we finally won 
in 1994 because Tultex, after having won two labor board elections got, very arrogant and they 
started cutting workers and benefits and started taking advantage of people. At the same time, they 
were lining the top executivets pockets with a lot of money. So even after hiring several union 
busters, three to be exact, the workers overwhelmingly voted for union representation two to one. 
This victory, this huge margin enabled us to negotiate a top-of-the-line contract in the textile 
industry. The whole situation in Martinsville, Va., has changed to where mill workers and mill 
owners will never be the same. </p>
<p>During this same time period, this is since 1989, UNITE has organized over 10,000 private-sector 
workers in the South. We have engaged in dozens of first contract battles. From 600 union 
workers in Greensboro, Ga., who make socks for such prestigious customers as Adidas, to the 
K-Mart distribution center workers in Greensboro, N.C., where 550 predominately black and 
Hispanic workers won their union election and are now fighting in a militant battle against race 
discrimination and poverty wages. </p>
<p>In fact leaders in the Greensboro community have launched a full-scale boycott against K-Mart in 
Greensboro reminiscent of the Woolworth sit-in over 30 years ago to protest segregation. </p>
<p>And now, today in 1996, the Greensboro community leaders and the UNITE union members are 
fighting against racial and worker discrimination in Greensboro. All the way to Miami, Fla., where 
we are launching massive organizing drives involving hundreds of low-wage immigrant workers who 
work in health care industry from Haiti to Jamaica to Central America. </p>
<p>In closing, Itd just like to say that in the South we have learned that the only way to sustain 
ourselves through these grueling and tough fights is to develop a whole culture of organizing that 
goes from the shop floor to the union hall all the way to the international headquarters. And Itm 
proud to say that one of the first acts of our newly elected president of our union, our newly 
merged union, President Jay Mazur, was to commit major resources to organizing. Thatts the kind 
of commitment wetre looking for in the field, thatts the commitment we need in the field and thatts 
the kind of commit itts going to take to win. </p>
<p>So, in closing, I want to thank you, President Sweeney, for this opportunity to address the Council 
this morning. Out in the field we are thrilled because we see a new direction in the labor movement. 
Wetve been banging away long and hard for many, many, many years and we look forward to 
working in an environment where we can take more risks, pick more bigger fights and win bigger 
victories for workers in the South and all across America. </p>
<p>Thank you very much. </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Thank you Monica. Monica will be available as will the other organizers who are here 
throughout the whole press conference. </p>
<p>Next Itd like to introduce one who brings a tremendous amount of experience and energy as the 
new chair of the AFL-CIO Executive Council Organizing Committee. Hets the president of the 
Laborer's union, Arthur Coia. </p>
<p>ARTHUR COIA: Thank you, John. When John asked me to chair the Committee on Organizing, it 
was a deep privilege for me personally because I wanted to play a significant part in the new 
direction of the labor movement as we now see it. And especially leading the labor movement into 
the 21st century. </p>
<p>I can report to you that the committee has met. We met a number of times. It is comprised of the 
most aggressive labor leaders that we have seen. Labor leaders that are willing to restructure their 
own organizations. Labor leaders that are willing to take the extra step to lead by example, not by 
demand -- to say yes, when others say no -- who are willing to take a country and an organization 
into the 21st century. </p>
<p>We talked about different methods and opportunities that are before us. The committee addressed 
the financial resources that we hope to make available and will make available to those unions that 
are willing to restructure and willing to go forward, who will provide leadership and coordination 
support for respective organizations, promoting their efforts, willing to share with one another -- 
taking the good from all and distributing them making and curriculum assessments, development of 
strategic commands, promoting and coordinating the integration of political, legislative and legal 
activity. Especially raising the visibility and public profile of our federation and our respective 
organizations. </p>
<p>When we talk about organizing, we talk about a very significant priority in the federation. By not all 
means just that. We are going to be working very closely with the political committee on legislative 
issues and also on our public relations and communications committee, headed by Doug Dority. </p>
<p>So itts a coordinated effort. Itts not only one spoke thatts going to move the organization and move 
the federation forward under the leadership of John Sweeney. But itts a coordinated effort. Itts an 
effort that we hope and we know that we will succeed with. </p>
<p>So if anyone has any questions, I hope that I can answer them. </p>
<p>How about you Mr. Bernstein? </p>
<p>REPORTER: Whatts the difference between this and Operation Dixie 100 years ago? </p>
<p>COIA: I dontt think there is any difference now because the labor laws that we had then, we didntt 
have them. The labor laws that we have now are outdated. They are 60 years old, they need 
revitalization. And thatts why we are looking to a new Congress. And thatts why we are looking to 
the committee headed by Jerry McEntee to work closely with that committee to see a new day in 
Election 96. </p>
<p>So the legislation that is in front of us, labor law reform thatts needed, is very similar to where it was 
100 years ago. </p>
<p>But 100 years ago, we didntt have the power of the privilege, we didntt have the press with us and 
we didntt have any Congress with us. So itts almost the same as it is now. So we hope to rechange 
the imagery of the organization, we hope to get a new Congress for labor law reform. We certainly 
wontt have the power of privilege, though. </p>
<p>REPORTER: How will organizing work with politics? </p>
<p>COIA: In order to have a good organizing campaign, we need some substance behind us. And 
thatts were the law comes in, giving us the real opportunity to choose and select freedom of speech 
and freedom of opportunity coming through the most important thing of the law. So, through that 
activity, through election, through getting out the vote, through grass-roots opportunity, through our 
efforts to our communications department this will all work hand in hand. Without education, 
without communications we certainly cantt carry the message of organizing out there. </p>
<p>REPORTER: You suggested that money would be available to unions willing to restructure. What 
does that mean? </p>
<p>COIA: In order to provide our monies, wetll call it leverage money, not subsidy or grant money, 
those organizations that are willing to restructure not only their philosophy in organizing but to put 
out a meaningful organizing department, meaningful organizing staff to identify targets, to develop 
those targets, to develop ideas and to go forward. </p>
<p>This is not only an effort coming from the federation, but a coordinated effort coming from locals, 
districts and regional concepts out in the field. </p>
<p>REPORTER: What is the highest and the lowest percentages of funds allocated to organizing 
among AFL-CIO unions? </p>
<p>COIA: There are some unions out there that are providing significant amounts of money. I know 
that the Teamsters are have allocated in their budget approximately $25 million. The Laborerst right 
now, we have $6 million allocated for organizing. Bob Wages has just recently upgraded his 
organizing budget, where it was to a point below one percent. Now hets allocated 12 percent. So 
the idea is catching on, the concept is catching on. Organizing is certainly the theme of the day and 
it is certainly the theme of this administration. </p>
<p>REPORTER: How much money is available? How much are you looking to raise? </p>
<p>COIA: We hope to raise significant amounts of money. The heights and the goals are significant. 
More than $50 million. Under the leadership of John, wetll do that. Am I right John? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Youtre right. </p>
<p>We are reviewing all of the programs of the federation and will be laying out plans in terms of the 
amount of resources and how itts going to be used and where the focus is going to be. As Arthur 
was saying, we are also going to raise a culture of organizing among the affiliates, national unions 
and local unions, working closely with the affiliates. The affiliates will be doing the organizing, the 
federation will be assisting and providing expertise as well as coordination -- encouraging 
multiunion campaigns where more than one union will be involved in particular campaigns. </p>
<p>REPORTER: When you say youtre revising programs, does that mean youtre planning to shut 
down part of the AFL-CIO, to lay off some people? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We have an outstanding staff at the AFL-CIO and we are looking opportunities for 
developing new programs. This is a good example where there was no organizing department, 
there was a department that was called organization and field services. We have not created a new 
department. We are in the process of working with Richard Bensinger and Allison Porter on the 
changes that are taking place. We will be doing that with every department of the federation. </p>
<p>Richard and Allison are also available for any questions. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Can you talk about the guidelines? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: There are copies of the guidelines and the resolution in your packet. If you want to 
address a question to that you may. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Is the AFL-CIO saying that to get access to the organizing fund the union will have to 
restructure, to have strategic plans and the like? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Thatts some of what the guidelines say, yes. </p>
<p>REPORTER: How many unions can now meet these guidelines? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Itts not the unions that meet the guidelines, itts the programs and the proposals that 
the unions will be developing. I am assuming that those proposals would be developed in 
accordance with the guidelines as they are established. And there has to be flexibility involved as 
well in terms of tailoring programs to the needs of a particular industry or a particular jurisdiction. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Help me understand this. What number of unions could meet these guidelines? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Every union could meet the guidelines. It may require changes in terms how they 
organize or it may require some assistance from the organizing department of the AFL-CIO, but 
every union has the potential to meet those guidelines. </p>
<p>REPORTER: How many have it now. If you were to give a snapshot right now, how many unions 
would fall in this category? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: I cantt give you a stock answer. We are in the process of entertaining and 
encouraging unions to submit proposals. We have some proposals already submitted which are 
under reviews. We will be working together with those unions to see how those proposals meet the 
guidelines. And if there are any changes that we have to recommend, wetll be doing that. </p>
<p>Richard do you want to say a word on the guidelines? </p>
<p>RICHARD BENSINGER: I think the basic concept, as President Sweeney is saying, is that 
traditionally in recent times we too often had just done hot-shop or single-shop organizing going 
worksite by worksite. In many cases, even when we win, we dontt have enough power because 
we haventt taken on either the whole industry -- if itts a service sector industry, we didntt take on 
all of that industry in one round or if itts a corporation, we needed the capacity to take on and 
change the David and Goliath formula where we are always the David. </p>
<p>Itts not just a question of money, itts a question of bringing strategic approaches -- which the 
AFL-CIO is developing an internal capacity to do. Itts a question of mobilizing our base. Itts a 
question of doing organizing smarter, but clearly doing it to scale. It really is more reminiscent of the 
30s. </p>
<p>REPORTER: So a union could come to you and say, tWe have met these guidelines.t Then, they 
could get some money? </p>
<p>BENSINGER: All sorts of things. One is that they can get the troops of the Organizing Institute, 
which has a huge focus on recruiting women and people of color. So, if we are going to organize a 
big target in a Latino community, hopefully, we will have the capacity. Itts going to be hard to 
expand the institute. We cantt expand so fast that we get ahead of ourselves here. But we are trying 
to double the capacity of the institute this year. </p>
<p>They can get strategic advice. They can get, I think, a partnership with the AFL-CIO in looking at 
joint strategic campaigns that really hasntt existed before. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Provide the organizational support? </p>
<p>BENSINGER: Right. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Would the possibility of winning come into play? </p>
<p>BENSINGER: I think President Sweeney would tell me yes. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Where will the money come from? Will you have to have a special assessment? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Wait and see. </p>
<p>REPORTER: What kind of workers are you looking to organize? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: The thousand recruits that we will have in place this summer will be young workers 
who are active in campaigns as well as college students who have an interest in the values of the 
labor movement. Children of members. And we will be reaching out to young folks to get them 
involved and give them a taste of what the labor movement is all about and we will be looking to 
the affiliates to provide us with the opportunities of ongoing campaigns were these workers can 
learn something and make a contribution in terms of raising the visibility of the labor movement. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Is there a particular area of the country? Or a particular industry? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: It will be diversified. Every region of the country will be considered and every industry 
is a potential. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Are you formally beginning an effort to organize more people in the South? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Yes, we will be putting more resources into the South and we will be encouraging 
affiliates of the AFL-CIO to organize in the South. And Itm sure that we will be receiving proposals 
from affiliates to do more organizing in the South. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Have you set a deadline for proposals to be submitted for this effort? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: No, this is a long-term program ongoing. There are some proposals already submitted 
and we expect that the number will increase and hopefully it will be a process that the AFL-CIO 
will be undertaking for many years. And changing where necessary in order to make the program 
as successful as we can. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Are there unions not going along? What are you saying to unions not going along? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We have not heard any opposition to the program. In fact, we have heard enthusiastic 
support. Unions are excited about this. Organizers such as these wonderful people who are here 
today are very excited about it and we have high expectations. </p>
<p>REPORTER: How soon do you think youtll have an organization that will reverse the membership 
losses, to improve on the 10.4 percent private-sector unionization? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: The things that we are talking about are really longterm investments in organizing, 
long-term rebuilding of the culture of organizing. The resources that we put into the organizing and 
training institute, as an example, is a long time commitment to organizing, a continuous program. 
The folks we will be recruiting and training, hopefully, will be with the labor movement for many 
years. </p>
<p>BENSINGER: Corporate American at the flick of the switch can lay off 40,000 people. We dontt 
have a button to push or a magic answer, but I think in the long run we have a lot more the offer 
American workers. </p>
<p>REPORTER: How would you sum up what youtre doing today, in terms of this year? Are you 
planning to pick a particular target, or focus on the South, this year? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: We have some very good proposals that are in the process right now. We are not at 
liberty to reveal what they are. When we conclude the process and make some determinations, we 
will be announcing those. And I think you will see that they will be in different parts of the country. </p>
<p>REPORTER: How does union organizing connect with political action, strategic campaigns and 
communications? How does that all fit together? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: There is an interconnect between all of the programs that you have mentioned aimed 
at rebuilding the labor movement in the United States, turning around the decline in membership, 
creating a stronger political voice for American workers and improving the perception of the 
American labor movement, both within the movement as well as with the public. </p>
<p>REPORTER: What are you doing differently in Detroit? </p>
<p>SWEENEY: Is Rich Trumka here? Rich is chairman of the Strategic Approaches committee and he 
has been coordinating the efforts of that committee and meeting with the unions who are involved in 
the newspaper strike there? </p>
<p>Bill would you like to say a word? Bill Boarman is with CWA. </p>
<p>BILL BOARMAN: I think the total commitment of the labor movement in Detroit is much different 
than wetve had in past newspaper strikes. The AFL-CIO support for the unions there has been 
tremendous since day one and it continues to increase. Wetve had a number of meetings here 
planning strategy that will be, I think, unfolded later in the week and youtll hear about that. But I 
think overall itts just a combined effort by the unions to help each other. </p>
<p>In our industry our unions are relatively small and we are up against huge giants who many of you 
work for. And you can understand the problem. Itts a typical David and Goliath struggle for the 
newspaper unions. And so we really need the support of the AFL-CIO in addition to all of its 
affiliates. I think that itts been tremendous. I think itts working. I think the advertising campaign in 
Detroit and the circulation campaign and the alternative newspaper that the striking workers are 
putting out are all new ideas and all new concepts. And I think youtll see more added to that as this 
week unfolds. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Can I ask a followup question to that? What if you end up with just one newspaper? </p>
<p>BOARMAN: Well, we hope that won't be the case. That happened in Pittsburgh, as you well 
know. And thatts not our desire. But if the corporate giants -- the greedy people that are involved 
in really aggressing this strike at the cost of millions and millions of dollars to the shareholders, to 
the people in Detroit -- that'll be a decision that they'll have to make, but we certainly hope that isn't 
the case.</p>

<h3 align=center>AFL-CIO Executive Council Meeting<br>
Press Briefing<br>
Vice President Al Gore<br>
Bal Harbour, Fla.<br>
February 19, 1996<br>
</h3>
<p>JOHN SWEENEY: We just had a good visit with the vice president and a very frank discussion 
about a number of issues. It is my honor to present to you Vice President Al Gore. </p>
<p>VICE PRESIDENT GORE: I thought he was going to make a longer statement. Itm used to 
standing there behind presidents when they speak at the microphone. Thank you very much, John. </p>
<p>Itll just give you a brief summary of what I said to the Council and then John Sweeney and I will be 
happy to respond to any questions that you might have. </p>
<p>I spoke at some length about the importance of President John Sweeneyts vision for the labor 
movement in the United States of America. Many of the problems that we face in our country, 
wage stagnation, the rising gap between the rich and poor, the difficulty families have getting by in 
spite of the economic progress that is so evident with the millions of new jobs and rising stock 
market and all the rest. A lot of these problems are due to the fact that legislation, policies and 
programs that are designed to help working men and women have not had the vigorous advocacy 
in the organized labor movement that they had when 34 percent of the work force was organized in 
the early 1950s. Labor has been just as vigorous, just as strong and just as determined in 
advocating its point of view, but with a smaller percentage of the work force, the overall impact has 
been somewhat less. </p>
<p>That is why John Sweeneyts vision is so important -- to organize those men and women who really 
want to bargain collectively and be a part of a movement that urges greater progress and justice in 
matters like job safety and health and so forth. </p>
<p>So, Itm very encouraged by what I see from this new team with John Sweeney and Linda 
Chavez-Thompson and Rich Trumka, both of whom are also here. And the whole new team that 
they have put together at the AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>President Clinton has worked very closely with President Sweeney and his team and one of the 
announcements that I made today to the Council was that the president will veto any bill that closely 
resembles the Ballenger Bill in the House or the Kassebaum Bill in the Senate to weaken and 
undermine OSHA. Wetve had thousands of work-related deaths each year, tens of thousands of 
work related injuries or workplace induced illnesses. This legislation which has suddenly arisen in 
the Republican Congress would really undermine and devastate OSHAts ability to do its job. And 
so I was pleased to announced today that the president would veto that legislation if it passes in its 
current form, either the House bill or the Senate. </p>
<p>We also look forward to working with John Sweeney and his team on issues across the board. We 
also look forward to working with them in a political context and I also shared with the Council my 
own first-hand impressions from the race in Oregon -- that organized labor put Ron Wyden over 
the top in that Senate race for a seat that has not been held by a Democrat for 34 years, I believe it 
is. And which was won by Ron Wyden after John Sweeneyts team put a lot of people on the 
ground in key roles organizing voters and getting the message out in that mail-in election campaign. </p>
<p>President Clinton and I want to continue that kind of partnership with the AFL-CIO. We are 
looking forward to their Union Summer activities, which are very promising. We look forward to 
working with them to prevent the kind of damage the Newt Gingrich-controlled Congress is 
attempting to do. And we believe that we will be successful. And then, of course, in November we 
are going to be working very hard together for the reelection of President Clinton and the 
Clinton-Gore ticket. </p>
<p>So, with that let me throw it open to your questions. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Did you talk about any of the other legislation in Congress and what the president 
would do? </p>
<p>GORE: Yes, the president will veto the TEAM Act or any legislation that attempts to create 
company dominated unions. Thatts not the American way. We dontt support that. The president 
will veto the TEAM Act. And as has been previously said, any measure that eliminates 
Davis-Bacon would also be vetoed. I said that last year. </p>
<p>REPORTER: There have been some proposals and some ideas kicked around by Sen. Kennedy, 
Labor Secretary Reich and just a few moments ago Congressman Gephardt about trying to use the 
tax structure to get corporations to be tbetter citizens.t Whatts the presidentts position on that? </p>
<p>GORE: Well, we believe that a variety of measures are warranted in the area of education, health 
care and child care. The president publicly called for passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum Bill 
which requires portability of pensions. </p>
<p>The president has called for a tax deduction for educational expenses for college or technical 
school, up to $10,000. Where individual employees are concerned, of course, one of the biggest 
changes in our tax code in recent years was the change called for and passed by President Clinton 
to vastly expand the earnedincome tax credit. It has given a reduction of taxes of more than $1,000 
per family -- up to $1,600 per family of four -- for families making under $26,000 per year. Thatts 
been a huge change for the better because it is in those amounts spread out over so many millions 
of families. It doesntt get the headlines, it doesntt get the attention, but it has been a very big 
change. For the first time in 25 or 30 years, just in the last two years we have begun to see a slow 
rise in every income category. Itts not enough. As Itve said before, we want to take steps to 
accelerate it dramatically. Incidentally, one other measure that will very effectively deal with this 
growing gap between the rich and the poor would be an increase in the minimum wage. </p>
<p>I talked about that at some length in the meeting, as well. This year, without changes, the minimum 
will fall to a 40-year low, after you adjust for inflation. President Clinton and I believe the minimum 
wage must be increased. Every single Republican candidate is opposed to an increase in the 
minimum wage and the Republican majority leader in the Congress said he would fight any increase 
in the minimum wage with every breath in his body. Can you imagine? A person in a position like 
that, when the minimum wage is at a 40-year low, saying that he is going to fight any change with 
every breath in his body. It really is amazing. </p>
<p>But thatts what the election is all about in 1996 -- whether wages are going to grow or continue to 
stagnate. </p>
<p>REPORTER: As unions step up their organizing activity, as they have promised, more American 
workers will be faced on the job with a choice, yes or no on a union. How do you recommend they 
vote on that? </p>
<p>GORE: Thatts for them to decide given the circumstances as they judge them. Itve stated my view 
a few moments ago that in my opinion one of the reasons why progressive legislation has had 
rougher sailing in recent years, compared to the 50s and 60s, is the simple fact that instead of 34 to 
35 percent of the work force being organized, 16 to 17 percent of the work force is organized. But 
where an individual employee faces a choice, that is for that employee to decide. You deal with it in 
a pure hypothetical form, it depends on the circumstance. </p>
<p>REPORTER: As a followup to a previous question, did you discuss with the Council changing the 
tax code to penalize companies like Caterpillar and also changing to reward somebody like the 
manufacturer in Dewey, Mass. </p>
<p>GORE: No, we didntt discuss either of those companies. We did discuss the striker replacement 
issue as I did last year and again this year. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Pat Buchanan? What argument would you give voters for not going to his brand of 
solutions? </p>
<p>GORE: Itm going to try my best to stay out of the Republican primary contest. I was one who 
convinced myself in 1980 that if the Republicans would only nominate Ronald Reagan wetd be in 
great shape. I was burned so badly, I decided not to meddle in their primaries any more. </p>
<p>I think that even he [Buchanan] has refused to endorse an increase in the minimum wage. Isntt he 
opposed to an increase in the minimum wage? Itm going to resist getting involved in their primary. </p>
<p>REPORTER: What about wage stagnation? </p>
<p>GORE: Wage stagnation as Itve said is part of the challenge President Clinton and I signed on to 
meet. You remember the oftquoted slogan from the campaign war room back in 1992 -- tItts the 
economy, stupid.t </p>
<p>Well, it is still the economy. There are many issues that are of great concern to American citizens. 
The issue of values, how we strengthen families, how we raise our children, how we protect the 
environment and invest in education and protect Medicare. But it is still the economy that is the 
bedrock of our nationts ability to solve any of these problems. And dealing with the stagnation of 
wages requires policies like the earned-income tax credit, policies like an increase in the minimum 
wage, policies like portability of health insurance, policies like family leave. These deal with some of 
the issues that people in the workplace otherwise have to take out of their pocketbooks, and 
policies that are designed to make American business more competitive and share the profits and 
the wealth with those who earn them and who produce the productivity in the American workplace. </p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>

<h3 align=center>Remarks by Linda Chavez-Thompson<br>
Executive Vice President<br>
AFL-CIO<br>
<br>
IUD Southeast Regional Conference on Organizing,<br>
Workers' Rights and Coalition Building<br>
Atlanta, Georgia<br>
January 19, 1996<br>
</h3>
<p>My name is Linda Chavez-Thompson and I am here to help you kick some como se llama. </p>
<p>I see you speak Spanish. Well, since you speak Spanish, you know the Spanish word for &quot;yes,&quot; 
right? Then I want you to follow along and every time I make a statement you agree with, I want 
you to answer, &quot;Si,&quot; OK? </p>
<p>Here we go: Are we winning the budget fight? Are we saving Medicare and Medicaid and worker 
protections and student loans? Are we kicking Newt Gingrich's como se llama? Are we ready to 
give up on the American dream and roll over to corporate America? </p>
<p>I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you the Spanish phrase for saying &quot;NO&quot; to corporations and Republicans. 
Watch my lips and I'll show you. We say, &quot;Kiss my como se llama.....&quot; </p>
<p>I want to thank Elmer Chatak and the IUD for inviting me to join you here in Atlanta. You have a 
rare thing here, something you should treasure, something we rarely see in Washington, D.C. It's 
called &quot;sunshine.&quot; </p>
<p>I appreciate having the opportunity to be here at this regional conference and to speak on behalf of 
John Sweeney and Rich Trumka and the new AFL-CIO. I'm here without John and Rich because 
we believe in never sending two men to do a job one woman can do alone! </p>
<p>I think it's indisputable that a tremendous sense of energy and hope for meaningful change and 
progress was created by the victory of our New Voice leadership team at the AFL-CIO. The 
labor movement in America now has a window of opportunity we haven't seen for perhaps two 
decades or more. That opportunity is to once again become a forceful player in determining the 
nation's political agenda. And, ultimately, the opportunity is to use that power wisely on your behalf 
and that of all working families in America. </p>
<p>The theme of this conference -- &quot;organizing and coalition building&quot; -- could not be more timely. It 
speaks directly to how we can develop the tools and the strategies to take advantage of this 
opportunity, at this special moment in history. </p>
<p>As you know, the New Voice team pledged during our campaign that would invest heavily in 
organizing. We said we'd go anywhere and everywhere -- especially the South -- to organize and 
empower workers. And, in fact, plans are well under way to begin that effort during &quot;Union 
Summer,&quot; which is set to begin in just a few months. </p>
<p>We're going to send 1,000 young people, students as well as rank-and-file workers, into organizing 
campaigns in places like Georgia and Texas and California to help jump-start a movement to 
organize thousands and thousands of new union members. And then we're going to turn &quot;Union 
Summer&quot; into &quot;Union Fall,&quot; as we fan out across the country and launch a massive grass-roots 
campaign to take back the House of Representatives and to take back our country. </p>
<p>One of the most important things I've learned down through the years as an organizer, is that we 
need a lot of help in accomplishing these two great goals this year and the other goals to follow. 
That means &quot;coalition building&quot; in a new and bigger way. While common sense tells us we can all 
get ahead by working together, we have too often succumbed to the corporate imperative that 
drives wedges between people, and employs classic divide-andconquer strategies. New hires vs. 
experienced workers. Minorities vs. whites. African-Americans vs. Latinos. Women vs. men. New 
immigrants vs. not-so-new immigrants. Anything to keep working people from identifying with each 
other and coming together to advance their common interests. </p>
<p>Of course, we're not supposed to see it that way. Instead, we hear constantly about the changes in 
the economy that have created uncertainties and insecurities -- whether it's the global economy, or 
the decline in industrial jobs and growth of the service and information economy, or even the old 
canard that business is hamstrung by excessive government taxes and regulations. </p>
<p>It's always some unseen outside force. But what I see is a stock market that grew 33 percent in 
1995, with companies downsizing and workers paying the price. Is AT&amp;T an ailing company? Of 
course not! It's doing fabulously well. And how do they reward their work-force and move 
forward? They start the new year by eliminating more than 40,000 jobs! That's just the latest 
example. Last year we had an example of corporate &quot;coalition building&quot; when Chase Manhattan 
and Chemical Bank merged. That put 12,000 people out of work. In dozens of industries... in 
scores of cities... the price is paid by hundreds of thousands of workers and their families. </p>
<p>When that happens, you have no choice but to look out for No. 1 -- yourself. And the loyal 
workers who are the engine of the greatest economy on the planet are inevitably pitted against each 
other just to survive. But the reality is that as far as our common interests are concerned, 1996 is 
no different than 1976 or 1956 or the Depression days of 1936.<br>
Notwithstanding all the efforts to build artificial barriers between us, we all want the same things: 
job security, good wages and decent benefits providing health security for our families and income 
security after retirement. And all of us want to make sure our children have every opportunity to 
climb the ladder of success and achieve their dreams. Those are our common interests. Today, our 
challenge is to gain strength from that commonality to overcome our shared plight. In our struggles 
on behalf of working men and women no less than earlier fights for civil rights, we will win by 
reaching out to each other. </p>
<p>You know, the Republicans think they've re-invented the wheel by trying to build coalitions, too. In 
another of those tiresome articles about how those clever Republicans are supposedly remaking the 
capital, The Washington Post this week quotes a vice president of the Heritage Foundation as 
saying: &quot;There are different groups of conservatives who really believe the same thing but don't 
know it.&quot; </p>
<p>The article goes on to say they want to build coalitions not between liberals and conservatives, but 
among conservatives with different agendas, namely taxes, the environment, family values, even the 
elimination of entire departments of the federal government. This phenomenal insight that probably 
took years of deep thinking to uncover is, of course, what those of us in progressive politics have 
always understood to be the essence of activism in our democracy. Inclusive politics. Building 
bridges. Allowing for dissenting views. Eliminating unnecessary barriers and glass ceilings. </p>
<p>Look at me; look at where I am today. I can tell you from my heart, I am a proud Latina, but I 
know the long road I've traveled was paved not just by my own people, but also by many others 
working at coalition building, creating a whole greater than the sum of the parts. Within the 
AFL-CIO, the historic New Voice campaign has brought together the entire labor movement as 
never before, with the unions represented in this room feeling they are truly on equal footing in the 
federation. </p>
<p>We are witnessing in West Virginia, for example, the increasingly influential ACT Foundation -- 
composed of building and construction trades unions -- reaching out to environmentalists to put the 
brakes on the development of a pulp and paper mill unless it's built with West Virginia labor and 
using the safest and cleanest technology. It's not a perfect marriage, but so far by working together 
they've successfully overcome the governor, the federal government and a multibillion dollar 
international corporate giant that, after six years and counting, is very frustrated at not having its 
way. </p>
<p>Here's another grand coalition that is succeeding: Throughout the nation last year and this year, the 
working men and women of the AFL-CIO have stood shoulder to shoulder with community 
groups, with seniors and with people of all ages with disabilities to get the message out that we will 
not permit that como se llama, Newt Gingrich, to destroy Medicare, Medicaid and college loans 
while giving corporate America and the rich one more tax break. We've hit radical right members 
of the House with wave after wave of media advertising, demonstrations and we have driven the 
budget negotiations. </p>
<p>And it is because we need to mount an even bigger effort to inform the American public about what 
the Gingrich Republicans are doing that the AFL-CIO today is three days into our latest media buy 
-- a one-week, million-dollar run aimed at 27 robotic &quot;Newtoids&quot; marching in lockstep with the 
House speaker. One of the keys in labor's increasing visibility in all these campaigns is ever-greater 
emphasis on education and providing more information. No longer will we allow our enemies to get 
away with mischaracterizing us and our positions. We will not stay on the sidelines as others 
attempt to label working men and women as &quot;special interests&quot;. Those common interests I 
mentioned earlier are the core beliefs shared by virtually all Americans. </p>
<p>We've gotten quite a response already to this media campaign. Many of the freshman Republicans 
targeted are squealing like stuffed little pigs. They don't like it when someone calls them on the 
carpet by pointing out their votes to their constituents. Congress may still run itself like a circus, but 
the Republican fun-ride is over. They're not nearly as full of themselves today as they were just a 
few months ago, when they were carrying on about their &quot;Contract on America.&quot; </p>
<p>Those freshman clown-arounds must have thought no one would pay any attention when it came 
time to spell out in a serious way what their public policy agenda would mean for working families, 
for seniors, for students, for poor children, for people with disabilities, for single mothers. Brothers 
and sisters, that's our coalition. </p>
<p>Organized labor, through the AFL-CIO and its affiliated unions, is determined to bring that coalition 
together by devoting enormous time and resources to a year-long campaign we call &quot;America 
Needs a Raise.&quot; In early spring, the AFL-CIO will begin to hold hearings on the low-wage 
economy in communities across the country. We will ask working men and women what is 
happening to their jobs, their paychecks and to their family budgets. We'll take our show on the 
road -- from Iowa to New Hampshire, from the South to the Midwest and the Far West, to put the 
issue of wages at the center of political debate. </p>
<p>We're going to make family incomes the central political issue of 1996. Why?<br>
In a prophetic article in The New York Times last January, Louis Uchitelle brought it all into focus. 
&quot;Something is wrong with America's economic boom,&quot; he wrote. &quot;After four years of everstronger 
growth, people's wages should be going up faster than their expenses. For most people, they're 
not, and this is the first time in decades that a recovery has gone so long without putting more 
money in more pockets. And now, if the recovery runs out of steam in 1995 --- as so many 
economists predict --- that money might never show up.&quot; </p>
<p>What happened is that we've changed from a country concerned with raising the standard of living 
for all to a nation concerned only with raising wealth for a few. Between 1947 and 1973, the 
median paychecks of American workers more than doubled -- and the bottom 20 percent enjoyed 
the biggest gains. Since 1973, median earnings have fallen by about 15 percent, and the bottom 20 
percent have fallen the furthest behind. More than 40 percent of all earnings gains have gone to the 
richest 1 percent. Meanwhile, wealth became even more concentrated. The top 20 percent of all 
households now control more than 55 percent of all wealth. The rest of us -- 80 percent of all 
American households -- get to split the rest. </p>
<p>In every speech John and Rich and I make, we try to make this simple point: America needs a 
raise. And this year, we're going to demand that every candidate for public office tell working 
Americans how they'll get them a raise. We're going to hang a sign in the headquarters of every 
man or woman we support and it's going to read, &quot;It's wages, stupid.&quot; Come this September, we 
are going to organize and mobilize working Americans around the fundamental issue of raising 
wages and increasing incomes. If Americans vote on the issue of who can lift the poor and secure 
the middle class, I am confident they will make the right choices for president and Congress. </p>
<p>If we take that message to every workplace and every polling place, then we will win. And we can 
begin to close the gap between those who do the work of America and those who control their 
lives and livelihoods. </p>
<p>This is a great time to be part of the trade union movement in the U.S. Lots of people who think 
they're real smart have been writing us off for years, but here we are, in the middle of the biggest 
political dogfight in a very long time, battling to keep Newt from reversing more than 50 years of 
progress. </p>
<p>As I look around this room, I see the face of America. That same Washington Post article I 
referred to earlier also quotes some Republican genius as saying that people like us are simply on 
the wrong side of history, and that we just have to deal with it. Well, history is made by doers, not 
talkers. In the last several months I've had the opportunity to travel throughout the entire country. 
The American labor movement today is becoming a surging force for change. Evidently those 
Republican think-tank boys have a hearing problem, because they're missing the squealing &quot;oink, 
oink, oink&quot; we're provoking among their House freshman. </p>
<p>We have an obligation in 1996 to continue to get out our message, to work in our communities, to 
walk the walk. And when we do that, united, we will move our agenda of shared, common 
interests forward. Together, we can make history. </p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<h3 align=center>Remarks by John Sweeney President, AFL-CIO National Press Club 
December 15, 1995 </h3>
<p>Thank you for inviting me to speak with you on behalf of American workers and their families. </p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I had the honor of joining President Clinton's journey of peacemaking all across 
Ireland. Most Americans think of the problem in Northern Ireland as a religious and political divide 
-- and, of course, it is. But it is important to understand that this generation of &quot;the troubles&quot; began 
because of an economic divide, as well. </p>
<p>In 1968, large numbers of Catholics began to protest against the discrimination that denied them 
good jobs in growing industries. They were inspired, in part, by the civil rights struggle in our own 
country, which was a movement for jobs and freedom. </p>
<p>After more than a quarter-century of struggle, progress is being made. That is why one of our first 
stops in Northern Ireland was at the Mackie Engineering Works plant in Belfast. </p>
<p>For years, that plant was a symbol of discrimination and division. Now it is a symbol of progress 
and peace. On the shop floor, Catholics and Protestants work together. At the bargaining table, 
labor and management are cooperating. Productivity, profits and wages are all rising, and 
management is investing in new equipment and new jobs. </p>
<p>The lesson is clear: When there is dignity for everyone, everyone wins. </p>
<p>What is happening at Mackie may happen throughout Northern Ireland. Thanks in large measure to 
President Clinton's brave peacemaking, Catholics and Protestants, Dublin and London, are closer 
together than at any time in a generation. In that land of pain and poetry, hope and healing may 
finally prevail over division and despair. </p>
<p>That is why I found more joyous optimism on the streets of Derry and Belfast than I've seen in 
Detroit or the Bronx. In fact, I felt mixed feelings coming back from the peacemaking in Ireland to 
the problems here at home. </p>
<p>The conflict at Caterpillar, the newspaper strike in Detroit, the contract talks in New York City and 
the difficulties here in Washington, from the District Building to Capitol Hill, almost made me miss 
the relative tranquility of Belfast. </p>
<p>Of course, that journey made me prouder than ever of everything America is doing to make peace 
in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and the Balkans. </p>
<p>I am here today to talk about what we can do to reach another historic agreement: a new social 
compact between business and labor. To find new ways to grow the American economy, 
American companies and American wages in the new world economy. And to bridge the growing 
gap between the great majority of Americans who are working longer and harder for less and the 
fortunate few who are prospering as never before. </p>
<p>Andy Warhol used to say that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes. Here at the National Press 
Club, you give your speakers 20 minutes. I promise you that, before my 20 minutes is up, I'll give 
you a preview of what labor will do next year and a prediction about the 1996 elections. </p>
<p>To the journalists here today, let me offer this advice: The biggest story of our times will be whether 
America can find a way to restore the sense that we are all moving and advancing together, not 
sinking separately. </p>
<p>I am a product of the social compact that lifted America out of the Great Depression and lifted 
working Americans into the middle class. </p>
<p>My father was an Irish immigrant, a New York City bus driver and a proud member of the 
Transport Workers Union. Some of my earliest memories are of going to union meetings with him. 
We'd listen to Mike Quill -- whose brogue was better than some I heard in Dublin and Derry -- 
explain paycheck economics to workers and their families. </p>
<p>Those were tough times. But working people, business people and public officials shared certain 
understandings -- a social contract, if you will. </p>
<p>Here's what working people knew: If we got up every morning and did our jobs, then we could 
earn a better life for ourselves and a better chance for our children. </p>
<p>Here's what business people knew: If they paid their workers fairly and plowed some of their 
profits back into their communities, they could count on loyal employees and loyal consumers. For 
companies back then, good citizenship was good business. </p>
<p>And here's what our leaders in government understood -- and President Kennedy said it best -- &quot;A 
rising tide lifts all boats.&quot; </p>
<p>For almost 30 years after winning World War II, we all prospered because we prospered together. 
We were concerned with raising the standard of living for all Americans -- not just accumulating 
enormous wealth for a fortunate few. That social compact was a formula for the strongest 
economy, the largest middle class and the most successful society this world has ever known. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, those days are gone. You all have reported what happened: the oil embargo of 
1973; global economic competition; new technologies; and the deregulation of the domestic 
economy, from transportation to communications. </p>
<p>Business found new ways to compete -- ways that may succeed in the short term but which, I 
submit to you, are short-sighted and ultimately self-destructive. </p>
<p>They competed, not by American teamwork and American knowhow, but by driving down labor 
costs. Caught in an unforgiving global economy, corporate America too often squeezed the last 
possible ounce of productivity out of American workers, and then threw them on the scrap-heap of 
unemployment or old age, with reduced pensions and health coverage. </p>
<p>Consider the stories you've reported on the business page: </p>
<p>Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank announce a merger that will put 12,000 people out of work 
----- and their stock goes up. Does a rising tide now sink all ships --- except for the luxury yachts? </p>
<p>And what's wrong with this picture: Caterpillar is doing great, racking up record profits, enjoying 
great productivity. So they decide to install a two-tier wage system, schedule work on the 
weekends without paying overtime and reject pattern bargaining. They force thousands of workers 
out on strike, commit 300 unfair labor practices and rack up more record profits. </p>
<p>Caterpillar says it did it to stay competitive with Kamatsu. Baloney!<br>
Kamatsu is struggling with a global market share below 3 percent, while Caterpillar has the lion's 
share. Know why? Because the United States government has spent American tax dollars fronting 
them into emerging nations in Europe, including Russia, and helping arrange financing for their 
operations through the World Bank! </p>
<p>And, finally, how about this picture: The state of Arizona and the city of Phoenix bail America West 
Airlines out of bankruptcy with more than $100 million dollars in tax breaks and revenue bonds. 
The airline agrees not to contract out hangar jobs and rebounds with 11 straight quarters of 
profitability and stacks up $300 million in reserves. Then the Teamsters crank up an organizing 
drive aimed at machinists working for America West. America West shows its respect for our 
labor laws and thanks the community by illegally firing 500 $35,000-a-year machinists and 
contracting out their jobs to a company in Everett, Washington, where machinists make only 
$21,000. </p>
<p>That happened last Friday. How many of you want to fly in an airplane that's just been repaired by 
a $21,000-a-year rookie mechanic? Raise your hands. </p>
<p>For American workers and their families, these are snapshots from hell. They paint an ugly portrait 
of an economy that has lost respect for workers and the jobs they do. </p>
<p>In a prophetic article in The New York Times last January, Lou Uchitelle added words to the 
pictures. &quot;Something is wrong with America's economic boom,&quot; he wrote. &quot;After four years of 
ever-stronger growth, people's wages should be going up faster than their expenses. For most 
people, they're not, and this is the first time in decades that a recovery has gone so long without 
putting more money in more pockets. And now, if the recovery runs out of steam in 1995 --- as so 
many economists predict --- that money might never show up.&quot; </p>
<p>You have reported what this means for workers: Between 1947 and 1973, the median paychecks 
of American workers more than doubled -- and the bottom 20 percent enjoyed the biggest gains. 
But since 1973, median earnings have fallen by about 15 percent, and the bottom 20 percent have 
fallen the furthest behind. More than 40 percent of all earnings gains have gone to the richest 1 
percent. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, wealth became even more concentrated. The top 20 percent of all households now 
control more than 55 percent of all wealth. The rest of us -- 80 percent of all American households 
- </p>
<ul>
<li>get to split the rest. </li>
</ul>
<p>Profits are up. Productivity is up. Executive compensation is up. The stock market is up. Worker 
wages and health benefits and pensions are down. </p>
<p>Now, you're reporting how great gaps in wages and wealth are hurting American companies and 
the American economy. Think of the hardworking Iowa family Susan Sheehan describes in a recent 
article in the New Yorker. </p>
<p>Bonita and Kenny Merton live with their two sons in a small home they own in Des Moines. Kenny 
once had an $11-an-hour job before the factory closed. Last year, he made $17,239 hauling sand 
sacks. Bonita made $13,977 working full time at Luther Park Nursing home. After 15 years, she's 
paid $7.40 an hour, gets a ham at Easter, a turkey at Thanksgiving, $10 for her birthday and $20 at 
Christmas. She pays $36 a month for health insurance, $28 a month for dental coverage and gets 
no pension. Every year they go further and further in debt and there is no hope of ever doing better. 
Kenny says, &quot;There ain't no middle class no more. There's only rich and poor.&quot; </p>
<p>Now, ask yourself whether families like the Mertons are spending confidently this holiday season. 
American workers are running out of money, running out of hope and are loaded with debt. That's 
why retail sales are lagging; why manufacturers are loaded with inventory; and why they cut 32,000 
jobs last month. Macy's figured out a new way this week to blame the worker: to compensate for 
plunging sales, they cut the commissions of their clerks. </p>
<p>And can you imagine in the middle of all of this, the Republicans giving a tax break to the rich by 
declaring all-out war on the programs and policies Kenny and Bonita depend on just for survival? </p>
<p>You may have seen the television commercials we're running during the current budget battle. In 
one of them, Father Julio Perez, a priest in Miami, sums it up for all of us when, with his eyes filled 
with tear,s he says: &quot;I came to America in 1954. What a country we had then. What happened to 
America?&quot; </p>
<p>America is becoming edgier, angrier and meaner. Until we ease the growing gaps in work, wages 
and wealth, you will be sending more dispatches from a wounded nation -- more militia 
movements, more bombings, more hate crimes and more of the quiet anguish of Americans losing 
their sense of a common destiny and a common purpose. America will become more like the 
trouble spots where we send our sons and daughters to keep the peace. </p>
<p>So what can we do about it? </p>
<p>Of course, American business must change. But I stand before you today as president of the 
AFL-CIO because American labor must also change. </p>
<p>That is why I ran for president of the AFL-CIO, and that is why I won. We understand that while 
the world and the workplace changed, labor stood still and lost ground. </p>
<p>Just as today I challenge business to change, every day on my job I challenge labor to change. </p>
<p>First, we have to reach out to unorganized workers -- because that is the only way we can build a 
stronger movement. For too long, too many unions have seemed satisfied with a shrinking 
membership base. As our membership strength has declined, so has our bargaining power. It used 
to be that strong unions lifted all workers up; now, non-union employers are dragging all workers 
down. </p>
<p>Here's the truth: Our weakness encouraged employers to take the low road. Only by rebuilding our 
strength can we bring American business back to the high road of high wages. That is why I am 
challenging every union and every level of our labor movement to do what the fastest-growing 
unions do: Put at least 30 percent of our resources into organizing. That is why we will be training at 
least a thousand organizers a year, pouring $20 million into organizing programs -- and organizing 
from the Sunbelt to the Rustbelt and from health care to high tech. </p>
<p>That is why we are rebuilding our grass roots political strength, training candidates and training 
political organizers. Yesterday, I told a gathering of 30 Democratic senators they can also expect 
an end to checkbook politics: we're going to demand a voice for the working people of this country 
in setting strategies, defining messages and issues and a hand in running campaigns. </p>
<p>Second, we have to reach out to management -- from a position of strength -- because that is the 
only way we can build a stronger, high-wage economy. </p>
<p>We can no longer afford the luxury of pretending that productivity, quality and competitiveness are 
not our business. They are our business, our jobs and our paychecks. Too many workers have 
suffered because of failed and foolish, shortsighted management policies. We need to follow the 
example of workers and their unions in companies and government agencies and school systems 
across the country who are winning a voice in improving the products they make and the services 
they deliver. </p>
<p>As labor becomes stronger and smarter, we will really be in a position to offer management this 
challenge: </p>
<p>*Take your profits and invest them in growing the American economy, American workers, and 
American wages. </p>
<p>*Offer your workers the training they need for tomorrow's jobs -- not just the big-shots in the 
executive suites, but all your employees. </p>
<p>*Work with your employees and their unions. Give us a voice in decision-making. Give us half a 
chance to improve the quality of our goods and services. That is the path to lasting prosperity -- 
and we want to walk down that road with you. </p>
<p>We will offer this challenge with the confidence that we are prepared for conflict or cooperation -- 
and the choice is management's to make. </p>
<p>Here's an example. In the Boeing contract just ratified by 32,000 Machinists in Washington, 
Oregon and Kansas, management agreed to give the workers and their unions a voice in decisions 
to contract out work --- adequate notice, a chance to bid competitively, retraining and 
meet-and-confer language. It's a tremendous agreement. The only trouble was, we had to strike for 
69 days to get it! </p>
<p>Our challenge to management is to avoid conflict, not promote it. Let's spend our time and our 
money and our energy pursuing higher profits and higher wages. </p>
<p>Next year, we will begin to offer these challenges not only to the leaders of labor and business but 
to all Americans. </p>
<p>Early next spring, the AFL-CIO will begin to hold hearings on falling living standards in 
communities across the country. We will ask working men and women what is happening to their 
jobs, their paychecks and their family budgets. We'll take our show on the road -- from Iowa to 
New Hampshire, from the South to the Midwest and the Far West -- to put the issue of wages at 
the center of political debate. </p>
<p>We want to get even more of the suggestions that already are pouring in from unlikely sources, like 
this letter I got last week from Rusty Hills in East Lansing, Michigan. He says, &quot;As a conservative 
Republican, I suspect you and I part company on most political issues. But as a fellow Catholic, I 
believe strongly in just wages and an equitable distribution of profits.&quot; He goes on to make a 
recommendation: that we bargain wages by comparing the percentage increase in executive 
compensation to percentage increases for workers over the past 10 years. </p>
<p>In every speech I give, from the Press Club to the picket lines, I try to make this simple point: 
America needs a raise. Next year, we'll be asking every candidate for public office to tell working 
Americans how they'll get them a raise. </p>
<p>Then in June, we're going to start a Union Summer, as we send a thousand college students and 
young workers to organize voter registration and living wage campaigns across the country. We're 
going to begin a dialogue with working America -- union members and future members, alike. </p>
<p>And, come September, we'll have a Union Fall, as we organize and mobilize working Americans 
around the fundamental issue of raising wages and increasing incomes. If Americans vote on the 
issue of who can lift the poor and secure the middle class, I am confident they will make the right 
choices for president and Congress. </p>
<p>Here's my prediction for 1996: If the Republicans continue to pursue their extremist economic 
agenda and Bill Clinton continues to stand tall against it, we will win back the House and re-elect 
our president. Somebody said the Republicans won the last election by saying, &quot;They took it from 
you and gave it to them,&quot; meaning poor people. We can win this one by saying, &quot;They tried to take 
it from you and give it to themselves.&quot; </p>
<p>If we take that message to every workplace and every polling place, then we will win. And we can 
begin to close the gap between those who do the work of America and those who control their 
lives and livelihoods. </p>
<p>I believe that, in the words of the Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney, whose writings 
inspired so many fighters for peace and justice: &quot;History says don't hope on this side of the grave. 
But, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up -- and hope and history 
rhyme.&quot; </p>
<p>Soon, you will see our labor movement &quot;rising up,&quot; like &quot;the longed-for tidal wave of justice.&quot; And 
working men and women will once again make &quot;hope and history rhyme.&quot; </p>

<title>SP 12/14/95 -- Sweeney on SEIU L. 509 Representation</title>

<body>
<h3 align="center">Remarks by John J. Sweeney, President, AFL-CIO
on the Occasion of the Signing of Voluntary Recognition Procedure
Agreement Between Service Employees International Union Local 509
and Commonwealth of Massachusetts-funded Human Service Providers </h3>
<p><b>December 14, 1995 </b></p>
<p>Thank you. It really is a pleasure to be here. </p>
<p>It's a measure of how significant I think this event is -- for
the labor movement, for the entire employer community, for the
human service provider community and for those of us who believe
in the public sector's responsibility for the most unfortunate
among us-- that I changed my schedule so that I could join you
today, add my name to those of these visionary employers and
local union leaders, and still get back to Washington, D.C. for a
meeting with Democratic leaders who are searching for a humane
solution to our nation's budget crisis. </p>
<p>Two months ago, at the AFL-CIO convention in New York City,
there was a great debate about how workers and their unions
should relate to employers in our new economy. In his keynote
address, my old friend and former rival, Tom Donahue, said he was
more interested in &quot;building bridges than in blocking
bridges.&quot; He was referring to one of our SEIU locals in
Washington, D.C. blocking our busiest bridge across the Potomac
during rush hour one morning. </p>
<p>I responded by saying that when employers and other powerful
people refuse to respect working people, we have a moral
obligation to block bridges and even go to jail to dramatize
their plight. But, I was careful to add, I believe in building
bridges any time the shelling stops long enough for us to start
pouring concrete and putting up steel. </p>
<p>And that's what we're marking today -- the decision to stop
the shelling. These employers are choosing not to pick up the
traditional weapons of management anti-unionism. The union is
choosing not to base its strategy for growth in this industry on
knee-jerk anti-management rhetoric. And as is often the byproduct
of a cease-fire, a truly mutually beneficial peace can grow. </p>
<p>We are here to say that in exchange for these employers'
willingness to allow their employees to make a truly free choice
about whether or not to support unionization </p>
<p>without their discouragement, Local 509 (backed both by the
SEIU and my own office as President of the AFL-CIO) has committed
to form a &quot;New Partnership&quot; with these employers if
their employees choose 509 representation. </p>
<p>What's our notion of a partnership? The partnership has at its
core a shared commitment to provide the highest quality of care
to the people these agencies serve at the greatest value to the
taxpayers. The parties have committed to working together
aggressively in order to win the kind of support -- both
political and financial -- to enable that quality, cost-effective
care to continue to improve. It is a relationship of mutual
institutional respect: the union will recognize both the
responsibilities and difficulties of managing for quality care in
such a discouraging political and economic environment;
management will recognize that the union is the collective voice
of their employees and that it also has the responsibility and
right to organize and represent the voice of its members in
decisions which affect them. </p>
<p>The fact that these four agency directors and their Boards of
Directors have made this leap is a credit to their individual and
institutional courage and vision. Most importantly, it is a sign
of their real commitment to the people they serve. They have made
that commitment more important than historical enmity; more
important than old-fashioned notions of managerial prerogative;
more important than the cynicism and criticism of their peers.
SEIU and the AFL-CIO will not forget that commitment. We always
do our best to make unionization pay off for our members. We are
now committed to doing our part to make sure that it pays off for
these agencies and for the people we serve.</p>

<title>SP 12/8/95 Sweeney to Calif Assoc of Public Hospitals</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<p align=center>Remarks by John J. Sweeney<br>
President, AFL-CIO </p>
<p align=center>California Association of Public Hospitals<br>
San Francisco<br>
December 8, 1995 </p>
<p>Thank you for that generous introduction --- its great to be here in San Francisco and to be greeted 
by a warm welcome as well as warm weather. </p>
<p>This is the first major speech I've made to a health care group since being elected president of the 
AFL-CIO and I'm delighted it is taking place here in the Bay area where my union, the Service 
Employees Union, has such deep roots. </p>
<p>Our great local union 250 here in San Francisco is the oldest health care union in America. It was 
started by low-wage workers at San Francisco General in the early 1930s and by 1941 it could 
claim the first master contract in the hospital industry. </p>
<p>Today, SEIU locals 250, 790, 535, 1000, 616, 707 and 715 represent more than 60,000 health 
care workers in Northern California. SEIU is now the biggest union in the state with close to 
300,000 members from Bakersfield to San Diego and I bring you their greetings and good wishes 
at during this holiday season. </p>
<p>I also bring you greetings from the 13 million members of the AFL-CIO and from the one and 
one-half million health care workers included in those ranks. </p>
<p>Six weeks ago at the AFL-CIO convention in New York City, there was a great debate about 
how workers and their unions should relate to employers in our new &quot;winner take all&quot; economy. </p>
<p>In his keynote address, my old friend and former rival, Tom Donahue, said he was more interested 
in &quot;building bridges than in blocking bridges.&quot; He was referring to one of our SEIU locals in 
Washington blocking our busiest bridge across the Potomac during rush hour one morning. </p>
<p>I responded by saying that when our employers and other powerful people refuse to listen to the 
working people we represent, then we have a moral obligation to block bridges and even go to jail 
to dramatize their plight. But, I was careful to add, I believe in building bridges any time the shelling 
stops long enough for us to start pouring concrete and putting up steel! </p>
<p>This morning, I'm here to try and build a bridge or two and talk about the need for a rejuvenation of 
our labor-management partnership in public health care. For those of you who are more of the 
&quot;bridge-blocking&quot; school, I invite you to join me at 2121 Pine Street at 12:30 this afternoon as we 
march and demonstrate on behalf of the embattled employees of the Hillhaven nursing home chain! </p>
<p>I can't think of a place where management needs labor as a partner more than in public health. 
Historically, we've been bound together by our deep common interest in the patients we serve and 
together we've built and maintained a system that is characterized as much by compassion as it is 
by competency. </p>
<p>Now we face changes that are unparalleled in our years of joint advocacy and our ability to work 
together is being challenged as never before. </p>
<p>I'm going to address some of those changes and challenges in a moment, but I want to ask for your 
help in fighting one battle there is no time to debate over. </p>
<p>Please take out a pen or pencil and write down these two numbers. The first is 
1-800-96-AFL-CIO and the second number is 1-800-97-AFL-CIO. Sometime today, call one of 
those numbers. They will automatically kick your call into the switchboard at the U.S. Capitol, 
toll-free. No matter what part of the country you are from, ask to speak to your Representative 
and when you get their office on the phone, tell them to back off the massive cuts in Medicare and 
Medicaid they are proposing. </p>
<p>Then make two more calls, to Senators Boxer and Feinstein and tell them to keep up the good 
work. Then make a last call, this time at your own expense. Make a &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;please&quot; call 
to President Clinton at 202-456-1111. Tell him &quot;thank you for vetoing the Republican budget bill&quot; 
and then say &quot;please, please don't let Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole back you down!&quot; </p>
<p>Those toll-free AFL-CIO hotline numbers are the action end of a grass-roots lobbying campaign 
we've been running for the past four months to battle the Medicare and Medicaid budget cuts. In 
the summer and early fall, we spent $4 million on media in targeted House districts and ginned up 
270,000 telephone calls -- plus about 200,000 postcards to President Clinton. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, we purchased another million dollars worth of radio and television time and also 
dropped a million pieces of mail into those same targeted districts. We're also staging events and 
press conferences in 22 of the districts. </p>
<p>I recount all this to you in hopes you will appreciate what the men and women of the AFL-CIO are 
doing to preserve Medicare and Medicaid. And I want you to know we will continue to fight for as 
long as it takes to preserve our health care system in general and to preserve and improve our 
public health system in particular. And I want you to fight with equal vigor because we may all be 
gone if these cuts go through. </p>
<p>My union, the Service Employees Union, is the biggest health care union in North America, so I 
don't need on-the-job training in my new position when it comes to public health. SEIU represents 
475,000 health care workers, half of them in the public sector. Here in California we represent 
nearly 100,000 service workers, technicians, nurse aides and nurses in hospitals, nursing homes, 
home health agencies ambulatory clinics, blood banks, public health programs and HMOs. </p>
<p>We've always worked closely with your national association, the National Association of Public 
Hospitals, and we've begun to establish a working relationship with CAPH here in California. </p>
<p>I hope you will take my presence here today as the strongest possible indication that I intend to 
continue, nurture and expand those relationships in my new position as head of our national labor 
federation. We cannot and must not allow the violent forces now battering our health care system 
to damage our mutual commitment to the mission of public health, which is to provide high quality 
medical care to everyone who needs it, no matter how poor they are, no matter how old, no matter 
how sick, no matter what color and no matter what their immigration status! </p>
<p>Through much of this conference, you've been struggling with how to restructure our public health 
systems so they can survive and continue to provide quality health care for all. Our unions are 
struggling with how to represent health care workers in an environment where cost cutting 
pressures most often mean cutting back staff and redesigning jobs. </p>
<p>Together, we need to figure out how to gain control over the restructuring that is transforming our 
system of providers and payors. How we can maintain a strong role for government in assuring 
health care to all in an environment that favors market reform over government reform. How we 
can fight the Republican agenda of massive cuts in Medicare and Medicaid to fund tax cuts for the 
wealthy. How we can fight deregulation of health care. How we can build a public health system 
that works more efficiently without hurting patients and workers. </p>
<p>Cuts in Medicare and Medicaid have already triggered great changes that are squeezing health care 
workers and raising concerns about quality and access. Our members are telling us that patient 
loads are 50 percent higher than they should be. Nurses say they don't have enough time to spend 
with their patients. A rash of high profile clinical errors in hospitals across the country has captured 
the attention of the media and the general public. </p>
<p>Now there are new threats: more Medicaid and Medicare cuts at the federal level; questions about 
managed care; state and local funding cutbacks; the growing ranks of the uninsured and the poor; 
challenges of substance abuse and violence; and the unwillingness of private sector health care to 
help provide a safety net. </p>
<p>Our projections are that 1.7 million health care workers could lose their jobs, for instance, as a 
result of the proposed cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. Many of those who keep their jobs will be 
faced with moving from hospitals into outpatient settings, with all the professional as well as 
personal stress that attends such uprooting. </p>
<p>Our unions know that we face drastic cuts in funding, no matter how successful we are at lobbying. 
And we know that means we all face tough choices. But, as I have said in city after city over the 
past year, we will not sit silent seeing families ripped to their roots while many of the experts who 
got us into this mess in the first place exclude us from the decisions affecting our future. </p>
<p>We must be full partners. Not only because we have a common interest in serving our community 
and serving the poor, but because we represent experienced workers who have valid and 
worthwhile ideas for change and who have first-hand knowledge of the problems of their 
communities. </p>
<p>We know such partnerships can work, but they are hard to come by. In Boston, for instance, we 
were faced with the merger between Boston City Hospital, which is mostly unionized, and a 
private, mostly non-union facility serving a totally different population. </p>
<p>We were willing to be flexible, to be open for change, but we demanded to be part of the process. 
We had to organize and fight like hell for public health and worker protections, but we got them. 
We are still seen by the private hospital as an impediment to change, but we're working together 
now and the merger will go through by July 1996. </p>
<p>In Los Angeles, we were faced with a more horrendous situation, as you all know. With a $655 
million deficit, the county was faced with the closure of hospitals and clinics and cuts in services to 
thousands of poor patients as well as the loss of jobs for thousands of workers. Early on, we 
offered to cooperate and we were willing to help get federal and state relief if worker and 
consumer issues could be addressed. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the county manager tried to close us out of the decisions and we had to spends 
weeks and weeks in the streets and in the media to get our concerns addressed. To their credit, the 
county supervisors took control of the process and established a task force that allowed us to begin 
working together more effectively. I went to work in Washington and the Service Employees Union 
went to work in Sacramento. We came out batting .500 with enough money from President Clinton 
to bail things out temporarily. Instead of losing 12,000 jobs, we lost 1,600. But the safety net in 
Los Angeles, however tattered, is still in place. </p>
<p>I want to say one word to the Los Angeles County officials who are here with us today, and it has 
to do with the privatization of clinics. Seven clinics have been privatized and 22 more are 
scheduled. To preserve bargaining rights for the workers who are our members, you made us go 
door to door and have them sign union cards. We signed up a majority in six of the first seven 
clinics. Now we ask that you sit down with us and help figure out a way to continue union 
representation without having to drain our treasury and exhaust our organizers to do it. </p>
<p>We've made real headway in establishing a new partnership. The AFL-CIO is ready to help build 
more such partnerships, to build the kinds of bridges we need in order to preserve our public health 
system. But in places like Los Angeles County, we need a little more quid pro quo to keep things 
moving. </p>
<p>For the next two weeks, we all need to be concerned with minimizing the damage to Medicare and 
Medicaid. Then we need to begin a forceful dialogue about legislative and political strategies at the 
state level to help preserve our systems. </p>
<p>There is no single solution and there are no easy answers, so we need genuine collaboration and a 
genuine commitment to making hard choices. </p>
<p>For labor's part, we will insist on being participants in developing proposals for restructuring and 
we're going to increase our strength by aggressively organizing across the country. </p>
<p>The principles we're guided by are in the best interest of public health and the best interest of 
consumers as well as in the best interest of health care workers. </p>
<p>We want serious consideration of alternatives to privatization or closures, such as creation of public 
health authorities, to help continue the public health mission and tradition.<br>
We want restructuring proposals to recognize the rights of health care workers and their unions, 
and the right of unorganized workers to unionize without management interference or coercion. And 
we want communities, as well as workers and their unions, fully involved in discussing and deciding 
on strategies and tactics for the actual restructuring plans. </p>
<p>If we can reach these kinds of accords, together we can fight effectively to guarantee adequate 
funding, for public policies that ensure high quality care and strengthen communitybased care. And 
we can hold the private sector to our own high standards of access as well as quality. </p>
<p>We must identify our common agenda. We must work together to re-establish the public's trust in 
public service. And we must flex the political muscle it takes to preserve public health care. </p>
<p>Our local unions here in California are ready to work with you. </p>
<p>And our international unions and the AFL-CIO in Washington are ready to work with you. </p>
<p>Let's get to work. </p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<pre>                       Remarks by John J. Sweeney
                           President, AFL-CIO
</pre>
<h3 align=center>Hillhaven Rally December 8, 1995 San Francisco </h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we are here today to deliver a message to the Hillhaven Corporation. </p>
<p>We are here today to deliver a message to every for-profit hospital, HMO, home care agency and 
nursing home chain in California. </p>
<p>We are here today to deliver a message to every elected official and community leader in California 
and to every woman and man in this great state who believes in decency and dignity and justice. </p>
<p>Our message is: we will not give in to corporate greed. </p>
<p>And I am here to deliver another message. It's a message to the families of the courageous 
Vencor/Hillhaven workers who have given their hearts and their hands to build this giant nursing 
home chain. </p>
<p>Our message is: the AFL-CIO will stand beside you in your hour of need. </p>
<p>This is not a strike about slashing wages; this is a strike about putting profits before patients. </p>
<p>This isn't a strike about benefits; this is about permanently replacing workers who exercised their 
right to strike for ONE DAY ..... the first workers in the Bay area in recent memory to be 
permanently replaced. </p>
<p>This isn't a strike about working conditions; it's a strike about squeezing the last ounce of 
productivity out of workers and then throwing them in the street. </p>
<p>What's wrong with this picture: </p>
<p>Productivity is up. Profits are up. So the company wants to squeeze a little more out of low-wage 
women workers. </p>
<p>I'll tell you what's wrong with this picture --- there's no respect for workers or the jobs they do or 
the contribution they make, and this strike is not going to end until we regain that respect. </p>
<p>You are not alone: your story is being played out in every workplace in America ---productivity up, 
profits up, workers down. </p>
<p>What you are doing here is an inspiration to other unions and to other workers across our country 
--- we've learned the hard way that an injury to one is an injury to all. </p>
<p>And that is why 13 million members of the AFL-CIO are committed to you and to your cause --- 
we are going to start proving that a victory for one is a victory for all! </p>
<p>We're going to do whatever it takes, work as hard as it takes, and stick with it as long as it takes to 
help Hillhaven workers win the respect you have earned and deserve. </p>
<p>And in doing so, we will send a massive message to every greedy, short-sighted employer in this 
country: honor American work, honor American workers, honor American working families. </p>
<p>America works because we do, and when we stop working, America stops working!</p>

<h3 align="center">Remarks by John J. Sweeney President, AFL-CIO
Association for a Better New York December 6, 1995 </h3>
<p>For me, this speech is like a homecoming. New York is where my
family built a new life in a new land; where I got my education
and my start in the labor movement; and where, six weeks ago, I
got an honor and a responsibility beyond my greatest dreams --
the leadership of the national labor federation, the AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>Addressing this audience, I feel like I'm among old friends.
Whether you're leaders in business, labor, government, education
or community service, I feel we're bound together by the values
we share -- the sense of mutual responsibility that defines this
city and this nation at their best. If I come here with a
warning, rest assured that it's a friendly warning -- a call to
action from one friend to another, so that, together, we can
avoid a danger that threatens us all. </p>
<p>For the past six weeks, I've been trying to live up to my
campaign commitment of not just sitting behind a desk in
Washington. So I've been crisscrossing the country trying to
solve some of the awful confrontations I inherited. </p>
<p>We have Boeing workers out on strike in Seattle; newspaper
workers out at the Detroit News; paperworkers still out after 30
months at Staley in Decatur, Illinois; and a big dispute
involving hospital workers brewing at Kaiser in Northern
California. </p>
<p>I have to begin by congratulating the Teamsters' track workers
for their success in bringing Metro-North to terms. They
conceived and carried out a brilliant strike strategy. And the
entire labor movement takes pride and encouragement at what they
were able to accomplish. </p>
<p>As some of you know, at the AFL-CIO convention here in New
York six weeks ago, there was a great debate about the kind of
tactics our labor movement should use. </p>
<p>In his keynote address, my old friend and former rival, Tom
Donahue, said he was more interested in &quot;building bridges
than in blocking bridges.&quot; And it became a metaphor for the
issues involved in the election of our reform slate -- and for
the issues facing American workers and American business. </p>
<p>Tom was referring to a Service Employees local representing
janitors in Washington, D.C. They blocked the 14th Street Bridge
for two hours one morning. They were protesting exorbitant tax
breaks for real estate developers at a time when our nation's
capital city is going broke, services are deteriorating, and
working people are suffering.<br>
I responded by saying that, when our employers and other powerful
people refuse to listen to the working families we represent,
then, sometimes, we have to dramatize their plight, with tactics
such as blocking bridges. </p>
<p>But, as I made clear at the convention, I believe in building
bridges any time the shelling stops long enough for us to start
pouring concrete and putting up steel. </p>
<p>We need to build those bridges because we want to be full
partners with our employers, full participants in the economy,
and full citizens of our society. </p>
<p>I want to build bridges between labor and management, so that
American business can be more successful, and American workers
can share in the gains. When we do this, we'll build bridges for
the working poor to climb into the middle class; bridges for the
middle class to continue the great American journey of
generational progress; and bridges over troubled waters in a
nation increasingly divided along the lines of color and class. </p>
<p>At its best, this city and this nation have built these
bridges -- and all our people have benefitted. From the Roosevelt
administration until the Reagan Era, business, labor, and
government in the United States were busier building bridges than
blocking them. </p>
<p>Sure, we had some bumps along the way. But, for the most part,
we reaped the rewards of a unique economic and social compact,
especially here in this city. </p>
<p>My father was a bus driver, a member of the Transport Workers
Union. Some of my earliest memories are of going to union
meetings with him and listening to Mike Quill. Those were tough
times. But you knew that, if you worked hard, you could earn more
money and live a better life. </p>
<p>Employers knew that, if they paid their workers fairly and
plowed a little of their profits back into their communities,
they could count on employee loyalty and healthy consumer
spending, which has always made up two-thirds of our economy. </p>
<p>President Kennedy found a simple but eloquent way to describe
this successful social and economic compact: &quot;A rising tide
lifts all boats.&quot; </p>
<p>When things were good, as they were for almost 30 years after
the end of World War II, we all prospered because we prospered
together. We were concerned with raising the standard of living
for working Americans, not just accumulating enormous wealth for
a fortunate few. </p>
<p>When things broke down, we fixed them -- together. And you
know that better than anyone. </p>
<p>Twenty years ago, when this city faced up to and solved the
worst fiscal crisis in its history, you did it together. </p>
<p>Lew Rudin must have seen it coming when he founded this
organization in 1971. The Association for a Better New York saved
the New York City payroll four times by encouraging the
prepayment of real estate taxes by many of the organizations
represented in this room. You did your part, and you should be
proud. </p>
<p>And labor did its share as well, as people like Ed Cleary and
Jack Sheinkman and Victor Gotbaum recall. </p>
<p>We used our political clout in Albany to pass legislation
allowing the city to abrogate our own contracts. And we poured
our pensions into bonds to keep the city afloat. </p>
<p>We did it because we knew that, when things were better, we
would all recoup our losses -- business and labor alike. We did
it because we had some unwritten rules -- a social compact --
that we lived by. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, those days are gone. </p>
<p>Thanks to the work of the Association for a Better New York,
some semblance of our great labor-business-government compact
continues to function in this city. </p>
<p>But, in the rest of the country -- in Los Angeles and Seattle
and Detroit and Washington, D.C. -- the only rule is that you
take what you can get away with. </p>
<p>After getting whacked by the oil embargo, American business
decided the best way to compete in the global economy was by
driving down labor costs. </p>
<p>Not by innovation, not by Yankee ingenuity, not through
labor-management cooperation, not by insisting on international
social standards and rights for workers ... but by squeezing the
last possible ounce of productivity out of American workers and
then throwing them on the scrapheap of unemployment or old age
with reduced pensions and health insurance coverage. </p>
<p>Since 1979, all of the income growth in our country has gone
to the top 40 percent of households -- and nearly all of that
went to the top 20 percent. Well, that isn't the way America
built the world's largest middle class -- and the world's
strongest economy. </p>
<p>Henry Ford used to say he wanted to pay his workers enough to
afford the cars they were building. </p>
<p>Now, old Henry must be spinning in his grave: The average
price of a car has jumped 70 percent in the past 10 years, while
family incomes have climbed only 40 percent! </p>
<p>The business community, our political leaders, and our mass
media -- they all love to celebrate the American work ethic. But
look at what has happened to the American worker. </p>
<p>Think of the fellow who used to do America's heavy lifting,
the working man whose formal education ended with his high school
diploma. Over the last 20 years, his real income dropped by 30
percent. And now, it takes two and three wage earners to support
a family. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, corporate profits are up, up, up. In fact,
according to Business Week, they're at a 45-year high. </p>
<p>The stock market is up. Productivity is up -- it has been
since the late 1970's -- and it's way out front of compensation. </p>
<p>This past year, workers' wages and benefits increased only 2.8
percent -- the lowest since 1981 -- while productivity was up 3.4
percent. </p>
<p>Twenty years of declining wages and disappearing benefits are
taking their toll on American life. There's a free-floating anger
among hardworking people for whom the American dream is turning
into a handful of ashes. </p>
<p>For a growing number of American workers, blocking bridges
seems like the very mildest form of protest. And that's not what
their union leaders are telling them -- that's what their daily
lives are telling them. </p>
<p>I was in Europe last week, traveling with President Clinton,
and I couldn't help but be impressed with what is going on in
France. </p>
<p>In this country, when we're faced with cuts in vital services
that benefit workers and the poor, we shut down a few parts of
the government. </p>
<p>In France, the workers shut down the country --- even though
only 8 percent of the work force is organized! </p>
<p>I hope it never comes to that here in America. But,
increasingly, American workers are down on their government, down
on their employers, and down on their future. </p>
<p>There's a new Times-Mirror poll that says 66 percent of
Americans are concerned about being able to pay for health care
if a family member gets sick. </p>
<p>Fifty-seven percent are very concerned that their children
will not have good job opportunities. Forty-eight percent say
they are concerned about not having enough money for retirement,
44 percent not having enough to afford college, 34 percent
worried about losing their job or taking a cut in pay. These
numbers are all up 6 and 7 percent over March, 1994. </p>
<p>A majority of the same respondents said they think business
makes too much profit. And the vast majority say business doesn't
value its employees, its customers or the communities they
supposedly serve. </p>
<p>Another poll dramatized how workers feel about their
employers. The great majority of workers, it found, care a great
deal about their work, but they no longer give a damn about their
employers. And that's not surprising when you remember that their
employers don't give a damn about them! </p>
<p>This cycle of cynicism is eating away at our economy, which
depends on consumer confidence and business optimism in order to
thrive. </p>
<p>American workers are running out of money -- and running out
of hope. This holiday season, they are also loaded down with
debt, and that is why retail sales are lagging. And,
increasingly, people are blaming business -- and blaming their
bosses -- for their precarious economic situation. </p>
<p>Are they correct in where they place the blame? Take a look at
this picture: </p>
<p>Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank announce a merger that will
put 12,000 people out of work -- and their stock goes up. </p>
<p>Does a rising tide now sink most ships -- except for the
luxury yachts? </p>
<p>What's wrong with this picture? Caterpillar inventories are
fat, and sales are good, so they decide to install a two-tier
wage system, schedule work on the weekends without paying
overtime, and reject pattern bargaining. </p>
<p>They force their workers out on strike, commit 300 unfair
labor practices, and rack up record profits while they are doing
it. </p>
<p>After a year and a half, the workers are forced to come back
to work without a contract because labor law enforcement is too
slow to help them! </p>
<p>How about this picture, right here at home: </p>
<p>Citibank, which says it has a community commitment to New York
City, decides to cut its building maintenance costs. So it
replaces a cleaning contractor, whose workers are protected by a
contract with an AFL-CIO union, with a contractor covered by a
sweetheart contract with a so-called &quot;independent&quot;
union. </p>
<p>The new contractor replaces career janitors earning $15-anhour
with transients making $7.00-an-hour with no health benefits, who
then have to depend on food stamps, AFDC, rent subsidies, and
charity hospital care just to survive. </p>
<p>Citibank says, &quot;It's not our responsibility.&quot; </p>
<p>And this picture: Gannett and Knight-Ridder are rolling in
dough, so they decide they can afford a big strike. They force
2,000 Detroit News workers into the street for reasonable wages
and job security. K-Mart, which is nearly bankrupt because
American workers don't have enough money to spend, keeps the
strike going. They're the only major advertiser to refuse to pull
their ads. </p>
<p>And this picture: striking machinists finally negotiate a
tentative agreement with Boeing Aircraft to end a 50-day strike.
Boeing torpedoes the settlement by announcing $2.5 million in
executive bonuses on the very day workers are voting! </p>
<p>What's wrong with these pictures? For American workers and
their families, they are snapshots from hell. </p>
<p>Writing in the New York Times last January, Louis Uchitelle
added words to the pictures. </p>
<p>&quot;Something is wrong with America's economic boom,&quot;
he wrote. </p>
<p>&quot;After four years of ever-stronger growth, people's wages
should be going up faster than their expenses. For most people,
they're not, and this is the first time in decades that a
recovery has gone so long without putting more money in more
pockets. And now, if the recovery runs out of steam in 1995 -- as
so many economists predict -- that money might never show
up.&quot; </p>
<p>As The Times and dozens of other media have recently
discovered, raising wages has recently become the number one
issue in our country. And next year's elections will revolve
around who can offer credible ideas not only for generating jobs
but for increasing incomes. Look for some smart candidates and
their campaigns to hang signs in their headquarters with this
slogan: &quot;It's wages, stupid.&quot; </p>
<p>American workers and their families are suffering as they
haven't suffered since the Great Depression. And I'm convinced
that business is going to suffer as well, if we don't close what
is commonly called the &quot;wage gap&quot; and remedy the
excesses of our new &quot;winner take all&quot; economy. </p>
<p>Let me offer all of you a sophisticated economic theory I
learned in college -- the carrot and the stick. The
&quot;stick&quot; is this: </p>
<p>On behalf of workers and their families, the leadership of the
new AFL-CIO is going to challenge our unions to get busy doing
what we are supposed to do. </p>
<p>It's not just happenstance that our nation's 20-year wage
decline has coincided with a 20-year decline in the power and
effectiveness of the labor movement. </p>
<p>I firmly believe, and I know some of you agree, that strong
unions are vital to a thriving, high-wage economy. But, quite
frankly, we haven't been holding up our end of the stick. </p>
<p>As I said in my acceptance speech at the AFL-CIO convention
six weeks ago, our problem is stagnant wages -- America needs a
raise. The solution is a larger, stronger, smarter labor
movement. </p>
<p>We're going to renew and rebuild our labor movement by pouring
vast resources into organizing from the Sunbelt to the Rustbelt
and from software writers to sweatshop workers. Our message to
American workers is simple and but powerful: Whether you wear a
blue collar, a white collar, a new collar, or no collar, we can
help you make your job better. </p>
<p>We're going to be stronger and we are going take it to greedy
employers who've been picking our pockets and then trying to tell
us we stupidly lost our wallets. </p>
<p>Now, let me offer you the &quot;carrot&quot; I promised: </p>
<p>Labor's victories can be your victories, too. With decent
paychecks, we can buy your products and services. </p>
<p>With a little respect -- as that song says -- we can help you
compete in the global economy. We are going to challenge American
business to use our brains as well as our backs, to let workers
and their unions contribute to your decision-making process, to
let us help you make the hard choices that affect our family
budgets as well as your bottom lines. </p>
<p>For American business, this is our message: If you choose to
join us in building a bridge between management and labor, then
together we can build a path to a new shared prosperity for
American business and American workers. The choice is yours --
and the benefits can belong to you, to us, and all Americans. </p>
<p>I want to leave time for questions, so I'll close by saying
that, especially here in New York City, the labor movement has
always been interested in building bridges -- and much, much
more. </p>
<p>Our Housing Investment Trust, for instance, has invested more
than $1.5 billion of union pension funds in union-built housing
projects nationwide. And, here in the New York area, it has
financed over 2,000 units of housing, with a value of over $64
million, and we're looking to do more. </p>
<p>Recently, the Trust joined with the New York City Housing
Development Corporation to provide financing for the 1,000-unit
West End Towers in Manhattan. Our $22 million helped this $156
million project go forward. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Trust committed $28.9 million in
construction and permanent financing for the Queens Boulevard
extended care nursing facility. </p>
<p>We are also reviewing several additional investments in the
New York area. Among them are the Daly Avenue apartments in the
South Bronx and the rehabilitation of a 2,000-unit co-op in
Brooklyn. </p>
<p>I want you to know that the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust
and our newer Building Investment Trust both love New York. And
we are anxious to work with more New York developers, community
groups, non-profits, and labor organizations. </p>
<p>In a strange twist of fate, our trusts have money to invest at
a time when our members don't have much money to spend. </p>
<p>We'd like to have your help in putting more of our money into
your pockets through partnerships like the Housing Investment and
Building Investment Trusts. And we'd like to have your help in
putting bigger paychecks into the pockets of our workers and
their families. That way, they can afford more of your goods and
services and condominiums and apartments! </p>
<p>Labor and management should be builders not brawlers.
Together, we can build a better New York and we can reclaim and
rebuild America. So let's get to work. </p>
<p>Thank you very much .....</p>

<title>SP 11/22/95 Sweeney at ICEF-MIF Merger Congress</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<h3 align=center>Remarks by John J. Sweeney, President AFL-CIO </h3>
<h3 align=center>ICEF-MIF Merger Congress Washington, D.C. November 22, 1995 </h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it's a pleasure to be here. I want to thank Victor Thorpe and Peter Michalzik 
for inviting me to speak, and Wayne Glenn for his kind introduction. </p>
<p>I come before you to congratulate each one of you for making a dream into a reality. You are 
present at the creation of a new, stronger, larger, more effective ITS, the International Chemical, 
Energy, and Mining Federation. Each of you has helped to bring this about, and you have done a 
magnificent job. Believe me, this ITS has some friends in the AFL-CIO leadership. </p>
<p>As many of you know, I've had the privilege of being active in the ICEF through my own union, the 
Service Employees International. Rich Trumka, our Secretary-Treasurer, has been a leader and 
guiding spirit of the MIF and Linda Chavez-Thompson, our Executive Vice-President, joined many 
of you yesterday in protesting the anti-worker, anti-human rights policies of the Nigerian 
government and their wealthy friends in the oil industry.<br>
All of us have seen first-hand the good work that these two ITS's have done. There are countless 
working people in our country who are better off because of the ICEF and MIF. Each secretariat 
gave tremendous assistance to the Mine Workers during their Pittston and BCOA strikes. When 
the Steel Workers were locked out at Ravenswood, they could count on the ICEF when they 
needed its help the most. </p>
<p>Your two secretariats, each with its own history and tradition, have shown the world what militant, 
idealistic, creative trade unionism can do. And now your merger into the ICEMF is the best thing 
that can happen on both sides. </p>
<p>It is a win-win equation to have one single ITS that brings together the world's unions in energy, 
chemicals, and similar industries. Why? One very simple reason. It's called SOLIDARITY. You 
and I know what that's all about. Solidarity both at home and around the globe. </p>
<p>From the day we signed up in our unions we've known that our strength is in our unity. It's the basic 
insight that drives everything we do. But in the last several years solidarity has taken on a new 
meaning. </p>
<p>More and more the global economy means that the political borders of nations count for little, and 
that economic power is even more concentrated in the hands of fewer multinational corporations. 
There's no better example of this, or maybe I should say worse example, than the petroleum 
industry. Talk about concentrated power! The business empires that already control much of the 
world's petroleum supply are a textbook example. And as our adversaries work in global terms, so 
must we. </p>
<p>Time after time, we trade unionists are finding that we are stronger and healthier when we merge 
our institutions. It is already true for the education I.T.S.'s, which have merged. It may possibly 
prove to be true for your ITS and those that serve food workers, and construction and wood 
workers. In the United States, it is certainly true. Just in the last few months, the Ladies' Garment 
Workers and the Clothing and Textile Workers came together to form a single union in the needle 
trades and the Auto Workers, Steel Workers, and Machinists announced their plans to merge into 
one of the largest independent unions in the world. </p>
<p>In coming together in the ICEMF, you have been a great example for all of us. Your members will 
no doubt stand to gain immeasurably. By that measure, and that is the only measure that really 
counts, your merger is a great success. There's no question about it. </p>
<p>This is a moment of great change for you and the workers you represent around the world, and at 
the same time, for the American labor movement. Our movement has new leadership and new 
priorities. </p>
<p>Let me report to you on where we are and what our priorities will be in the days ahead. This is an 
incredibly exciting time for the AFL-CIO. A time of hope and faith in the labor movement unlike 
what we've seen in decades. A time when we're leaping forward, and a time when the voice of the 
working people of America is being heard. It is a time when the trade union movement is 
committed to building from the grassroots up, and committed to truly creating a strong, 
compassionate new voice for union members and for all workers. </p>
<p>We have three top priorities. The first is to organize new workers at a pace and scale that have no 
precedent. We are committing millions of dollars to our Organizing Institute, which trains young 
organizers. We are creating a Sunbelt Organizing Fund, which will focus on a part of the country 
where right-wing business interests have traditionally resisted unions. And we are creating a new 
Organizing Department and an Office of Strategic Planning at the AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>Second, we are committed to opening up our movement at every level, making it more diverse by 
bringing in more women and more people of color, so that the AFL-CIO will reflect the faces in the 
American work force. This change has already started. At our convention last month, we expanded 
our Executive Council to make more room for women, people of color, and young people, and we 
are creating new roles for organizations of trade unionists who are African American, women, 
Latino, or Asian and Pacific American. Our new Executive Vice-President, Linda 
ChavezThompson, is the first Latina in history to hold an executive position in the Federation. </p>
<p>Our third priority is politics. We are determined to build a progressive new movement of working 
people in the United States. The AFL-CIO will start a National Labor Political Training Center to 
develop campaign organizers, train candidates, and be a seedbed for young political activists. We 
will create a Labor Center for Economic and Public Policy to do the research we need to back up 
our legislative agenda, and we will launch a Campaign '96 Fund to supplement our regular political 
efforts in next year's national elections. Most importantly, we will reengage our members from the 
bottom up to rekindle the passions that built not only our labor movement, but our country. </p>
<p>We face huge challenges. But as I travel around the United States, I find union members and 
leaders filled with a sense of excitement, and ready as never before to take on those challenges. 
We, like you, are keeping our eye on the prize. And for us, like for you, the prize is to make the 
world a place where working people have a chance for good wages, decent benefits, justice in the 
workplace, and simple human dignity. </p>
<p>That is our great goal. That is what it's all about. Thank you very much.</p>

<body>
<h3 align=center>Remarks by Linda Chavez-Thompson Executive Vice President, 
AFL-CIO </h3>
<h3 align=center>Public Employee Union Leaders Meeting November 20, 1995 Atlantic 
City </h3>
<p>I'm happy to be here. </p>
<p>You and I are here this week for a tremendously important cause -- a cause that we believe in and 
fight for -- and that is bringing justice and fairness and decency to the public employees in this 
region. </p>
<p>Let me start out by asking, Is there anyone in this hall -- anyone at all -- who is a friend and 
admirer of that buzzard Phil Gramm? </p>
<p>Good! </p>
<p>Then it won't hurt your feelings if I steal one of his lines and improve on it. </p>
<p>He flies around the country saying, &quot;I was a conservative before conservative was cool.&quot; </p>
<p>Well, I'm here to tell you that I was a public-sector unionist before public-sector unionism was cool 
-- and I'll stay a publicsector unionist through cool and hot and everything in between. </p>
<p>I see lots of friends here, and I've met several of the fine speakers who are scheduled to be here. </p>
<p>Most importantly, the problems you're grappling with here are the same issues we're up against in 
Texas and California and Wisconsin and around the country. </p>
<p>I congratulate you for taking on the tough and important issues -- the issues that count -- the mania 
for contracting out, the financing of government services, and where we are with publicsector 
collective bargaining. </p>
<p>I'd like to talk about a broader issue that links all of those three issues together. </p>
<p>That issue is how Americans think and feel about their public sector. </p>
<p>Last week, two days after most of the federal government had ground to a halt, there was a scary 
headline in the New York Times -- scary but not surprising. </p>
<p>It read, &quot;House Republican Freshmen Heed a Call to 'Shut It Down.'&quot; </p>
<p>The article said that there was a meeting of the Republican freshmen Congressmen -- those 
right-wingers in the Class of '94. </p>
<p>Someone asked, &quot;Anyone got problems back home with the fact that the government's shut 
down?&quot; And not one of them raised a hand. </p>
<p>There's something going on here, and it goes beyond the budget battle. </p>
<p>These right-wing Republicans on Capitol Hill are people who are delighted the government is shut 
down. </p>
<p>They think it's great. </p>
<p>They really hate the public sector -- the services it provides -- the people who work in it -- and the 
unions that represent those men and women. </p>
<p>Our members are the people who deliver the mail, teach the kids, clean the streets, and guard the 
prisons. </p>
<p>And their guarantee of dignity and decent wages -- their only guarantee -- is the union. </p>
<p>And it is precisely the unions that the right wing wants to destroy any way it can -- by contracting 
out to non-union shops, by denying us our collective bargaining rights, by cutting back our budgets 
until our agencies wither on the vine. </p>
<p>Make no mistake about it: government-bashing and union-bashing are twins. </p>
<p>One comes with the other. </p>
<p>You see signs of that fact all around. </p>
<p>State employees across the country are confronted with wage freezes, health care givebacks, and 
staff reductions. </p>
<p>Federal employees are being asked to accept pension cuts and wage increases that barely exceed 
the cost of living. </p>
<p>With school violence up and achievement levels down, teachers are told that the answer to all their 
problems is merit pay and privatization. </p>
<p>With handguns proliferating, police officers are being told to ride alone in their patrol cars or 
abandon them completely. </p>
<p>Time after time, in states and cities all over, the messages to public employees are the same: You 
better cut costs, work longer, take a pay freeze, make do with the old equipment, and shortchange 
your clients -- because if you don't, we'll abolish your job or contract it out and put you on the 
street. </p>
<p>There's an interesting article in the current Washington Monthly called &quot;Working for the 
Government is Cool.&quot; </p>
<p>That's a great title, isn't it? </p>
<p>I'd just add an amendment. </p>
<p>&quot;Working for the Government is Cool, Especially When You're in the Union.&quot; </p>
<p>Anyway, this article says, &quot;It's amazing what a bad rap government workers get. </p>
<p>&quot;People who work in all levels of government -- federal, state, and local -- are written off with a 
label that has a powerful hold over the country's imagination: bureaucrat.&quot; </p>
<p>I'm sorry to say that the Washington Monthly is exactly right. </p>
<p>And I tell you here and now that we who work in the public sector, and we who have the great 
mission of representing publicsector workers, are sick and tired of the government-bashing. </p>
<p>You and I have a big job to do. </p>
<p>Part of our job is to turn back the nonsense of contracting out, the mystical belief that private 
business and the unregulated market are always wonderful at everything they do. </p>
<p>Part of our job is to turn back the tax reductions for the wealthy -- these people who privatize their 
own education, their security guards, and their mail service. </p>
<p>Part of our job is to turn back the budget cuts that make it impossible for public-sector agencies to 
do their jobs. </p>
<p>But a big part of our job is also to get our message out. </p>
<p>That message is that we are proud of what we do and who we are -- we want a government that 
does its job for the people -- and government workers have the same rights to good wages, decent 
working conditions, and independent trade unions that every other worker should have. </p>
<p>We're doing all that during a very exciting time for our movement. </p>
<p>This is a time of hope -- a time when we're moving forward -- a time when the voice of the 
working people of America will be heard. </p>
<p>This is a time when the trade union movement is committed to building from the grassroots up -- 
committed to truly creating a strong new voice for union members and for all workers. </p>
<p>As I travel around the country, I find union members and leaders alike filled with a sense of 
excitement and ready as never before to take on the huge challenges we face. </p>
<p>We're keeping our eye on the prize, and the prize is to make America what it should be -- a place 
where working people, public sector and private sector alike, have a chance for good wages, 
decent benefits, and justice in the workplace. </p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<title>SP 11/18/95 Sweeney to CWA Bell Atlantic Rally</title>

</head>
<body>
<h3 align="center">Remarks by John J. Sweeney, President AFL-CIO </h3>
<h3 align="center">CWA Bell Atlantic Rally November 18, 1995
Baltimore </h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we are here today to deliver a message
to Bell Atlantic Corporation. </p>
<p>We are here today to deliver a message to the United States
Congress, the Department of Labor and the National Labor
Relations Board. </p>
<p>We are here today to deliver a message to every woman and man
in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West
Virginia and the District of Columbia who believes in decency and
dignity and justice. </p>
<p>Our message is: we will not give in to corporate greed. </p>
<p>Not here on the east coast with Bell Atlantic workers, not on
the west coast with the courageous Boeing strikers, not in the
heartland with the Caterpillar strikers, the Staley strikers or
the Detroit News strikers. </p>
<p>I am also here to personally deliver another message. </p>
<p>It's a message from the 13 million members of the AFL-CIO to
the families of 34,000 CWA members who built this giant company
with their sweat and their blood and their lives. </p>
<p>Our message is: we will stand beside you in your hour of need. </p>
<p>This is not an ordinary labor-management confrontation about
wages, working conditions and benefits. </p>
<p>It is an extraordinary confrontation about union-busting and
job destruction. </p>
<p>This isn't a union campaign about union issues. </p>
<p>It is a workers crusade to protect the future of their
families. </p>
<p>This isn't even a rally to protest bad faith bargaining and
the suspension of 6,000 loyal employees for exercising their
legal rights. </p>
<p>It is a rally to protest squeezing the highest productivity in
the telecommunications industry out of 34,000 workers and then
attempting to abandon them like so much roadkill on the
information super highway. </p>
<p>What's wrong with this picture: </p>
<p>In 1994, Bell Atlantic earned profits of $1.4 billion on
revenues of $13.8 billion. </p>
<p>Over the past five years, Bell Atlantic revenues have grown 20
percent and profits have grown 30 percent. </p>
<p>Last year, Bell Atlantic awarded stock options to CEO Ray
Smith that will be worth $82 million dollars in just 10 years! </p>
<p>And with the impending passage of the Telecommunications Act,
Bell Atlantic is to take off like a rocket into profit paradise. </p>
<p>But the company wants to reward the retirees responsible for
past performance by making them pay for health benefits. </p>
<p>And to reward workers responsible for current and future
performance by slashing wages and benefits and subcontracting out
their jobs. -more- </p>
<p>I'll tell you what's wrong with this picture --- there's no
RESPECT for workers or the jobs they do or the contribution they
make, and this confrontation is not going to end until you are
granted that respect. </p>
<p>You are not alone in your struggle. </p>
<p>Your story is being played out in every workplace in America
---productivity up, profits up, workers down. </p>
<p>But the methods you are using to bring this employer to
justice are unique. </p>
<p>You are plotting a course of new unionism for every member of
every union in America to follow and all of us will benefit from
your efforts. </p>
<p>What you are doing here is an inspiration to other unions and
to other workers across our country --- we've learned the hard
way that an injury to one is an injury to all. </p>
<p>And that is why 13 million members of the AFL-CIO are
committed to you and to your cause --- we are going to start
proving that a victory for one is a victory for all! </p>
<p>To your great president, Morty Bahr, and to Pete Catucci,
Vince Maisano, Jan Pierce and to every one of you, I bring a
commitment from the &quot;New Voice for American Workers:&quot;<br>
We're going to spend whatever it takes, work as hard as it takes,
and stick with it as long as it takes to help CWA Bell Atlantic
members win the respect and the job security you have earned and
that you deserve. </p>
<p>And in doing so, we will send a massive message to every
greedy, short-sighted employer in this country: honor American
work, honor American workers, honor American working families. </p>
<p>America works because we do, and when we stop working, America
stops working! </p>
<p>-end- </p>

AFL-CIO President Tom Donahue<br>
AFL-CIO Convention -- New York City<br>
Monday, Oct. 23, 1995<br>
</h3>
<p>Let me add my words of welcome to New York, and to this
convention. </p>
<p>As the saying goes -- a funny thing happened on the way to
this convention. Or, more accurately, a wonderful thing happened
on the way to this convention. We have so stirred the interests
of trade unionists that we have the largest convention in this
federation's history. </p>
<p>That will cause some inconveniences and some crowding, but we
will do everything possible to make this convention the vital and
historic event it will be -- marking a re-birth of this workers'
movement. </p>
<p>It is good to be back in New York -- which is my birthplace --
and which in fact and in spirit, in many of the most important
ways, is also the homeland of the American labor movement. </p>
<p>Here my life as a union member and union organizer began. And
I come here today determined that this movement will grow
stronger and regain its rightful place as the people's tribune in
the places of government power -- and in the face of corporate
power. </p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we have come to New York City for one
fundamental purpose, and that is to set the course for the future
of the federation, for the revival of America's working middle
class, and for the restoration of America as the leading economic
power in the world. </p>
<p>We are here on behalf of 13 million working men and women who
believe in trade unionism, in its power to transform the American
workplace, and in its role as a proud, powerful and humanizing
force for a better standard of life. </p>
<p>We believe in what this great movement has accomplished in the
past century and in what it can accomplish as we approach the
next one. </p>
<p>Thirteen million strong. Men and women of all colors and
creeds. Women and men who make common cause because they know
what it is to work hard for a living, because they know what it
means to fight hard for their rights and because, in today's
savage economy, they know that's the only way you get a union, or
keep a union, or secure a living wage. </p>
<p>This week on behalf of the millions of Americans who want and
need unions... </p>
<p>Let us, together, resolve to grow in number. </p>
<p>Let us, together, resolve to save the nation's legislative
agenda from the cold iron fist of the far right and the
overprivileged. </p>
<p>Let us, together, resolve to have this federation seen and
understood as it is -- as the champion of the most important
investors in America -- the men and women whose hard work makes
America work everyday. </p>
<p>And let us, together, resolve to open up our leadership so
that the face of the labor movement truly will be the face of
America. </p>
<p>Let no one question our determination. The fundamental fact is
that strong, independent trade unions are absolutely essential to
economic and social progress. Without them, the workers of this
nation will never obtain their rightful measure of dignity and
respect, and their fair share of the wealth they produce. America
cannot prosper and cannot shine as a beacon of hope for the world
without a strong, democratic labor movement that brings us back
to the defining truth of our national being -- the ideal of
justice for all. </p>
<p>The vast majority of Americans know that values like fairness
and human decency do not flourish naturally in the climate of the
economic jungle. They know that these values are not handed down
from on high -- that most employers do not give a better deal to
their workers out of the goodness of their hearts. It is only
when workers themselves band together and demand what is
rightfully theirs that the wealth they produce gets converted
into wages and not profits. </p>
<p>So above all else, let solidarity be our pledge. </p>
<p>It's true that we come here today divided on the issue of who
will lead us over the next two years. But on Thursday, let there
be no question that when we leave this hall to carry on our work,
we must do so with our divisions healed, our strength enhanced,
and our federation more united than ever before. </p>
<p>No matter what your feelings about this election -- no matter
how you intend to vote on the leadership question -- let us
always remember that our adversaries are not here in this room.
They are out there -- in the downsizing, union-busting boardrooms
of companies that are increasingly exporting American jobs
instead of American products. </p>
<p>Our enemies are the economic royalists in boardrooms who
intimidate the unorganized -- who force union workers to strike
and then attempt to permanently replace them with scabs. Our real
enemies are the legions of lawyers, lobbyists, fixers and other
parasites whose stock in trade is showing companies how they can
bend and break the labor laws and get away with it. </p>
<p>Backing up all of them are the reactionaries who -- for the
time being and for the time being only -- have taken control of
the Congress and are hell-bent on destroying all that our
movement has fought and struggled for across the generations. </p>
<p>The members of this &quot;mean team&quot; know exactly which
side they are on. They are on the side that wants to keep working
people down in order to push profits up. And they have an agenda
to do just that -- by returning us to the dark days of so-called
states rights, when corporate enterprise ruled unchecked in this
country and the economic royalists could do whatever they
pleased. </p>
<p>We will not let them have their selfish way. We will not
tolerate their campaign of contempt for working Americans. </p>
<p>We will not let them repeal the ban on company unions. We will
not let them repeal the eight-hour day. We will not let them
repeal Davis-Bacon and the Service Contract Act. We will not let
them snuff out OSHA. We will not let them slash college loan
programs for the middle class -- and the Earned Income Tax Credit
that gives modest help to the working poor. </p>
<p>Last week, we saw the obscene spectacle of the House of
Representatives passing the Gingrich cuts in Medicare in order to
finance the Gingrich tax cut for the rich. </p>
<p>Let us serve notice, here and now, that if this dirty deal
ever achieves final passage, we will wage and win the election of
1996 on a demand, a resolve, and a pledge to repeal these
unconscionable cuts in Medicare. </p>
<p>The Gingrich Republicans are now so shameless that they do not
even try to hide their real intentions -- no masks, no makeup, no
magic tricks. </p>
<p>The Majority Leader of the House of Representatives has
outright opposed the very idea of a minimum wage. He says he
wants to repeal it altogether. </p>
<p>The chairman of a House subcommittee has said he intends to
hold hearings into union organizing techniques and union
corporate campaigns, with the goal of finding some way to use the
muscle of the federal government to put an end to such
afflictions. Not content with union-busting corporations, they
now want a union busting government. </p>
<p>The chairman of the House Subcommittee on Work Force
Protection, who doubles as the Chairman of the Board of a
corporation he owns, introduces his own bill to gut OSHA, holds
hearings on his own bill before his own committee, and joins the
rest of the Gingrich-ites in slashing funding for OSHA
enforcement -- a move that the Labor Department estimates will
cause 50,000 more workplace injuries next year. </p>
<p>Think about that -- 50,000 more people injured on the job --
the reversal of a 25 year trend. I don't know a single American
who voted to allow 50,000 more people to suffer injury on the
job. </p>
<p>And then, a couple of weeks ago, at a televised debate in New
Hampshire, the Republican candidates for President erupted into a
frantic bidding war over who could heap the greatest largesse on
the richest people by cutting the most taxes. It began with one
of the candidates simply pledging to reduce tax rates. The next
one came along and promised a bigger bonanza for the wealthy -- a
flat tax. Then another candidate proposed a flat tax but said his
would be even lower. Finally, one of the candidates trumped them
all by saying he would abolish the federal income tax altogether
and replace it with the most regressive tax of all -- a national
sales tax. </p>
<p>We're talking here about the kind of politicians who can look
at a nation in which the richest one percent control half of its
entire wealth and say: &quot;Those poor rich people need another
tax break.&quot; </p>
<p>These are the politicians who see the unconscionable toll of
workplace death in America -- some ten thousand workers every
year -- and say: &quot;We need to get rid of all these burdensome
safety regulations.&quot; </p>
<p>These are the politicians who turn a deaf ear to the millions
of Americans who have no jobs and the many millions more who have
no health insurance and say: &quot;What America needs is more
rugged individualism.&quot; </p>
<p>My favorite exponent of this view is Malcolm Forbes, Jr. He's
had to take on the rigors of the world with nothing more than a
few hundred million inherited dollars in his pocket and a vast
publishing empire his father gave him. Now there's a rugged
individualist! </p>
<p>And now, as the consequences of their crusade against middle
America begin to become apparent, some of these revolutionaries
seek to divert attention by blaming immigrant Americans and
affirmative action, or by glorifying tinhorn Idaho racists and
anyone else who wants to take a pot-shot at federal employees in
the name of &quot;patriotism&quot; and &quot;individual
liberty.&quot; </p>
<p>If they really want to see &quot;jackbooted thugs,&quot; why
don't they check out the private armies arrayed against the
picket lines in Detroit and Decatur? I submit to you that
America's real patriots are the men and women who are fighting
for their livelihood and their lives on those picket lines. </p>
<p>&quot;Facts are stubborn things,&quot; one of our
ex-Presidents used to say. Well, like them or not, let's look at
the facts -- the real facts -- the hard facts of economic life in
America for America's workers. </p>
<p>The real wages of American workers are lower than they were 15
years ago, despite the fact that productivity is up. The fact is
that greedy corporations are turning productivity into profit --
and refusing to share any of it with workers. </p>
<p>More facts. America continues to ship jobs out of the country
at a record pace. Our merchandise trade deficit continues to run
between $10 billion and $15 billion a month, without which we
could save somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 American jobs. </p>
<p>Remember the pro-NAFTA economists? Remember all of the eminent
scholars who touted NAFTA as a job creator and an overall plus
for the economy? </p>
<p>The fact is that NAFTA is a disaster. NAFTA is a job
destroyer. We said the peso was on shaky ground long before NAFTA
was passed, and we said devaluation was inevitable -- and it was.
We said NAFTA would turn our trade surplus with Mexico into a
huge deficit and it did. We said NAFTA would cause many more U.S.
factories to pack up and head south to a new Super Sun Belt --
and they did. </p>
<p>And remember those side agreements that were supposed to
ensure fair labor practices in Mexico? The fact is that they
don't work. Maquiladora workers still can't form unions, and the
United States of America can't do a thing about it. The fact is
that we were right -- and NAFTA is wrong -- wrong for America and
wrong for American workers. The fact is that we were right and
President Clinton was wrong -- and we told him so. </p>
<p>Today, all those economists, all those Nobel Laureates, are
busy backpedaling. They now say that NAFTA shouldn't be measured
in terms of jobs created or lost. Well, let me say to them: If
you hadn't concocted those false economic forecasts, if you
hadn't propagated the phony estimates of jobs created, then let
me assure you that NAFTA never would have passed. But you wrote
the rosy scenarios and American workers are paying the price. </p>
<p>Those same economists now tell us of the glories of the global
economy -- one without borders, without rules and in which
corporate buccaneers can roam the world exploiting as they
please. </p>
<p>For our part, we need meet their plundering by acting in
concert with our fellow trade unionists around the world, to meet
global capital with global labor. We need to perfect the
mechanisms for trade union cooperation in global bargaining and
match the multi-national company with the multi-national union. </p>
<p>In the face of all these stubborn facts, and in the face of
all these challenges and more, our first responsibility is to
make this movement an even more powerful force in setting the
direction of our country. And to do that, we will have to grow. </p>
<p>Today, there are millions of workers who desperately need and
want a union to represent them and give them a voice they can
call their own. We must summon the will and the means to help
them reach their aspirations. </p>
<p>Organizing the unorganized must and will become the primary
mission of the AFL-CIO and its affiliated unions. In the coming
years, this federation will raise and spend millions of new
dollars for massive, multi-union organizing drives that will
target entire industries and geographic regions. </p>
<p>We are reallocating the resources necessary to double and
redouble the recruitment and training of new organizers, and to
turn the Organizing Institute and its graduates into the greatest
force for unionization since Franklin Roosevelt said &quot;if I
were a worker, I'd join a union&quot; -- and since Eleanor heeded
that advice and joined The Newspaper Guild. </p>
<p>As our movement grows, we must also address another major
challenge, and that is the question of how we can become an
increasingly powerful engine of progressive change in our
society. </p>
<p>In an era when diversions have a way of becoming front line
issues -- when voter anger toward the two parties is on the rise
and when racial polarization looms -- this labor movement must
refocus our membership on the critical economic issues -- on jobs
and wages and education and opportunity. Let's not let them get
lost in the present wilderness of hype, backlash and dirty
politics. I firmly believe that we can restore the faith of
America's workers in the American system by showing them not what
divides them, but what unites them -- and what unites them is the
fight for a better life. </p>
<p>We simply have to reach our members, educate them, help them
discover common bonds with their brothers and sisters, and help
them focus on the 1996 campaign and on electing a Congress and
state legislatures that will care about the hard-working majority
of our people. </p>
<p>Later today we will hear from someone who has proven himself
to be a friend of America's working families -- the President of
the United States. </p>
<p>We will welcome him to this hall and offer him our continuing
support in the escalating congressional battles against organized
greed and selfishness. </p>
<p>In the struggles we now face -- the fight to stop the company
union bill, stop the killing of OSHA, stop the repeal of
prevailing wage laws and stop the Great Republican Medicare Raid
-- President Clinton has pledged that he will be with us every
step of the way. </p>
<p>And next year, in the next election, this labor movement is
going to be with him every step of the way, fighting to send Newt
Gingrich and his mean-spirited, rubber-stamping reactionaries
back home where they belong. </p>
<p>Nineteen-ninety-six is a time when the decisions of our
electorate will set the course of our country for a new century. </p>
<p>But this is a time of decision for the labor movement, as
well. </p>
<p>To be sure, on the critical national issues of the day, we
know where we stand, we know which side we are on and we know who
our friends are. On the goals and aims of this federation, on our
vision for working America, there is no real dispute. </p>
<p>But the time has come to decide where this movement is headed
and how our federation will inspire and lead labor's renewal in
the 21st Century. How do we change this movement so that unions
once again are seen and heard as the authentic voice of working
families? How do we change so that unions are winning again? </p>
<p>Winning the allegiance of America's working people, so that we
can grow and flourish and better represent them. Winning the
support of the public at large, so that we can bring constructive
change to our society. Winning union elections and legislative
battles -- these are our purposes and priorities. On these great
questions, we will not retreat, excuse, pause, or equivocate. </p>
<p>But to restore this federation to its rightful place at the
center of national life and destiny, we must make the right
choice today. </p>
<p>We must build a movement that is broadly reflective of the
workforce, and serves their interests always. </p>
<p>The struggles of 60 years ago -- the great sit-down strikes
and the mass organization of those on industrial assembly lines
-- are shining moments in labor history. But I tell you we are
living in a fool's paradise if we think for a moment that we can
simply tear a page out of that book and use it to set the course
for the remainder of the 1990's and beyond. </p>
<p>The rhetoric of old is comforting and stirring. For us and for
trade union activists, it makes the pulse beat faster and raises
our spirits. </p>
<p>But for millions of workers who want progress and improvement
in their lives without increasing the amount of struggle they
already feel, it's too often a call to arms they cannot and will
not answer. </p>
<p>Raising the decibel level -- without exercising the mind and
without building the muscle to show that we know what we mean and
we mean what we say -- is a prescription for disaster. We have to
think and target before we march. Otherwise, we will marginalize
this movement and consign it to the fringes of society for
generations to come. </p>
<p>We must worry less about blocking bridges and worry more about
building bridges to the rest of society. We must enlist the
support of members of the public, not inconvenience as many of
them as possible. Our purpose, as I see it, is not to breakdown
the system, but to make it work for working families. </p>
<p>To prevail in this cause, we must do what is right, even when
it is hard; but we must not decide to engage in a fight simply
for the sake of having one. </p>
<p>This federation can lead, innovate and inspire. This
federation can win. This federation can summon the collective
insight of its best and brightest -- and forge dynamic approaches
to our greatest challenges. </p>
<p>It can and it must find the means to support every worker
locked in struggle to protect his or her rights, and it must
ensure that no striker is ever alone on a picket line and that no
scab replacement every becomes permanent. It can and must devote
every resource to the fulfillment of its oldest bedrock principle
-- solidarity -- without which we are nothing. </p>
<p>But this movement cannot move forward as long as the AFL-CIO
is viewed by some as the reason for every problem that afflicts
the labor movement and, at the same time, as the solution for
every problem. </p>
<p>This, my brothers and sisters, is the path of least
resistance, and we will pay a steep price if we choose to take
it. To survive and succeed, we must spend less time talking and
listening to ourselves and more time talking and listening to
those we represent and seek to represent. </p>
<p>If this movement is to be rebuilt, it will be rebuilt from the
ground up -- by creating the broadest possible support behind a
program of progressive change, and not by allowing a few to don
the mantle of &quot;progressivism,&quot; proclaim the way
forward, and expect others to follow. </p>
<p>The essential strength of this federation has always been with
its unions and their members. There is no savior waiting in the
wings. There is no plumed knight who will shatter the nation's
power structure with the force of words alone. There is only a
great deal of work to do -- tough, gritty work like organizing
the unorganized, fighting at the side of our courageous brothers
and sisters who have staked everything they have on their picket
lines, and forging, as Gompers taught us, an effective role for
labor in the political life of our country -- a role for labor
and of labor, making our own considered judgments about which
politicians may be worthy of our support. </p>
<p>I suggest we get down to it. </p>
<p>Millions depend on us, whether they know it or not, to help
build a better workplace, with better wages, in a better, more
decent and more truly human world. </p>
<p>If we don't do it, no one else will. </p>
<p>We -- you me and 13 million others -- are the strongest moral
force in this nation -- arguing every day for the rights of all
to work with dignity and live in decency. </p>
<p>If we don't do it, no one else will. </p>
<p>We can and will, through our organizing efforts, lift up the
conditions of work for the millions who join our ranks -- and we
will, thereby, as we have in the past, improve the lives and
conditions of many millions more as they move to the higher
standards we build. </p>
<p>If we don't do it, no one else will. </p>
<p>We can and will, through our political action and our
legislative action, reform this nation and make it one in which
the rich will pay their fair share, and the young and the sick
and the old will be cared about and cared for. </p>
<p>If we don't do it, no one else will. </p>
<p>Together -- you, me and 13 million others -- let's lift up
labor and give it back its strength. </p>
<p>Let's lift up this nation and give it back its soul. Thank
you.</p>

<h2 align="center">Remarks of AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Barbara
J. Easterling at the Food and Commercial Workers Union's</h2>
<h1 align="center"><br>
'Workers Blow the Whistle on Congress' rally</h1>
<h2 align="center">September 27, 1995, at the U.S. Capitol</h2>
<p>I am delighted to be here. I bring you greetings from
President Tom Donahue, the AFL-CIO Executive Council, and the 13
million proud members of the American trade union movement. </p>
<p>Let me thank each of you for coming here today. </p>
<p>Let's talk about a few facts. </p>
<p>Here's Fact Number One. </p>
<p>America's working people -- the women and men on the lower and
middle rungs of the economic ladder -- need trade unions today
just as much as they always have. </p>
<p>The independent trade union is their way for getting decent
wages, good benefits, safe working conditions on the job, a
secure life for their families, and the dignity that every person
deserves. </p>
<p>You know what trade unions work for? We work for an America
where working people get a fair share of what they produce. </p>
<p>We work for an America that is more equal -- a nation where
the telephone operator and the department-store clerk can live on
the same block as the lawyer and the accountant, where people are
treated the same regardless of their gender or the color of their
skin. </p>
<p>We work for an America that is more humane -- a nation where
the poor get a decent minimum wage, where workers don't risk
their lives when they go to work, where retirees know that their
pensions are safe. </p>
<p>Now, here is Fact Number Two. </p>
<p>Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, and their gang all hate what we do.
They despise everything we stand for. These guys know exactly
what democratic independent unions are all about -- they know how
important we are -- and they are determined to do everything in
their power to destroy our movement. </p>
<p>Look at all of their legislation, and you see a pattern as
plain as day. Their idea of heaven is a nation full of
sweatshops. Their favorite fantasy is workers who are isolated,
powerless, scared. </p>
<p>The Republicans' dirty little secret is that they can't stand
the idea of workers having an independent voice in the workplace.
They're scared of workers having the right to associate and make
their own decisions. </p>
<p>They know how popular unions really are among America's
workers. </p>
<p>They've seen the evidence. When a CNN/Time Magazine poll
asked, &quot;Do American workers need unions?,&quot; a big
majority -- 73 percent of the respondents -- said yes. </p>
<p>When the Associated Press/Media General poll asked workers who
were not union members if they would join a union if the
opportunity presented itself, 37 percent of that group said they
would. </p>
<p>That means that if workers could choose freely whether to join
a union, then the membership of our movement would nearly triple. </p>
<p>And the Republicans will stop at nothing to prevent that. </p>
<p>Fact Number Three is that this gang and the business people
who order them around are all very clever. They're not trying to
outlaw us. No -- their strategy for undercutting the real unions
is to let businesses create pseudo-unions that the bosses keep
under their thumbs. </p>
<p>That's what the Team Act would do, and it's coming up on the
House floor today. </p>
<p>Doug described it very well. Let me just add a couple of
comments. </p>
<p>The Gingrich-Armey gang say that they want teamwork and
cooperation between employer and employee. Cooperation sounds
just great. We trade unionists have been talking about it for
years. But there's one small difference. </p>
<p>We want cooperation between employer and employee as equals.
We believe each side should be independent, and they should sit
down and work out their differences. </p>
<p>The Team Act idea of cooperation is that if you're a worker,
you get to be the puppet, and the boss gets to pull all the
strings. You don't dare make one independent move, or else you'll
crash to the floor. </p>
<p>Some teamwork! Some cooperation! </p>
<p>And that's why stopping the Team Act is one of the top
priorities of the AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>The final fact is that Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Bob Dole,
and their people didn't just appear out of nowhere. There is a
bad spirit that is behind what they do, and they represent it
perfectly. </p>
<p>As one observer said, the key words for these people are not
&quot;we&quot; and &quot;sharing&quot; and &quot;the future&quot;
-- they are &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; and
&quot;now.&quot; </p>
<p>Their real constituents are the junk-bond speculators -- the
millionaires who avoid paying a fair share of taxes -- the
business people who cheat and exploit their workers if that pads
their profits. </p>
<p>Our job as trade unionists is to change all that. You and I
have a big task -- to make this country a better place for the
people who check our groceries, build our cars, teach our kids,
and care for us when we're sick. </p>
<p>Our job is to work for a society where people care for each
other, help each other, stand together, plan for our future, and
take care of the less fortunate. </p>
<p>It's a tough job -- but we'll do it. That's what we are.
That's what our mission is. That's why we're here.</p>

<h3 align="center">COMMENTS OF BARBARA J. EASTERLING<br>
SECRETARY-TREASURER, AFL-CIO<br>
AT A NEWS CONFERENCE OF THE<br>
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES<br>
</h3>
<p>The AFL-CIO is committed to support AFGE and all federal
employees if a shutdown of the federal government takes place.
Federal workers want to work. They want to continue to serve the
American people. </p>
<p>In the event that they are prevented from doing this, the
AFL-CIO is developing a contingency program to help them through
this difficult challenge. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO Executive Council has already approved a program
of loan assistance to striking workers of unions that do not have
strike funds. We have extended that program to include federal
workers forced off their jobs through no fault of their own. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO will work with an area bank to create a $5 million
Fund -- $1 million from the AFL-CIO and the rest to be arranged
with the bank. This fund will be used to provide loans that will
be made available to federal workers if they are locked out of
their jobs. The AFL-CIO first adopted this policy in August, and
I presented the first million dollar loan to Teamsters on strike
at the Detroit newspapers. </p>
<p>Loans will be offered to assist federal workers to pay their
mortgages, make car payments, buy groceries and to provide for
other essential needs. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO also will call upon our state and local
federations across the nation to urge their members of Congress
to support a continuing spending resolution that provides
adequate funding to maintain current government spending and
employment levels. </p>
<p>We will further ask our affiliates and state and local central
bodies to support the September 27 action to protest a government
lockout. </p>
<p>These steps are just the first in a series of actions we are
prepared to implement. If necessary, we will ask the AFL-CIO
Strategic Approaches Committee to develop a strategy that will
focus the combined resources of our affiliated unions in support
of federal workers. </p>
<p>We hope that we do not get to that point. We call upon
Congress to act responsibly toward the federal workers who serve
our nation so proudly and so well. But the AFL-CIO and its
affiliates will assist federal workers to the fullest extent
possible. </p>
<p>It is completely unfair to make federal workers and their
families shoulder this financial hardship. The members of
Congress will still receive their paychecks during a government
shutdown. To hold federal workers hostage to the Republican
budget is unjustified and immoral. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO will work with AFGE and other unions to encourage
federal workers to use their expanded political rights under the
Hatch Act to make their voices and their votes heard in the next
election to prevent this situation from recurring in the future.</p>

<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO President Tom Donahue<br>
Executive Council Meeting Press Conference<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
September 21, 1995<br>
</h3>
<p>JOHNSON: We're sorry about the delay you went through. You
have a copy of President Donahue's summary of the meeting and
he's here to take your questions. </p>
<p>SUMMARY: We had a long and productive meeting of the Executive
Council. Barbara and I are proud of what the council accomplished
today on behalf of the working families of America. </p>
<p>We adopted a resolution establishing budget levels for our
Organizing Fund that we had approved in principle in August. That
fund will begin next year with $5 million and will grow to $20
million within four years. We have also approved a financing
mechanism for that fund and instructed the Committee on the Role
of the AFL-CIO in Organizing to develop a structure and procedure
for that fund in time for convention action. </p>
<p>The purpose of the AFL-CIO's investing in an Organizing Fund
is to leverage new monies from affiliates to achieve a
substantial increase in overall organizing activity. We think our
fund of $20 million can generate an additional $80 million from
individual unions in new organizing money per year. We believe
this is the scale that will be required to rekindle organizing
activity. </p>
<p>The council was presented with a draft Ethical Practices Code
for union officers and representatives and we agreed to ready
that for adoption in October. </p>
<p>I reported to the council on the work of our ad hoc committee
on governance, which is working on an agreement on a proposal for
the convention that would substantially increase the
representation of women and persons of color on the AFL-CIO
Executive Council. We also approved a resolution on full
participation that commits us to make rules changes and other
efforts to increase the participation of women and minorities in
our state and local central bodies, in all committees of the
AFL-CIO and at the AFL-CIO Convention itself. </p>
<p>Finally, we spent a great deal of time reviewing the
legislative situation and our grass-roots legislative and
political activities. Members of the council expressed alarm and
anger at the multiple attacks by the congressional Republican
leadership on programs that benefit working families in order to
finance tax breaks for large corporations and wealthy
individuals. We met with Rep. Gephardt and Sen. Daschle; reviewed
our Stand UP campaign; and heard a report by Geoff Garin on the
results of our ongoing research concerning the attitudes of union
members. </p>
<p>I advised the council that we are targeting 50 congressional
districts for intensive grass-roots activity; building
Legislative Action Committees in 150 congressional districts;
developing an electronically linked network of thousands of local
trade union activists; starting to train 500 local activists in
grass-roots legislative and political activities; planning now
for a political operation in 1996 that would put 500 union staff
in the field from Labor Day to Election Day to mount the largest
and most effective political operation in our history -- double
the number fielded in 1994 and working with an area bank to
create a $5 million fund for low- or no-interest loans that would
be available to federal workers through their unions in case of a
government shutdown. Union members in federal agencies want to
keep on serving the public. Today we made contingency plans to
help them and their families in case they are prevented from
doing so. </p>
<p>Barbara reported on the progress being made in our internal
review of AFL-CIO operations. Part of her report concerned the
process of reorganizing and consolidating our communications
operations to shift our focus away from publications and toward
proactive media relations. </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I'd be happy to take your questions. </p>
<p>REPORTER: What about the disparaging remarks of corporations
about ghastly union behavior in corporate campaigns? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I greet their reaction with joy and glee -- to have
them acknowledge the enormous power that we must have and the
ability to so plague them that they are somehow going to join
together and try to force workers to abandon efforts to make
those corporations a little bit more civilized. </p>
<p>I think that's a great tribute to the work that we have been
doing. I understand this arises from the American Trucking
Association and from my namesake there. It would be an
interesting case -- Donohue v. Donahue. </p>
<p>But I think that's a great testimony to the work our unions
have been doing trying to defend workers against those
corporations. </p>
<p>If they'd like to compare the litany of things that unions
have said about those corporations with the things that they have
said about us through the years, there are still several more
volumes on our side than on theirs, I assure you. </p>
<p>These are the same people who have for years carried on a
campaign for a ``union-free environment'' as if we were some sort
of vermin. I really do not have a lot of sympathy for their
concerns on this issue. </p>
<p>REPORTER: There is some argument on the Hill. Apparently there
is going to be a hearing about this issue. I'm just curious, how
concerned are you?<br>
DONAHUE: Well, if the Hill would operate in the fashion that the
nation has gotten accustomed to over the years -- if there are
going to be hearings on this issue -- we would be happy to
appear. In the current Congress that seems to be out of vogue.
They apparently don't hold exhaustive hearings on anything
anymore. </p>
<p>So that part of it can be a serious problem. We will have to
see. Certainly those corporations have a lot of slack on the
Hill. They can and will try to bedevil workers by attacking us
there or anywhere they can. We will have to deal with it. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Could you elaborate on the second-to-the-last item
in the summary and explain what the political plans are for 1996?
How is this operation different from what has been done in the
past? When will the people start? What exactly will they do? What
is hoped will be accomplished and so forth? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: Could I ask for a copy of that? I don't have the same
page two. You are referring to what parts of it? </p>
<p>REPORTER: The 1996 political operations. </p>
<p>DONAHUE: In 1994, we put into the field about 225 people, both
from the federation staff and from the staffs of our affiliates
working with our unions' members in various areas around the
country to carry on registration, education and get-out-the-vote
efforts among union members. That was in a period that probably
covered the last four weeks of the campaign. One of the lessons
we've learned, obviously, is that four weeks is not long enough.
That wasn't a heavy enough effort. </p>
<p>So, what we are going to do for 1996 is try to double that
number of union activists out working with members in specific
districts and double that by doubling the commitment from the
AFLCIO field staff and asking our affiliates to double their
commitment, all together an effort to put 500 people in the
field. We'll put folks in right after Labor Day to work with our
members in those campaigns from Labor Day to Election Day. </p>
<p>We asked our unions to think about that now. Obviously, to do
that by September, you have to begin training and orientation of
those people sometime in June and July, and we have to make
specific assignments. We have pulled the calendar back
substantially. </p>
<p>REPORTER: So, the goal is to mobilize support among union
members for the candidates that have received union backing? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: Right, in as many districts as we can cover and in
districts that are designated marginal or critical to us. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Have you targeted any yet? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I don't care to say that we have selected the final
targets. In many of them, you don't even know who the opposition
is going to be. </p>
<p>REPORTER: How does this mix with Project '95 and (AFSCME
President Gerald W.) McEntee and company and their support? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: You will have to ask him. I don't know what districts
they are working in. Project '95 is a different kind of project,
as I understand it. Project '95 is designed to focus attention on
the incumbent and to highlight his or her actions or failure to
act on certain matters, or how he or she votes on certain
matters. That is a quite different effort than the federation
effort, which is a legislative issues effort, trying to educate
our members and activists on the legislative issues and to work
those legislative issues between now and the end of this
congressional session. </p>
<p>So, our concentration now is not on any effort to embarrass
the incumbent, but rather to involve our members in issues to
build pressure on incumbents to support us on those issues. We
seek thereby to produce an educated cadre of members in each of
those congressional districts. Those members will then be able to
transfer that knowledge and take it with them when they become
involved in the political campaigns in the latter part of 1996.
The substantial difference, I believe, is that Project '95 has a
different agenda and is geared to work through June or so of next
year. </p>
<p>REPORTER: The Governance Committee -- the proposal that you
are working on says that you are going to increase the
representation of women and people of color on the Executive
council. I am assuming that means that you want to increase the
number of members on the Executive Council and if so, can you
tell us how many people you want to increase it by? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: The answer is yes to the first question and no to the
second. I think that you would have to increase the size of the
council and that is what the committee is examining. But, no I
can't give you an answer as to how many seats we're talking
about. The phrase in the early draft of my remarks said that we
are very close to agreement. I think that exaggerates the case.
We are working in a committee in which everybody is trying to
work together. We have agreed that we are going to discuss
informally and off the record all of these issues. That is what
we have been doing in the committee, I think very effectively. I
don't what to be speaking about the work of that committee. I
only mean to give you an indication that, I think that committee
will be able to come to an agreement on increasing the diversity
of the council and have a recommendation for the convention. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Doesn't that recommendation have to be in within the
next couple of days? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: Resolutions to the convention can come from the
Executive Council as late as the day of the convention and
anywhere during the convention. They don't have to meet the
deadline. The deadline within the next few days is for submission
of resolutions by our affiliates. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Could you tell us a little more about the work of
the Committee on Governance? More specifically, is there just one
proposal or several proposals? What's holding up agreement? And
finally, how many weeks before the convention will this report be
out or will it be on the eve of the convention? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: The committee is considering a number of proposals to
revise the governance structure, including some you submitted
which have been distributed to the members of the committee and
have been discussed. There are a number of proposals before the
committee on revision of the governance structure. </p>
<p>I don't think there's any &quot;holdup.&quot; The committee
has had two meetings. We have had good discussions. We will have
more discussions as to when the committee will finish its work. I
just don't know, except obviously it has to finish before the
convention. But, I think that it may well be on eve of the
convention. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Do you think there is a chance of an agreed policy
in sight, policy on governance? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: That is what we are testing: whether or not there can
be agreement. That committee is pretty evenly divided between
Sweeney adherents and the Donahue adherents. We are examining
that. It is a way to see if we can agree, rather than simply to
have competing proposals on the floor of the convention. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Any commitments from Gephardt and Daschle on
anything? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: No. They both discussed the current situation in the
Congress, the apparent growing irritation of the Democratic
members as reflected in Sam Gibbons' demonstration yesterday.
Gibbons is an old paratrooper. So, I guess that you will have to
understand that. </p>
<p>I don't want to put words in either of their mouths. For my
part, I believe there's a growing feeling among the Democrats in
both the House and the Senate that the Republican leadership is
distorting the process, that there is not a fair opportunity to
have hearings, to see bills before hearings begin, and so forth. </p>
<p>Gephardt or Daschle, I can't remember which one, noted there
are hearings scheduled for tomorrow on something on which no bill
has yet been produced. Medicare is an issue on which the
Democrats are frustrated because they have not yet seen the
proposal that the Republicans are offering on Medicare and
Medicaid revisions. </p>
<p>Generally they only spoke of those things and spoke of their
concerns over the 1996 elections and the need to assure
Democratic control of the House and Senate election or to strive
to achieve Democratic leadership in the House and Senate. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Does any part of the campaign for the presidency of
the AFL-CIO intrude on this meeting in any form? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: Perish the thought. This is a meeting of elected
officers of unions all of whom have their own election contest.
So, it would be surprising if they were not aware that there is a
contest going on in the federation. </p>
<p>It doesn't intrude in the sense of preventing us from finding
agreement on broad range of issues in which we make common cause
on behalf of the working families of America, obviously. </p>
<p>Does it intrude into some of the political discussions that
take place? Yes, I guess it does. I guess it is reflected in
comments by adherents on both sides, and may prolong some of the
discussions. </p>
<p>REPORTER: There are some people who feel that this is very
divisive, and they wish that it would go away, and perhaps one of
the candidates should drop out in the interest of solidarity. Has
that kind of proposition come up? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: No. I haven't heard that at the council. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Did you respond to the letter that you got from six
union presidents urging you to be the person to withdraw? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I was not ducking your question, Peter. You asked me
did it come up in the council and it didn't come up in the
council. So far as I know John has no plans to withdraw and I
didn't hear that in the council. </p>
<p>With respect to the letter signed by six unions, none of which
are currently supporting me -- suggesting that I withdraw -- I
think that is clearly a dog bites man story. If they were six
unions supporting me, then I think that would be news. </p>
<p>But, what made it news in the proportions that it was played
up, I have now idea, except skillful PR from the other side. It's
a letter from six people who are not supporting me, saying
they're supporting John. I knew that. </p>
<p>REPORTER: On that point, it seems to me, and probably a lot of
outsiders, there is general agreement on many issues and the
Sweeney group -- on organizing, on political action. There may be
shades of difference, but you all want to do the things that are
necessary to help working people. What are the sticking points of
this agreement, if any, outside of the fact that you have a race
for the presidency? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I think that we have discussed a number of points,
both of agreement and disagreement. I think the judgment has to
be made by the delegates as to who's the person most competent,
the most qualified to lead the federation for the two next years.
I expect to be the person chosen when that question is answered. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Along those lines, are you any closer to producing a
list of what you think those numbers are in terms of who supports
whom? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I will be happy to give you my version of the
numbers, or what I understand of the numbers. I believe that John
has 24 unions supporting him. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Is it 24 or 26? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I think that he is saying 24. </p>
<p>REPORTER: He is saying 26. </p>
<p>DONAHUE: Is he saying 26? </p>
<p>REPORTER: His press release said 26. </p>
<p>DONAHUE: My count of John's unions is at 24. My count of my
support is at 48. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Forty-eight is short. But they don't vote by unions,
they vote by membership. Do you have projections from those
unions, their recent per capita figures or what would play out at
the convention? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I do. (Laughter) I don't anticipate that is going to
play out at the convention. </p>
<p>I wouldn't try to fool you and say that I am not behind. I'm
behind on those counts and those declarations. </p>
<p>I have said from the beginning, &quot;the vote will be taken
Oct. 26.&quot; At that point, you will have the results of the
voting and we will see what the numbers are. I expect a number of
changes in the current alignment, or else I wouldn't be
continuing. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Would there be anything that could persuade you or
possibly Mr. Sweeney to withdraw? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I can only speak for myself. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Well, you might be very persuasive with Mr. Sweeney. </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I haven't been. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Can you answer that? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: Sure. No, I can't think of anything which would
persuade me not to run. There is a contest. It is to be decided
by the vote of our convention delegates. It will be decided on
October 26. I'll be there. Barbara Easterling will be there. We
will be candidates for election. </p>
<p>REPORTER: There was a union today, the Transport Workers,
which seemed to come out for Mr. Sweeney. You have spoken about
the fluid situation in which you indicated that you thought Mr.
Sweeney had 53 percent. Why does the Transport Workers
declaration today . . . presumably you wish to revise that figure
upward in favor of Mr. Sweeney and what would you like to revise
it upwards to? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: Whatever proportion 58,000 is of 13 million. If you
can do your mathematics quickly you will have the answer. I think
that is about four-tenths of one percent? </p>
<p>REPORTER: United Transportation Union. Is there any other
calibrations that we should make on that 53 percent? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: None that I know of. The only announcement I was told
about was the announcement of the UTU to support the Sweeney
candidacy. That is the only thing that I know of. </p>
<p>REPORTER: What can we look forward to in Las Vegas? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: It depends on what week you are talking about. Tyson
is fighting there. </p>
<p>REPORTER: I am talking about . . . </p>
<p>DONAHUE: Oh, this week. What you might have looked forward to
last week was the endorsement that I received in Las Vegas from
the Amalgamated Transit Union, with I guess 55,000 members or so. </p>
<p>Next week is the Carpenters' Executive Board meeting. I can't
tell you what to look forward to in that convention other than
separate appearances by John Sweeny and me. We will both be there
speaking to the delegates. I can't tell you what is going to
happen there. You all know the history -- that Sig Lucassen was
strongly supporting Sweeney and that he is retiring at that
convention, that the Executive Board of the Carpenters failed to
endorse or did not give John the endorsement when he appeared
before their board here in Washington. It is an open question
with the Carpenters. I am not going to claim anything more than
that. </p>
<p>REPORTER: What is their membership? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: 383,000 or 382,000. About seven times bigger than the
UTU. (Laughter) </p>
<p>REPORTER: Do you expect them to make an endorsement or make a
decision at the convention or do you have an understanding that
that will be done? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: Kevin, I am not dancing. I have no feel for that. I
just don't know what they will do. Whether they will take up the
issue at that convention or whether they will do it by Executive
Board either before, during or after the convention. I just don't
know. </p>
<p>REPORTER: There is still a question of whether the
international unions will vote as a body or whether they will
allow the delegates to have a portion of those votes to cast on
their own. We have had only one contest in the history of the
federation. That is 1969, I believe. The international cast their
complete slate. I know a number of the internationals appoint
their delegates. So, the delegates are usually beholden to the
president and it goes down the line with them. </p>
<p>But, it seems to me that in this situation there may be people
who do not want to go down the line for a particular side -- one
or the other. I would like to see votes by the delegates, because
that would certainly be much more democratic at a convention. Is
there any possibility of doing something to encourage it. I have,
as you know, suggested one delegate/one vote. I think that would
probably get you elected. But, I don't know if the convention has
adopted or is even considering that kind of proposal. </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I will examine it, Harry. If it would get me elected,
I'll take a serious look into it. </p>
<p>To answer your question, I believe that the constitution is
clear that the delegates to the convention are elected or
appointed in accordance with the rules of the individual unions. </p>
<p>Those delegates are appportioned against a number which is the
per capita payment of the national union. The delegates divide
among them, with the divisor being the number of delegates -- and
whatever the number on top is called being the per capita number.
The delegate then votes. A union with a million members, for
example, has 10 or 11 or 12 delegates who would vote 50-odd
thousand votes apiece. </p>
<p>That is my view of the constitution. </p>
<p>REPORTER: I want to clarify something in your statement. You
are talking about the Organizing Fund of $20 million dollars can
generate an additional $80 million dollars from individual
unions. How does that work? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: How the fund will work is still being discussed and
that is what the Norton Committee has been asked to come up with
for the convention. </p>
<p>The general expectation, I guess, would be that you would have
a group of organizing directors who would meet and discuss
possibilities for developing campaigns, prospects in areas,
regions, industries and whatnot. There could well be another
structure above that of general presidents, as a kind of
oversight committee, on the distribution or the allocation of
that $20 million. </p>
<p>It is clearly my anticipation and I think everybody else's
that that money -- the AFL-CIO's money -- being put into these
campaigns would be designed to leverage spending on organizing
from affiliates. So, on the proportions that are there, we would
look to affiliates to be spending $4 for every $1 that the
federation puts up, and we would be putting together $100 million
to spend on organizing in a given year -- using that $20 million
to leverage additional spending by the affiliates. </p>
<p>REPORTER: That would be actual spending or spending in kind?
Providing organizers obviously has a value. </p>
<p>DONAHUE: It probably could be either. But, it would have to be
additional to a union's ongoing effort. We wouldn't want a
situation in which a union has three organizers or 10 organizers
on the payroll and says, &quot;Now I will come into your campaign
and I will put those 10 organizers in.&quot; That is not
additional or new money into organizing. We are talking about new
money added to current expenditures on organizing. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Both you and Mr. Sweeney have sent signals to the
Democrats saying, &quot;don't take us for granted.&quot; Did any
sort of discussion along those lines occur today with Gephardt
and Daschle? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I think there is a clear understanding from a number
of discussions that we had today that trade unionists, like
voters all across the country, are not as enchanted as they once
were with party labels. They are looking much more at individual
performance of the representative or the senator. </p>
<p>I think that is clear. It comes through in all of the polling
that we do. It comes through in the focus groups and it came
through in the discussions at the Executive Council today. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Speaking of which, were there any other startling
revelations that emerged from the research and the attitudes of
union members that you were briefed on today? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: I was impressed with the concerns our people have
about their own jobs, their own future prospects, their own
expectations of what is ahead for them. And I was impressed with
the evidence of their interest in job training, in partnership
arrangements, which would help to secure their employment and
enhance their employment opportunities. </p>
<p>There is fairly substantial evidence of that and a greater
evidence of that than there is of anti-corporate attitudes as
such. That is something for us to consider. </p>
<p>REPORTER: Did anything emerge that would suggest unions have
become irrelevant to working people? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: Geoff didn't say that at all. No. </p>
<p>REPORTER: On page two, you say that you are going to develop
an electronically linked activists' network of thousands of local
trade union activists. As I am sure you know, there is an AFL-CIO
LaborNET. Do you intend to expand that? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: We have and have maintained for a number of years an
activist list of somewhere over 150,000 trade union activists --
people who have participated in the past in solidarity activities
in one kind or another. They want to be active on other issues. </p>
<p>We have communicated with them extensively through the years
and used them in organizing, in political campaigns and in other
work. </p>
<p>What we are seeing now is that we want to link those folks
electronically, probably through the LaborNET or the World Wide
WEB Page, to be able to communicate with them and to be able to
mobilize them on far shorter notice than the mails will allow. I
don't take that back. Don't tell the postals I said that. </p>
<p>REPORTER: I want to be very clear about the organizing fund.
If these numbers are what you intend on spending each year -- $5
million in the year. . . . </p>
<p>DONAHUE: $5, $10, $15 and $20 million. </p>
<p>REPORTER: That is the annual amount of money that is
anticipated to be spent each year? </p>
<p>DONAHUE: Yes. OK? </p>
<p>REPORTER: Thank you.</p>

<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO President Tom Donahue<br>
AFL-CIO Public Employees Department Convention<br>
Lake Buena Vista, Fla., September 8, 1995 </h3>
<p>I am delighted to be here. I am accustomed to saying I'm
delighted to be here and bring you the greetings of the
president. Now, I deliver them in person as the president, and
also bring you greetings from Secretary-Treasurer Barbara
Easterling, the AFL-CIO Executive Council, and the more that 13
million working women and men who are the American trade union
movement. </p>
<p>I come before you at a very interesting time for our movement.
As Mario Cuomo noted yesterday, two fine trade unionists -- both
of them New Yorkers, both of them Irish-American, both of them
out of SEIU Local 32B-32J and both balding ever so slightly --
are running against each other to be the future president of the
AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>Those reports are right, and I'm one of the two. I just want
to note how proud I am of the fact that I helped bring the other
candidate, John Sweeney, into SEIU. I knew that he had great
potential, and I was pleased that he rose to the presidency of
the SEIU. I believe it would be wonderful if he continues to
provide my union with many more years of service in that
position. </p>
<p>Many of you in this room are supporting my candidacy and I
thank you for your support. For all the rest of you, I'm counting
you as undecided and will continue to pursue your vote
relentlessly by demonstrating that Barb and I are making changes
happen every day. But the fact is that I have not come before you
to give a campaign speech. That is for other times and other
places. </p>
<p>Instead, I would like to talk about an issue that really
unites us all -- a problem that concerns us all -- and that is
``government itself'' and what it means in our country. </p>
<p>For trade unionists, the public sector isn't just some
sideshow -- it is at the very heart of what we are all about. </p>
<p>We need a government that will ensure our right to associate
and guarantee that independent unions can exist. We need a
government that will ensure against sweatshops and child labor.
We need a government that creates infrastructure and maintains
it. We need a government that insures the purity of our food, the
safety of our work places and the healthiness of the water we
drink and the air we breathe. We need a government that provides
universal health care, and a fair trade policy, a government that
provides a tax code that makes the rich pay their fair share and
a Social Security system for our retirees. </p>
<p>Each of those is as vital to us as the air we breathe, and
each of those falls squarely inside the public sector. </p>
<p>You and I, and this department, are faced with a huge
contradiction in this country. It colors everything we do; it
affects everything we stand for. If we want to deal with it, we
have to call it what it is. </p>
<p>The fact is that in the past 20 years government in our
country has been demonized. We've sunk to the point where our
conventional wisdom is that government -- whether it's federal,
state or local -- always ruins whatever it touches. Another piece
of the conventional wisdom is that everything the government does
just gets worse and worse. </p>
<p>The truth is that the good things that government does in this
country are legion and -- almost always -- the things that only
government can do. You know well what they are. You and your
members do them day in and day out and do them very well. </p>
<p>I'm not suggesting that the public sector is perfect, any more
than businesses, colleges, trade unions or other institutions
made up of human beings are perfect. But consider for a moment
what government agencies -- and that means government employees
-- have accomplished. </p>
<p>You all know well the federal government has built dams,
created millions of public-sector jobs, kept prices steady when
there were shortages, created the interstate highway system,
managed the air lanes of the busiest airspace in the world, and
put together a medical system in the military that led to a
revolution in civilian medicine. </p>
<p>We trade unionists could certainly add to the list. We would
include government agencies that stop employers from violating
the 40-hour week, enforce the minimum wage, keep an eye on
private pensions so they aren't bankrupted by hot-dog speculators
and guarantee that independent unions have a right to exist. </p>
<p>And how about the myth that things always get worse? Look at
the postal service and Social Security. These are two of our
biggest, most important agencies, and both of them work far
better today than they did 20 years ago. There are plenty of
others. </p>
<p>And while we're at it, look at OSHA. For all its petty flaws,
for all its limitations, it has made the workplace safer for
literally millions of Americans over the past quarter-century </p>
<p>We have cut accident/death rates by more than one-half. Still
6,000 Americans are killed on the job each year and tens of
thousands are injured. Now, the Department of Labor estimates
these cuts will cost 50,000 more accidents and year. I don't know
anyone in the country who voted for that. </p>
<p>You could tell the same story about thousands of state and
local government agencies around the country. </p>
<p>Is there reason to complain about the public sector? Sure
there is, but the real truth is that much of what's wrong with
government is that it has too few resources, too little money,
too few staffers, or too limited a mandate to do its job right. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, OSHA itself is a dramatic example of this. It's
a fine agency, but wouldn't it be nice if its protections were
extended to cover everyone in this room and all of the people you
represent? </p>
<p>That's the kind of government reform -- of re-invention, if
you will -- that we'd like to see. When Republicans talk about
``reforming'' government, they usually mean ``annihilating
government.'' When we talk reform, we want to make the thing
better. And that's a far different approach. </p>
<p>The sad fact is that people's trust in government is at a
dangerously low level, and that's the case even among union
members. </p>
<p>A poll commissioned by the AFL-CIO has found that only 38
percent of our own members have ``generally positive'' feelings
about the federal government. There are almost as many -- 32
percent -- who feel negatively, and 30 percent are neutral or
unsure. Those numbers are pretty close to the rest of the
population. </p>
<p>The same poll asked union members to volunteer one or two
things that the president or Congress could do ``to help people
like you.'' The most common answer -- it came from one-third of
our members -- was to lower taxes. And there was quite a bit of
support for reducing government spending and balancing the
budget. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, those results aren't unusual. We've been seeing
the same kind of distrust and cynicism in the general population.
In 1958, 73 percent of Americans said they ``trust the government
in Washington to do what is right most of the time or always.''
Today, only 22 percent do. In 1965, 35 percent of Americans said
that ``big government'' posed ``the biggest threat'' to the
country's future. Today, 67 percent believe that. </p>
<p>So, there we have one side of our contradiction: the American
people don't like government and the people who work for it. The
other side of the contradiction is that the American people like
what the government does. </p>
<p>The political scientist Robert Putnam puts it this way: ``We
[Americans] want government to do things, not just decide things
-- to educate children, pay pensioners, stop crime, create jobs,
hold down prices, encourage family values, and so on. ``We do not
agree,'' Putnam continues, ``on which of these things is most
urgent, nor how they should be accomplished, nor even whether
they are all worthwhile. All but the anarchists among us,
however, agree that at least some of the time on some issues,
action is required of government institutions.''<br>
That's absolutely right. But we're left with this huge
contradiction: people on the one hand, hating government, and on
the other hand, liking what government does. If you're a public
employee, it stares you in the face every time you show up for
work. </p>
<p>But what these polls and this contradiction tells us is very
important. There is a great deal of confusion and ambivalence in
this country, and it's no wonder. For nearly 20 years, Reagan,
Bush, Gingrich and their gang have systematically bashed and
insulted the public sector. In fairness, we ought to note this
didn't begin with Reagan but with Jimmy Carter -- who ran against
Washington and against the very government he aspired to lead. </p>
<p>Then came Reagan's monstrous comments about `getting
government off our backs'' and the rest of his poisonous
rhetoric. The bad politics and the public employee bashing of the
Bush era and of Gingrich were inevitable. </p>
<p>What the American conversation badly needs is a strong,
progressive voice that speaks out against government bashing,
against privatization, against contracting out, against the
idolatry of the market -- a voice for a vigorous, well-funded,
well-managed public sector that deserves and gets America's
support and respect. </p>
<p>America needs to know that the people who clean our streets,
guard our prisons, inspect our poultry, deliver our mail, and
keep our airports safe are vital to this nation. They and
millions like them make this country run. They deserve the same
good pay, decent working conditions and job security as everyone
else. And they are morally entitled to the same collective
bargaining rights as every other worker in America. </p>
<p>There is no institution that is in a better position to take
on that task than the trade union movement. There are two things
we must do. </p>
<p>First, we as leaders need to go out there on the morning news,
the late-night talk shows and the radio call-ins and talk about
what government and public employees really mean to America. </p>
<p>I've said this before, and I'll say it again. When our
principles are attacked, I want us to respond. When our movement
is slandered, I want to speak the truth. When myths are spread, I
want to fight them with facts. </p>
<p>And to each of you -- whatever union you're in, whatever
position you hold, whether you're woman or man, black or brown or
yellow or white, young or old, whether you're talking to ``Larry
King Live'' or your next-door neighbor -- I invite you, I beg you
to join me. </p>
<p>Be proud of who you are and what you represent. Be proud of
the work you do and the movement you are in -- and spread the
world about what you believe. We have an enormous public
educating job to do in the face of very tough odds. </p>
<p>Let this be the moment when the Public Employee Department and
the entire trade union movement move to the center of America's
public dialogue. We've been locked out of it for too long and
have to fight our way back in. </p>
<p>But there is a second thing we need to do. We need a far
tougher, smarter, more sophisticated, more extensive political
effort than ever before to ``take government back'' from the
millionaires and the right-wingers and return it to the American
people who work for a living -- and that is what the AFL-CIO has
started to do this summer. </p>
<p>We have now begun the most intensive political campaign in our
federation's history. We have launched a special project to train
500 labor activists in the nuts and bolts of grass-roots
political activity over the next 12 months. Why? Because there
are lots of our members who no longer know how to run an
effective COPE program -- to activate our members, to get them
registered, voting and involved. This program will provide a
chance for them to learn or relearn those skills. </p>
<p>I have already appointed a full-time director for this
project, Susan Washington. We've had the first weekend planning
session for our directors and staff who'll be involved and we're
going into the field this month. </p>
<p>I have also assigned half of the AFL-CIO field staff and
committed millions of dollars to the Stand UP for America's
Working Families campaign. We have targeted 36 critical
congressional districts during the last recess -- districts that
we have a good chance to win back -- for a grass-roots campaign
between now and the 1996 elections. </p>
<p>We're going to let the voters in those districts know just
what the Republicans are doing to them. They're entitled to hear
the facts. </p>
<p>In just the last two weeks of August, we spent $1 million in
local advertising in 26 of those districts to focus public
attention on the OSHA cuts and the Labor-HHS appropriations bill.
That buy brought us to slightly more than $2.5 million for this
Stand UP for America's Working Families campaign in more than 60
districts and the nation's capital during the three congressional
recesses. </p>
<p>Finally, when the 1996 election campaign starts, we are going
to run the largest political education program we have ever
undertaken. We have more than 13 million names of active and
retired members on our computer lists. With the exception of
AFSCME and the Teamsters, all of our unions now supply COPE with
their membership lists for voter registration and education and
get-outthe -vote activities. We've got to work those lists so
that when trade unionists go to vote on Election Day 1996, they
will know what's at stake. </p>
<p>For public employees and for all Americans, a lot depends on
what happens in November of 1996 and we have to work as never
before to win back the House, to elect a Democratic president and
to begin to recapture our power in the capitols and state houses. </p>
<p>Beyond that we have to engage this nation in the debate on
taxes or we'll lose badly and public employees will suffer badly.
We're going to see extensive debate in the Congress on the
socalled flat tax. That debate will begin next year and running
beyond the election into the next Congress. </p>
<p>The Republican version will be touted as simplification and
reductions for everyone, but of course the major benefit will go
to the rich. </p>
<p>The Democrats seem ready to engage in debate on the same terms
with this version of a flat tax and we'll wind up in a sterile
argument about which version is fairer. </p>
<p>I propose that we have to change the terms of that debate. We
have to say you can't starve government any longer. We have
already cut to the bone on services and employment. It's time to
look at the tax and income side in order to maintain government
services and government efficiency. I believe we have to offer
our version of a fair tax which must include substantial new
taxes on the rich. </p>
<p>The astonishing maldistribution of wealth in this country goes
on and on. Take a look at the top one-half of one percent in the
U.S. -- the 50,000 richest households in America with minimum
holdings of $10 million. They own one-third of the $22 trillion
wealth of the nation. In 1981 they owned $1 trillion, the Reagan
tax cuts gave them $2 to $3 trillion more. And the continuing tax
structure gives them a transfer of $170 billion per year. That's
the rate at which their wealth grows. </p>
<p>It's not their fault. They didn't ask for these additional
trillions and didn't earn them -- but our tax system gives it to
them. </p>
<p>So, we need to propose a Wealth Tax -- a special one-time or
continuing levy on wealth as Switzerland and several other
nations now do. And we ought to set up a new period of
``givebacks,'' this time from the super rich. It's to us trade
unionists to propose and pursued that dialogue. </p>
<p>Let me just touch on two other subjects. </p>
<p>I note from your program that you received reports yesterday
on the work of the Secretary of Labor's Task Force on Excellence
in State and Local Government Through Labor-Management
Cooperation. (I would like to nominate that for the longest title
in history.) </p>
<p>I gather John Brock and the two co-chairs have done a good job
in drawing together a substantial body of information on the
subject and I'm going to testify next week. I will be trying to
add what we all believe is the crucial element on which
excellence can be based: the collective bargaining relationship.
That relationship has to be developed and fostered on the basis
of decent laws that give public employees the right to associate
freely and to choose their representatives to bargain over all
the condition of their employment. </p>
<p>Let me say that all through the early 1960s and 1970s -- when
I was at SEIU -- I was the voice of that union in all the debates
about public employee legislation. Don Wasserman of AFSCME and I
carried the dialogue all around the country to file for public
employee collective bargaining rights and collective bargaining
laws. </p>
<p>Now you can look and say we made a lot of progress in all of
the states and our unions have grown in pubic employment, but the
reality is we still have 24 states without full collective
bargaining rights; nearly 4 million workers are denied their
rights. </p>
<p>And that is a disgrace. </p>
<p>We all believe in excellence. We all believe in partnership.
I've led the course of the federation that forged those policy
positions over the years. But you can't have excellence, you
can't have partnership, if you deny workers their fundamental
rights by resorting to an outmoded theory of the sovereignty of
the state. So we have lots of work ahead of us on that count. </p>
<p>Finally, let me note the problems coming at us in the federal
sector on Oct. 1. There is a very real possibility, even a very
real probability, that some or all federal agencies are going to
be without funds and will lock out their workers. </p>
<p>The maneuvering of the Republicans in the House and Senate
seem designed to force the president's hand to veto some or all
of the appropriations. Certainly we will strongly urge a veto of
the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. In its
current form, it guts OSHA, practically repeals Davis-Bacon, guts
the Mine Safety and Health Act, the National Labor Relations
Board, the college student loan program and so on. </p>
<p>The stage is set for a different confrontation with a
president who won't accept these kinds of cuts and the Republican
leadership delighted to have government grind to a halt and try
to blame gridlock on the president. As politics, it will provide
high drama. </p>
<p>But for the workers involved, it will lock them of their jobs
-- not just federal employees, but lots of grant workers in the
states as well. </p>
<p>For our part, we have to worry about them and find ways to
ease their burden. I have begun some consultations to explore
what the federation and the affected unions can do in the way of
nointerest or low-interest loans to tide members over until the
political sparring ends. </p>
<p>I think it should be possible to do this in the same way we
help out on strike funds and strike assistance in the private
sector and we are looking into the use of Union Privilege funds
or AFL-CIO Reserve funds. </p>
<p>I am aware that the PED is working with an AFGE Task Force
created by President John Sturdivant and we want very much to
help in any way we can. </p>
<p>In this meeting, as in all other, the Federation has to be
taking an activist role in support of its affiliates. That's been
my direction for as long as I have been in the federation and it
will continue for as long as I serve as your president. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>SP 09/04/95 -- Alemeda County Labor Day Picnic </title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<p align=center><strong>AFL-CIO PRESIDENT TOM DONAHUE</strong><br>
<strong>ALAMEDA COUNTY LABOR DAY PICNIC</strong><br>
<strong>PLEASANTON, CALIFORNIA, SEPTEMBER 4, 1995</strong> </p>
<p>I am delighted to be here and to celebrate this Labor Day with you. I bring you greetings from 
Secretary-Treasurer Barbara Easterling, the AFL-CIO Executive Council, and the more than 13 
million proud women and men who are the American trade union movement. </p>
<p>This is the day we wait for all year, the day we celebrate those who make our cars, teach our kids, 
clean our buildings, sew our clothes, build our homes, and load onto ships the goods that we 
produce. </p>
<p>This year, we also have to mark the struggles of workers on strike today. We mark our concerns 
for the strikers at the Detroit Free Press and News, at Staley, Caterpillar, Bridgestone, Diamond 
Walnut, for those at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas -- who mark the fourth anniversary of their 
strike on September 21 -- and for workers locked in similar struggles all around the country. </p>
<p>These are brave people, brave trade unionists standing up for their rights, their dignity, and against 
those who would attempt to destroy them and their unions. </p>
<p>I ask all of you to take a minute of silence sometime on this Labor Day for those workers, or to 
pray in your own way that their struggles will soon be won. </p>
<p>If you can send a contribution from your local, that would help them, too. </p>
<p>This Labor Day, we have to note that these are difficult times for working people and for their 
unions. </p>
<p>Wages have been stagnant despite high corporate profits. Last year, profits of major corporations 
were up 40 percent, productivity was up 2 1/2 percent, but real wages were up only onetenth of 
one percent -- and half of the workers in the nation were earning less than $24,000 per year. </p>
<p>It's true that union wages are still one-third higher than non-union wages, but we face continuing 
challenge to our wages and our benefits from all sides. </p>
<p>All of us, all of you, are working hard to overcome the difficulties that beset us -- working hard to 
change labor and change America -- working hard to grow, to improve the lives of our members, 
to establish decent conditions of work for our members, and to establish decent conditions in our 
society for all Americans. </p>
<p>We are working hard for conditions in which families can live with dignity and with confidence in 
their future. </p>
<p>We have a big job ahead of us in the next year, with contract negotiations for many of you and with 
political work for all of you. </p>
<p>We have to mobilize and motivate all of our members as never before. We need a friend in the 
White House and we need Democratic control of the House of Representatives if we are to make 
any progress. </p>
<p>Here in California, we need to reassert Democratic control in the legislature to protect the workers 
of this state against your governor -- that man who has libelled every immigrant and then, in one of 
the most hypocritical acts of American politics, posed in front of the Statue of Liberty to announce 
his campaign for the presidency. </p>
<p>She must have closed her eyes and he should have blushed with shame. </p>
<p>Over these past three years, in our efforts to advance the cause of workers, to advance their 
economic and social interests, we have had a friend in the White House. </p>
<p>We have had a president who passed and signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, so workers 
can take care of their families, a president who passed and signed the Hatch Act reform so federal 
workers can take part in politics like everyone else. </p>
<p>We have had a president who, in his first months in office, repealed the three executive orders 
George Bush had put in place at the urging of the National Right to Work Committee to plague our 
unions and weaken our ability to defend workers' interests. </p>
<p>We have had a friend in the White House, a president who peopled his administration with decent 
trade unionists -- who appointed people to the National Labor Relations Board and other agencies 
who would enforce the laws designed to help workers. </p>
<p>We have had a president who fought long and hard at our side to ban the evil practice of allowing 
employers to fire strikers and hire scabs -- and after the Republicans blocked him and us in the 
Senate, he signed an executive order to stop federal agencies from doing business with companies 
with scabs. </p>
<p>He has stood with us for affirmative action, for OSHA reform, for increasing the minimum wage. It 
hasn't been an easy time. His and our hopes, the hopes of 1992 and 1993 were dashed by the 
1994 elections -- dashed by a crop of right-wing Republicans who are bent on repealing or 
weakening every law that protects workers and killing all the programs that help workers. </p>
<p>They want to gut OSHA, repeal Davis-Bacon, throttle the NLRB, cut college loans, cut Medicare 
and Medicaid -- all to advantage the rich. </p>
<p>And what stands between us and them is the veto pen of the president of the United States. </p>
<p>Who's side is Bill Clinton on? Make no mistake about it: he's on your side, he's on the side of 
everyone in this country who has to work for a living. He's on the side of the trade union 
movement. </p>
<p>I am proud to introduce the most pro-worker, pro-union president in more than a generation, my 
brothers and sisters, the President of the United States -- Bill Clinton.</p>

<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<p>AFL-CIO President Tom Donahue<br>
1995 Labor Day Roundtable<br>
Thursday, Aug. 31, 1995<br>
<br>
<br>
CANDICE JOHNSON, AFL-CIO press secretary: Let me just note, in the<br>
handouts are some of the things from our Stand UP campaign. We have<br>
ads running right now in about 26 districts and activities in about<br>
36. It is our legislative and political campaign. Probably our<br>
biggest concern was the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill the House<br>
voted just before recess. When the Senate comes back, they are<br>
going to take that up.<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: Thank you all for coming. I'm delighted to visit with<br>
you, talk a little about the state of labor on Labor Day. I don't<br>
have any formal opening statement. I thought we'd save some time<br>
and take your questions and I can try to respond.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Why don't you start with the state of labor?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: Okay. I think there is both good news and bad news on<br>
Labor Day. <br>
<br>
If you look at the membership figures over the last two years,<br>
BLS reports that labor has grown by 390,000 members. And I believe<br>
that trend is continuing in '95. That's not a large growth, that's<br>
3 percent, but it is going in the right direction.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Bringing membership to what, then?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: A little over 13 million. Our membership has been fairly<br>
static for a lot of years. We haven't lost a lot of membership, but<br>
we have not grown with the growth of the work force. <br>
<br>
In terms of where workers find themselves and consequently the<br>
labor movement finds itself on Labor Day, I think the state of the<br>
world for workers is a very insecure and difficult one. And when<br>
times are hard for workers, then times are hard for their unions.<br>
What the workers see is big profit increases in 1994. Forbes<br>
magazine says 40 percent for the major 900 corporations.<br>
Productivity is up 2.5 percent wages up 0.1 percent. <br>
<br>
Clearly, America needs a raise on Labor Day. That ought to be<br>
the message: that there ought to be some sharing of those profits<br>
with the people who create them.<br>
<br>
When workers look at the federal Congress this Labor Day, what<br>
they see is a Congress that is attempting to strip away from them<br>
what protections they have and to wipe out or diminish the programs<br>
that affect them and benefit them. So they are getting hit from<br>
both sides in terms of stripping away protections -- OSHA, the<br>
attack on the 40-hour week and all the rest of it. And they are<br>
seeing the programs that improve life for workers taken away in the<br>
form of the college loan reductions, the effects of Medicare,<br>
Medicaid cuts and so forth. <br>
<br>
I think what workers are feeling on Labor Day is that this is<br>
not what anybody intended. And the country is going in the wrong<br>
direction -- not just in a political sense, but clearly in an<br>
economic sense. We continue to enrich the already rich and we<br>
continue to re-enforce the enormous maldistribution of wealth and<br>
increase the concentration of that wealth in the hands of fewer and<br>
fewer people.<br>
<br>
We are now at a point at which one-half of 1 percent of the<br>
people hold nearly a third of the total wealth of the country. Half<br>
of 1 percent -- that's probably everybody with more than $10<br>
million. And they own $7 trillion of a $22 trillion wealth package.<br>
<br>
I think it's time that serious consideration be given to the<br>
theories that are being advanced out there, to talk about a wealth<br>
tax and to foster the idea that it is indeed time for give-backs --<br>
and it's time for give-backs from the rich this time. Workers paid<br>
their share and now it's time for give-backs from the rich.<br>
<br>
I think the Congress, instead of talking about flat taxes,<br>
instead of talking about cutting taxes for the rich, ought to be<br>
talking about a wealth tax. We ought to be taking back some of the<br>
trillions of dollars that have been transferred to the rich over<br>
the last 12 to 15 years.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Isn't it fair to assume that a good number of the people<br>
who are in your various labor unions actually helped create this<br>
situation by voting for the Republicans? They couldn't have done it<br>
without ...<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: If you say a fair number, it's something less than a<br>
majority, however. But point well taken.<br>
<br>
Some of our people, like lots of other people in the country,<br>
were so distressed with the way the country was going that they<br>
sought relief in the anti-government mood, in the concept that<br>
government was the devil. Get government off my back. That became<br>
a popular cry. I'd only footnote that by noting that in every<br>
election that our people, the majority of union workers, have voted<br>
for the Democratic candidate or the progressive candidate. <br>
<br>
Now, was there a departure of some percentage of people who in<br>
previous times voted Democratic or progressive, who in the last 6,<br>
8, 10, 12 years shifted over to the right? Sure. The percentage<br>
among trade union members was far less than the percentage of the<br>
population at large. But I don't think anybody who shifted over,<br>
anybody who voted for the crop of right-wing Republicans in the<br>
House, I don't think any of those people voted to cut Occupational<br>
Safety and Health and none of those people voted for a condition<br>
which the Labor Department says is going to cost us 50,000<br>
additional injuries next year on the job, God knows how many<br>
additional deaths on the job. We have spent 20 years bringing that<br>
number down, cutting it in half and now we are going to stop<br>
enforcing the law. We are going to cut enforcement by 50 percent.<br>
<br>
That's obscene and nobody voted for that. Nobody voted to do<br>
away with the 40-hour week, I assure you. I don't know anybody in<br>
this nation who even dreamt of such an obscene idea. But the right-<br>
wingers in the Congress apparently accept it and think that it is<br>
a sound idea to say that we should tear up the fabric of American<br>
society, tear up the concept of the normal five-day work week and<br>
two days off, and allow employers to work people up to 20 days<br>
straight.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: One of the things that happened in that last election<br>
was not so much that they switched sides but that a lot of people<br>
stayed home. There was a very low, very low turnout. Is there<br>
anything to suggest, and I don't know where you are getting your<br>
readings on this, but is there anything to suggest that it would be<br>
different at the next election, that there is a counter-anger<br>
building or is it about the same as it was?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I think in terms of the presidency, there is some turning<br>
and some more enthusiasm among workers for the Clinton<br>
administration, as they see the horrors of the other side. <br>
<br>
I think that there is some turning and some recognition that<br>
this is not what we voted for among people who voted for<br>
Republicans last time around. I think you see that.<br>
<br>
I think that certainly there is a growing recognition among<br>
our members and I think among workers generally that this Congress<br>
and this nation are not worker-friendly. Nobody is advancing the<br>
interests of workers, except the AFL-CIO. But not many of our<br>
politicians on the Republican side.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Including Clinton?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: Oh no. Certainly not. The Democrats and Clinton have been<br>
trying to advance the worker interest. They don't control, but they<br>
have been trying to advance worker interest. Certainly Clinton has<br>
been.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Mr. Donahue, you mentioned earlier the national rise in<br>
union members, but that percentage of the overall work force, that<br>
number, has declined steadily for quite some time. Why do you think<br>
that is happening and, then, what can you do to change that?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: The reasons for the decline are several. One, the<br>
diminution of employment opportunities in the industries in which<br>
we were traditionally best represented, the destruction of our<br>
manufacturing base. And the reduction of employment in<br>
manufacturing is one of the bigger reasons.<br>
<br>
The continuing shipment offshore of jobs from those same<br>
industries is another. Look at the UAW, now at half its previous<br>
size. Look at the condition of our textile and clothing workers<br>
union, less than half its former size. That's part of why<br>
membership has dropped and why as a percentage of the work force we<br>
haven't been growing. Because the industries in which we were<br>
traditionally most strongly represented are the industries that<br>
have been hardest-hit by downsizing, shipping offshore and so<br>
forth.<br>
<br>
Secondly, where we're experiencing growth has been largely in<br>
the service areas -- particularly health care in the service<br>
industries -- where conditions for organizing are quite similar to<br>
the traditional conditions that provide people the desire to form<br>
and join unions. And in the public sector, the growth has come<br>
largely because of the changes in collective bargaining laws. We<br>
argue that if it was possible in the private sector to easily form<br>
and join a union, if it was possible to suggest having a union in<br>
the workplace without threatening your livelihood, without knowing<br>
that the boss is going to fire certain people who are engaged in a<br>
campaign, without knowing if people were free of the fear of<br>
harassment and intimidation from the boss in the private sector,<br>
they would do what the people in the public sector are doing under<br>
appropriate laws. So the growth in the public sector has come --<br>
and it's a series of states -- that have provided workers real<br>
protection and the opportunity for collective bargaining. And they<br>
vote overwhelming for union representation.<br>
<br>
So that's where the growth has come. <br>
<br>
QUESTION: Do you think labor needs to adopt a new approach in<br>
terms of attracting attention in areas that are white collar,<br>
office, and what not? We had a major bank merger this week and the<br>
first thing, practically, they announced was 12,000 people are<br>
going to lose their jobs. This is what seems to be happening all<br>
over the country. And the 85 percent or so of the work force that<br>
is not represented by unions are going through tremendous tumult.<br>
Is that where organized labor's future lies? Is this an area to go<br>
after? Or do you have your hands full just trying to deal with<br>
keeping what you've got on the books in terms of labor protection<br>
laws?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I've got a two-part answer, but let me just preface it by<br>
saying we don't have our hands full keeping what we have. The<br>
reality is that most of our unions are busy organizing and bringing<br>
members into their ranks every day. The static condition of the<br>
overall number reflects enormously successful organizing, replacing<br>
enormous job losses. The fact is -- for all our unions -- that if<br>
you could stop the leakage out the bottom, they'd all reflect<br>
growth. But their growth is now being offset against the job<br>
destruction and the leakage from the bottom. <br>
<br>
In terms of the future, I think we have a primary obligation<br>
to work among low-wage workers and we have always fulfilled that<br>
responsibility. I think that's a primary area for continuing our<br>
organizing activities and one in which there is a great deal of<br>
enthusiasm for traditional union organizing and for the achievement<br>
of collective bargaining. I think in the white-collar, semi-<br>
professional and professional areas, there is a desire for<br>
associational unionism, if you will, for people coming together for<br>
purposes that may not reach all the way to traditional collective<br>
bargaining. That's very clear from the National Bureau of Economic<br>
Research study, the Freeman-Rogers piece. There is an enormous<br>
desire. Their numbers run into the 70th percentiles of people who<br>
absolutely want to have some way of coming together, forming an<br>
association, dealing with some workplace problems, dealing with<br>
their professional relationships, their professional training,<br>
knowing more about education and work opportunities and so forth.<br>
9to5 is, I guess, the earliest precursor of that. But I think the<br>
expression of desire on the part of these people and the NBER study<br>
goes quite beyond 9to5. <br>
<br>
I think we have to answer that. There are three or four things<br>
we have to do. But one is to answer the desire of workers for<br>
traditional organizing for traditional collective bargaining, which<br>
arises most strongly among the heavily exploited class who see very<br>
short-term futures in their current employment and who feel very<br>
insecure.<br>
<br>
Among this other group of workers, whether you call them<br>
white-collar or semi-professional or professional, there is an<br>
equal amount of insecurity and they want something. They are not<br>
quite sure what it is. I think we have to provide the type of<br>
associational relationship that they want. So we need to modify<br>
some of our structures to do that. <br>
<br>
Thirdly, I think we have to look at the contingent, temporary,<br>
part-time work force where you are talking about some 20 percent of<br>
the population. Now some of that, particularly among the part-<br>
timers, is in industries that are susceptible to traditional<br>
organizing and among workers who want a traditional collective<br>
bargaining approach in some form in these other areas. And I think<br>
we have to try to address the part-timers, the contingent work<br>
force. Those are fairly tough assignments and the contingent work<br>
force and this so-called independent contractor work force requires<br>
yet another approach and a kind of attempt to organize people by<br>
their skill category or by their job titles, I guess you'd say,<br>
rather than by their place of employment. And that's yet another<br>
approach. So I think we have to do all three of those.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: In the study that you cited, the Freeman-Rogers study,<br>
the overwhelming desire for a voice in the workplace that was<br>
expressed seemed to have the condition that workers would rather<br>
have a weak organization that had management's blessing rather than<br>
a strong organization that management opposes. And so, if you're<br>
trying to address the wants and desires of those workers, it seems<br>
that what they are crying out for are company unions. <br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I read the results of the survey as proving the<br>
effectiveness of the boss's terror tactics. He has convinced<br>
workers that if you look for a traditional union approach here, you<br>
will experience even more insecurity. And there will be harassment<br>
and intimidation. So they succeeded in frightening people in the<br>
workplace. There is no question about that. <br>
<br>
I don't hear those people as speaking for a company union in<br>
the traditional sense of that word at all. They are not looking for<br>
a patsy organization. They want a real voice in the workplace. <br>
<br>
QUESTION: But they don't want to upset their boss in the process.<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: Yes, that's right. They don't want to upset the boss.<br>
They are saying, I think, &quot;We don't want a confrontational<br>
situation here. Because we know what will happen in a<br>
confrontational situation. The boss is going to intimidate, harass<br>
and terrorize and make us even more insecure.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think you provide what they want. You provide a voice which<br>
is not in its initial stages confrontational. You attempt to behave<br>
rationally and hope that an employer responds rationally. <br>
<br>
I have to say to you that there is very little evidence that<br>
that'll happen. But you have to hope. Hope springs eternal that the<br>
boss will behave rationally and will respond to peoples' desires.<br>
There is lots of anecdotal information that he will, and that in<br>
the early stages of such an effort he does respond to efforts of<br>
people to have voice.<br>
<br>
As those people become more and more accustomed to the<br>
expression of voice, sooner or later, that voice expresses the<br>
desire for a larger share of the profits of what they produce. It<br>
expresses itself as wanting conditions or wanting freedoms that the<br>
boss isn't prepared to give up. He wants control in the workplace<br>
and he doesn't want to give up control in the workplace. <br>
<br>
So history is replete with the examples of associations that <br>
were formed and later grew into true, full collective bargaining<br>
mechanisms. I think that is a natural evolution and I think that's<br>
what the people in the Freeman-Rogers survey are saying.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Is that what you are going to try to cultivate as far as<br>
organizing people in white-collar jobs, rather than the traditional<br>
approach?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: Yes. Let me be clear about one thing. The traditional<br>
organizing approach is not necessarily a confrontational approach.<br>
It is an approach to the people to form and join a union. It<br>
doesn't necessarily have to be confrontational. It becomes<br>
confrontational when the boss creates that confrontation. I don't<br>
know anybody who wants to fight with the boss. The boss is much<br>
more ready to fight with the people.<br>
<br>
When I distinguish between traditional and non-traditional,<br>
I'm not talking about confrontation. I'm talking about the<br>
distinction of the goal that's being sought. Some organizing looks<br>
to the short-term achievement of collective bargaining. And I'm<br>
saying to you that among this group of people we are talking about,<br>
white-collar workers or semi-professional workers, they are not<br>
ready yet for that. They don't want to fight to achieve that degree<br>
of recognition from the employer. But they want a voice. And we<br>
have to adapt the product we offer to meet that need.<br>
<br>
That's all I'm saying.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: What do you suppose the image is of labor these days --<br>
Labor Day 1995? Not just among your members, but among the country<br>
as a whole?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I would hope that it is increasingly understood that we<br>
are standing up for America's working families. That the only voice<br>
in this country that speaks up on a daily basis for the protection<br>
of workers and the advancement of their interests is the labor<br>
movement of this country. That's absolutely true.<br>
<br>
And I'm getting hoarse from trying to do that and trying to<br>
say that.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Various surveys are going to show a different attitude<br>
toward labor unions as too pushy, maybe even outdated in the role<br>
that they take on. Is that something that you are working on?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I think we are certainly working on making clear to the<br>
American people that we are the representatives of workers in this<br>
nation. That's our role in life. And that we are not a narrow<br>
interest, pursuing only the interest of those who are trade<br>
unionists. Obviously, on the job, in the workplace, in terms of<br>
wages, hours, conditions and benefits, that's what we are for union<br>
members -- that's our primary function. But our secondary function<br>
is to advance the interest of those members who are our members in<br>
society. And the only way we can do that is to advance the<br>
interests of all workers in society. So at the political and<br>
legislative level, we are the voice of all of the workers in this<br>
society.<br>
<br>
When we fight for OSHA protections or fight against the<br>
Republican efforts to cut those protections, we are certainly not<br>
fighting only for the 16 percent of American workers who are trade<br>
union members. We are fighting for the 100 percent who are going to<br>
be put at risk by cutting OSHA protections.<br>
<br>
So I would argue that people ought to see the trade union<br>
movement as the voice of workers in this country -- all workers.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Can you talk a bit more about the political climate? You<br>
said earlier that you didn't think a lot of folks knew what they<br>
were getting when they voted for a lot of these Republicans. Yet it<br>
seems to me that the Republicans were quite up front about what<br>
they represented and what they were going to do. Newt Gingrich kept<br>
referring to that Readers' Digest article, I think it was, about<br>
unions ruining New York City. He had this anti-union rhetoric all<br>
along, so why do you think that people are surprised by it and how<br>
are you going to counter that?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I don't think that people all across the country in<br>
congressional races voted for Newt Gingrich. <br>
<br>
QUESTION: But he kind of set the tone.<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: He set the tone. He laid out their &quot;Contract on America.&quot;<br>
But you'd be hard-put to find a lot of voters around the country,<br>
including in Georgia, who had a sense of what the &quot;Contract&quot; was<br>
about. What Gingrich was promising was small government. It was a<br>
repetition of &quot;We'll get the government off your back. We are going<br>
to reduce government.&quot; That's a fancy slogan. People like that kind<br>
of slogan. It's simplistic. And they're finding out now the<br>
consequences of that kind of a simplistic appearance. And the<br>
consequences are the cutting back of services that help people, the<br>
endangerment of people on the job, the reduction of opportunities<br>
for their kids and so forth.<br>
<br>
They will find out even more about that as more and more<br>
programs and responsibilities are transferred to the states and<br>
state or city taxes have to be increased to cover the shortfall in<br>
those programs. That is as inevitable as tomorrow. City taxes,<br>
state taxes will increase and you all know it. Once the federal<br>
government cuts back, somebody is going to have to pick up that<br>
slack. It's going to result in increases all the way down the line.<br>
This will be a slower education for the people who voted for the<br>
Republican right, but it'll come.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Isn't there a danger that if the labor movement's No. 1 <br>
priority -- organizing the most exploited segment of the work force<br>
-- is successful, that by focusing on that segment that the labor<br>
movement is going to lose political clout because that segment of<br>
the work force is just not as influential as the middle class, as<br>
white collar workers, the semi-professionals. And that if you want<br>
to build labor's image among the influential segment of the country<br>
that you have got to appeal to them. Is there a danger in<br>
alienating them?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I don't think so. I was thinking as you offered the<br>
question that if I really believed that I'd work someplace else.<br>
I'd work in a public relations firm trying to influence the middle<br>
and rich class as a way of improving the nation.<br>
<br>
No, I don't think so at all. I think that we have always<br>
organized workers. And most workers are badly paid. That's the<br>
reality. It is the people in the most exploited groups who most<br>
seek a way out of their more desperate situations. The middle-class<br>
earner is less prone to do that. So our organizing has always been<br>
concentrated on those people who are in the lower pay groups. <br>
<br>
The truth is, however, that we've been quite successful in<br>
other areas of the work force. And I think the labor movement<br>
represents a very interesting spread, from the lowest-paid janitors<br>
to the actors and artists to the writers and the airline pilots.<br>
And lots of earners in between. So I don't think there is any risk<br>
of distorting the labor movement's interests. I think that we have<br>
worked as hard with the airline pilots, for example, and with the<br>
flight attendants and with the teachers to see that their needs are<br>
met within the federation and that we help them in their organizing<br>
efforts just as much as we have with unions organizing low-paid<br>
workers.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: This wouldn't be complete without a campaign question.<br>
I heard you got a good reception at the Building and Construction<br>
Trades meeting in Chicago. Is there anything you can tell us about<br>
what the changes in the Carpenters union, for example, might mean?<br>
Was Mr. Lucassen's departure and Mr. McCarron's ascension good news<br>
for you?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I thought the good news was that the Carpenters union<br>
refused to vote an endorsement to John Sweeney at their executive<br>
board meeting, though it was my understanding that Sig Lucassen<br>
asked for such an endorsement.<br>
<br>
I thought that was good news.<br>
<br>
I had asked for an opportunity to speak to that board. Sig had<br>
invited me the night before and I was unable to go to the meeting.<br>
But I'm told that I will have an opportunity to speak to their<br>
board at their convention. I'd been invited to speak to their<br>
convention many months ago. And I'll be having a meeting with their<br>
executive board then.<br>
<br>
So I regard that as indicative that that union is still making<br>
up its mind, as I believe a number of other unions are making up<br>
their minds. I just don't believe that the Iowa primary decides the<br>
presidential races and I don't believe that whatever figures<br>
anybody wants to cite in May, June, July or August decide a race<br>
that's going to be held on the 25th of October.<br>
<br>
We'll take the vote on the 25th of October.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: You have said a couple of times in the past that in the<br>
future you would state who was in your camp and offer the same sort<br>
of numbers of support that Sweeney-Trumka has been promoting. Are<br>
you close to doing that?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: The reality is that I'm being supported by 47 to 48<br>
unions. Sweeney is claiming 22 to 24. I think that leads me to<br>
conclude that I have the support of the majority of leaders who are<br>
most informed about the work of the federation and about what needs<br>
to be done.<br>
<br>
Now, it's perfectly true that the unions that are supporting<br>
John are bigger unions and so he has a numerical advantage at this<br>
point. That's clear. Part of the reason he has a numerical<br>
advantage is because he started with 1 million votes in his pocket<br>
which are from my union. <br>
<br>
That's a fair question. I think that the numbers will change.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Do you believe that the number of unions, would you<br>
agree that it is about the 60 percent for him?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: No, I think that's an exaggeration. I think it's more<br>
like 53, 54 percent. And there are still seven or eight unions that<br>
are in flight.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: What about the strength of the labor movement in the<br>
South? The last couple of years there have been some major plant<br>
openings with Mercedes and BMW in South Carolina and Alabama. The<br>
South has a strong right-to-work tradition and this is where a lot<br>
of businesses are going. How are you doing in the South and what<br>
are you doing to make any gains down there?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I think the question on Mercedes, BMW is really a UAW<br>
question. They have been involved in efforts to organize and to<br>
represent the workers in those plants and I think those will<br>
obviously continue over some time.<br>
<br>
The interesting thing about plant movement to the South is<br>
that I think of the Saturn operation, where the UAW has been a<br>
prime mover in the effort to create the new company, and I think<br>
it's setting a style for the South. I hope it is. That it is a<br>
model that would carry through into a lot of other parts of the<br>
auto industry production in the South. But the federation has not<br>
been singly involved on the Mercedes, BMW issue or the other issues<br>
there. <br>
<br>
There is continuing organizing in the South by lots of our<br>
affiliates and the IUD, the Industrial Union Department, has long<br>
coordinated a Southern organizing strategy, with continuing slow<br>
growth.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: A lot of governors who are getting elected are quite<br>
open about promoting their right-to-work states and their anti-<br>
union environment. And they succeed in getting a lot of businesses,<br>
not just automotive. The success is to promote yourself as non-<br>
union. How do you make gain?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: But that's not new. That's been going on for 40 years, 50<br>
years.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: What will you do to combat that?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: It's not just the movement of the South that I say<br>
accounts for our membership, our inability to grow. It's a movement<br>
all the way South beyond the border, where you find 600,000<br>
American jobs in the maquiladoras; 165,000 of those belong to<br>
General Motors. They're hard to organize, clear on the other side<br>
of the border. They're even harder than other parts of the South. <br>
<br>
But that's not a new phenomenon, the states bidding against<br>
one another on either the largest tax advantage or a benefit they<br>
can offer a corporation or their right-to-work status. Indeed it is<br>
a question that's been raised in some of the discussions we've had<br>
with the Canadian Labor Congress about whether or not the right-to-<br>
work states confer an unfair trade advantage on companies which<br>
move from Canada to a right-to-work state. Is that not a subject<br>
that should be addressed under the side agreements on NAFTA? I<br>
think it's a fascinating question. <br>
<br>
Clearly, if you entice a company to move from Canada, where<br>
you don't have right-to-work laws and part of the enticement is to<br>
come to a Southern state where you do have right-to-work laws, then<br>
they do confer an unfair trade advantage?<br>
<br>
I think it's something that ought to be examined in the NAFTA<br>
side agreement.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Taking a look at Congress coming back next week and the<br>
Senate, realistically what kind of changes do you see being made in<br>
the Labor/HHS Appropriations? And have you had contact with Senator<br>
Specter, who chairs the Labor/HHS subcommittee? And out of that<br>
whole bill that was so critical coming out of the House, which of<br>
the points are you going to be working hardest to get modified in<br>
the Senate?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I think that the general view that the Senate is the more<br>
deliberative body will influence to a fair extent the Labor/HHS<br>
appropriations legislation and the other legislation coming along. <br>
<br>
I think that you would see in the Senate much less stomach for<br>
the kind of atrocious cuts in OSHA enforcement, the cuts in the<br>
National Labor Relations Board and so forth. <br>
<br>
So I think there is a different attitude in the Senate on some<br>
of those things and I think that the bills which will emerge in the<br>
Senate, hopefully, will be less vicious to workers than the House<br>
versions.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: In the Senate, you also have a Republican presidential<br>
nomination playing out.<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: Yes, but it may well be that in some issues that race<br>
benefits us. <br>
<br>
QUESTION: How is that?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: It seems to be stalling the discussions on worker rights<br>
in the Chile negotiations -- as opposed to the earlier Republican<br>
positions in the Senate that there would never be any inclusion or<br>
discussion of worker rights. Even standing still is better than<br>
that proposition.<br>
<br>
So I am hopeful that the Senate will prove to be slightly more<br>
rational. <br>
<br>
Yes, I met with Sen. Specter to discuss . . .<br>
<br>
QUESTION: When did you talk to him and what was his . . . <br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I'm sorry I can't give you an exact date, but it was<br>
probably about two weeks ago. I'm sorry it was more than that, it<br>
was the last days of the session, so it's three weeks ago.<br>
<br>
We talked, simply, about the prospects for Labor/HHS and how<br>
he was going to handle it, and I had the sense that there will be<br>
less action on some of those matters in the Senate committee and<br>
more of the amendments will be offered on the floor of the Senate.<br>
Whether that all goes or augurs well or ill, I can't divine at this<br>
point.<br>
<br>
I think, however, that the more the program is exposed to<br>
public discourse and public discussion the more people understand<br>
what the effect of these bills really are. Then I think that to<br>
that extent the Senate will be more cautious. I don't expect,<br>
however, the Senate to pass a bill on Labor/HHS appropriations that<br>
we will think is a splendid and sterling bill. <br>
<br>
I think you'll see much of what was done in the House remain<br>
and I think you'll see a presidential veto. And then we'll go on<br>
from there.<br>
<br>
But I thank that's going to be the course of lots of things as<br>
the legislative session heats up from now until December.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: You mentioned your anticipation of presidential vetoes.<br>
What can you say to your members and people in general would be the<br>
consequences of a Republican victory in the presidential level next<br>
and retaining the Congress? What would that augur for labor?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: A Republican victory in the presidential race? I think it<br>
would put at risk the social gains that the nation has achieved<br>
over the last century. Certainly the social gains of the last 60<br>
years would all be put at risk.<br>
<br>
I would regard that most seriously. And I think that's<br>
absolutely accurate. If this Congress, in the face of a Democratic<br>
president, is willing to put at risk the education of kids, the<br>
safety and health of workers in the workplace, then surely they are<br>
willing to put at risk such matters as Social Security, Medicare,<br>
Medicaid all the rest of the benefits that people have achieved<br>
over the years.<br>
<br>
Certainly they would be prepared to create new systems for<br>
pensions and destroy the current pension system and pretend that we<br>
can rely upon savings as a substitute.<br>
<br>
I think it is accurate to say that it would put at risk every<br>
social gain that this nation has made over the last 60 years<br>
including the successful efforts we've made in developing a more<br>
color-blind society, and certainly all of our efforts in<br>
affirmative action, and so forth.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Will that sort of thinking persuade the Reagan Democrats<br>
among your members?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I believe so. The truth is, I insist to you, that we have<br>
had fewer defections and a smaller shift of trade union members to<br>
the Reagan philosophy or to a right-wing philosophy than is true of<br>
the society at large.<br>
<br>
So it is less of a problem for us, but it is nonetheless a<br>
problem.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: But your members count the most because they are not<br>
expected to go the other direction.<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: That may be true. It's clearly something we have to work<br>
very hard at. We have to make sure that our people understand the<br>
consequences of the political decisions they make. And we have to<br>
make them understand that it is easy to talk about government in<br>
terms of slogans, but it is quite another thing when you get behind<br>
the slogan and look at the effect it has on that worker and on his<br>
or her family. That's what we have to make them realize. We have to<br>
make them realize that it makes no sense to vote a prejudice<br>
against big government, whatever that is. When in fact the result<br>
of that is that more workers are going to get killed on the job.<br>
That just makes no sense. It makes no sense to vote for politicians<br>
who keep preaching that we need to make the rich richer when you<br>
are one of the poor and you are getting poorer.<br>
<br>
I think that we need to make sure that our people understand<br>
those facts.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Do you think that if all of these horrible things come<br>
to pass with a Republican victory, it will make people want unions<br>
more?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: The answer may be, things get worse before they get<br>
better. I certainly hope that's not true for the benefit of all of<br>
the workers in this country. Things don't have to get so bad before<br>
it turns around.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Have you essentially forgiven Clinton for NAFTA at this<br>
point? Political reality has forced one to accept what is? Is NAFTA<br>
a dead issue?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: What is true about NAFTA is that we were right. And<br>
everybody else was wrong. We take very small comfort in that<br>
knowledge. But we were right. We said that the Mexican economy was<br>
unstable. We said repeatedly during the consideration of NAFTA that<br>
there was to be a devaluation and it was going to happen and when<br>
it happened America would be further disadvantaged. And that's<br>
precisely what happened. We said that we would lose far more jobs<br>
than we would gain. And the administration and the other advocates<br>
of NAFTA kept touting all the statistical studies which told us we<br>
were going to gain hundred of thousands of jobs. And we said they<br>
were wrong. And as it turned out, they were wrong. And we are<br>
looking at major deficits in Mexican trade this year and worse<br>
deficits next year. <br>
<br>
In terms of the Clinton administration, you have to remember<br>
that NAFTA was not a Clinton-negotiated agreement. He attempted to<br>
salvage the protection of worker rights and the environmental<br>
rights. We don't think he did it well enough. And so we campaigned<br>
against NAFTA. <br>
<br>
We would have won, but for the fact that the administration<br>
gave away enough sugar beets and grapefruit protections and other<br>
protections to gain the votes to pass it.<br>
<br>
There is no question that we were speaking for the American<br>
people on that issue and that the majority of Americans agreed with<br>
us. <br>
<br>
I know that the current surveys tell you differently. But<br>
that's because people changed their mind after the event.<br>
<br>
But I don't think that is a factor in our judgments today<br>
about support for Bill Clinton or respect for his administration<br>
and for what he has tried to do for workers.<br>
<br>
QUESTION: Or for Democrats in Congress who voted for NAFTA?<br>
<br>
DONAHUE: I think that continues to be a very difficult vote for<br>
them and people continue to judge those who voted for NAFTA harshly<br>
on that count. There is no question about that.<br>
<br>
That was a serious fight and our membership and our leadership<br>
were properly incensed about people who voted against America's<br>
workers' interests in that fight.<br>
<br>
And those who had what we would term a bad vote on NAFTA will<br>
continue to be troubled by that vote. No question in my mind about<br>
that.<br>
<br>
And I submit to you that in the future that will -- not the<br>
NAFTA vote, but the question of our support for politicians -- will<br>
be, I think, much more related and much more balanced against what<br>
politicians do for workers.<br>
<br>
I don't think there is any more of a change here -- no more<br>
blank checks here, no more free rides for politicians who would<br>
vote against the interests of workers. That's not to say that<br>
somebody who disagrees with us on one issue will be voted out of<br>
office or not have any trade union support. But I think you will<br>
see a much more measured support for politicians which will be much<br>
more closely related to their overall performance.<br>

<p>Remarks of AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Tom Donahue<br>
to the Communications Workers of America Convention<br>
Anaheim, California<br>
July 11, 1995<br>
<br>
<br>
I am delighted to be here. I bring you greetings from the more<br>
than 13 million working men and women who are the AFL-CIO. I come<br>
to pay tribute to your union and its leaders -- Morty, Barbara,<br>
Nick -- and to all of you as its leaders for having created this<br>
fine union.<br>
<br>
Let me begin by also thanking Morty Bahr and each one of you<br>
for being willing to share your Secretary-Treasurer with the entire<br>
American trade union movement.<br>
<br>
I must confess that I feel some guilt standing here before<br>
you, but I want to assure you that I conducted this &quot;raid&quot; only<br>
with the blessing and, indeed, the encouragement of your good<br>
President and my good friend, Morty Bahr.<br>
<br>
Morty and I have been through lots of struggles and lots of<br>
good times through the years, both in New York and in Washington.<br>
There is no one I am prouder to be associated with and to have at<br>
my side.<br>
<br>
Above all, I want to thank Barbara for agreeing to join with<br>
me to lead the AFL-CIO in difficult years. As I said when we<br>
announced our ticket, Barbara will bring to the AFL-CIO not only<br>
her &quot;breadth and depth of experience,&quot; but special &quot;qualities of<br>
mind and heart.&quot; <br>
<br>
I wish you could have been there at the press conference.<br>
Barbara talked about the lessons she had learned growing up as the<br>
daughter of a coal miner. She talked about the lessons she had<br>
learned in her local union, representing the operators and other<br>
employees of Ohio Bell.<br>
<br>
And she talked about the lessons she had learned on the staff<br>
and as an officer of this great union -- as she put it, &quot;the need<br>
to embrace change ... to make it work for working people and not<br>
against us.&quot;<br>
<br>
She captured what our campaign and our vision for the AFL-CIO<br>
are all about. It is a campaign about solidarity, diversity, and<br>
above all, innovation.<br>
<br>
Barbara herself represents one innovation that's long overdue.<br>
I am proud to be on the ticket with the first Secretary-Treasurer<br>
of a national union to run for Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO -<br>
- indeed, the only candidate for leadership in the history of our<br>
movement who happens not to be a white male, and who is running for<br>
a real, existing post as one of the two executive officers of the<br>
AFL-CIO.<br>
<br>
If, as we expect, we are elected by the Executive Council on<br>
August 1, we will begin together to hasten the pace of innovation,<br>
of progress, of growth in this labor movement.<br>
<br>
Barbara and I and the unions that support us are out to change<br>
things for the better -- change to ensure progress.<br>
<br>
Indeed, there is probably no better example of what the AFL-<br>
CIO needs to do than the CWA itself, under the leadership of Morty<br>
Bahr, Barbara Easterling, and M.E. Nichols. Your union is a model<br>
for trade unionism: idealistic, progressive, militant, far-sighted,<br>
and absolutely dedicated to improving the lives of its members.<br>
<br>
It is always ready, willing, and able to play an appropriate<br>
and realistic role in our struggle to make this nation responsive<br>
to the needs of working families.<br>
<br>
When it comes to long-term planning, you wrote the book. More<br>
than a dozen years ago, you pioneered with your Committee on the<br>
Future. <br>
<br>
You've broken new ground by demonstrating how much can be<br>
accomplished through real partnerships between labor and management<br>
-- partnerships based on equality, independence, and mutual<br>
recognition and respect. Your Workplace of the Future agreements<br>
are a model for the rest of the labor movement.<br>
<br>
Your organizing program is second to none in its level of<br>
energy and creativity, organizing both in old and new industries,<br>
from newspapers and cable television to the information<br>
superhighway.<br>
<br>
Even more important, you are organizing in new ways. The<br>
employee associations you have created at NCR, at Sprint, and at a<br>
number of other companies offer a new model for the labor movement.<br>
And the agreement you recently negotiated with AT&amp;T marks a<br>
historic breakthrough in securing for individual workers at what<br>
was NCR the right to be represented by a union. <br>
<br>
While others talk about the need to integrate our unions into<br>
larger industrial groupings, you've actually done it. You have<br>
brought under one roof unions representing working people<br>
throughout the communications industry -- the United Telegraph<br>
Workers, the International Typographic Union, NABET, and very<br>
likely the Newspaper Guild.<br>
<br>
Every single member who has been part of this consolidation is<br>
getting more effective representation in each of those divisions<br>
because of your unity.<br>
While others talk about the need for diversity, you've elected<br>
an Executive Board that is representative of the diversity of your<br>
union.<br>
<br>
You've done all this without compromising your core<br>
responsibilities, and you've done it with an informed and actively<br>
involved membership.<br>
<br>
When businesses all across the country are trying to chisel<br>
away our wages and benefits, you have just succeeded not only in<br>
resisting cutbacks in your health benefits but in negotiating<br>
healthy and well-deserved pay increases at AT&amp;T. <br>
<br>
I congratulate you for that -- but nothing in this movement is<br>
easy or simple, nor are any of our victories ever final.<br>
<br>
When we settle one contract or dozens, we then go on to the<br>
others. And so you now face real struggle in New Jersey, where the<br>
Republican governor finds it very simple to say, &quot;I'm going to<br>
change the health benefit formulas and you have to pay for that<br>
change.&quot; And you will face struggle in dozens of other negotiations<br>
throughout the year.<br>
<br>
In reviewing your accomplishments, it is not my purpose to pit<br>
the CWA against other unions. Nor do I mean to suggest that your<br>
way is &quot;the way&quot; or &quot;the only way.&quot;<br>
<br>
As I'm sure you know, my union is the Service Employees. While<br>
John Sweeney will be running against me in October, I do not doubt<br>
for a minute that, as John's press release says, the SEIU &quot;fairly<br>
sparkles with energy, creativity, and hope.&quot;<br>
<br>
The point is that no individual, no union, and no group of<br>
unions has a monopoly on these efforts. Each union has something to<br>
learn from, and something to teach to, other unions.<br>
<br>
That's why unity and innovation must go hand in hand. And<br>
that's why the Federation needs leaders like Barbara and me who can<br>
draw the labor movement together behind a program of progressive<br>
change.<br>
<br>
Talk is cheap. Rhetoric about innovation is easy. If talk<br>
organized members, we would be four or five times our current size.<br>
<br>
If rhetoric made change happen, we would all be dizzy from new<br>
forms and new successes.<br>
<br>
But talk and rhetoric won't cut it.<br>
<br>
We need to talk specifics. Let me tell you what Barbara and I<br>
believe the challenge for our movement really is, and how we want<br>
to address it.<br>
The challenge is to grow, not for numbers alone but because we<br>
have a moral responsibility to offer the opportunity to have a<br>
union -- the opportunity to enjoy respect -- to every worker in<br>
this nation.<br>
<br>
The challenge is to serve better every current member and<br>
every future member -- to serve them on the job, to serve them in<br>
their communities, and to serve them in the legislative and<br>
political arenas at the federal, state, and local levels.<br>
<br>
The challenge is to make our nation better, to stand up for<br>
America's working families and to insist that our politicians do<br>
the same.<br>
<br>
The challenge is to insist that tax policies and economic<br>
policies should provide a better distribution of the wealth of this<br>
nation, and should create and maintain an economy that serves the<br>
people, not vice versa.<br>
<br>
The challenge is to do a whole lot better job of explaining<br>
this trade union movement and its goals and activities to the<br>
American people, a better job than we have done up to now.<br>
<br>
We all know that this is a virtuous movement, designed to make<br>
America a better place for everyone in it, but we clearly have<br>
failed to get that message across to all Americans.<br>
<br>
It is small wonder that this is true, given the domination of<br>
the media by business interests. But while that is a huge obstacle,<br>
we have to find the ways to overcome that bias.<br>
<br>
All of these challenges and all of the solutions to them --<br>
the ways of meeting them and overcoming them -- are linked.<br>
<br>
We can't grow if we can't explain ourselves better. We can't<br>
serve members better unless we make the nation better. <br>
<br>
We can't change tax and economic policies unless we are<br>
politically stronger. And we can't be politically stronger if we<br>
don't grow. <br>
<br>
And if we don't grow, we can't negotiate better in the face of<br>
non-union competition.<br>
<br>
It is all a seamless garment. We have to take on all the<br>
challenges and make progress on each one of them.<br>
<br>
The first is to grow. You all know the numbers. We represent<br>
16 percent of the work force and we used to represent more than 30<br>
percent.<br>
<br>
We also know that salvation won't come from on high. We can't<br>
wait for a better law before we organize the unorganized.<br>
<br>
Things won't change until we make them change.<br>
<br>
The job of the federation can't be to do the actual<br>
organizing. That's the job of each affiliated union. They know<br>
their industries, their industries' problems, their workers' needs.<br>
But lots of our unions are too small to be able to put resources<br>
into organizing, and they are having a tough time adequately<br>
serving current members.<br>
<br>
There is a lot that the federation can do to encourage, and<br>
energize, and support the organizing efforts of the affiliates.<br>
<br>
First, the Federation can do more to recruit and train a new<br>
generation of organizers through the Organizing Institute.<br>
<br>
The Institute already has a great track record. It has become<br>
one of the largest, most successful programs of the Federation.<br>
<br>
It has already graduated nearly 400 organizers, and this year,<br>
we will graduate about 150 more. Those graduates, more than half of<br>
them women or people of color, are now involved in just about every<br>
large organizing campaign in our movement. <br>
<br>
I think we can expand the Organizing Institute until it can<br>
graduate enough organizers to meet the needs of every union in the<br>
Federation. And I would like to work with every union to increase<br>
their ability to hire and use Institute graduates.<br>
<br>
I believe that next year, we can double the number of<br>
organizers that graduate from the Institute, and we intend to do<br>
that.<br>
<br>
But in the final analysis, the best organizers in the trade<br>
union movement are in this room and in your workplaces.<br>
<br>
Member involvement is our best hope of continuing the<br>
membership growth cycle we are in. As quiet as the news has been<br>
kept, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported growth of trade<br>
unions in each of the last two years, a total of 340,000 members.<br>
<br>
This is a growth rate of only 3 percent, but these are the<br>
first years in a decade that we have grown in absolute numbers.<br>
<br>
Member involvement cannot be just rhetoric. It means an<br>
emphasis on real worker ownership of our unions, locally and<br>
nationally, and the investment of real resources in members as<br>
volunteers and full-time local organizers. <br>
<br>
Second, I believe we should create a multi-million-dollar<br>
organizing trust fund to encourage organizing projects that are<br>
important to the strategy of the entire trade union movement. The<br>
fund would be used to leverage affiliates' spending in industries<br>
that are hard to organize and industries where unions haven't been<br>
much of a presence up to now.<br>
<br>
Third, I believe the AFL-CIO should help start new kinds of<br>
worker organizations, side by side with unions that do traditional<br>
collective bargaining.<br>
<br>
We should experiment more with &quot;less-than-exclusive&quot;<br>
recognition and representation, just as you have done with the<br>
workers at NCR. <br>
We should also explore associations of workers who are linked<br>
together by a certain kind of occupation rather than the same<br>
workplace.<br>
<br>
These days, more and more workers aren't attached to a single<br>
employer. They're attached to a specific kind of work or an<br>
industry. <br>
<br>
These are the part-time and temporary workers, or &quot;contingent<br>
workers.&quot; They need unions just as much as the rest of us need<br>
unions, maybe even more. But if they're going to be at a single<br>
workplace for just a few weeks or months, it makes sense to<br>
organize them according to the type of work they do rather than the<br>
workplace.<br>
<br>
It makes sense to bond them together by their work, to make<br>
that bond effective in the workplace, and then to help them move to<br>
career opportunities and security.<br>
<br>
What is true of contingent workers is also true of many<br>
professional and technical workers -- and ten years down the line,<br>
they'll make up 40 percent of all non-managerial employees.<br>
<br>
Fourth, the AFL-CIO should set up an American Association of<br>
Working Persons to serve the active workforce, in ways similar to<br>
those in which the AARP and the National Council of Senior Citizens<br>
serve older Americans. <br>
<br>
Fifth, I believe that we should set up a Labor Leadership<br>
Institute for Workplace Change to help trade union leaders develop<br>
new sets of skills and new kinds of representation for workplaces<br>
that are far different from those we're used to and are getting<br>
more different every day.<br>
<br>
There are millions of unorganized workers in those new<br>
workplaces, especially white-collar and pink-collar workers, who<br>
want an independent voice on the job. But at the same time, they<br>
read the papers. They know how determined bosses are to make life<br>
hard for those who seek a union. And lots of them are either not<br>
ready, or not able, or not willing to take on what appears to them<br>
to be a war with their employers.<br>
<br>
We need to learn more about how to serve their needs, how to<br>
represent them in the way they want to be represented.<br>
I have spent a lot of time on organizing because we simply<br>
have to grow. Let me now turn to our challenges in government and<br>
politics.<br>
<br>
You know and I know that the corporations and the wealthy now<br>
control Congress and many state governments. Their prime targets<br>
are programs that help America's working families -- from OSHA, to<br>
the 40-hour week, to an attempt to legislative away the very<br>
existence of independent trade unions.<br>
<br>
To defend ourselves and then to get back on the offensive, we<br>
have to go back to basics.<br>
<br>
First, we need to harness the energy of our trade unionist<br>
activists. I want to build a network of activists from our unions<br>
across our movement, all of them linked together electronically,<br>
updated on important issues, and able to move into action on a<br>
moment's notice.<br>
<br>
Second and even more important, we need to reach out to each<br>
and every rank-and-file member. We have to educate and activate all<br>
of our members.<br>
<br>
There are simply too many trade unionists, especially among<br>
our newer and younger members, who have little contact with their<br>
unions and little understanding of what unionism is all about.<br>
<br>
They see the union as a slot machine. We haven't educated them<br>
about the real linkage between their activism and their political<br>
and economic well-being.<br>
<br>
The campaign we are now waging to Stand Up for America's<br>
Working Families illustrates what the AFL-CIO can do. In that<br>
campaign, we have brought together our legislative, political and<br>
communications operations to develop a coordinated set of messages<br>
to our members. These messages explain exactly what the stakes are<br>
for them in the Republican agenda -- what a weak OSHA law means on<br>
their job, what &quot;less government&quot; or &quot;getting government off our<br>
back&quot; means to their families' well-being.<br>
<br>
We have produced a set of campaign materials -- videos,<br>
pamphlets, pins, bumper stickers -- that are being disseminated<br>
widely throughout the movement. <br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO has assigned half of its field staff to the<br>
campaign. During each congressional recess, our staff and that of<br>
affiliated unions is working in carefully selected congressional<br>
districts to coordinate Stand Up activities, from leafletting at<br>
plant gates to confronting congressmen at their country clubs.<br>
<br>
And we have bought nearly a million dollars of local radio,<br>
television, and newspaper advertising, the largest media buy since<br>
the NAFTA campaign.<br>
<br>
All of that is designed to make clear to these politicians<br>
that we are going to be much tougher in measuring their<br>
performance.<br>
<br>
We will match our efforts for or against them to their efforts<br>
for or against us. No more free rides!<br>
<br>
All politics is not, as some say, a choice between the lesser<br>
of two evils. Our politics can be one of real, dedicated,<br>
determined support for good politicians who represent the best<br>
interests of working people. <br>
<br>
We are going to develop the sophisticated ways of opposing<br>
those who don't. As for those who find it possible to support<br>
worker interests only some of the time, we can find it possible to<br>
be lukewarm to ice cold in our support for them.<br>
<br>
We also need to make our public communications work better, to<br>
explain ourselves, our ideas, and our programs better.<br>
<br>
To do that, we need better coordination with affiliated<br>
unions. We have to work together to attract attention to those<br>
messages and events that are most important for the public to<br>
understand.<br>
<br>
We have to recognize that most of the communications in the<br>
nation today take place not through national media but at the local<br>
level, through local papers, radio and TV.<br>
<br>
We also need to figure out how, in a coordinated fashion, to<br>
make best use of the newer forms of communication -- from talk<br>
radio and cable television to the Internet and the information<br>
superhighway -- as well as how best to use paid advertising and how<br>
to earn free media attention.<br>
<br>
We need to get our message out, to get it heard and<br>
understood. Only then can we change America. <br>
<br>
Let me close with a few thoughts.<br>
<br>
The challenges we face are enormous, but we are still the<br>
largest, strongest, most vibrant labor movement in the world. <br>
<br>
And there are plenty of good, sound ideas for renewing and<br>
strengthening our movement -- ideas at AFL-CIO headquarters, at <br>
every national and international union, at every local. We just<br>
need to get them out, get them heard, and get the best of them in<br>
place.<br>
<br>
We need to look at changing some of the structure and<br>
techniques of the AFL-CIO. But it is not change in the inner<br>
workings of the AFL-CIO that will turn things around for the<br>
working men and women of this country or for the unions that<br>
represent them. It is the renewed dedication and energy of the men<br>
and women of this movement that will make the difference. <br>
<br>
We are a movement of 13 million people and their families. We<br>
are a movement of 80 national unions, 50 state federations, over<br>
500 city central bodies, 50,000 local unions, and over a quarter-<br>
million local officers.<br>
<br>
We are amazingly diverse in every sense. We have to be<br>
respectful of that diversity, and we have to find the common ground<br>
that unites us all.<br>
<br>
No small group of unions or union presidents can separate<br>
themselves out, declare their program to be the only way forward,<br>
and seek by sheer numbers to force those decisions on everyone<br>
else.<br>
<br>
This federation will survive and prosper only if everyone in<br>
it is given an opportunity to work with everyone else to form a<br>
dynamic consensus on our future program.<br>
<br>
I promise you that Barbara Easterling and I will work as hard<br>
as we know how from August 1 on to forge that dynamic consensus, to<br>
equip this movement to best serve the interests of all our members<br>
and of the nation.<br>
<br>
The working men and women who depend on this movement and the<br>
millions more who seek a genuine voice on the job require that we<br>
make common cause. I'm confident we can.<br>
<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p>                        Remarks of AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Tom Donahue<br>
                   &quot;The Black-Labor Alliance: Strengthening the Partnership for<br>
                                         Economic Justice&quot;<br>
                         A. Philip Randolph Institute Conference, Chicago<br>
                                           June 30, 1995<br>
<br>
       I am delighted to be here with you once again.  I bring you<br>
greetings from your 13 million brothers and sisters in the trade<br>
union movement.  And I salute you for the contributions that the A.<br>
Philip Randolph Institute makes day in and day out to the cause of<br>
working Americans.<br>
<br>
       The topic you asked me to address -- &quot;The Black Labor<br>
Alliance:  Strengthening the Partnership for Economic Justice&quot; --<br>
couldn't be more important or more timely.  We meet at a time in<br>
which the forces of reaction, privilege and greed have temporarily<br>
succeeded in gaining control of the Congress and of many of our<br>
state governments.  They threaten to undo much of what we have<br>
accomplished together over the past thirty years or more.  Our<br>
alliance is therefore needed today perhaps more than ever before.<br>
<br>
       We also meet at a momentous time in the history of the labor<br>
movement.  The impending change of leadership of the AFL-CIO<br>
creates an occasion to reassess where we are as a labor movement<br>
and where we are heading.  That is an exceedingly healthy process,<br>
and one which I welcome.  <br>
<br>
       There is now a generally shared recognition of the need to<br>
revitalize and reinvigorate our movement.   The times demand a<br>
stronger, more self-sufficient labor movement.  Such a movement<br>
requires strong national and international unions with a strong<br>
Federation at its core.  That makes it incumbent upon the next<br>
president of the AFL-CIO to put forth a bold program of innovation<br>
that will capture the imagination of the labor movement and to<br>
build the breadth of support needed to propel us forward.<br>
<br>
       Certainly one of the first priorities of the next President of<br>
the AFL-CIO must be to strengthen our alliances and to rebuild our<br>
capacity for effective legislative and political action.  The<br>
black-labor partnership is, of course, integral to that process. <br>
<br>
       Our alliance rests on two strong legs.  First, our common<br>
interests.  And second, our common values.  <br>
<br>
       Our community of interests was eloquently articulated by Dr.<br>
Martin Luther King more than 30 years ago in addressing the 1961<br>
AFL-CIO Convention.  Some of you were no doubt there, and heard Dr.<br>
King's speech.  Others of you have heard me quote the speech on<br>
other occasions.  But Dr. King's words bear quoting again.  <br>
<br>
       &quot;Negroes,&quot; Dr. King said in the language of that day, &quot;are<br>
almost entirely a working people.  There are pitifully few Negro<br>
millionaires and few Negro employers.  Our needs are identical with<br>
labor's needs -- decent wages, fair working conditions, livable<br>
housing, old age security, health and welfare measures, conditions<br>
in which families can grow, have education for their children, and<br>
respect in the community.&quot;<br>
<br>
       Those remain the needs of African-Americans -- and of all<br>
working families -- today.  And out of those needs arise our common<br>
values and our common mission:  to create a society in which all of<br>
us -- black and white, male and female, Christian, Muslim and Jew<br>
-- are able to satisfy our basic human needs.  A society which<br>
affords working people the dignity and honor they deserve and which<br>
lives by the democratic principles it professes.<br>
<br>
       Indeed, one of the great lessons that Phil Randolph taught us<br>
-- and that Norm Hill continues to reinforce -- is that there are<br>
really no distinctions between black issues, women's issues, or<br>
labor issues.  They are all part of the seamless fabric of human<br>
issues -- of the quest for human justice.<br>
<br>
       Today, the values which we share -- and the interests we seek<br>
to advance -- are under siege.  The right-wingers have targeted<br>
America's working families as well as children, the aged, and the<br>
infirm.  They're out to destroy the government programs that assist<br>
them and the laws that protect them, including many of the<br>
employment laws we have fought so hard to secure -- from the<br>
Occupational Safety and Health Act to the 40 hour week.<br>
<br>
       Our unions are the last bastion of defense.  And the African<br>
American-labor alliance is critical to that defense and to our<br>
shift to offensive strategy in our political work.<br>
<br>
       What, then, can we do to strengthen our alliance and to<br>
redouble our efforts to advance economic justice?  And more<br>
particularly what can the AFL-CIO do to aid in that process?<br>
<br>
       Your focus is, appropriately enough, on the here and now -- on<br>
the legislative and political battles we face and will be facing in<br>
1996 -- but let me begin by suggesting that in the long term the<br>
most important single step we can take to advance our cause would<br>
be to bring thousands upon thousands, tens of thousands upon tens<br>
of thousands more working men and women -- men and women of every<br>
race, creed, color and religion -- into our movement.                                      When I<br>
joined the trade union movement, roughly four in ten workers in<br>
this country belonged to a union.  Today, in the private sector,<br>
the number is closer to one in ten.  Indeed, when I first had the<br>
honor of addressing this body thirteen years ago I was able to<br>
bring you greetings from 15 million brother and sister trade<br>
unionists.  Today, you may note, I brought greetings from 13<br>
million.<br>
<br>
       More troubling still, if present trends were to continue,<br>
within ten years only one in twenty private sector workers would be<br>
part of our movement.<br>
<br>
       The good news is that &quot;present trends&quot; won't continue -- they<br>
never do (which is why economists spend so much time alone).  But<br>
more importantly, we cannot and we will not allow those trends to<br>
continue.<br>
<br>
       Some have suggested that labor unions are &quot;no longer relevant&quot;<br>
to today's workers.  I couldn't disagree more.  Even if union<br>
membership were ever to reach the end of the road, trade unionism<br>
still would be the most vital, most meaningful force in the work<br>
life of its last 100 members, assuring the recognition of their<br>
dignity and the decency of their working conditions.  <br>
<br>
       But such a labor movement would no longer be a major force in<br>
our society.  It would no longer help set labor standards.  It<br>
would no longer be able to represent working families in the body<br>
politic.  <br>
<br>
       We cannot allow that to happen.<br>
<br>
       We all know the extraordinary obstacles that unorganized<br>
workers face in trying to create independent representation in<br>
their workplace.  But we also all know that salvation will not come<br>
from on high.  Things won't change until we make them change.  We<br>
can't wait for a better law before we go about the task of<br>
organizing the unorganized.  <br>
<br>
       We have all heard -- and given -- stirring speeches about the<br>
importance of organizing.  But the truth is that no one and no<br>
institution -- and I include the AFL-CIO in this -- is doing<br>
enough.  All of us can, should and must do more -- and I mean do<br>
more, not just talk more.  <br>
<br>
       If words could organize workers, we'd be four or five times<br>
our present size.  If the rhetoric about change could change us,<br>
we'd be reeling under its effects.  It is easy to talk about these<br>
things -- a lot harder to make them happen.  But rhetoric won't do<br>
it -- only hard work will.  Let me tell.  I know.  I've been there,<br>
I've done it, as everyone in this room knows.<br>
<br>
       For the Federation's part, while we cannot do the critical<br>
front line work of organizing unorganized workers, the Federation<br>
must energize the organizing process and assist the work of our<br>
affiliates.           <br>
<br>
       One way to do that is to continue to develop the AFL-CIO<br>
Organizing Institute which opened its doors in 1990 as a two-person<br>
operation and which I am proud to say we have grown into one of the<br>
largest programs of the Federation.  Since 1990, the Institute has<br>
graduated nearly 400 organizers.  This year alone we will graduate<br>
another 150 or more organizers.  More than half of these graduates<br>
are women or persons of color.  These organizers are now involved<br>
in just about every large organizing campaign within our movement.<br>
<br>
       In my view, we need to expand the Organizing Institute until<br>
it can graduate enough organizers each year to meets the needs of<br>
every union in the Federation, and we need to push very union to<br>
need them..  Whatever the cost, that is something we must find the<br>
way to do.<br>
<br>
       I also believe the Federation should create a multi-million<br>
dollar organizing trust fund to be used to stimulate and support<br>
organizing projects which are of strategic importance to the<br>
movement as a whole and to which interested unions make substantial<br>
commitments of their own.  By leveraging our resources, the AFL-CIO<br>
can serve as the catalyst for a renewed focus on organizing.  <br>
<br>
       The first group that I would propose we reach out to with this<br>
kind of organizing effort are the low-wage workers in this nation<br>
-- a disproportionate number of whom are immigrants, African<br>
Americans and other persons of color.  The sorry truth is, for<br>
example, that more than one-third of all African American workers<br>
in this country earns less than $7.00 an hour.  All these low-wage<br>
workers belong in our movement.  And, tragically their ranks are<br>
expanding rapidly; the number and proportion of full-time worker<br>
whose earnings are below the poverty level doubled in the past<br>
fifteen years.<br>
<br>
       If we're going to organize these workers we must make sure<br>
that the representatives of our unions reflect the diversity of<br>
today's workplace.  That commitment must begin with our organizers<br>
but cannot end there.  Rather it must extend to all levels of the<br>
trade union movement.  <br>
<br>
       We at the AFL-CIO have been working at this at the staff level<br>
and I am proud to say that in the past ten years almost half of the<br>
newly-appointed department heads have been women or minorities. <br>
Our staff clearly reflects the inclusion of women and people of<br>
color and I'm proud so many of them are here.  And we've seen the<br>
beginning of change -- but only its beginning -- in our state<br>
federations and city central bodies.   <br>
<br>
       Because I believe the time has come to make the same<br>
commitment with respect to the top leadership of the AFL-CIO -- and<br>
to give reality to what up to now has been promises -- I have asked<br>
Barbara Easterling, the Secretary-Treasurer of the Communication<br>
Workers, to be my running mate as the candidate for Secretary-<br>
Treasurer of the AFL-CIO.  <br>
       Barbara is one of the highest ranking women -- as well as one<br>
of the most able leaders -- in our movement.  She's going to make<br>
an outstanding Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO and hold one of<br>
the two, mainstream leadership posts in the Federation.   (Only my<br>
high regard for the incumbent keeps me from saying she will be the<br>
best in recent memory.)  <br>
<br>
       I also announced last week that if, as I expect, the Executive<br>
Council elects me in August to fill the remainder of President<br>
Kirkland's term, I intend as one of my first act to appoint a<br>
special committee to reexamine the Federation's entire structure<br>
and its decision-making processes.  We need to make sure that they<br>
are as open and inclusive as possible and are capable of decisive<br>
action.  <br>
<br>
       It would be a mistake, in my view, to rush to make structural<br>
change in a time of partisan politics and without achieving the<br>
breadth of support on which Federation action must always rest. <br>
But I am confident that with strong leadership we can reach<br>
agreement over restructuring the Federation to make it more<br>
inclusive and more effective.                        <br>
<br>
       Barbara Easterling's election as Secretary-Treasurer and the<br>
revamping of our governing structure will, I believe, help to<br>
shatter any remnants of a glass ceiling in our movement holding<br>
back women, African Americans and other persons of color.  We need<br>
the fullest participation of all of our members if we are to<br>
realize our full potential -- and to live up to our own ideals. <br>
Indeed, we created a special Committee on Full Participation last<br>
year which John Sturdivant is chairing; that Committee already has<br>
presented a partial report to the Council and will present a full<br>
report to the Convention.<br>
<br>
       But we cannot wait until we realize the ideal of full<br>
participation -- or until we succeed in reorganizing the workforce<br>
-- to mount our defense of workers' right and to wage our crusade<br>
for economic justice in this country.<br>
<br>
       You have been focusing at this conference on the many critical<br>
issues facing us, so I won't go back over that ground.  You know<br>
what the Republican agenda means for working families, and<br>
especially for African Americans.  Less money for the education of<br>
our kids.  Fewer opportunities for college education.  Drastic<br>
reductions in health care coverage for the elderly and the poor.<br>
Longer hours, lower pay, and unsafe and unhealthy workplaces.  And<br>
the destruction of a real voice on the job.<br>
<br>
       To mount our defense -- and get back on the offensive -- we<br>
need to develop a grassroots mobilization effort that will put the<br>
Christian Coalition, and the National Federation of Independent<br>
Businesses, to shame.  The right wingers and the corporate<br>
interests learned political organizing from us and they've poured<br>
their millions into refining these techniques in the service of the<br>
privileged few.  <br>
<br>
       We're never going to be able to match the other side dollar<br>
for dollar, although I believe we have to narrow this gap<br>
substantially.  But I'll put the vitality of our trade union<br>
activists -- the men and women in this room -- up against them any<br>
day of the week, so long as we give our activists the tools. <br>
<br>
       We have finally reached the point where virtually all unions<br>
supply our COPE program with their membership lists so we can mount<br>
coordinated political efforts -- although there are still a few of<br>
our largest affiliates who remain outside this process and at the<br>
same time are somewhat critical of our political efforts.  We have<br>
to continue to try to persuade them of the need for unity in these<br>
efforts and of the program-weakening effects of their abstention. <br>
<br>
       But with or without them, the AFL-CIO now needs to take the<br>
next step of building a movement-wide network of activists linked<br>
together electronically and capable of being activated on short<br>
notice, through the Federation, our affiliates, and our support<br>
groups.  That, too, is something that must be done whatever the<br>
cost.<br>
<br>
       As important as our activists are, however, our ultimate task<br>
is to reach out to each and every rank-and-file member.  The truth<br>
is we spend much of our time &quot;preaching to the choir.&quot;  In the<br>
meantime, too many trade unionists, especially among our newer and<br>
younger members, are members in name only.  They joined ongoing<br>
unions as a condition of their employment and they have little<br>
contact with and sometimes even less understanding of trade<br>
unionism.  <br>
<br>
       If we are to build an effective grassroots legislative and<br>
political operation, we need to attend to the task of unionizing<br>
the already organized.  This is another area in which I think no<br>
one -- again, including the AFL-CIO -- has done enough.<br>
<br>
       Like all other organizing, the ultimate responsibility  must<br>
rest with the individual unions.  But here, too, the AFL-CIO can,<br>
and should play a strong leadership role.<br>
<br>
       That's what our campaign to Stand UP for America's Working<br>
Families -- which I am so pleased to note has been the focus of<br>
this conference -- is all about.  In this campaign we have brought<br>
together our legislative, political, and communications operatives<br>
to develop a coordinate set of messages to explain to our members<br>
exactly what the stakes are for them in the Republican agenda.  <br>
<br>
       But the messages of the campaign are just that -- messages. <br>
They are of no value unless they are heard, and understood, by our<br>
members.  And that is where you, and every other trade union<br>
activist in our movement, comes in.  <br>
<br>
       We cannot, we dare not, rest until each and every union member<br>
-- and each and every member of the public -- understands the<br>
threat facing working people and knows who it is that is &quot;leading<br>
the fight for America's working families.&quot;  <br>
<br>
       For our part, the AFL-CIO has assigned half of its field staff<br>
to this campaign.  Next week, for example, while Congress is in<br>
recess and the Representatives are in their districts, we will have<br>
AFL-CIO and affiliate staff in 30, carefully-selected congressional<br>
districts to coordinate Stand UP activities from leafletting at<br>
plant gates to confronting Congressmen at posh estates.  We will be<br>
supplementing our staff efforts with a half-million dollar radio<br>
and television buy, as part of our largest media buy since the<br>
NAFTA campaign which I was proud to lead and which you supported so<br>
enthusiastically.<br>
<br>
       We intend to continue this Stand UP campaign throughout the<br>
year, and into 1996.   And we need the active participation of each<br>
and everyone one of you.  We need you to be part of the legislative<br>
action committees which now exist in more than one-quarter of all<br>
congressional districts to serve as the focal points for an ongoing<br>
program of grassroots education.  Even more than that, we need you<br>
to make sure that week in and week out, our members are aware of<br>
what is going on in Washington, and in your state capitols that<br>
affects working people.  We need to make sure that their voices are<br>
heard by their elected representatives.  And we need to assure that<br>
elected officials who vote against the interests of working people<br>
are held accountable by our members for their votes.<br>
<br>
       As we embark on this campaign to turn the tide in this<br>
country, we need to be mindful of what the forces of reaction will<br>
do in an effort to divide us.  The oldest game known to politicians<br>
-- and to defenders of wealth and privilege -- is to divide working<br>
people along racial lines, persuading whites or blacks that the<br>
other is somehow an opponent.  <br>
<br>
       We already have witnessed the first wave of this divisiveness<br>
in the attacks on the Davis-Bacon Act.  Non-union construction<br>
companies want that law repealed for a very simple reason:  they<br>
don't want to have to pay prevailing wages to their construction<br>
workers.  Repealing Davis-Bacon would reduce the wages of all<br>
construction workers -- black, brown, yellow and white -- by almost<br>
$1,500 a year.  That's the real reason why the Davis-Bacon Act --<br>
and its sister, the Service Contract Act -- are under attack. <br>
<br>
       But the opponents of prevailing wage laws have cleverly sought<br>
to disguise their true interests by claiming that Davis-Bacon is an<br>
impediment to African-Americans getting training to become skilled<br>
craftsmen.  That is, of course, patent nonsense.  Worse than that,<br>
it is a pernicious argument -- it assumes that blacks are somehow<br>
not &quot;worth&quot; the prevailing wage and will only be hired if they can<br>
be paid sub-standard wages.  <br>
<br>
       The truth is, of course, precisely the opposite.  The truth is<br>
that African Americans are more likely to have jobs and get<br>
training on Davis Bacon projects, and that in those states which<br>
repealed their &quot;little Davis-Bacon laws&quot; the minority enrollment in<br>
apprenticeship training dropped from 20% to 12.5%.  Moreover, the<br>
truth is, as Norm Hill has stated, that because persons of color<br>
are most vulnerable and most exploited, &quot;Black, Hispanic, Native<br>
American and other minority workers, as well as women and young<br>
workers, especially need this law.&quot;                         But the attempt to use the<br>
Davis-Bacon Act to drive a wedge between us is only the dress<br>
rehearsal for what we know is the coming featured attraction:  the<br>
assault on affirmative action.  That assault began with the right-<br>
wing in California which, as Newsweek recently put it, has &quot;a knack<br>
for recognizing and speaking to the resentments of white<br>
suburbanites.&quot;<br>
<br>
       From anti-communism to anti-taxes to anti-busing to anti-<br>
welfare to anti-immigrant and now anti-affirmative action -- it<br>
doesn't matter how much or little merit those resentments may have. <br>
The California right knows how to play them like a violin -- how to<br>
advance the wedge issues that set worker against worker.  And<br>
they're giving lessons to the rest of the nation's right wingers.<br>
<br>
       If we are going to respond effectively to this threat, we need<br>
to understand what fuels it.  <br>
<br>
       Working families in this country are understandably nervous --<br>
and they are angry.  Who isn't?  They are working harder and<br>
harder, for less, struggling to keep from falling behind.<br>
<br>
       Just last week the Labor Department reported that in the<br>
preceding twelve months -- in the midst of a widespread economic<br>
expansion -- average wages plunged by 2.3% and total compensation<br>
by 3%.  That is the largest one-year decline since the 1840's. <br>
<br>
       It is all too easy in times like these for demagogues on the<br>
right to persuade white families that the reason they are<br>
struggling is because affirmative action is giving black families<br>
an unfair share of the pie.  <br>
<br>
       We have got to make the case against this nonsense.  White<br>
families are struggling for the same reason that black families and<br>
Hispanic families and Asian families are struggling:  because this<br>
nation tolerates the most unfair, unequal distribution of income of<br>
any industrialized nation.  <br>
<br>
       The Washington Post news article reporting on last week's<br>
Labor Department data tells the real story.  It is headed &quot;Profits,<br>
Markets at a High But Workers Earning Less.&quot; Let me read part of<br>
that article:  &quot;The stock market is at an all-time high, driven by<br>
corporate profits that are up 14% over the last year.  Worker<br>
productivity seems to have reached a new, higher plateau. <br>
Businesses are so flush with cash that they are buying back their<br>
own stock ... But recent data show that surprising little of this<br>
bonanza has been passed on to workers.&quot;<br>
<br>
       Commenting on the data Secretary of Labor Reich said, &quot;The<br>
owners of capital are registering huge gains while ordinary working<br>
Americans are seeing their incomes fall.&quot;  This suggests &quot;a major<br>
shift from earned to unearned income, from paychecks to dividends<br>
and capital gains.  Things are simply way out of whack.&quot;    <br>
<br>
       The villain is not affirmative action.  It is a set of<br>
governmental policies that allow low-wage workers to be exploited,<br>
that allows our best jobs to be shipped overseas, and that denies<br>
working men and women the right to organize a union and negotiate<br>
for decent wages and working conditions.  <br>
<br>
       On affirmative action, the AFL-CIO's position is as clear as<br>
it can be.  As I said to the AFL-CIO Civil Rights Institute in<br>
April, &quot;We support true affirmative action, not the distorted image<br>
conjured up by right-wing propagandists, with their claims of<br>
quotas and of the hiring of incompetents and the disruption of<br>
seniority systems.&quot;<br>
<br>
       &quot;We endorse the real thing -- a set of effective tools to help<br>
remedy the colossal injustice of discrimination, to give people an<br>
equal chance at good jobs and good education, to make sure that<br>
people have a ladder up, to open opportunity for people to use<br>
their talents and abilities.&quot;<br>
<br>
       Our movement defines itself by certain ideals:  democracy,<br>
equality, fair treatment, and a commitment to economic and social<br>
justice.  We believe that when there is injustice, when those<br>
ideals have been violated then there must be redress.  That is what<br>
we are all about.  That is what we stand for. <br>
<br>
       And so, we can't allow the demagogues on the right to set<br>
white against black, native-born against immigrant.  We must stand<br>
and fight together.  For as Phil Randolph taught us, &quot;there are no<br>
reserved seats at the banquet table of nature.  You get what you<br>
can take and you keep what you can hold.&quot;<br>
<br>
       Working together -- standing UP together for America's working<br>
families -- we'll be seated at the table.  We'll get as much to eat<br>
as everyone else gets.  And we'll make sure that no one goes<br>
hungry.  <br>
<br>
       Working together, we can build the largest, most dynamic trade<br>
union movement this nation has ever had and we can make the nation<br>
respond.  We can make the politicians create an economy with the<br>
people at its center -- an economy at the service of the people,<br>
not vice versa.  And we can make life a whole lot better for the<br>
people we are privileged to serve.<br>
<br>
       Thank you.</p>

<p>Remarks of AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Tom Donahue<br>
&quot;The Black-Labor Alliance: Strengthening the Partnership for<br>
Economic Justice&quot;<br>
A. Philip Randolph Institute Conference, Chicago<br>
June 30, 1995<br>
<br>
I am delighted to be here with you once again. I bring you<br>
greetings from your 13 million brothers and sisters in the trade<br>
union movement. And I salute you for the contributions that the A.<br>
Philip Randolph Institute makes day in and day out to the cause of<br>
working Americans.<br>
<br>
The topic you asked me to address -- &quot;The Black Labor<br>
Alliance: Strengthening the Partnership for Economic Justice&quot; --<br>
couldn't be more important or more timely. We meet at a time in<br>
which the forces of reaction, privilege and greed have temporarily<br>
succeeded in gaining control of the Congress and of many of our<br>
state governments. They threaten to undo much of what we have<br>
accomplished together over the past thirty years or more. Our<br>
alliance is therefore needed today perhaps more than ever before.<br>
<br>
We also meet at a momentous time in the history of the labor<br>
movement. The impending change of leadership of the AFL-CIO<br>
creates an occasion to reassess where we are as a labor movement<br>
and where we are heading. That is an exceedingly healthy process,<br>
and one which I welcome. <br>
<br>
There is now a generally shared recognition of the need to<br>
revitalize and reinvigorate our movement. The times demand a<br>
stronger, more self-sufficient labor movement. Such a movement<br>
requires strong national and international unions with a strong<br>
Federation at its core. That makes it incumbent upon the next<br>
president of the AFL-CIO to put forth a bold program of innovation<br>
that will capture the imagination of the labor movement and to<br>
build the breadth of support needed to propel us forward.<br>
<br>
Certainly one of the first priorities of the next President of<br>
the AFL-CIO must be to strengthen our alliances and to rebuild our<br>
capacity for effective legislative and political action. The<br>
black-labor partnership is, of course, integral to that process. <br>
<br>
Our alliance rests on two strong legs. First, our common<br>
interests. And second, our common values. <br>
<br>
Our community of interests was eloquently articulated by Dr.<br>
Martin Luther King more than 30 years ago in addressing the 1961<br>
AFL-CIO Convention. Some of you were no doubt there, and heard Dr.<br>
King's speech. Others of you have heard me quote the speech on<br>
other occasions. But Dr. King's words bear quoting again. <br>
<br>
&quot;Negroes,&quot; Dr. King said in the language of that day, &quot;are<br>
almost entirely a working people. There are pitifully few Negro<br>
millionaires and few Negro employers. Our needs are identical with<br>
labor's needs -- decent wages, fair working conditions, livable<br>
housing, old age security, health and welfare measures, conditions<br>
in which families can grow, have education for their children, and<br>
respect in the community.&quot;<br>
<br>
Those remain the needs of African-Americans -- and of all<br>
working families -- today. And out of those needs arise our common<br>
values and our common mission: to create a society in which all of<br>
us -- black and white, male and female, Christian, Muslim and Jew<br>
-- are able to satisfy our basic human needs. A society which<br>
affords working people the dignity and honor they deserve and which<br>
lives by the democratic principles it professes.<br>
<br>
Indeed, one of the great lessons that Phil Randolph taught us<br>
-- and that Norm Hill continues to reinforce -- is that there are<br>
really no distinctions between black issues, women's issues, or<br>
labor issues. They are all part of the seamless fabric of human<br>
issues -- of the quest for human justice.<br>
<br>
Today, the values which we share -- and the interests we seek<br>
to advance -- are under siege. The right-wingers have targeted<br>
America's working families as well as children, the aged, and the<br>
infirm. They're out to destroy the government programs that assist<br>
them and the laws that protect them, including many of the<br>
employment laws we have fought so hard to secure -- from the<br>
Occupational Safety and Health Act to the 40 hour week.<br>
<br>
Our unions are the last bastion of defense. And the African<br>
American-labor alliance is critical to that defense and to our<br>
shift to offensive strategy in our political work.<br>
<br>
What, then, can we do to strengthen our alliance and to<br>
redouble our efforts to advance economic justice? And more<br>
particularly what can the AFL-CIO do to aid in that process?<br>
<br>
Your focus is, appropriately enough, on the here and now -- on<br>
the legislative and political battles we face and will be facing in<br>
1996 -- but let me begin by suggesting that in the long term the<br>
most important single step we can take to advance our cause would<br>
be to bring thousands upon thousands, tens of thousands upon tens<br>
of thousands more working men and women -- men and women of every<br>
race, creed, color and religion -- into our movement. When I<br>
joined the trade union movement, roughly four in ten workers in<br>
this country belonged to a union. Today, in the private sector,<br>
the number is closer to one in ten. Indeed, when I first had the<br>
honor of addressing this body thirteen years ago I was able to<br>
bring you greetings from 15 million brother and sister trade<br>
unionists. Today, you may note, I brought greetings from 13<br>
million.<br>
<br>
More troubling still, if present trends were to continue,<br>
within ten years only one in twenty private sector workers would be<br>
part of our movement.<br>
<br>
The good news is that &quot;present trends&quot; won't continue -- they<br>
never do (which is why economists spend so much time alone). But<br>
more importantly, we cannot and we will not allow those trends to<br>
continue.<br>
<br>
Some have suggested that labor unions are &quot;no longer relevant&quot;<br>
to today's workers. I couldn't disagree more. Even if union<br>
membership were ever to reach the end of the road, trade unionism<br>
still would be the most vital, most meaningful force in the work<br>
life of its last 100 members, assuring the recognition of their<br>
dignity and the decency of their working conditions. <br>
<br>
But such a labor movement would no longer be a major force in<br>
our society. It would no longer help set labor standards. It<br>
would no longer be able to represent working families in the body<br>
politic. <br>
<br>
We cannot allow that to happen.<br>
<br>
We all know the extraordinary obstacles that unorganized<br>
workers face in trying to create independent representation in<br>
their workplace. But we also all know that salvation will not come<br>
from on high. Things won't change until we make them change. We<br>
can't wait for a better law before we go about the task of<br>
organizing the unorganized. <br>
<br>
We have all heard -- and given -- stirring speeches about the<br>
importance of organizing. But the truth is that no one and no<br>
institution -- and I include the AFL-CIO in this -- is doing<br>
enough. All of us can, should and must do more -- and I mean do<br>
more, not just talk more. <br>
<br>
If words could organize workers, we'd be four or five times<br>
our present size. If the rhetoric about change could change us,<br>
we'd be reeling under its effects. It is easy to talk about these<br>
things -- a lot harder to make them happen. But rhetoric won't do<br>
it -- only hard work will. Let me tell. I know. I've been there,<br>
I've done it, as everyone in this room knows.<br>
<br>
For the Federation's part, while we cannot do the critical<br>
front line work of organizing unorganized workers, the Federation<br>
must energize the organizing process and assist the work of our<br>
affiliates. <br>
<br>
One way to do that is to continue to develop the AFL-CIO<br>
Organizing Institute which opened its doors in 1990 as a two-person<br>
operation and which I am proud to say we have grown into one of the<br>
largest programs of the Federation. Since 1990, the Institute has<br>
graduated nearly 400 organizers. This year alone we will graduate<br>
another 150 or more organizers. More than half of these graduates<br>
are women or persons of color. These organizers are now involved<br>
in just about every large organizing campaign within our movement.<br>
<br>
In my view, we need to expand the Organizing Institute until<br>
it can graduate enough organizers each year to meets the needs of<br>
every union in the Federation, and we need to push very union to<br>
need them.. Whatever the cost, that is something we must find the<br>
way to do.<br>
<br>
I also believe the Federation should create a multi-million<br>
dollar organizing trust fund to be used to stimulate and support<br>
organizing projects which are of strategic importance to the<br>
movement as a whole and to which interested unions make substantial<br>
commitments of their own. By leveraging our resources, the AFL-CIO<br>
can serve as the catalyst for a renewed focus on organizing. <br>
<br>
The first group that I would propose we reach out to with this<br>
kind of organizing effort are the low-wage workers in this nation<br>
-- a disproportionate number of whom are immigrants, African<br>
Americans and other persons of color. The sorry truth is, for<br>
example, that more than one-third of all African American workers<br>
in this country earns less than $7.00 an hour. All these low-wage<br>
workers belong in our movement. And, tragically their ranks are<br>
expanding rapidly; the number and proportion of full-time worker<br>
whose earnings are below the poverty level doubled in the past<br>
fifteen years.<br>
<br>
If we're going to organize these workers we must make sure<br>
that the representatives of our unions reflect the diversity of<br>
today's workplace. That commitment must begin with our organizers<br>
but cannot end there. Rather it must extend to all levels of the<br>
trade union movement. <br>
<br>
We at the AFL-CIO have been working at this at the staff level<br>
and I am proud to say that in the past ten years almost half of the<br>
newly-appointed department heads have been women or minorities. <br>
Our staff clearly reflects the inclusion of women and people of<br>
color and I'm proud so many of them are here. And we've seen the<br>
beginning of change -- but only its beginning -- in our state<br>
federations and city central bodies. <br>
<br>
Because I believe the time has come to make the same<br>
commitment with respect to the top leadership of the AFL-CIO -- and<br>
to give reality to what up to now has been promises -- I have asked<br>
Barbara Easterling, the Secretary-Treasurer of the Communication<br>
Workers, to be my running mate as the candidate for Secretary-<br>
Treasurer of the AFL-CIO. <br>
Barbara is one of the highest ranking women -- as well as one<br>
of the most able leaders -- in our movement. She's going to make<br>
an outstanding Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO and hold one of<br>
the two, mainstream leadership posts in the Federation. (Only my<br>
high regard for the incumbent keeps me from saying she will be the<br>
best in recent memory.) <br>
<br>
I also announced last week that if, as I expect, the Executive<br>
Council elects me in August to fill the remainder of President<br>
Kirkland's term, I intend as one of my first act to appoint a<br>
special committee to reexamine the Federation's entire structure<br>
and its decision-making processes. We need to make sure that they<br>
are as open and inclusive as possible and are capable of decisive<br>
action. <br>
<br>
It would be a mistake, in my view, to rush to make structural<br>
change in a time of partisan politics and without achieving the<br>
breadth of support on which Federation action must always rest. <br>
But I am confident that with strong leadership we can reach<br>
agreement over restructuring the Federation to make it more<br>
inclusive and more effective. <br>
<br>
Barbara Easterling's election as Secretary-Treasurer and the<br>
revamping of our governing structure will, I believe, help to<br>
shatter any remnants of a glass ceiling in our movement holding<br>
back women, African Americans and other persons of color. We need<br>
the fullest participation of all of our members if we are to<br>
realize our full potential -- and to live up to our own ideals. <br>
Indeed, we created a special Committee on Full Participation last<br>
year which John Sturdivant is chairing; that Committee already has<br>
presented a partial report to the Council and will present a full<br>
report to the Convention.<br>
<br>
But we cannot wait until we realize the ideal of full<br>
participation -- or until we succeed in reorganizing the workforce<br>
-- to mount our defense of workers' right and to wage our crusade<br>
for economic justice in this country.<br>
<br>
You have been focusing at this conference on the many critical<br>
issues facing us, so I won't go back over that ground. You know<br>
what the Republican agenda means for working families, and<br>
especially for African Americans. Less money for the education of<br>
our kids. Fewer opportunities for college education. Drastic<br>
reductions in health care coverage for the elderly and the poor.<br>
Longer hours, lower pay, and unsafe and unhealthy workplaces. And<br>
the destruction of a real voice on the job.<br>
<br>
To mount our defense -- and get back on the offensive -- we<br>
need to develop a grassroots mobilization effort that will put the<br>
Christian Coalition, and the National Federation of Independent<br>
Businesses, to shame. The right wingers and the corporate<br>
interests learned political organizing from us and they've poured<br>
their millions into refining these techniques in the service of the<br>
privileged few. <br>
<br>
We're never going to be able to match the other side dollar<br>
for dollar, although I believe we have to narrow this gap<br>
substantially. But I'll put the vitality of our trade union<br>
activists -- the men and women in this room -- up against them any<br>
day of the week, so long as we give our activists the tools. <br>
<br>
We have finally reached the point where virtually all unions<br>
supply our COPE program with their membership lists so we can mount<br>
coordinated political efforts -- although there are still a few of<br>
our largest affiliates who remain outside this process and at the<br>
same time are somewhat critical of our political efforts. We have<br>
to continue to try to persuade them of the need for unity in these<br>
efforts and of the program-weakening effects of their abstention. <br>
<br>
But with or without them, the AFL-CIO now needs to take the<br>
next step of building a movement-wide network of activists linked<br>
together electronically and capable of being activated on short<br>
notice, through the Federation, our affiliates, and our support<br>
groups. That, too, is something that must be done whatever the<br>
cost.<br>
<br>
As important as our activists are, however, our ultimate task<br>
is to reach out to each and every rank-and-file member. The truth<br>
is we spend much of our time &quot;preaching to the choir.&quot; In the<br>
meantime, too many trade unionists, especially among our newer and<br>
younger members, are members in name only. They joined ongoing<br>
unions as a condition of their employment and they have little<br>
contact with and sometimes even less understanding of trade<br>
unionism. <br>
<br>
If we are to build an effective grassroots legislative and<br>
political operation, we need to attend to the task of unionizing<br>
the already organized. This is another area in which I think no<br>
one -- again, including the AFL-CIO -- has done enough.<br>
<br>
Like all other organizing, the ultimate responsibility must<br>
rest with the individual unions. But here, too, the AFL-CIO can,<br>
and should play a strong leadership role.<br>
<br>
That's what our campaign to Stand UP for America's Working<br>
Families -- which I am so pleased to note has been the focus of<br>
this conference -- is all about. In this campaign we have brought<br>
together our legislative, political, and communications operatives<br>
to develop a coordinate set of messages to explain to our members<br>
exactly what the stakes are for them in the Republican agenda. <br>
<br>
But the messages of the campaign are just that -- messages. <br>
They are of no value unless they are heard, and understood, by our<br>
members. And that is where you, and every other trade union<br>
activist in our movement, comes in. <br>
<br>
We cannot, we dare not, rest until each and every union member<br>
-- and each and every member of the public -- understands the<br>
threat facing working people and knows who it is that is &quot;leading<br>
the fight for America's working families.&quot; <br>
<br>
For our part, the AFL-CIO has assigned half of its field staff<br>
to this campaign. Next week, for example, while Congress is in<br>
recess and the Representatives are in their districts, we will have<br>
AFL-CIO and affiliate staff in 30, carefully-selected congressional<br>
districts to coordinate Stand UP activities from leafletting at<br>
plant gates to confronting Congressmen at posh estates. We will be<br>
supplementing our staff efforts with a half-million dollar radio<br>
and television buy, as part of our largest media buy since the<br>
NAFTA campaign which I was proud to lead and which you supported so<br>
enthusiastically.<br>
<br>
We intend to continue this Stand UP campaign throughout the<br>
year, and into 1996. And we need the active participation of each<br>
and everyone one of you. We need you to be part of the legislative<br>
action committees which now exist in more than one-quarter of all<br>
congressional districts to serve as the focal points for an ongoing<br>
program of grassroots education. Even more than that, we need you<br>
to make sure that week in and week out, our members are aware of<br>
what is going on in Washington, and in your state capitols that<br>
affects working people. We need to make sure that their voices are<br>
heard by their elected representatives. And we need to assure that<br>
elected officials who vote against the interests of working people<br>
are held accountable by our members for their votes.<br>
<br>
As we embark on this campaign to turn the tide in this<br>
country, we need to be mindful of what the forces of reaction will<br>
do in an effort to divide us. The oldest game known to politicians<br>
-- and to defenders of wealth and privilege -- is to divide working<br>
people along racial lines, persuading whites or blacks that the<br>
other is somehow an opponent. <br>
<br>
We already have witnessed the first wave of this divisiveness<br>
in the attacks on the Davis-Bacon Act. Non-union construction<br>
companies want that law repealed for a very simple reason: they<br>
don't want to have to pay prevailing wages to their construction<br>
workers. Repealing Davis-Bacon would reduce the wages of all<br>
construction workers -- black, brown, yellow and white -- by almost<br>
$1,500 a year. That's the real reason why the Davis-Bacon Act --<br>
and its sister, the Service Contract Act -- are under attack. <br>
<br>
But the opponents of prevailing wage laws have cleverly sought<br>
to disguise their true interests by claiming that Davis-Bacon is an<br>
impediment to African-Americans getting training to become skilled<br>
craftsmen. That is, of course, patent nonsense. Worse than that,<br>
it is a pernicious argument -- it assumes that blacks are somehow<br>
not &quot;worth&quot; the prevailing wage and will only be hired if they can<br>
be paid sub-standard wages. <br>
<br>
The truth is, of course, precisely the opposite. The truth is<br>
that African Americans are more likely to have jobs and get<br>
training on Davis Bacon projects, and that in those states which<br>
repealed their &quot;little Davis-Bacon laws&quot; the minority enrollment in<br>
apprenticeship training dropped from 20% to 12.5%. Moreover, the<br>
truth is, as Norm Hill has stated, that because persons of color<br>
are most vulnerable and most exploited, &quot;Black, Hispanic, Native<br>
American and other minority workers, as well as women and young<br>
workers, especially need this law.&quot; But the attempt to use the<br>
Davis-Bacon Act to drive a wedge between us is only the dress<br>
rehearsal for what we know is the coming featured attraction: the<br>
assault on affirmative action. That assault began with the right-<br>
wing in California which, as Newsweek recently put it, has &quot;a knack<br>
for recognizing and speaking to the resentments of white<br>
suburbanites.&quot;<br>
<br>
From anti-communism to anti-taxes to anti-busing to anti-<br>
welfare to anti-immigrant and now anti-affirmative action -- it<br>
doesn't matter how much or little merit those resentments may have. <br>
The California right knows how to play them like a violin -- how to<br>
advance the wedge issues that set worker against worker. And<br>
they're giving lessons to the rest of the nation's right wingers.<br>
<br>
If we are going to respond effectively to this threat, we need<br>
to understand what fuels it. <br>
<br>
Working families in this country are understandably nervous --<br>
and they are angry. Who isn't? They are working harder and<br>
harder, for less, struggling to keep from falling behind.<br>
<br>
Just last week the Labor Department reported that in the<br>
preceding twelve months -- in the midst of a widespread economic<br>
expansion -- average wages plunged by 2.3% and total compensation<br>
by 3%. That is the largest one-year decline since the 1840's. <br>
<br>
It is all too easy in times like these for demagogues on the<br>
right to persuade white families that the reason they are<br>
struggling is because affirmative action is giving black families<br>
an unfair share of the pie. <br>
<br>
We have got to make the case against this nonsense. White<br>
families are struggling for the same reason that black families and<br>
Hispanic families and Asian families are struggling: because this<br>
nation tolerates the most unfair, unequal distribution of income of<br>
any industrialized nation. <br>
<br>
The Washington Post news article reporting on last week's<br>
Labor Department data tells the real story. It is headed &quot;Profits,<br>
Markets at a High But Workers Earning Less.&quot; Let me read part of<br>
that article: &quot;The stock market is at an all-time high, driven by<br>
corporate profits that are up 14% over the last year. Worker<br>
productivity seems to have reached a new, higher plateau. <br>
Businesses are so flush with cash that they are buying back their<br>
own stock ... But recent data show that surprising little of this<br>
bonanza has been passed on to workers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Commenting on the data Secretary of Labor Reich said, &quot;The<br>
owners of capital are registering huge gains while ordinary working<br>
Americans are seeing their incomes fall.&quot; This suggests &quot;a major<br>
shift from earned to unearned income, from paychecks to dividends<br>
and capital gains. Things are simply way out of whack.&quot; <br>
<br>
The villain is not affirmative action. It is a set of<br>
governmental policies that allow low-wage workers to be exploited,<br>
that allows our best jobs to be shipped overseas, and that denies<br>
working men and women the right to organize a union and negotiate<br>
for decent wages and working conditions. <br>
<br>
On affirmative action, the AFL-CIO's position is as clear as<br>
it can be. As I said to the AFL-CIO Civil Rights Institute in<br>
April, &quot;We support true affirmative action, not the distorted image<br>
conjured up by right-wing propagandists, with their claims of<br>
quotas and of the hiring of incompetents and the disruption of<br>
seniority systems.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We endorse the real thing -- a set of effective tools to help<br>
remedy the colossal injustice of discrimination, to give people an<br>
equal chance at good jobs and good education, to make sure that<br>
people have a ladder up, to open opportunity for people to use<br>
their talents and abilities.&quot;<br>
<br>
Our movement defines itself by certain ideals: democracy,<br>
equality, fair treatment, and a commitment to economic and social<br>
justice. We believe that when there is injustice, when those<br>
ideals have been violated then there must be redress. That is what<br>
we are all about. That is what we stand for. <br>
<br>
And so, we can't allow the demagogues on the right to set<br>
white against black, native-born against immigrant. We must stand<br>
and fight together. For as Phil Randolph taught us, &quot;there are no<br>
reserved seats at the banquet table of nature. You get what you<br>
can take and you keep what you can hold.&quot;<br>
<br>
Working together -- standing UP together for America's working<br>
families -- we'll be seated at the table. We'll get as much to eat<br>
as everyone else gets. And we'll make sure that no one goes<br>
hungry. <br>
<br>
Working together, we can build the largest, most dynamic trade<br>
union movement this nation has ever had and we can make the nation<br>
respond. We can make the politicians create an economy with the<br>
people at its center -- an economy at the service of the people,<br>
not vice versa. And we can make life a whole lot better for the<br>
people we are privileged to serve.<br>
<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p>Remarks of AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland<br>
ACTWU/ILGWU Merger Convention<br>
Miami Beach, Florida<br>
June 30, 1995<br>
<br>
<br>
President Mazur, Brother Sheinkman, Brother Loevy,<br>
Brother Raynor, Brother Romney, brothers and sisters:<br>
<br>
It is a special pleasure to be here for this historic<br>
convention, which merges two proud, unions into a major<br>
force for progressive change in the 21st Century -- a force<br>
for working people and the dignity and justice they deserve.<br>
<br>
&quot;In unity there is strength.&quot; It is the oldest and yet<br>
the most modern bedrock principle of this labor movement. <br>
And it is the clarion call from your decision this week to<br>
merge the Amalgamated with the ILG.<br>
<br>
On behalf of your 13 million brothers and sisters who<br>
belong to the unions of the AFL-CIO, I am proud to help you<br>
inaugurate your new era as the Union of Needletrades,<br>
Industrial and Textile Employees.<br>
<br>
I have no doubt that UNITE is going to be in the<br>
forefront of the labor movement's struggle to make life<br>
better for working families everywhere.<br>
<br>
For what it's worth, I want you to know that this<br>
merger has my blessing with only one qualification -- and<br>
that is that UNITE must still have Evy Dubrow, fighting the<br>
good fight for all of us on Capitol Hill. We young people<br>
must stick together, Evy.<br>
I want to extend my personal congratulations to Jack<br>
Sheinkman and Jay Mazur, whose leadership and vision made<br>
this extraordinary event actually happen. Together, they<br>
have carried forward the ideals that ACTWU and the ILG have<br>
so forcefully advocated since the turn of the century.<br>
<br>
Just as all of labor looked to Sidney Hillman and David<br>
Dubinsky for their leadership and their ideas to confront<br>
the challenges of an earlier era, Jack and Jay have kept the<br>
needle trades unions on the cutting edge of the critical<br>
issues of today.<br>
<br>
I'm referring very specifically to the globalization of<br>
the economy and the exploitation of working people both at<br>
home and abroad. Let me address that issue for a moment.<br>
<br>
As you know, over the past several months, there has<br>
been much debate over the leadership of the AFL-CIO and its<br>
policies and programs.<br>
<br>
There is nothing inherently troubling about that. We<br>
are a democratic movement and such debate is part and parcel<br>
of that fact.<br>
But there is one thing that disturbs me very much --<br>
and that is the tendency of some to make a political issue<br>
of our movement's activities on behalf of our brothers and<br>
sisters in other countries.<br>
<br>
The argument -- and I've heard it put forth, recently,<br>
by prominent trade union leaders -- goes something like<br>
this: &quot;We appreciate what the AFL-CIO has done to advance<br>
democracy in places like Poland, Chile, South Africa and<br>
elsewhere in the world. But that fight is over. Workers in<br>
our own country have real problems, and we should stop<br>
focusing our attention abroad and come home.&quot;<br>
But you can't go home again -- the world won't let you.<br>
<br>
What they are advocating is nothing less than the<br>
abandonment of a principle that the American labor movement<br>
has championed since the days when Samuel Gompers helped<br>
launch the International Labor Organization -- poverty<br>
anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere.<br>
<br>
It's bad enough that the right wing in Congress has<br>
again succumbed to the fatal lure of isolationism. We hear<br>
from Senators Dole and Helms that the ILO is going to be<br>
history if they get their way.<br>
<br>
The barbarians are at the gates. They have launched a<br>
direct attack on the labor standards and conditions that the<br>
ILO has set forth and which provide a framework for<br>
defending and advancing worker rights in the new global<br>
economy. We've got to stop their campaign to scuttle the<br>
only body in the UN family that addresses the lives and<br>
problems of the billions of working people on whose<br>
shoulders this world rests.<br>
<br>
But above all, let us not join them, under whatever<br>
pretext, in turning our backs on our brothers and sisters in<br>
the far places of this shrinking globe.<br>
<br>
One of the bulwarks of the AFL-CIO Constitution -- the<br>
&quot;Objects and Principles&quot; section -- contains a paragraph<br>
that defines the federation's mission as: &quot;To give<br>
constructive aid in promoting the cause of peace and freedom<br>
in the world and to aid, assist and cooperate with free and<br>
democratic labor movements throughout the world.&quot; If it<br>
should now be said in lofty derogation, that the AFL-CIO<br>
takes this commitment very seriously, that we are overly<br>
concerned with the plight of the wretched of the earth, then<br>
I must plead guilty as charged -- and proudly so.<br>
<br>
There is a reason for this. It is not blithe<br>
rhetoric -- or sentimentality. And our international<br>
responsibilities must not be kicked around like a political football.<br>
<br>
You have learned the hard way that we do not live on an<br>
island. We cannot make a separate peace with those who<br>
would abuse and exploit workers if given a free hand to do<br>
so.<br>
<br>
The global marketplace, the rapid mobility of capital,<br>
the inscrutable nature of flags over workplaces and the<br>
indifference of corporate managements to national values and<br>
aspirations that do not turn into profit -- all of these are<br>
facts of life that we cannot simply wish away.<br>
<br>
The defense of worker rights and standards in our own<br>
country requires that we act in close concert with free<br>
labor everywhere.<br>
<br>
That's why your predecessor unions have worked<br>
tirelessly with your brothers and sisters in the developing<br>
world -- all for the purpose of improving their conditions<br>
and helping them stand on their feet rather than live on<br>
their knees.<br>
<br>
And I am confident that the men and women of UNITE will<br>
continue on this course in the years ahead.<br>
<br>
The grim consequences of rampant market capitalism have<br>
already been felt by workers everywhere, as enterprises roam<br>
the world in search of the cheapest and most repressed<br>
labor.<br>
<br>
They sentence working men and women to misery and death<br>
through starvation wages in fire-trap factories. They<br>
conspire with economic systems that conscript little<br>
children into hard labor. And they forge alliances with the<br>
world's cruelest dictators to undermine the rights,<br>
standards and conditions of working people in the name of<br>
trade, investment and profit.<br>
<br>
Contrary to the arguments of their lackeys in<br>
government, in the usual well-endowed think tanks, and in<br>
journals supported by their ads, these people are not the<br>
tribunes of human freedom and human hope, but are in league<br>
with the deadliest enemies of those values. <br>
<br>
They must be opposed vigorously by all who love liberty<br>
and democracy and the right of workers to band together,<br>
lest a great gulf open into which human beings will fall to<br>
ruin. The AFL-CIO must remain in the vanguard of what will<br>
surely be the next century's greatest and most difficult<br>
struggle.<br>
<br>
Societies and states are raised among men to serve, not<br>
the faceless marketplace, but the aspirations of real<br>
people. We must compel those responsible for affairs of<br>
state and finance to face these questions:<br>
<br>
What prospect motivated those workers whose sacrifice<br>
of their lives is memorialized on the wall of the shipyard<br>
in Gdansk?<br>
<br>
What aspirations moved those young workers who ended up<br>
in unmarked graves in a cemetery on the outskirts of<br>
Budapest, executed in cold blood in the aftermath of the<br>
uprising of 1956?<br>
<br>
What dreams prompted working people to look down the<br>
barrels of guns in the streets of Soweto, the boulevards of<br>
Santiago and at Tiananmen Square?<br>
<br>
What ambitions inspire ordinary, working people<br>
anywhere to place life and limb in harm's way?<br>
<br>
Their valor is summoned to advance, not business<br>
license and market ideology, but rather the right of<br>
ordinary people to live a decent and honest life and not to<br>
be humiliated and kicked around by idiots with the power of<br>
arms or other people's money.<br>
<br>
They seek to fulfill the democratic promise that<br>
ultimate power should reside not in capital or centralized<br>
government -- not in pure individualism or coercive<br>
collectivism -- but rather in communities of people<br>
exercising their rights to free association in order to<br>
express their common aspirations.<br>
<br>
The great and burning question in the world today is<br>
whether this new world order is to serve the ends of those<br>
who brought it to life -- the quest for simple human dignity<br>
and just societies -- or is to be held in thrall by the<br>
agents of ruthless capital.<br>
<br>
It is up to us to see that the answer is not handed<br>
down from on high, but wells up from the places where<br>
attention has been truly earned, from the workplaces and the<br>
streets, wherever plain people band together to build a<br>
decent life.<br>
<br>
We cannot and we must not retreat from that<br>
responsibility. It is what we are all about.<br>
<br>
And I have no doubt that you are up to the challenge.<br>
Thank you. Congratulations. And the very best of luck<br>
in your new era of unity and solidarity.</p>

<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<p>AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Thomas R. Donahue<br>
Utility Workers Union of America<br>
San Diego, California<br>
June 21, 1995<br>
<br>
<br>
This is my third consecutive Utility Workers convention, and<br>
after sweltering with you at the Diplomat both in 1987 and again in<br>
1991 I want to salute you for your choice of this magnificent city<br>
for your 1995 convention. I'm happy to be here with you again, and<br>
not just because we're in San Diego.<br>
<br>
As you all know, last week Lane Kirkland announced his intent<br>
to retire as President of the AFL-CIO and I announced my candidacy<br>
to succeed him. I am proud to say that one of the first persons to<br>
announce his support for me was your good president, Marshall<br>
Hicks, and the resolution you have adopted supporting me is the<br>
second formal convention endorsement I have received. I thank you<br>
for it. Your resolution confirms my view that my candidacy offers<br>
the best opportunity to unite the labor movement behind a program<br>
of solidarity, diversity and innovation. <br>
<br>
President Kirkland's resignation as President of the AFL-CIO<br>
marks the end of an era. Amidst the current debate about what we<br>
ought to accomplish, it is too easy to lose sight of what has been<br>
accomplished during those years. The AFL-CIO of today is a vastly<br>
different -- and better -- organization than it was in 1979. Lane<br>
led us through exceedingly difficult times, and did so with great<br>
distinction. We would be unworthy of our values if, in the heat of<br>
the moment, we were to fail to recognize and pay tribute to Lane<br>
Kirkland. I for one do not propose to allow that to happen.<br>
<br>
At the same time, an impending change of leadership creates an<br>
occasion to reassess where we as a labor movement are and where we<br>
are heading. That is an exceedingly healthy process, and one which<br>
I welcome. <br>
<br>
As you know, for the past ten years I have devoted a great<br>
deal of my time and energies to focusing the Federation and our<br>
affiliated unions on the challenges of the future. That has not<br>
always been easy. Ours is a movement so engaged with our present<br>
responsibilities -- so preoccupied with current economic problems<br>
and so beset by the hostile climate in which we defend worker<br>
rights -- that we too often find it impossible to take the time to<br>
look to the future. It is awfully hard to focus on tomorrow when<br>
today demands so much of us. <br>
<br>
But we have made headway, I think, in introducing for our<br>
affiliates' consideration new and promising approaches. Some did<br>
not pass inspection; others, quite frankly, were tried and failed;<br>
but many have proven to be quite successful and are now part of the<br>
warp and woof of the AFL-CIO.<br>
<br>
In the wake of last November's disastrous elections, there was<br>
and is now a widespread recognition that we need to do more -- to<br>
accelerate the pace of change. The times demand a stronger, more<br>
self-sufficient labor movement. Such a movement requires a strong<br>
Federation at its core. And a strong Federation requires strong<br>
and creative leadership and the united support of all our unions. <br>
<br>
<br>
Our Federation is a peculiar and, in some respects, fragile<br>
institution. It is a voluntary organization of 80 autonomous<br>
unions who represent different kinds of people in different<br>
jurisdictions with different needs. Achieving consensus is never<br>
easy and often frustrating. The need for a broad agreement to<br>
support AFL-CIO action has stalled many a proposal that you might<br>
think -- and that I have thought -- eminently worthwhile. Those<br>
proposals failed because some affiliates -- faithfully representing<br>
their own members -- thought otherwise. <br>
<br>
This process of securing as broad an agreement as possible<br>
cannot be short-circuited. Ultimately what holds us together is the<br>
understanding that in solidarity and in unity lies our strength. <br>
That makes it incumbent upon the next president of the AFL-CIO to<br>
put forth a bold program of innovation that will capture the<br>
imagination of the labor movement and to build the breadth of<br>
support needed to propel that program forward.<br>
<br>
We all know that the trade union movement is in a period of<br>
difficulty. Our unions are in difficulty because working families<br>
are in difficulty. That is not an excuse, it is a simple fact!<br>
<br>
I would like to talk to you today about the challenges as I<br>
see them and about the steps I think we need to take if we are to<br>
fulfill our historic mission.<br>
<br>
Our first, most pressing challenge is to help the unorganized<br>
workers in this country to form and join unions. When I joined the<br>
trade union movement, roughly four in ten workers in this country<br>
belonged to a union. Today, in the private sector, the number is<br>
closer to one in ten. And if present trends were to continue,<br>
within ten years only one in twenty private sector workers would be<br>
part of our movement.<br>
<br>
Some have suggested that labor unions are &quot;no longer relevant&quot;<br>
to today's workers. I disagree. Even if union membership were<br>
ever to reach the end of the road, trade unionism still would be<br>
the most vital, most meaningful force in the work life of its last<br>
100 members, assuring the recognition of their dignity and the<br>
decency of their working conditions. <br>
But such a labor movement would no longer be a major force in<br>
our society. It would no longer help set labor standards. It<br>
would no longer be able to represent working families in the body<br>
politic. <br>
<br>
We cannot allow that to happen.<br>
<br>
We all know the extraordinary obstacles that unorganized<br>
workers face in trying to create independent representation in<br>
their workplace. &quot;Only in America,&quot; as the saying goes, is<br>
business so determined to crush any independent voice for working<br>
people. And only in America does the law allow management free<br>
rein to terrorize workers who seek to stand up for themselves. <br>
<br>
A writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer recently noted that<br>
&quot;organizing a union these days is like breeding pandas in<br>
captivity. If everything goes right, it can be done. Miracles do<br>
happen. But it's so difficult, so risky, so fraught with<br>
frustration and disappointment that fewer and fewer people are<br>
wiling to try.&quot;<br>
<br>
What will change this? We know that salvation will not come<br>
from on high. Things won't change until we make them change. We<br>
can't wait for a better law before we go about the task of<br>
organizing the unorganized. Indeed, in my view our best hope of<br>
achieving labor law reform is first to bring millions of new<br>
workers into our ranks.<br>
<br>
We have all heard -- and given -- stirring speeches about the<br>
importance of organizing. But the truth is that no one and no<br>
institution -- and I include the AFL-CIO in this -- is doing<br>
enough. All of us can, should and must do more.<br>
<br>
Let me cite a couple of shocking statistics to you. Each<br>
year, fewer than two-tenths of one percent of all unorganized<br>
workers are afforded the opportunity to vote for or against union<br>
representation in an NLRB election. Less than forty elections are<br>
held in units with 500 or more employees. The number of elections,<br>
and the number of workers involved in those elections, is now half<br>
of what it was in the 1970's, even though the labor force is quite<br>
a bit larger. <br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO cannot itself do the critical front line work of<br>
organizing unorganized workers. The Federation will never<br>
adequately know the needs and wants of utility workers, for<br>
example, as well as the Utility Workers Union. But I believe that<br>
the Federation can energize the organizing process and assist the<br>
work of our affiliates. <br>
<br>
Last January, we created an Executive Council Committee to<br>
reexamine the Federation's role in organizing. That Committee is<br>
now hard at work. I do not know what will come out of its work,<br>
but let me offer you some specific ideas of my own.<br>
<br>
One critical role for the Federation is to recruit and train<br>
a new generation of organizers. In 1985, the Evolution of Work<br>
Committee which I chair, in its report on The Changing Situation of<br>
Workers and Their Unions, called attention to the need for &quot;broad<br>
recruitment efforts&quot; and &quot;extensive training&quot; of organizers. The<br>
result of our recommendation was the AFL-CIO Organizing Institute.<br>
<br>
The Institute opened its doors in 1990 as a two-person<br>
operation with a tiny budget. Since then, I am proud to report <br>
the Institute's budget has increased five fold to roughly $2.5<br>
million. It is one of our greatest success stories.<br>
<br>
Since 1990, the Institute has graduated 400 organizers. This<br>
year alone the Organizing Institute will provide classroom training<br>
programs to 900 individuals, and will provide supervised<br>
internships and apprenticeships to 200, most of whom will go on to<br>
become full-time organizers. When you look at just about every<br>
large organizing campaign in our movement, you will notice that a<br>
graduate of the Institute is involved.<br>
<br>
I believe we need to expand the Organizing Institute until it<br>
can graduate enough organizers each year to meets the needs of<br>
every union in the Federation. Whatever the cost, that is<br>
something we must find the way to do.<br>
<br>
There is, I believe, a second and equally important role for<br>
the AFL-CIO to play in the organizing process. I believe, the<br>
Federation should create a multi-million dollar organizing trust<br>
fund to be used to stimulate and support organizing projects which<br>
are of strategic importance to the movement as a whole. Organizing<br>
today generally involves small shops that happen to present<br>
themselves to a union somewhere as a target of opportunity. <br>
Organizing is not driven by any strategic sense of important<br>
industries, employers, regions, or occupational groups who we need<br>
to organize. <br>
<br>
I believe the AFL-CIO can change that by using this trust fund<br>
to support organizing projects which are of movement-wide<br>
significance and to which the interested unions make substantial<br>
commitments of their own. In that way the Federation could use its<br>
expenditures to secure much larger commitments of resources from<br>
our affiliates.<br>
<br>
Financing such an effort may not be easy. But it can and<br>
should be done.<br>
<br>
The first group that I would propose we reach out to with this<br>
kind of organizing effort are the low-wage workers in this nation -<br>
- especially immigrants, women and persons of color. They belong<br>
in our movement. And, tragically the low wage workforce is<br>
expanding rapidly; the number and proportion of full-time worker<br>
whose earnings are below the poverty level doubled in the past<br>
fifteen years.<br>
<br>
If we are to organize these workers we must make sure that the<br>
representatives of our unions reflect the diversity of today's<br>
workplace. The Organizing Institute has concentrated on this need<br>
and more than half its graduates are women or persons of color. <br>
But the commitment to diversity and full participation must extend<br>
to all levels of the trade union movement. <br>
<br>
We at the AFL-CIO have been working at this at the staff level<br>
and I am proud to say that in the past ten years almost half of the<br>
newly-appointed department heads have been women or minorities. <br>
And we've seen the beginning of change -- but only its beginning --<br>
in our state federations and city central bodies. <br>
<br>
But the time has now come, in my view, to make the same<br>
commitment with respect to the top leadership of the AFL-CIO. <br>
Yesterday, I gave reality to what up to now has been promises by<br>
announcing that my running mate for the position of AFL-CIO<br>
Secretary-Treasurer will be Barbara Easterling, the Secretary-<br>
Treasurer of the Communication Workers. <br>
<br>
Barbara is one of the highest ranking women -- as well as one<br>
of the most able leaders -- in our movement. The daughter of a<br>
coal miner, she joined the union at age 17, and rose through the<br>
ranks -- as shop steward, secretary and then vice-president of her<br>
local union, national staff representative for CWA, Assistant to<br>
the National President, Executive Vice President, and for the past<br>
three years Secretary-Treasurer. She's going to make an<br>
outstanding Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO. (Only my high<br>
regard for the incumbent keeps me from saying she will be the best<br>
in recent memory.) <br>
<br>
There is yet a third way in which the AFL-CIO can<br>
significantly contribute to the revitalization of organizing: we<br>
can stimulate the creation of new forms of worker organizations to<br>
supplement our traditional, collective-bargaining institutions. <br>
<br>
One way to do that is to experiment much more broadly with<br>
&quot;less-than-exclusive&quot; recognition. This was one of the ideas<br>
developed in our Evolution of Work committee. We have experience<br>
with it in the public sector where it has been a &quot;building block&quot;<br>
to full collective bargaining.<br>
<br>
Over the past few years the Communications Workers has been<br>
particularly active in testing this idea in the private sector. At<br>
NCR, for example, CWA helped build an NCR employees association. <br>
Now, in the agreement negotiated just last week between AT&amp;T and<br>
CWA, the union was successful in winning the right to represent<br>
individual workers at AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions -- formerly<br>
NCR -- who designate CWA to be their representative. This is an<br>
historic breakthrough and it, and other efforts like it, can blaze<br>
a new trail.<br>
<br>
There are other new trails we need to explore as well. Today,<br>
companies and jobs are less stable than they used to be. Workers<br>
are increasingly attached not so much to their workplace or<br>
employer, but to their occupation and sometimes their industry. <br>
This is especially true of contingent workers, who account for 20%<br>
of today's workforce and who are growing at an exponential rate. <br>
And it is also true of professional and technical workers who will<br>
account for 40% of all non-managerial employees in ten years. <br>
<br>
I believe that we can serve these workers by creating<br>
organizations modeled after our craft unions (in the building<br>
trades, maritime, and printing industries) and professional<br>
associations with an occupational rather than a workplace focus. <br>
This was one of the centerpieces of the Evolution of Work<br>
Committee's 1985 report. At that time, many within the labor<br>
movement were concerned about an active AFL-CIO role in developing<br>
what came to be known as &quot;associate membership&quot; and so the AFL-CIO<br>
largely was limited to creating benefits and services which our<br>
unions offer to those who join their ranks. That program -- the<br>
Union Privilege program -- has been a huge success but we need to<br>
go further.<br>
<br>
I propose that the Federation be authorized to experiment with<br>
different types of associations structured on occupational or<br>
industrial lines. I also continue to believe that we should create<br>
an American Association of Working Persons to serve the active<br>
workforce in much the same way that AARP and the National Council<br>
of Senior Citizens serve older Americans. Such organizations<br>
eventually can become bridges to forming workplace organizations as<br>
well.<br>
<br>
There are millions and millions of unorganized workers --<br>
especially white collar and pink collar workers -- for whom bridges<br>
are not necessary but who need to be reassured that they can have<br>
an independent voice on the job without endless conflict with their<br>
employer. These workers are hungry for a new way of dealing with<br>
their employers.<br>
<br>
Last year, after many years of discussions and debate, the<br>
Evolution of Work Committee paved the way for that to happen with<br>
a report entitled, A Call for Partnership. That Report calls upon<br>
unions &quot;to take the initiative in stimulating, sustaining and<br>
institutionalizing a new system of work organization based upon<br>
full and equal labor-management partnerships.&quot; The Report also<br>
urges the Federation to assume a leadership role in &quot;helping unions<br>
-- and employers -- identify paths to success.&quot; <br>
<br>
We've already taken the first steps. Our Labor Studies Center<br>
has been working this past year with four unions to develop a Labor<br>
Leadership Institute for Workplace Change. <br>
In my view, that kind of program needs to be expanded to serve<br>
the entire labor movement. We need to help this generation -- and<br>
to develop a new generation -- of labor leaders who are prepared to<br>
function in a very different environment requiring expertise and<br>
skills quite different than those required in the past. I would<br>
like to see the AFL-CIO create a new institute, modeled on the<br>
Organizing Institute, but with the mission of training union<br>
leaders for new roles and responsibilities. <br>
<br>
I have talked at great length about organizing because in the<br>
long run, we cannot survive unless we succeed in reorganizing the<br>
workforce. But in the short term, we face challenges which are, if<br>
anything, even more urgent and pressing. <br>
<br>
We talk about building partnership with employers but we know<br>
that many employers still would love nothing better than to<br>
annihilate us, to silence the independent voice of workers and to<br>
regain total control of the workplace.<br>
<br>
In recent years, management has increasingly used or<br>
threatened to use one of the most deadly weapons in its arsenal:<br>
permanent replacements. The law says that workers have a right to<br>
strike, that they cannot be fired for exercising that right, but<br>
that they can be permanently replaced. Charles Dickens was right: <br>
the law is an ass!<br>
<br>
We tried to change the law. We tried to prohibit permanent<br>
replacements in 1992 and again in 1994 but each time we were<br>
defeated by a filibuster led by Senator Hatch and his right-wing<br>
friends. <br>
<br>
I was on Capitol Hill, meeting with Senators, up until the<br>
moment of the vote each time. I know that we waged the good fight<br>
and did everything in our power to win. I know we had the support<br>
of a majority of the Senate to win. But the 60 votes simply<br>
weren't there to break the filibuster.<br>
<br>
President Clinton is now doing what he can to address this<br>
situation through his Executive Order prohibiting the federal<br>
government from doing business with companies which hire permanent<br>
replacements for strikers. The regulations implementing that Order<br>
take effect next week and we need to be ready to make full use of<br>
it.<br>
<br>
In the final analysis, however, it is up to us as a labor<br>
movement to marshall the strength to prevent employers form<br>
successfully breaking our strikes and destroying the lives of<br>
working families through the use of permanent replacements. It is<br>
up to us to do that, whatever the law is. <br>
<br>
The AFL-CIO several years ago created a Strategic Approaches<br>
program to harness the strength of all of our unions in important<br>
struggles. That program has contributed vital support in a number<br>
of epoch battles, and has, I am persuaded, been a substantial<br>
factor in the successful outcomes of several of these. One need<br>
only look at the struggles at Ravenswood Aluminum, or in the New<br>
York, Pittsburgh, and San Francisco newspaper fights, to see the<br>
efficacy of this support mechanism. This program needs to be<br>
nurtured and strengthened. <br>
<br>
We need to make it clear to friend and foe that there will be<br>
no lost strikes. There will be no permanent replacement of<br>
strikers. No matter how long it takes, this labor movement will<br>
stand in solidarity with our strikers for as long as it takes --<br>
and one day longer -- and we will find the resources to sustain the<br>
brave and determined workers who are locked in these struggles.<br>
<br>
Let the word go out to employers who may be inclined to test<br>
our mettle. We seek no conflicts. We seek partnership and<br>
sharing. But neither will we shrink from battles forced upon us.<br>
<br>
Tell the Bridgestones and the Caterpillars and the Staleys and<br>
all the rest, we won't go away. You may produce, but you will not<br>
sell to decent minded people. You will not live in peace in any<br>
community where you oppress workers. We will use every tactics<br>
available to us to make you pay a price every bit as dear as that<br>
which you seek to impose on workers. <br>
<br>
For our part, our affiliates need to ensure that there are no<br>
ill-conceived strikes, no major struggles lightly entered upon<br>
without the fullest consultation. But in the final analysis, where<br>
workers are pressed to a breaking point and determine that they<br>
must fight for decency, they'll have the support of every man and<br>
woman in this Federation, and we will, in turn, seek to enlist the<br>
support of every citizen in the community.<br>
<br>
<br>
We face equally important and tough fights in the legislative<br>
and political arena. The supporters of the wealthy now control<br>
Congress and they are targeting America's working families -- the<br>
government programs that assist them and all the employment laws<br>
that protect them, from OSHA to the 40 hour week. Our unions are<br>
the last bastion of defense for working families.<br>
<br>
To mount that defense -- and get back on the offensive -- we<br>
need to develop a grassroots mobilization effort that will put the<br>
Christian Coalition, and the National Federation of Independent<br>
Businesses, to shame. The right wingers and the corporate<br>
interests learned political organizing from us and they've poured<br>
their millions into refining these techniques in the service of the<br>
privileged few. <br>
<br>
We're never going to be able to match the other side dollar<br>
for dollar, although I believe we have to narrow this gap<br>
substantially. But I'll put the vitality of our trade union<br>
activists up against them any day of the week, so long as we give<br>
our activists the tools. <br>
<br>
We have finally reached the point where virtually all unions<br>
supply our COPE program with their membership lists so we can mount<br>
coordinated political efforts -- although there are still a few of<br>
our largest affiliates who remain outside this process. We have to<br>
continue to try to persuade them of the need for unity in these<br>
efforts and of the program-weakening effects of their abstention. <br>
But with or without them, I believe we now need to take the next<br>
step of building a movement-wide network of activists linked<br>
together electronically and capable of being activated on short<br>
notice, through the Federation and our affiliates.<br>
As important as our activists are, however, our ultimate task<br>
is to reach out to each and every rank-and-file member. The truth<br>
is we spend much of our time &quot;preaching to the choir.&quot; In the<br>
meantime, too many trade unionists, especially among our newer and<br>
younger members, are members in name only. They joined ongoing<br>
unions as a condition of their employment and they have little<br>
contact with and even less understanding of trade unionism. <br>
<br>
If we are to build an effective grassroots legislative and<br>
political operation, we need to attend to the task of what I call<br>
unionizing the already organized. This is another area in which I<br>
think no one -- again, including the AFL-CIO -- has done enough.<br>
<br>
Like all other organizing, the ultimate responsibility must<br>
rest with the individual unions. But here, too, the AFL-CIO can,<br>
and should play a strong leadership role.<br>
<br>
A good example of what the Federation can do was the campaign<br>
against NAFTA, which I was proud to lead. <br>
<br>
We lost against the united forces of the entire business<br>
community and the administration. That was a formidable army<br>
fighting us. But our members -- and working families everywhere --<br>
saw us, heard us, and knew who was fighting for the working people<br>
of this country. We made clear to our members what we are all<br>
about, and made them proud to be members of the labor movement.<br>
<br>
Right now, we are waging a campaign against the Republicans'<br>
legislative assault -- our campaign to Stand UP for America's<br>
Working Families. It's a different kind of operation, but it also<br>
shows what the Federation can do to lead the way back.<br>
<br>
In this campaign we have brought together the legislative,<br>
political, and communications operations of our affiliates. We<br>
have worked out a set of messages which can be repeatedly<br>
communicated to our members to explain what the stakes are for<br>
them. Our messages have been informed by a sophisticated research<br>
program and captured in professionally-developed campaign materials<br>
that are being disseminated widely throughout the labor movement.<br>
<br>
In addition, in a number of key congressional districts, we<br>
have taken to the ground and to the air with both the AFL-CIO field<br>
staff -- almost half of whom have been deployed on this campaign --<br>
and with our largest media buy since NAFTA. <br>
<br>
We intend to continue this effort throughout the year, and<br>
with your help to keep hammering on our messages until each and<br>
every union member -- and in our targeted districts every member of<br>
the public -- understands the threat facing working people and<br>
knows who it is that is leading the fight for America's working<br>
families.&quot;<br>
<br>
As the NAFTA and Stand UP campaigns illustrate, our<br>
legislative-political efforts -- and also, I believe, our<br>
organizing efforts -- require a sophisticated communications<br>
program. Here, again, we have significantly expanded our<br>
capacities, especially for electronic communications.<br>
<br>
I am still not satisfied, however, that we have done enough in<br>
these areas. In 1993, at my urging, the AFL-CIO commissioned a<br>
full-scale audit of our communications program which resulted in a<br>
hard-hitting report with recommendations for a strategic<br>
communications program for the labor movement.<br>
<br>
We took some criticism for this effort -- especially when some<br>
of the results were leaked to the press. Holding a mirror up to<br>
one's face is seldom entirely pleasant, and in this case we learned<br>
some painful lessons about how we are perceived by a portion of the<br>
general public. But in my view, this was important to do and I am<br>
determined to move forward in implementing this strategic<br>
communications program.<br>
<br>
One element of that program is a far more systematic effort to<br>
earn media attention. The days when the press would seek us out<br>
are long gone. We need to adapt accordingly. We also need to<br>
recognize that most of the communications in the nation today take<br>
place not through national media but at the local level, through<br>
local papers, radio and TV.<br>
<br>
We also need to figure out how to make best use of the newer<br>
forms of communication -- from talk radio and cable television to<br>
the Internet and the information superhighway -- as well as how to<br>
best use paid advertising. <br>
I've talked now at probably too-great length and yet I feel<br>
that I have only begun to scratch the surface. Allow me to close<br>
with a few, more general observations.<br>
<br>
While the challenges we face are, enormous, we can take heart<br>
in the fact that we are still the largest, strongest, most vibrant<br>
labor movement in the world -- with 13 million members and an<br>
activist core second to none. We are still the strongest, most<br>
vital progressive force in the nation, seeking justice, fairness<br>
and decency for all American working families.<br>
<br>
We can also take heart in the fact that there is no shortage<br>
of promising ideas as to how to go about creating the kind of labor<br>
movement working families need. Those ideas exist not just at AFL-<br>
CIO headquarters but at every national and international union, at<br>
every local union, and at every state and local central body<br>
throughout the nation. Our challenge is to get all those ideas on<br>
the table and then decide which are most worth pursuing and how to<br>
fund them.<br>
<br>
This is not to say that the decisions we face in revitalizing<br>
our movement are easy or the path ahead clear. If that were true,<br>
the decisions would have been made long ago. <br>
To the contrary, we face complex and challenging decisions<br>
about priorities and about roles -- about how best to use the very<br>
limited resources that are allocated to the AFL-CIO and about how<br>
to maximize the contributions of the Federation in a system built<br>
upon autonomous, decentralized unions.<br>
<br>
That brings me to my final point -- a terribly important note<br>
of caution. How we go about making these decisions is every bit as<br>
significant as what we ultimately decide. The AFL-CIO is nothing<br>
more -- and nothing less -- than the sum of its parts. I said<br>
before and I say again, we are an organization dedicated to seeking<br>
consensus as a basis for action. The Federation cannot be held<br>
together if it is run by 52-48 votes or if it is run by a group of<br>
large unions acting separately. Nobody can &quot;proclaim&quot; the way<br>
forward. <br>
<br>
That need not mean -- as it sometimes has in the past -- that<br>
one union or even a small group should be able to tie the<br>
Federation's hands. Such an approach can produce inertia -- and<br>
inertia is the last thing we can afford.<br>
<br>
I believe we need to reexamine the Federation's entire<br>
structure, governance and decision-making processes so as to assure<br>
that they are open, inclusive and capable of decisive action. If,<br>
as I expect, the Executive Council elects me in August to fill the<br>
remainder of President Kirkland's term, I intend as my first act to<br>
appoint a special committee drawn from our affiliates to undertake<br>
that task.<br>
<br>
It would be a mistake, in my view, to rush to conclude that<br>
examination in a time of partisan politics. But with strong<br>
leadership I am confident we can reach agreement over how to bring<br>
about the restructuring of the Federation's governance mechanisms<br>
and make it an even more effective instrument in the service of<br>
America's working families. <br>
<br>
When all is said and done, however, it is not change in the<br>
inner workings of the AFL-CIO that is going to turn things around<br>
for the working men and women of this country or for the unions<br>
that represent them. It is the renewed dedication, the renewed<br>
energy of the men and women of this movement that will make the<br>
difference. <br>
<br>
The opportunities before us are endless. But the one sure<br>
means of squandering the possibility for renewal is to fall into<br>
factionalism. <br>
<br>
I am determined to do everything in my power not to allow that<br>
to happen. The working men and women who depend on this movement<br>
and the millions more who seek a genuine voice on the job require<br>
that we make common cause. I'm confident we can.<br>
<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p>Remarks of AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland<br>
at Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt<br>
Institute Awards Dinner<br>
Warm Springs, Georgia<br>
April 11, 1995<br>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate the opportunity to offer a few remarks on<br>
behalf of the many millions of Americans whose lives have<br>
been shaped in some way by Franklin Roosevelt. I am proud to<br>
be in their number.<br>
<br>
When I was a kid I spent a summer at a National Youth<br>
Administration vocational training camp named for Aubrey<br>
Williams, the NYA's director.<br>
<br>
It was Franklin Roosevelt's Merchant Marine Act of 1936<br>
-- expanding the American flag fleet -- that enabled me, a<br>
small town kid from South Carolina, to go to sea and learn<br>
that trade for a living.<br>
<br>
Included in that law was a special program to train<br>
merchant ships' officers. At the age of 18, I shipped out,<br>
under that program, as a cadet aboard a freighter named,<br>
appropriately enough, &quot;Liberator.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shortly after Pearl Harbor, at the age of 20, I became<br>
a mate on vessels carrying weapons and ammunition to various<br>
war zones. Trained officers were so scarce that I was a<br>
chief mate at age 21, and got my Master's ticket for command<br>
of vessels of any tonnage, on any ocean, when I turned 24.<br>
<br>
The wartime merchant marine was where I came of age. <br>
It was where I was educated and where I first became a trade<br>
unionist.<br>
<br>
I went on to spend the rest of my career in the<br>
movement that Franklin Roosevelt nourished and promoted with<br>
the proclamation of his belief &quot;in the right of workers to<br>
join unions and to protect their unions.&quot;<br>
<br>
You can imagine what that simple, declarative statement<br>
meant at the time to millions of wage-earning Americans who<br>
were struggling for that right.<br>
<br>
Today, those who would further limit trade union rights<br>
are fond of saying that unions &quot;may have been appropriate<br>
for the 1930s, but not for today.&quot;<br>
<br>
But, in the 30s, I saw the machine guns of my state's<br>
national guard around the cotton mills where workers were<br>
trying to organize. The business community didn't like<br>
unions any better then than they do today, and the state<br>
served the business commmunity. That's how I remember it.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, millions of courageous and steadfast<br>
working people -- encouraged by the President of the United<br>
States -- stuck their necks out for their unions, built<br>
their ladder into the middle class, and created a market<br>
that became the envy and target of the world.<br>
<br>
I would suggest that the benefits of this struggle have<br>
flowed not only to working people but to the corporate<br>
enterprises that have flourished in that market.<br>
<br>
The more fiercely the current debate rages about the<br>
appropriate role of the federal government in our society,<br>
the more clearly I remember a lot of things about our<br>
country before there was such a role -- when about all the<br>
federal government did was collect tariffs, run the post<br>
office and pay the military, rather poorly.<br>
<br>
I remember when there were county poorhouses out on the<br>
edge of town. That's where people went when they became too<br>
old or too sick to work. Then Social Security came and tore<br>
those poorhouses down -- freeing young and old alike of that<br>
specter.<br>
<br>
I remember when the rivers of my state ran brick-red<br>
from the erosion of farms and deforested uplands stripped by<br>
unregulated free enterprise. I remember when the topsoil of<br>
the Great Plains literally blew away -- turning thousands<br>
upon thousands of farm families into homeless nomads.<br>
<br>
Then came the tree-planting of the CCC and the farm<br>
programs of the New Deal. Today those rivers run black and<br>
clear and the Dust Bowl is but a distant memory. Free<br>
enterprises such as the paper, forest products and<br>
agribusiness industries shared abundantly in those<br>
government initiatives.<br>
<br>
I remember when rural homes were lit by kerosene. And<br>
then the REA electrified and humanized them, bridging the<br>
cultural gap between town and country -- and incidentally<br>
creating new markets for the appliance industry. <br>
<br>
I am proud to acknowledge that I am a child of Franklin<br>
Roosevelt's New Deal. But, then, every person alive today,<br>
regardless of age or previous condition, is an heir of the<br>
works of that great period in our nation's life.<br>
<br>
I do not and cannot forget those roots in the past. So<br>
today, if asked whether the label &quot;liberal&quot; or<br>
&quot;conservative&quot; or misanthrope fits, I can only respond that<br>
I am a New Dealer, pure and simple and unreconstructed.<br>
<br>
Thank you.</p>

<title>SP 03/29/95 Kirkland Industrial Union Department</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<p>Remarks of AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland<br>
to the Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO<br>
1995 Legislative Conference<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
March 29, 1995<br>
<br>
<br>
President Chatak, Secretary-Treasurer diCicco, brothers<br>
and sisters:<br>
<br>
I'm delighted to be back for your annual legislative<br>
conference.<br>
<br>
This year, as you well know, the situation is different<br>
than in years past.<br>
<br>
We're in the fight of our lives right now.<br>
<br>
The extreme right wing is driving the agenda in Congress. <br>
They are guided by an ideology that is almost 100 percent<br>
contrary to everything for which this labor movement has ever<br>
stood.<br>
<br>
The would turn the Gompers doctrine upside down. They<br>
are for more jails and less schoolhouses; more arsenals and<br>
less books; more vice and less learning; more greed and less<br>
leisure; more revenge and less justice.<br>
<br>
Now, they've got the gavel in both houses of Congress. <br>
And they've targeted nearly everything in government that<br>
smacks of the Great Society or the New Deal or even Teddy<br>
Roosevelt's agenda from the turn of the century.<br>
<br>
They talk about &quot;empowerment&quot; and &quot;opportunity.&quot; But you<br>
and I know that the only power they want to enhance is that<br>
which is already held by the privileged elements of our<br>
society. <br>
<br>
Despite their rhetoric, their agenda has nothing to do<br>
with giving power to the people. Rather, it is to give the<br>
business interests of this country more power than they've had<br>
since the days just prior to the Great Depression, when a full<br>
third of our nation was ill-housed, ill-clad and ill-<br>
nourished.<br>
<br>
They're looking to undermine virtually every gain our<br>
movement has championed for working people in this century. <br>
I'm talking about decent wages, secure retirement income,<br>
safer jobs and the right to an independent voice at the<br>
workplace -- a voice that can only be asserted by a real trade<br>
union.<br>
<br>
They want to throw it all away. And they want to do it<br>
quickly before the American people realize what's happening. <br>
That's what their &quot;Contract on America&quot; is all about. But<br>
that's not the full extent of it.<br>
<br>
If this new majority in Congress gets its way, you can<br>
say good-bye to the programs that have helped working<br>
Americans create a better and more decent society out of the<br>
market jungle that once claimed our land.<br>
<br>
At a time when 10,000 Americans are killed on the job<br>
each year, they say American business is &quot;over-regulated&quot; --<br>
so they're trying to strip the Occupational Health and Safety<br>
Administration of any real power and turn it into a<br>
&quot;consultant.&quot;<br>
<br>
They want to force welfare recipients to work, but they<br>
propose nothing that would create decent jobs for the<br>
underprivileged. Instead, they're looking to slash the<br>
programs that help provide food, housing and education to the<br>
least fortunate in our society.<br>
<br>
At a time of falling wages and growing job insecurity,<br>
they seek to repeal the prevailing wage laws, ship more jobs<br>
overseas and encourage &quot;contingent&quot; employment here in this<br>
country.<br>
<br>
This country has just recorded its highest monthly trade<br>
deficit in its history. U.S. exports are dropping, not<br>
rising, while imports continue to increase.<br>
<br>
Remember NAFTA and the huge market that would be open to<br>
U.S. exporters when Mexico dropped it tariffs? Well, those<br>
barriers were put right back up with the devaluation of the<br>
peso. And you know what happened? The trade surplus we had<br>
with Mexico in December became an $863 million trade deficit<br>
in January.<br>
<br>
Just like that. So much for the rosy projections of the<br>
NAFTA lobby.<br>
<br>
They may talk about helping working middle-class<br>
families. But you can be sure that members of the new<br>
majority in Congress will do everything they can to aid and<br>
abet corporate America's flight from our shores. And they'll<br>
do it while cutting the programs that help displaced workers<br>
train for new jobs.<br>
<br>
They're aiming their budget axe at defense conversion<br>
programs, as well. As far at they're concerned, government<br>
has no place rendering assistance to the working people who<br>
helped this country win the Cold War. Those workers can just<br>
go flip burgers, for all they care. <br>
<br>
Through their balanced budget amendment, they went after<br>
the Social Security system. Social Security -- probably the<br>
best and most successful federal program ever devised. This<br>
is a program that works. It is in surplus. It will remain in<br>
surplus for many years into the future.<br>
<br>
And yet, to listen to the members of the new majority in<br>
Congress, you'd think that nothing good ever came of any<br>
government program enacted in the last 60 years.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you, I remember what it was like before we<br>
had these programs. I remember the county poorhouses, where<br>
people were sent when they became too old to work for a<br>
living.<br>
<br>
I remember when the federal government had virtually no<br>
role at all in our society -- except, perhaps, to pay the<br>
military, run the Post Office and collect tariffs.<br>
<br>
I remember when the countryside was stripped of trees by<br>
the plundering of commercial interests without the restraint<br>
of law or environmental concerns -- when the rivers ran red<br>
with the runoff and the topsoil of the Great Plains literally<br>
blew away.<br>
<br>
I remember the days before there was a minimum wage. <br>
Today, we need a higher minimum wage, in order to ensure that<br>
America's lowest paid workers are able to earn enough to<br>
provide at least the barest essentials for themselves and<br>
their families.<br>
<br>
Now we have a majority leader of the House of<br>
Representatives who hates the minimum wage, who has always<br>
hated it, and has pledged to do away with the minimum wage.<br>
<br>
I remember company unions, too. And now, our adversaries<br>
are trying to bring those back.<br>
<br>
The working men and women of this country do not want to<br>
return to that era. But that's what lies ahead if we allow<br>
these ideologues to dismantle our government and turn the<br>
country over again to the tender mercies of corporate<br>
enterprise.<br>
<br>
The immediate threat to our movement does not end at the<br>
Capital Beltway. In state capitals across the country, new<br>
conservative majorities are advancing right-to-work and other<br>
anti-union proposals.<br>
<br>
Clearly, we've got to be active at all levels of<br>
government.<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, we face a major challenge -- the<br>
challenge of standing up for this country and defending<br>
everything our movement has ever done to build a decent<br>
society for working people and their families.<br>
<br>
We have a great deal of work to do. If working people<br>
ever needed their trade union movement to stand up for them,<br>
that time is now.<br>
<br>
We've got the resources to win this struggle. We've got<br>
dedicated and talented leaders. We've got good people here in<br>
Washington -- legislative and political representatives at all<br>
of our AFL-CIO affiliates -- who are working day and night to<br>
stand up to this onslaught.<br>
<br>
But our greatest strength is our members. The other side<br>
may have all the money in the world, but we've got more than<br>
13 million people out there -- 13 million people who,<br>
everyday, stick their neck out for a trade union. We have a<br>
level of vigor and commitment within our ranks that is<br>
unmatched anywhere in the world.<br>
<br>
And that resource does not stop there. Think of all the<br>
family members. They don't pay dues. They aren't counted on<br>
our membership rolls. But they're out there. If they're of<br>
age, they can vote and they can contact their elected<br>
representatives. We've got to reach them.<br>
<br>
Think of the retirees. They're ready to do their part,<br>
too.<br>
<br>
So our numbers do not stop with our dues-paying members. <br>
We've got a vast army out there. And we have to educate and<br>
mobilize them as never before.<br>
<br>
But we can't do it without your participation and<br>
support. The most effective lobbying program in the world<br>
won't work unless you are out there making it work at your<br>
locals and in your communities.<br>
<br>
It means working together -- with the AFL-CIO's regional<br>
COPE directors, who now serve as our legislative field arm,<br>
and through your state federations and central labor councils. <br>
We've got to strengthen our grass roots activism, educate our<br>
members about the threat facing working Americans, get them<br>
involved, and motivate them to join labor's campaign to stand<br>
up for working families.<br>
<br>
It means working with AFL-CIO Legislative Action<br>
Committees in targeted congressional districts and engaging in<br>
other grass roots activities designed to ensure that union<br>
members understand the issues and communicate their views to<br>
their elected representatives.<br>
<br>
In the early going, we've had some outstanding successes.<br>
<br>
We helped stop Congress from enacting a balanced budget<br>
amendment that would have devastated this country's economy.<br>
<br>
And, for the time being, we have staved off congressional<br>
attempts to kill the President's executive order banning<br>
government contractors from permanently replacing their<br>
workers.<br>
<br>
We have every right to be proud of these victories. But<br>
I would remind you that our winning margins were razor-thin,<br>
and we can be sure that the assault on worker rights will<br>
accelerate in the days ahead. <br>
<br>
Looking beyond the current right wing agenda in Congress,<br>
there's another reason to build and mobilize at the grass<br>
roots.<br>
<br>
One of the great things about this country is that<br>
elections are never permanent. In a couple of years, you<br>
always get another chance.<br>
<br>
I am convinced that our ongoing legislative field efforts<br>
can and will pay off in November of 1996. If trade unionists<br>
and their family members become the best-informed voters in<br>
the country by that time, I have no doubt that they will help<br>
turn the tide in Washington and elect a Congress that really<br>
cares about working people and is committed to making life<br>
better for them.<br>
<br>
We can elect a Congress that stands up for good jobs and<br>
for decent wages and benefits.<br>
<br>
We can elect a Congress that stands up for fair trade and<br>
refuses to sell out working people to the vagaries of<br>
international trade agreements like NAFTA and GATT.<br>
<br>
We can elect a Congress that stands up for safer<br>
workplaces and gets tough on employers who kill and injure<br>
their workers.<br>
<br>
And we can elect a Congress that stands up for the idea<br>
that the best way to maintain a safe and decent society is to<br>
enhance the freedom of working people to join independent<br>
trade unions.<br>
<br>
But first we have to stand up for working families --<br>
together, every affiliated union, in solidarity.<br>
<br>
That is the immediate goal of the AFL-CIO, and I know we<br>
can count on you for your active support and participation.<br>
<br>
Thank you, and best of luck to you all.</p>

<h2>Working But Poor In America</h2>
<p>Although they work, some 10 million Americans and their
families are still in poverty. Work should pay and people should
be able to stand on their own in society. </p>
<p>Something is wrong in a nation where there were 2.4 million
who worked year round at full-time jobs but lived in poverty in
1993. About 7.4 million poor people lived in a household
containing someone who was employed full time throughout the
year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. </p>
<p>It is unfair that people should work, but not be paid a living
wage that would pull them out of poverty. At a time when the
nation is wrestling with the question of reforming welfare and
forging policies that bridge the gap between dependence and work,
the fact is that, for millions, work does not allow them to
provide a decent standard of living for their families. </p>
<p>Three key reasons for the poverty of the working poor come
from a recent report of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS): </p>
<ol>
    <li>Low earnings: Low-wage work with below-poverty earnings
        was the biggest single cause of poverty. Low wages, low
        earnings, and low income trap millions of American
        working men and women in a vicious cycle of poverty.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Involuntary part-time work: If you want a full-time job
        and a full-time paycheck, but you can only find part-time
        work, the odds are high that you will fall below the
        poverty line. </li>
    <li>Unemployment: If you lose or can't find a job, if you
        suffer spells of unemployment, the odds are high that
        your total earnings and your total income are going to be
        low, and you will be in poverty. </li>
</ol>
<h4>40 Million In Poverty</h4>
<p>In 1993 there were almost 40 million Americans living in
poverty, the latest year for which there are official poverty
figures. This was 15.1 percent of the total population in U.S.
households. Children make up a big part of the total poverty
picture. There were 14.4 million children under the age of 16 who
were living in poverty, almost one in four of all children. </p>
<p>More than half (56 percent) of the people in poverty are in
working poor households. </p>
<p>The poverty lines in mid-1995 were as shown in the box nearby.
Poor people age 16 and over totaled 24.9 million in 1993. This
Census poverty count includes the sick and disabled, the elderly
poor, mothers with small children and other family
responsibilities, young people still in school, and people in
regular working ages up to 65 years. </p>
<h4>10.4 Million In Census Count</h4>
<p>The working poor numbered 10.4 million, according to the
Census Bureau. These are people who had at least some work during
the year. </p>
<p>It is not easy to relate personal earnings to poverty status
because poverty for the individual depends on family income and
family size. You could find a person earning the minimum wage who
would not be &thorn;poor&thorn; if he or she lived
alone&thorn;but would be poor as part of a family that depended
entirely on that person's income. A person earning the minimum
wage would earn $8,840 in a year, compared with the poverty level
of $7,934 for a one person family, but below the $15,580 poverty
level for a family of four. </p>
<p>A fundamental problem in U.S. society is that work often
doesn't pay enough to keep people out of poverty and supplements
in money or in kind are necessary in order for people to make
ends meet. Many jobs in our society pay less than the $7.49
hourly wage cited above as the hourly equivalent of the poverty
level for a family of four. Such jobs classified as retail trade
by the Labor Department include the following: </p>
<h4>Hourly Wage</h4>
<p>Variety store $7.30<br>
Retail bakeries $7.29<br>
Gasoline Service Stations $6.92 Women' clothing $6.99<br>
Record and prerecorded tape stores $6.34<br>
Eating and Drinking Places $5.57<br>
</p>
<p>The Working Poor include the following, according to the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: </p>
<ul>
    <li>20 percent of food-stamp recipients are from working poor
        households.<br>
    </li>
    <li>43 percent of children on Medicaid are from working poor
        families. </li>
</ul>
<p>About one in five homeless people have jobs and others who are
homeless have worked sometimes, according to the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development. </p>
<h4>8.2 Million Workers In BLS Count</h4>
<p>A recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report on the working poor
focuses on a more narrowly defined group, but provides more
detail than the Census Bureau does. </p>
<p>The BLS count on the working poor came out to 8.2 million. The
&thorn;working poor&thorn; were defined as persons who have
devoted 27 weeks or more to working or looking for work and who
lived in families with incomes below the official poverty
thresholds. </p>
<h4>Who Are The Working Poor?</h4>
<p>About 6 million of the 8.2 million working poor (73 percent)
are white. There are about an equal number of males and females,
4.1 million each. Black and Hispanic working poor are about equal
in number, 1.7 - 1.8 million. </p>
<p>Although whites represented the bulk of working poor in 1993,
blacks and Hispanics had higher poverty rates for persons in the
labor force most of the year. The black poverty rate was 13.9
percent and the Hispanic rate 16 percent. </p>
<h4>More Workers Have Low Earnings</h4>
<p>Workers with low earnings represented 12 percent of all
year-round, full-time civilian workers aged 16 and over in 1979.
That proportion had risen to 16 percent in 1992, according to the
Census Bureau, which uses a technical definition of low earnings
that results in a threshold slightly lower than the official
poverty rate. </p>
<p>Increases in the number of working poor and the worsening
poverty rates are due in large measure to the steady erosion of
wages in the U.S. </p>
<p>Unemployment and underemployment are factors. In July, 1995,
for example, there were 7.6 million unemployed, 1.6 million who
had unsuccessully searched for work and 4.4 million working
part-time but wanted full-time jobs for a total of 13.6 million
affected. The rise of low wage service jobs has paralleled the
decline in well-paying manufacturing jobs and the loss of jobs
due to trade. The U.S. has lost about 1 million well-paying
manufacturing and mining jobs since mid-1990. </p>
<p>There has been a big increase in contingent work, including
part-time and temporary often without decent benefits. The
restructuring of industry results in the displacement of about
1.5 million full-time workers each year. About three out of four
of such workers end up with lower wages or are otherwise worse
off due to the displacement. </p>
<p>Low wage workers (defined as those at the 10th percentile with
90 percent paid more) saw their real wages fall by 13 percent
between 1979 and 1993, according to the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities. While median workers suffered a smaller
decline, high wage workers saw their pay increase 5 percent over
that time, in dollars adjusted for inflation. </p>
<p>Pension coverage and health insurance also has fallen for
low-income workers. For example, pension coverage of the lowest
fifth of wage earners in the private sector fell from 18 percent
to around 13 percent between 1979 and 1989. Health insurance
coverage fell from 40 percent to 26 percent. </p>
<h4>Making Work Pay</h4>
<p>Making work pay would go a long way toward ending poverty. An
estimated 22 million in poverty&thorn;some 56 percent of the
poor&thorn;lived in households where someone worked during the
year, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. </p>
<p>While there is no panacea of poverty or the working poor,
there are a number of measures which would make a big difference.
It has always been true that a single employee is helpless in
dealing with an employer and that if the employer refuses to pay
him fair wages, he is nevertheless unable to leave the employer
and resist arbitrary and unfair treatment. Workers need unions in
order to deal on the basis of equality with employers. </p>
<p>Strengthening of labor laws and collective bargaining empower
individuals to have a voice in the workplace and to negotiate
improved wages and working conditions. This is especially
important to low wage workers in the service sector and to low
wage workers who often lack health insurance and pension
benefits. </p>
<p>National policies, including trade policies, aimed at
preserving high wage jobs such as in manufacturing can help.
Policies that protect wage standards, such as prevailing wage
requirements at the national and state levels help to maintain
living standards. Union training and apprenticeship programs
represent gateways for workers to better pay and higher skill
jobs. </p>
<p>The minimum wage should be increased. The minimum wage has
fallen well behind average wages. The annual income of minimum
wage workers was sufficient to maintain a family of 3 at about
the poverty line in 1980. The current wage of $4.25 represents
annual earnings of $8,840 (assuming 52 weeks at 40 hours per
week), which falls $3,350 below the estimated 1995 poverty line
for a family of three. </p>
<p>The minimum wage would have to be raised to $5.86 per hour for
a family of 3 to again reach the poverty level. Employment and
training programs can help, but they are threatened by the
draconian Republican budget cuts, which will decimate domestic
programs by up to 30 percent over the next seven years. Such
programs are important because they help individuals qualify for
better jobs and higher incomes. </p>
<p>Threats to safety-net programs, including Medicaid, Food
Stamps, Welfare, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the like, will
only worsen the situation of the poor and make it harder for
people to rise from poverty. </p>
<p>Tax policy should be progressive so that those higher up on
the income scale pay proportionally more and those at the lower
income rungs less. Organized labor has supported the Earned
Income Tax Credit, which has helped low income workers, but the
benefits of the credit are not a total solution to the problem of
the working poor. The EITC also allows employers to evade the
responsibility to provide their workers with a living wage and
shifts their employment costs to taxpayers generally. </p>
<p>Education is a traditional pathway to upward mobility.
Assaults on the public sector and public education and cuts in
education programs at all levels of government make it harder for
citizens to get a good education and achieve a higher standard of
living. </p>

<h2>HOUSING AND THE AMERICAN DREAM, UNIONS HAVE A ROLE<br>
SO DOES GOVERNMENT</h2>
<p>The American Dream of home ownership is slipping from the
grasp of working people. Decent and affordable apartments in
locations near to work and the amenities of life are also harder
to find. The 1980's and 1990's have seen the rise of homeless
populations. Housing prices have skyrocketed, propelled by rising
land prices and soaring mortgage interest rates. The pay of
working people hasn't kept up. </p>
<p>Average weekly earnings of private nonagricultural workers
fell by 12.2 percent between 1979 and 1994, in dollars adjusted
for inflation. </p>
<p>Roughly 30 years ago in 1967, average weekly earnings of $104
for a worker about matched the $146 average monthly payment
required to buy a typical new home. By 1995, the required monthly
house payment ballooned to $969, while average weekly earnings
were only $398. Working people have seen well-paying
manufacturing jobs shipped overseas. They have seen jobs
destroyed by corporate downsizing. Good jobs have been lost due
to defense cutbacks. Many jobs have become part-time or
contingent without pensions and health insurance. Many jobs have
been replaced by low-paying service jobs. </p>
<p>These developments have made it hard to maintain a decent
standard of living, including shelter. </p>
<h4>Running To Catch Up</h4>
<p>Home buyers aren't the only ones to suffer. In the early
1970s, a family needed about a fourth of income for gross rent,
including fuel, utilities, property taxes and insurance. It now
takes over 30 percent of income, on average, to find an
apartment. </p>
<p>Stagnating incomes and high prices were reflected in constant
rates of home ownership during the 1980s&thorn;around 65 percent
of all households owning homes. Older workers with
well-established careers have often been able to buy homes
earlier in life. Younger workers, however, caught in the squeeze
of falling living standards, haven't been so lucky. Households
whose heads were in their early 30's&thorn;when most families buy
or have bought&thorn;for example, saw their ownership rate fall
from 57 percent in 1982 to about 51 percent in 1994. </p>
<p>While young people are not able to buy a home, they are also
being squeezed out of rental apartments. There was a rough
correspondence between low rent units and low income renters in
the early 1970s, about 7 million each. By 1993, however, the
number of low rent units fell to 6.5 million and the number of
low income renters jumped to 11.2 million, leaving an enormous
gap of 4.7 million. The Federal government has played an
important role in housing, beginning with public housing and
encouraging home ownership through the Federal Housing
Administration in the 1930s and Veterans housing in the postwar
era. The government has, in recent years, however, stepped back
from its commitment to augment the supply of affordable housing
at the low end of the income scale. Budget authority for the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, for example, fell by
about two-thirds in dollars adjusted for inflation, from about
$70 billion in 1977 to less than $20 billion in 1994, according
to the Congressional Budget Office. New commitments for renters
and for new construction rental units fell accordingly. In 1977,
the Federal government helped supply about 250,000 new units of
affordable rental units. That number fell to under 50,000 per
year by the early 1980s and has stayed there ever since, despite
the growing need for affordable housing. The annual budget
process has put a squeeze on housing assistance and things have
been especially tough since the advent of the Republican congress
in 1994. The House appropriations bill has slashed HUD's budget
by 25 percent for fiscal 1996. The Administration, meanwhile, has
advocated a reorganization of HUD which will consolidate numerous
programs and cut HUD staffing by 4,400 by the year 2000. HUD's
staff will have been cut by 56 percent between 1980 and 2000
under this plan. </p>
<h4>The Role Of Unions In Housing</h4>
<p>Labor unions have over the years striven to provide decent and
affordable housing to members and retirees. Those working under
union contracts are more able to earn the income needed to
provide decent housing for their families. Unions have also
supported government programs improving housing for the
community, including poor people in public housing, the elderly
and disabled, lower income renters and those aspiring to home
ownership. In addition, unions have formed non-profits to develop
affordable housing. Union community services have improved the
housing of those displaced by natural disasters and by
unemployment. The AFL-CIO Department of Community Services in
conjunction with Habitat for Humanity International has worked in
several cities, using volunteer union labor to improve low income
housing. Union members have contributed their skills as
volunteers to build homeless shelters. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO pension investment program directs union pension
funds into union-built homes, apartments and nursing facilities.
The AFL-CIO Housing and Building Investment Trusts funded over
$500 million in housing and commercial development in 1994, with
total assets reaching $1.3 billion. The Trusts increased housing,
stimulated commercial development and generated employment that
improved the quality of life for union workers and their
neighbors. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO Union Privilege Benefit Program sponsors a home
purchase program as a membership benefit for members of
affiliated unions. Union members get home loans through the
program. Negotiated Housing Trusts that make it possible for
members to become home owners are matters of collective
bargaining pursuant to a change in the Taft-Hartley Law. </p>
<p>Unions are attempting to play a role working with the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, in providing
affordable housing in federal Empowerment Zones to promote home
ownership for working people and to help renew these transitional
areas of cities. </p>
<h4>Government Has A Part To Play </h4>
<p>These efforts need to continue and be expanded. However, they
are not enough. Government has a vital part to play. The efforts
of unions to provide housing can be overwhelmed either by
monetary policy that hikes interest rates and ups mortgage
payments beyond the reach of home buyers or by the proposed
draconian cuts in housing assistance. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO has urged that the federal role in housing not be
lost or diminished in plans for the reorganization of federal
housing programs and in the congressional budget. Monetary policy
must also balance the need for jobs and affordable housing
against containing inflation. </p>
<p>There is a continuing need for federal aid for housing in view
of homelessness and the plight of the cities. Federal programs
should not be slashed and eliminated as proposed in budget
resolutions and other congressional measures. The FHA and
Veterans programs need to continue to help meet housing needs as
they have in the past. </p>
<h4>Need For A Revitalized Housing Program</h4>
<p>One way to revitalize housing programs is to pay for it in
part by earmarking part of the tax receipts that could be
obtained by reducing the mortgage amount on which interest is
deductible to $300,000 from $1 million. A cap at the $300,000
level would generate $35 billion over five years. </p>
<p>In recent years there has been a steady shift in Federal
assistance away from new construction in favor of using existing
housing. In many places, however, there isn't enough existing low
income housing. Federal, state, and local assistance should be
increased for new construction of public housing and basic
housing aid for the elderly and disabled. </p>
<p>Project-based assistance should not be entirely replaced by
tenant vouchers or certificates, since project aid enhances the
financial basis for assisted apartment projects. Further, the
tenant based assistance for public housing projects threaten the
financial basis of public housing authorities, to the extent that
units are left vacant. </p>
<p>Plans to consolidate federal programs and to devolve them to
states and localities should not mean the loss of a Federal role
or national standards, such as civil rights, the environment,
targeting to lower income people and prevailing wage
requirements. The Davis-Bacon Act is an important labor
protection that should be preserved. </p>
<p>While block grants for housing and for community development
provide greater flexibility, there is the danger that particular
targeted needs and programs are lost and funds are harmfully cut
below levels prevailing before the consolidations took place.
Local union oversight and greater citizen participations are
needed to see that government funds are spent wisely. </p>
<p>HUD program consolidations should take into due regard the
interests of employees. For example, if the Federal Housing
Administration is made into a government corporation, there
should be provision to protect the interests of present
employees. </p>
<h4>Housing A Basic Need</h4>
<p>Housing is an important element of the economy. It provides,
first and foremost, shelter. Everyone needs shelter, a place of
protection and nurture. Increasingly, many are finding it
difficult to achieve the American dream of decent housing. The
nation needs a rededication of the national commitment to good
and affordable housing. </p>

<h2>Minimum Wage Issue Paper</h2>
<p>Prepared by Iain Gold, AFL-CIO Economic Research Department </p>
<p>For original copy write to AFL-CIO Publication and Materials
Office </p>
<p>Let's put the &quot;fair&quot; back in Fair Labor Standards
Act and take the &quot;minimum&quot; out of the Minimum Wage. </p>
<p>President Clinton has called for a 90-cent adjustment in the
minimum wage over the next two years. While the increase in the
minimum wage to $5.15 two years from now is a step in the right
direction, it is still below the historical purchasing power of
the minimum wage. The Clinton administration proposal partially
restores the purchasing power of the minimum wage, after the
90-cent adjustment, the minimum wage would still be 14% below its
1979 level of purchasing power. </p>
<p>The high point of the purchasing power of the minimum wage, in
1968, translates to a minimum wage of $6.29 per hour today. The
historical level of the minimum wage (50 percent of the average
hourly earnings) calls for a minimum wage of $5.69 an hour today.
Over the last 15 years, prices have eroded the minimum wage by 26
percent, and by 11 percent since 1991 (the last time the minimum
wage was increased). </p>
<p>In 1994 there were 4.1 million hourly workers who were paid
the minimum wage or less which represents 6.2 percent of all
workers paid on an hourly basis. These estimates are conservative
as this total does not include all the salaried workers with
trumped up titles such as &quot;assistant manager&quot; or
&quot;management trainee&quot; who, because of long hours, are
often paid at the minimum wage rate or less. </p>
<p>Individuals who are employed at the minimum wage can be
characterized by their strong work ethic as they work even though
their low wage jobs do not provide enough earnings or income for
a decent standard of living. </p>
<p>Adopting a higher minimum wage is the most straight forward
&quot;program&quot; to help the &quot;working poor.&quot; An
increase in the minimum wage is good policy and it is supported
by the vast majority of Americans. </p>
<h4>Fair Labor Standards Act</h4>
<p>The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) first set a minimum wage
of 25 cents an hour when passed by Congress in 1938. The federal
policy behind the national minimum wage was and still is to
assure &quot;the maintenance of the minimum standard of living
necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of
workers.&quot; </p>
<p>Congress last voted to raise the minimum wage in 1989 to its
current level of $4.25 an hour effective April 1, 1991 (with an
interim step of $3.80 in 1990). The minimum wage remained static
at $3.35 an hour from 1981 to 1990, despite the fact that the
cost-of-living increased 46 percent. Yet the adjustment in the
minimum wage to $3.80 amounted to only a 13 percent increase. </p>
<p>The underlying intent of the FLSA was to make work rewarding
and thus encourage individuals to earn a living on their own.
However, the continuing decline in real wages for the large
majority of workers, coupled with the growing wage gap between
the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; is a concern for
all Americans. Low-wage workers (bottom 10 percent) have seen
their real wages drop by 13 percent from 1979 to 1993, while the
top 10 percent of workers have seen their real wages increase 5
percent over the same time period. Working at $4.25 an hour is
neither rewarding nor does it provide a minimum standard of
living for health, efficiency, and general well-being for the
vast majority of workers. </p>
<h4>Set the Minimum Wage to 50% of Private Sector Average</h4>
<p>Between 1960 and 1980, the United States Congress tried to
provide a minimum wage roughly equal to 50 percent of average
hourly earnings. In the 20 years from 1961 to 1981, the Congress
adjusted the minimum wage 11 times, averaging 51 percent of
average hourly earnings. Over the last 14 years, the minimum wage
was adjusted only twice and has failed to recapture lost ground.
In fact, the minimum wage is now, as a proportion of the average
hourly wage, at its lowest levels ever. </p>
<p>Fairness to the working poor demands that the federal minimum
wage should be not less than 50 percent of average hourly
earnings of non-supervisory workers and production workers in
non-farm private industry. If this adjustment were automatic,
then the minimum wage worker would get an increase when everyone
else got one, creating a steady relationship between wages of
workers in general. For this reason, the federal minimum wage
should automatically be adjusted to the private industry hourly
earnings. Poverty on Minimum Wage Pay </p>
<p>Nearly 40 million people lived in poverty in the United States
in 1993, most of the poor were children (according to the most
recent Census data). That figure represents 15 percent of the
entire US population. More striking is that of the 11.6 million
persons in the labor force below the poverty level, 8.2 million
were employed at some time during the year, with 4.7 million of
them usually working full-time. The number of families in poverty
totaled 4.2 million despite the fact that one or more members
participated in the labor force. Low earnings were cited as the
single largest factor contributing to poverty for full-time
workers. In fact, 7 out of 10 of the &quot;working poor&quot;
experienced low earnings with the others suffering from
unemployment spells, or curtailed hours of work. </p>
<p>The annual income of minimum wage workers was sufficient to
maintain a family of three above the poverty line -- in 1980. The
current level of the minimum wage $4.25, represents annual
earnings of $8,840 which falls $3,350 below the estimated 1995
poverty line for a family of three. This wage is clearly not a
living wage. Firms that pay their workers at the minimum wage
often have some of their workers living in poverty. Consequently,
to survive they must utilize public assistance programs such as
earned income tax credit (EITC), leaving taxpayers to make up the
difference between the real cost of living and the minimum wage. </p>
<p>The EITC provides a federal subsidy, in the form of a tax
credit, to low income working families until their annual income
reaches a certain amount. Thus, an increase in the minimum wage,
which has the effect of increasing family incomes higher,
benefits the US taxpayer. As it is now, the taxpayers are
subsidizing inefficient businesses that are profiting from paying
less than a fair wage. Republicans calling for a smaller
government should embrace an increase in the minimum wage with
open arms, as it forces the private sector to fulfill its
responsibilities. </p>
<p>The minimum wage is not a poverty program. It was designed as
a wage floor that would ensure that an individual working
full-time could maintain a minimal standard of living. The
minimum wage is based on work performed not family needs.
However, when earnings fail to cover the costs of day to day
survival, public assistance programs are needed. Those talking of
welfare reform and workfair programs have too little to say about
a fair minimum wage. Welfare reform without a real minimum wage
is short term political pandering and an act of cruelty. We need
to make work rewarding by making sure that all jobs pay a living
wage. As workers earn more money they will be able to purchase
more increasing aggregate demand which is good for the economy in
general. A higher minimum wage is an important measure to reward
work and provide real incentive to choose work over welfare. </p>
<h4>Who gets paid the minimum wage?</h4>
<p>An increase in the minimum wage would affect the 4.1 million
workers earning the minimum wage and an additional 2.6 million
workers who earn between $4.26 and $4.69 and 5.8 million workers
who earn between $4.70 and $5.14 an hour. Thus, 12.6 million
hourly workers would be directly affected by an increase in the
minimum wage under the Clinton administration proposal. </p>
<p>Contrary to popular opinion, minimum wage earners are not
predominantly teenagers, according to the latest BLS figures. An
estimated 87 percent of all people currently earning the minimum
wage are adults aged 18 or older. Sixty-nine percent of all
people currently earning the minimum wage are 20 years or older.
Thus an increase in the minimum wage along the lines of the
Clinton proposal would predominantly affect working adults. </p>
<p>Women are especially hurt by a low minimum wage. Women
represent 2.6 million or 62 percent of all hourly workers who are
paid the minimum wage or lower. </p>
<p>The current minimum wage disproportionately discriminates
against minorities. Hispanic persons make up 9 percent of the
labor force yet, people of Hispanic origin make up 15 percent of
all workers earning $4.25 or less. Blacks make up 12 percent of
civilian labor force yet blacks constitute 14 percent of minimum
wage earners. These figures indicate that minorities are
represented disproportionately among minimum wage earners. If all
groups were to be similarly affected, there would be parity
between the labor force participation percent and the percent
earning the minimum wage. </p>
<h4>Unemployment Effects?</h4>
<p>The age old myth--that an increase in the minimum wage causes
an increase in unemployment-- has been challenged by a number of
recent studies. Three separate studies, conducted by Princeton
Economists David Card and Alan Krueger, examining the 1988
increase in California's minimum wage, the 1990 and 1991
increases in the federal minimum wage and the 1992 increase in
New Jersey's minimum wage, are at the forefront of the current
research. In each case, the anticipated positive effect of an
increase in the minimum wage--the increase in wages of low-wage
workers--was observed. However, much to the researchers surprise,
the anticipated negative effect--an increase in jobless--was not
observed. These results have not only shaken the foundation of
conventional economic models but also rekindled the debate over
the employment effects of the minimum wage. The mounting evidence
suggests that there may not be adverse employment effects
associated with an increase in the minimum wage. </p>
<p>Robert M. Solow, a Nobel Laureate in economics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sums up the current debate
well &quot;[T]he main thing about (minimum wage) research is that
the evidence of job loss is weak. And the fact that the evidence
is weak suggest that the impact on jobs is small.&quot; Social
Effects of Low Minimum Wage </p>
<p>Business and the economy generally suffer when low-wage
workers do not have enough income and buying power to maintain a
minimum quality of living. </p>
<p>In addition, there are negative social effects when the
minimum wage is too low- older children may work to raise a
family income when they need to stay in school. Child care is too
costly for low-wage workers and so they may leave
&quot;latch-key&quot; children at home unsupervised. Minimum wage
workers for the most part receive no health care benefits. This
creates disincentive for low wage jobs as it proves more
beneficial to stop working in order to remain eligible for
Medicaid. </p>
<p>When only low wage jobs are available, crime and anti-social
behavior become tempting alternatives to paid jobs. In an age
where &quot;family values&quot; is a political issue, it is
ironic that some Republicans are advocating the repeal of the
minimum wage, causing more and more parents to work two or three
jobs spending more hours away from the home just in order to
provide basic necessities for their families. </p>
<h4>State Minimum Wage Laws</h4>
<p>The FLSA minimum wage applies to most businesses that are
engaged in interstate commerce. The FLSA provides that the state
minimum wage laws will be controlling--even for jobs that
traditionally fall under federal jurisdiction--if the state
minimum wage is higher than the federal minimum. </p>
<p>There are now ten jurisdictions that have extended to their
citizens minimum wage requirements higher than the $4.25 per hour
available under federal law. Those jurisdictions are: Alaska,
Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Iowa, New Jersey,
Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. </p>
<p>Massachusetts will become the eleventh jurisdiction as the
House and Senate overrode the veto of Gov. Weld (R). The bill
which was passed on Oct. 24, the 57th anniversary of the federal
minimum wage, increases the state minimum wage to $5.25 per hour
by 1997. </p>
<p>Despite the overwhelming support of the American people the
federal minimum wage is approaching its lowest levels in terms of
purchasing power and percent of the average non-supervisory
hourly wage. </p>
<h4>Who Supports an Increase in the Minimum Wage</h4>
<p>The majority of the American people favor an increase in the
minimum wage. A Time/CNN poll conducted January 25-26, 1995 found
that 78 percent favor increasing the minimum wage and 20 percent
oppose it. An NBC poll conducted January 25, 1995 also found 78
percent in favor with 18 percent opposed. A recent Gallup poll
(February, 1995) further supports that the public strongly backs
raising the minimum wage, with 77 percent in favor of the
increase while 21 percent oppose it. </p>
<p>The Gallup poll shows that females (83 percent) and non-whites
(88 percent), overwhelmingly favor an increase in the minimum
wage to $5.15 over two years. Interestingly enough, 68 percent of
those who classified themselves as conservatives favor an
increase, while 83 percent of moderates and 84 percent of
liberals also favored an increase. In any case, regardless of
political ideology, a majority of those polled favor an increase
in the minimum wage. </p>
<p>The last minimum wage increase received bipartisan support and
was passed by votes of 382 to 37 (135 Republicans supporting) in
the House and 89 to 8 in the Senate (36 Republicans supporting)
and was supported by both Senator Dole (Ka-R) and Rep. Gingrich
(Ga-R). However, despite the minimum wage being near all time
lows in terms of historical levels and purchasing power, the
Republican majority has come out against another increase in the
minimum wage. </p>
<p>It's time for Congress to listen to the will of the American
people.</p>

<pre>AFL-CIO Reviews the Issues                          Report No. 83
                                                       June, 1995
</pre>
<h2>TRASHING THE CPI</h2>
<h3>What Is the Consumer Price Index?</h3>
<p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the nation's best known and
most widely used barometer of inflation. For most people, the
&quot;inflation rate&quot; is the percentage increase in prices
as measured by the CPI. </p>
<p>Basically CPI is constructed by taking a reading of the
&quot;market basket&quot; of consumer purchases at a particular
time period and then repricing the contents every month. </p>
<p>The basket is updated about every ten years. Periodic
revisions are needed so as to take account of population shifts,
changes in what people buy, and to eliminate other discrepancies
that may creep into the index over time. </p>
<p>The market basket in use today reflects average consumer
purchases over the years 1982-84 and went into effect January
1987. The next update is scheduled for January 1998 and will
represent average purchases for 1993-95. </p>
<p>Today's CPI is a complex and sophisticated instrument,
produced under exacting standards and tight deadlines. Every
month the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects some 80,000 price
quotations in 21,000 retail and service establishments in 85
areas around the country. An additional 40,000 landlords or
tenants and 20,000 home owners are surveyed in regard to housing
costs. </p>
<h4>Origin of CPI</h4>
<p>The CPI dates back to World War I, when it was first developed
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for use in adjusting wartime
wages for shipyard workers. Coverage was later expanded to a
national basis and calculated back to 1913 (its official starting
point). </p>
<p>CPI-W. The original CPI survives today as the Consumer Price
Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W),
covering about 32 percent of the population. </p>
<p>CPI-U. A broader index was started in January 1978 for All
Urban Consumers (CPI-U), covering about 80 percent of the
population. In addition to the traditional wage-earner/clerical
group, this index also includes retired, unemployed,
self-employed, professional and supervisory workers. CPI-U is the
index used to mark the general inflation rate. </p>
<h4>CPI and Wages </h4>
<p>CPI-W is the index generally used in collective bargaining.
Contracts often include a specific COLA (&quot;cost-of-living
adjustment&quot;) clause automatically tying wage increases to
increased prices. Or price index rises may simply be factored
into an overall package at the time of agreement. </p>
<p>Formal COLAs are popular when inflation rates are high but
interest falls off in times of low inflation, such as at present.
COLAs can become a &quot;cap&quot; on wage adjustments, and may
not even produce full recovery of living cost increases. </p>
<p>In 1994, COLA clauses were in effect for less than a quarter
of the 5.4 million wage earners covered by major collective
bargaining contracts in private industry. COLAs are rarely used
in public employment, although, as in the private sector, living
cost increases indirectly enter into wage and salary
determinations. </p>
<h4>CPI for Retirement and Disability Benefits </h4>
<p>Today the most widespread use of formal COLAs is in the
automatic adjustment of social security benefits each year.
Indexing also applies in other Federal programs for retired and
disabled workers and their dependents and survivors. </p>
<p>The largest group--social security--numbers nearly 43 million.
About 4 million people receive payments under the Federal
government's retirement and disability systems for its own
civilian and military employees. </p>
<p>Several million people get means-tested benefits. Over 6
million (including 2.5 million social security beneficiaries)
qualify for Supplementary Security Income (SSI) for aged, blind,
and disabled persons. Veterans' pensions and compensation (also
means-tested) go to about 3.4 million. </p>
<p>Legislation to index social security benefits was enacted in
1972 and became effective in 1974. Federal employee retirement
indexation had started earlier. </p>
<p>Indexing of social security benefits (with CPI-W) was designed
to produce fairness in benefit increases and to insulate the
program from political pressures. President Richard Nixon put it
this way in 1969: <quote> &quot;The way to prevent future unfairness
is to attach the benefit schedule to the cost of living...We
remove questions about future years; we do much to remove this
system from biennial politics; and we make fair treatment of
beneficiaries a matter of certainty rather than a matter of
hope.&quot; </p>
<p>The indexing system is a vital adjunct to the &quot;safety
net&quot; for American workers and their families. When working
years are over, pensioners are not usually in a position to
recover living cost increases in other ways. </p>
<p>Private industry retirement and disability systems almost
never provide inflation adjustments--and indeed count on social
security to do it. For six out of ten workers in private
industry, social security is their only pension. </p>
<h4>A Special Index for the Elderly?</h4>
<p>Past proposals to create a special CPI for the older
population have failed of enactment, but one outcome was a series
of studies by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to show what such an
index would look like. </p>
<p>The most recent study is consistent with earlier ones. It
shows that an index generated for the population age 62 and over
moves up more than either CPI-W or CPI-U. From December 1987 to
December 1993, the rise in the special index averaged .3 percent
more per year than CPI-U and .4 percent more than CPI-W. The
difference mainly reflects the larger portion of older people's
outlays that goes for out-of-pocket medical care expenses. </p>
<h4>A New Use for COLAs: Federal Income Taxes </h4>
<p>In 1985 federal income taxes were tied to the annual inflation
rate, as registered by CPI-U. Escalation applies to tax brackets,
personal exemption amounts, and standard deductions.
Additionally, the Earned Income Tax Credit (designed for the
&quot;working poor&quot;) comes under its own indexing provisions
for credit amounts. </p>
<h4>COLAs and the Federal Budget</h4>
<p>Indexation of Federal benefits and income taxes naturally
attracts the attention of would-be budget cutters. </p>
<p>Total budget outlays in 1994 came to $1.5 trillion, of which
indexed benefits accounted for about 30 percent. Individual
income taxes, all subject to indexing, produced $543 billion in
1994, or 40 percent of all budget receipts. </p>
<h4>Political Pressure on the Price Index</h4>
<p>If social security benefits are supposed to be off-limits to
politics, another approach is to change the price index so that
it will go up less. </p>
<p>The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, has
frequently complained that CPI &quot;overstates inflation.&quot;
At hearings on January 10 of this year, he offered estimates of
the &quot;overstatement&quot;: namely, from .5 to 1.5 percentage
points per year. He invited Congress to select a number in this
range and reduce the inflation rate accordingly. (In later
hearings he proposed that Congress establish a special Commission
to set the adjustment each year.) </p>
<p>Illustrations of possible budget savings were provided by the
Federal Reserve staff. If, for example, the rate were reduced by
1 percentage point, the annual level of the deficit would be
lower by about $55 billion after five years, with cumulative
five-year savings of about $150 billion. </p>
<p>Chairman Greenspan urged speedy action because the effects
cumulate over time. (Each year a benefit is cut, the base is
lowered for calculating next year's adjustment.) </p>
<p>Congress could, of course, simply mandate an arbitrary cut in
the CPI rate for benefit and tax purposes. Greenspan, however,
provides a technical rationale--which makes it politically easier
to do. A mere &quot;correction&quot; in faulty measurements
absolves Congress from responsibility and mutes the objections of
those who would be injured. </p>
<p>But Greenspan may have opened up a can of worms. </p>
<p>In the first place, the technical grounds upon which his claim
rests are weak to non-existent. </p>
<p>Second, any &quot;mismeasurements&quot; in the CPI and its
component subindexes feed directly into a host of other
government statistics and private sector uses. Collective
bargaining negotiations and commercial contracts are affected.
Government numbers on national output, worker productivity, the
&quot;poverty line&quot; and trends in family income are among
those using CPI-U or its components. The whole statistical
edifice is undermined, not just the programs Greenspan wants to
target for savings to the federal budget. </p>
<h4>Is the CPI Really &quot;Overstated&quot;?</h4>
<p>The CPI is as reliable a measure of price inflation as the
&quot;state of the art&quot; permits. Research may lead to
further improvements, but no index can ever reach perfection. </p>
<p>There are both understatements and overstatements of price
change in the CPI, which largely cancel out. </p>
<p>The staff backup paper for Greenspan's claim presents a range
of .4 (not .5) to 1.5 percentage points per year. </p>
<p>At the outset, it should be noted that certain items have
already been taken into account in BLS price measurements--or
will be by the time the new market basket goes into effect. (They
involve computation glitches discovered by BLS itself.) If these
items are subtracted from the Fed totals, the Fed's overall range
shrinks to .1 at the minimum to 1.0 at the maximum. </p>
<p>The Fed estimates start at zero--with no allowance for
negative numbers to represent understatements. So the result is a
one-way upward street. </p>
<p>The maximums are estimated &quot;upper bounds&quot; on the
largest conceivable degrees of overstatement that might be
present. They are broad brush and thinly based, including
extension of small amounts of unreliable or conjectural data to
large areas of the index. </p>
<h4>The &quot;True Cost of Living&quot; Argument</h4>
<p>For the minimum, the remaining item of .1 (included as .2 for
the maximum) is the possible divergence of the CPI from a
&quot;true cost-of living index.&quot; &quot;Bias&quot; is said
to exist because the CPI uses price changes for a fixed market
basket. This does not allow for alternative lower-priced
purchases consumers may make when prices rise for particular
products, and thus keep down their living costs. A
&quot;true&quot; cost of living index would include allowance for
such substitutions. </p>
<p>While this view is accepted by many economists, there is no
way &quot;substitution bias&quot; can actually be measured for an
ongoing index--if indeed it exists at all. The effect can only be
inferred through studies of past index behavior. </p>
<p>Even the theoretical bias is erased when a new market basket
is put into place (until presumably it starts to build up again.)
Consumer price indexes throughout the world use a &quot;fixed
market basket&quot; in their calculations of price change. </p>
<p>What degree of satisfaction is lost for consumers who trade
down from steak to hamburger? Is the purchase of a used car
really as satisfactory as a new car when new car sticker prices
jump? </p>
<p>In any case many consumers at the lowest income levels really
don't have much room to &quot;trade down.&quot; They would
include many recipients of such Federal benefits as social
security, SSI, and veterans pensions. </p>
<h4>Quality Adjustment. </h4>
<p>&quot;Overstatement&quot; is said to occur because of failure
to make enough allowance for improvement in the quality of
products on the market. The Fed counts this as .3 for the
maximum. </p>
<p>Currently, BLS has several different ways of handling quality
change, although some items present especially difficult problems
to which answers are not really known. </p>
<p>The Fed authors rely on a single study for &quot;consumer
durables&quot; suggesting overstatement by as much as 1.5 points
per year. The 1.5 figure is then extended to goods covering
nearly a quarter of the index--household appliances, lawn
equipment and power tools, clothing, automobiles (both new and
used), airline fares, medical care, and entertainment
commodities. </p>
<p>Totally ignored are the quality adjustments BLS already makes
for such important products as automobiles and clothing. New car
prices, for example, would have come out 80 percent higher over
the 1967-94 period without BLS changes. Particularly since no
allowance is made for understatements, the Fed's .3 maximum
carries no credibility. </p>
<h4>New Products</h4>
<p>There are many problems with accounting for new products in
the index, such as the definition of &quot;new,&quot; and timing
of introduction into the index. </p>
<p>In the absence of actual data, the Fed authors constructed an
&quot;upper bound&quot; estimate of .5 by making what they admit
are &quot;some rather extreme assumptions&quot; for household
appliances, lawn and power tools, and drugs. It is simply assumed
that the prices of these items decline at the rate of 20 percent
per year! </p>
<p>This estimate boils down to conjecture rather than a serious
number. </p>
<p>New goods are not ignored in present BLS procedures--and
improvements are scheduled for the upcoming general index
revision. </p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The Consumer Price Index is an enormously important statistic
--one of the linchpins of our entire system of federal
statistics. It is of crucial importance that its computation be
free of political pressures. </p>
<p>While the AFL-CIO and its predecessor unions have not always
agreed with BLS technical determinations, labor has supported the
function of the Bureau as an independent source of expertise and
authority on price and labor statistics. The BLS technical work
should not be overridden either by direct Congressional fiat or
by any type of special Commission. </p>
<p>The claim by Chairman Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board
CPI is &quot;overstated&quot; by .5 to 1.5 percentage points per
year does not hold water. It is just as likely that CPI is
understating inflation as overstating it. </p>
<p>The higher rate of inflation for the population age 62 and
over makes rate cuts for Federal benefit programs particularly
unjustified. </p>
<p>The attack on the CPI is clearly an effort to produce a
politically easy way to create savings for the Federal budget.
without regard to other consequences. It should be firmly
rejected in favor of continued work by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics to produce the most accurate and solidly based numbers
possible. </p>

<p>Who wouldn't prefer a tax so simple that you could fill out
your return on a postcard, and so fair that every loophole on the
books today would be closed? These are just two of many claims
about the flat tax made by its advocates. In reality, the flat
tax would be neither simple nor fair. It would create a double
standard in which workers&thorn; hard-earned wages and salaries
are taxed, while the interest, dividends and capital gains
received primarily by the wealthy are not taxed directly at all.
The flat tax would be a bad deal for everyone making less than
$200,000 per year. </p>
<p>According to Treasury Department estimates, a &quot;revenue
neutral&quot; flat tax (one which neither gains nor loses
revenues compared with the current personal and corporate income
tax) would result in a 9% increase in Federal income taxes for
taxpayers with incomes between $30,000 and $75,000 per year.
Taxpayers with incomes above $200,000, on the other hand, would
enjoy a whopping 26% income tax cut. </p>
<h4>How Would It Work?</h4>
<p>While there are many variations of the flat tax, most or all
are traceable to a book first published in 1983 by conservative
economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, Low Tax, Simple Tax,
Flat Tax. Embraced by politicians ranging across the political
spectrum from Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) to Senator
Arlen Specter (R-PA) and ex-Governor Jerry Brown (D-CA), in 1995
the flat tax has emerged as the leading Republican contender to
replace the current federal income tax, both personal and
corporate. </p>
<p>While details differ between proposals, most flat tax plans
embody the following major features: * All income that is subject
to tax would be taxed at a single rate. (Hall and Rabushka
proposed a 19% rate; Rep. Armey has called for 17%.) * There is a
business tax and a personal tax. The personal tax would be levied
only on wages, salaries and pensions. There would be a sizeable
personal allowance, but no or very few deductions. (Sen. Specter
would allow deductions for mortgage interest on debt up to
$100,000 for owner-occupied homes, and for charitable
contributions up to $2,500; Rep. Armey, following Hall-Rabushka,
would not allow any personal deductions.) * The personal tax
return would be simple to fill out. For most people, the tax form
would be no bigger than a post card. Under Rep. Armey&thorn;s
version, income tax withholding would be abolished. Instead,
taxpayers would be responsible for remitting their taxes by check
to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) once a month. * The
business tax would apply to all business receipts, less wages,
salaries and pension contributions paid, and less purchases of
materials, supplies and services from other businesses.
Expenditures for fixed assets (buildings and equipment) would
also be fully deductible. Interest payments would not be
deductible; nor would employer payments for non-pension
job-related benefits (such as medical insurance). </p>
<h4>What's Wrong With the Flat Tax?</h4>
<p>Despite its surface appeal, and despite all of the problems
and unfairness of the present tax system, the flat tax would be a
very bad deal for working people. Citizens for Tax Justice
estimate that the flat tax would increase the annual taxes of
those making $50,000-$75,000 per year by an average of $2,000.
Those with incomes above $200,000 per year would enjoy an annual
tax cut averaging more than $50,000! </p>
<p>The flat tax would therefore result in a tremendous increase
in unfairness of a tax system which is already far from fair.
This increase in unfairness stems from three major causes. First,
under the flat tax, recipients of non-wage income would no longer
be taxed directly on the interest, dividends, capital gains and
other non-wage income that they receive. Second, the flat tax
with its single rate would take a smaller bite out of high
incomes than does today&thorn;s moderately progressive personal
income tax. Third, a considerable part of the business portion of
the flat tax would be passed on to consumers. This portion of the
flat tax would be highly regressive, hitting those with low
incomes the hardest. </p>
<h4>Non-Wage Income Not Taxed</h4>
<p>One of the greatest inequities to working people resulting
from the flat tax stems from the fact that non-wage income, such
as interest payments, stock dividends, and capital gains on the
sale of real estate or financial assets such as stocks or bonds,
would no longer be directly taxed. </p>
<p>How much of a shift in tax burdens from upper income to lower
and middle income taxpayers would this represent? A lot.
Taxpayers with incomes of between $30,000 and $75,000 per year
derive 83% of their incomes from wages and salaries, and only 6%
from dividends, interest and capital gains. The richest
taxpayers, by contrast, with incomes of $200,000 per year and up,
receive a much smaller 49% of their incomes in the form of wages
and salaries, but derive 25% from dividends, interest and capital
gains. Under the flat tax, their tax bill for these billions of
dollars in non-wage income would be zero. </p>
<h4>Loss of Progressivity</h4>
<p>A key principle of tax fairness is that taxes ought to be
based on ability to pay. This means that people with higher
incomes should pay a higher percentage of their incomes in taxes
than people with lower incomes. A tax system which embodies this
key principle of fairness is said to be
&thorn;progressive.&thorn; The current federal income tax, which
starts out with a low tax rate on those with lower incomes, with
higher tax rates applying to those with higher incomes, is an
example of a progressive tax. </p>
<p>Shifting to the flat tax would result in a major loss of
progressivity from the tax code. Because of the large personal
exemption, the flat tax would be slightly progressive, but far
less so than today&thorn;s federal income tax. Today&thorn;s top
tax rate of 39.6%, which applies to taxable incomes in execess of
$250,000, would be replaced in the Hall-Rabushka flat tax by a
uniform 19% tax rate. For upper income taxpayers, this would
represent a huge tax cut. For revenues to remain unchanged, taxes
would have to be higher&thorn;and would be higher on everyone
else. </p>
<p>Though they deny it today, in their original 1983 book Hall
and Rabushka were candid enough to admit that the flat tax
&quot;will be a tremendous boon to the economic elite.&quot; They
also conceded: &quot;Now for some bad news...it is an obvious
mathematical law that lower taxes on the successful will have to
be made up by higher taxes on average people.&quot; (From Hall
and Rabushka, Low Tax, Simple Tax, Flat Tax, 1983, p.58 and
p.67.) </p>
<h4>Regressive Business Tax</h4>
<p>A flat &quot;business tax&quot; would apply to all business
receipts, less the offsetting deductions described earlier.
Unlike today&thorn;s corporate income tax which applies to
corporate profits, the business tax portion of the flat tax would
more closely resemble the &quot;value added taxes&quot; (VATs)
which are common in other countries. Much of today's corporate
income tax is generally thought to be shifted to, and therefore
paid by, the owners of the corporation (e.g., wealthy individuals
and other stockholders). Value added taxes, by contrast, are a
cost to all firms and are generally thought to be shifted, in
large measure, to consumers who purchase a firm&thorn;s products
or services. They are therefore borne disproportionately by lower
income people, since they spend a greater proportion of their
incomes than higher income people. It is probable that a
disproportionate share of the business tax portion of the flat
tax would likewise be borne by taxpayers of low and moderate
means. </p>
<h4>Huge Revenue Loss</h4>
<p>Proponents of the flat tax say their intention is to offer a
proposal which is &quot;revenue neutral.&quot; In other words,
the flat tax is not supposed to increase or decrease revenues
compared with the current individual and corporate income tax.
Treasury Department analysts, however, find that the flat tax
would result in a huge revenue shortfall, thereby causing an even
bigger budget deficit than we have today, or requiring even
deeper cuts in federal spending than the massive cuts already
under consideration. Alternatively, in order to achieve revenue
neutrality, the &quot;uniform tax rate&quot; would have to be
considerably higher than the rate proposed by flat tax advocates
to date. In the case of Rep. Armey&thorn;s plan, for example, the
Treasury Department estimates that his proposed 17% tax rate
would result in a $186 billion revenue shortfall. The tax rate
would have to be increased to 23% in order to avoid a revenue
shortfall. </p>
<h4>Flat Tax Not Even Simple</h4>
<p>Even the claim that the flat tax would be far simpler than
today&thorn;s income tax system does not stand up under close
scrutiny. Nearly 20 million taxpayers use the Form 1040-EZ. For
these taxpayers, filing their income tax is no more complicated
than completing the famous flat tax postcard-size tax return. </p>
<p>For other taxpayers, the flat tax return would indeed be
simpler than todays Form 1040, but at a huge cost. Apart from
Sen. Specter&thorn;s version which would retain deductions for
mortgage interest and charitable contributions, no deductions
whatsoever would be permitted on the flat tax return. This means,
for example, that someone with a serious illness and inadequate
medical insurance would have no tax deductions for their medical
expenses, no matter how large they were. This may be simpler than
today's income tax, but it certainly is not fairer. </p>
<p>The business side of the flat tax, by contrast, is neither
simple nor fair. In order to prevent widespread fraud and abuse,
record keeping requirements, monitoring and enforcement would
actually have to be beefed up compared with today&thorn;s levels.
This is partly because the business side of the flat tax would
create many new possibilities for abusive tax shelters. Even
defining revenues and deductions for flat tax purposes would be
enormously complicated. </p>
<h4>Job-Related Benefits Not Deductible</h4>
<p>One thing that would not be deductible on the business side of
the flat tax is employer payments for employee benefits, other
than pension plan contributions. This means, for example, that
employer payments for employees&thorn; medical insurance premiums
would no longer be deductible. At a time when national health
insurance still has not been enacted and is not even any longer
on the horizon, the flat tax would therefore undermine and erode
the job-related medical insurance coverage that millions of
workers and their families depend on. Employer payments for other
job-related benefits, including education and training, life
insurance and child care, to name a few, would not be deductible,
either. </p>
<h4>AFL-CIO Wants Real Tax Reform</h4>
<p>Despite its surface appeal and notwithstanding the misleading
claims of its supporters, the flat tax would be a lousy deal for
working Americans. The current tax system has serious problems,
but the problems would be made worse by the flat tax. Real tax
reform would require taxing capital gains at the same rate as
wages, adding more progressivity to the tax rate structure, and
requiring corporations to pay a fairer share of the federal
income tax. </p>
<p>Current tax provisions which encourage corporations to export
jobs, or to destroy them through excessive, unproductive mergers
and aquisitions, should be ended. Transfer pricing abuses which
permit huge multinational corporations to avoid billions of
dollars in tax obligations should be stopped. </p>
<p>These are among the key ingredients of real tax reform, not a
flat tax system under which the richest and most privileged
Americans would get a huge tax cut and everyone else would pay
more. Prepared by Sheldon Friedman </p>

<p>1996 Republican Budget Resolution </p>
<p><a name="1"><strong>WEALTHY WINNERS,</strong><br>
<strong>MIDDLE CLASS LOSERS</strong></a> </p>
<p>Republican &quot;slash-and-burn&quot; budget policies threaten destruction of pro-people programs that help 
workers and their families. </p>
<p>The 1996 budget resolution of the Republican-dominated United States Congress will kill or 
drastically cut basic long-established, labor-supported programs. </p>
<p>Losers in the budget battles include children and elderly, middle class and moderate income 
families, college students and pre-school Head Start children, adult workers with jobs and workers 
without jobs, elderly victims of deep cuts in Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, and the adult 
children of these elderly victims of budget-cutting. </p>
<p>Winners in the budget battles include big business and high income individuals who have promises 
of Republican tax cuts. </p>
<p>House and Senate budget resolutions have proposed deep and painful spending cuts to balance the 
budget by the year 2002. These proposals have passed the respective houses and differences will 
be resolved and bills will be enacted later this year for reconciliation and appropriations to 
implement the budget. The Senate has proposed spending cuts of $961 billion over seven years, 
the House $1.4 trillion. </p>
<p>These cuts range across the entire federal budget. Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Act 
protections would be eliminated. Big cuts would be made in Medicare, Medicaid, and lesser cuts in 
Social Security. Federal pensions would be lowered and the contributions of federal employees 
raised. </p>
<p>Unemployment compensation for jobless workers, pensions for civilian and military retirees, 
veterans benefits and programs for roads, bridges, highways and housing will be cut. Mass transit, 
Amtrak and maintenance support would be slashed. The Federal Aviation Administration would be 
privatized in the Senate bill. </p>
<p>Specific training programs would be eliminated and a general block grant to the states would be 
substituted, while overall funds would be slashed by 40 percent. </p>
<p>An appendix to this report highlights some of the program cuts and terminations under the budget 
resolution in areas of the budget ranging from education and training to the environment, worker 
safety and more. Another appendix lists a number of federal regulatory protections of prevailing 
wages, worker safety, health and other areas of social concern that are on the Republican hit list. 
An appendix also shows the unequal impact on income groups of the various spending and tax cuts. </p>
<p><a name="2"><strong>NO BUDGET FAIRNESS</strong></a> </p>
<p>The tax and spending changes proposed by the budget reconciliation bills would worsen the 
distribution of incomes in this country. The combined effect of the tax and spending cuts would be 
to shave 7 percent from the after-tax income of families making less than $30,000 in the year 2002, 
according to a Washington Post compilation of the House resolution included in this report. For a 
family earning $30,000, this loss would amount to $2,100. </p>
<p>Families in the $30,000 to $75,000 range would lose almost 2 percent of income, from $600 to 
$1,500 on average. </p>
<p>The Washington Post compilation shows, for example, that about 85 percent of the cut in Social 
Security would hit middle class families below $75,000. About half of the cut in student loans 
would affect families with incomes below $30,000, which include about 40 percent of U.S. 
families. Eighty-five percent of the $3.2 billion in cuts in job training would affect families with 
incomes below $30,000. </p>
<p>On the other hand, two-thirds of the $90 billion in tax cuts would go to the 22 percent of families 
with incomes above $75,000. Less than 5 percent of the tax cuts would benefit the 40 percent of 
U.S. families with incomes below $30,000. </p>
<p>The Senate does not contain tax cuts, but promises to use a $170 billion saving from a balanced 
budget for an unspecified tax cut. </p>
<p><a name="3"><strong>CUTS VERSUS UNMET NEEDS</strong></a> </p>
<p>While the Capitol Hill rhetoric revolves around cutting spending, ironically there is a growing 
backlog of unmet needs. A need to repair the nation's physical infrastructure. Significant 
shortcomings in education in inner cities. College students need support and aid to prepare for jobs. 
Workers need training so that American firms can compete overseas. </p>
<p>This year's annual budget process has become the focus of some basic questions. Is balancing the 
budget in the way being considered at this time the right thing to do? Is it fair and wise to enact tax 
cuts that go mainly to the wealthy and to profitable businesses, while asking citizens to do without 
essential government services? What is the human price to be paid? Can federal spending and taxes 
be brought into balance in any other way? Should balancing the budget be considered to the 
exclusion of tax fairness and full-employment? Should the nation take a meat ax to essential 
programs and protections and government activities? Is it fair to scapegoat federal workers and the 
federal establishment? </p>
<hr>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution having failed enactment earlier this year, the 
congressional budget process has become the forum for tax and spending changes and deficit 
reduction. This is so even though the possibility of balancing the budget by the year 2002 is 
problematical and may even be undesirable. </p>
<p><a name="4"><strong>BALANCED BUDGET:</strong> <strong>A DRAG ON THE ECONOMY</strong></a> </p>
<p>Why so? Balancing the budget through massive spending cuts will slow the economy and contribute 
to unemployment and may even push the U.S. economy into recession. Big budget cuts planned by 
Republican budgeteers will further weaken an economy which is already slowing down in 1995 
because of the interest rate hikes engineered by the Federal Reserve over the last year. </p>
<p>The WEFA forecasting group, for example, recently predicted that the balanced budget plan would 
result in an unemployment rate more than 2 percentage points higher in 2002 than under current 
spending policies and that the economy would slow by an average of 0.3 percentage points a year 
between now and 2002. </p>
<p>To force strict and mindless adherence to a balanced budget regime takes out of the hands of 
policy makers the ability to counter the effects of recession. For example, in past downturns, 
Congress has been able to enact countercyclical measures to put people to work and to increase 
their incomes to get the economy moving again. A balanced budget wouldn't allow extra spending 
and would undermine the economy's so-called automatic stabilizers which automatically increase 
federal spending on such things as unemployment aid to jobless workers, food stamps and welfare 
when the economy turns down. </p>
<p>The budget resolution is the framework within which the various authorizing and appropriations 
committees must work in setting tax and spending policies. </p>
<p>The budget bill sets overall limits on spending. It requires the various committees of the Congress to 
stick within these limits. The budget assumes suggested program levels and cuts that could be 
adopted by the various appropriations committees in order to meet their mandated targets. The 
committees are free to adopt the recommendations on specific programs or not, but they must 
work within the mandated totals assigned them. If, for example, an appropriations committee fails 
to enact a program cut assumed by the budget committee and does not make another cut to make 
up the difference and the total of the committee bill exceeds the budget resolution target, an 
individual member can stop the bill on the House floor on a point of order. A reconciliation bill will 
be drawn up to make reductions in entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and veterans 
programs. Authorizing committees will need to produce policy changes to achieve the savings 
outlined in the budget resolution. </p>
<p>The Budget Process chart from the May 13 Congressional Quarterly is included in this report. It 
traces the path of the budget through the year up until final enactment in the fall when the 
implementing legislation and reconciliation bills are made final and submitted for the President's 
signature. </p>
<p><a name="5"><strong>TAX CUTS FOR WEALTHY AND PROFITABLE CORPORATIONS</strong></a> </p>
<p>The House budget plan includes $340 billion in tax cuts passed earlier in the year. Among other 
things, the tax plan would cut capital gains taxes and hike depreciation deductions as well as reduce 
corporate tax rates. The plan also includes a $500 tax credit for children. </p>
<p>The tax cuts aren't fair. The majority of those benefits go to corporations and people earning more 
than $100,000. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, people earning $350,000 a year or 
more could get a $20,000-a-year tax break while working people would be offered minor benefits 
in comparison. Meanwhile, middle class people would find benefits such as Medicare, student 
loans and training assistance, veterans benefits and retirement cut back. </p>
<p>As an example, a family might find that while it could claim a small tax credit for a child, several 
thousands of dollars would be added to the cost of another child's college education as the 
in-school interest subsidy is taken away from college students (as in the House bill). A student who 
borrows the maximum each year for four years of college now owes $17,100 when he or she starts 
to pay back the loan. Under the Republican proposal, that would go up to $20,500, and the 
monthly repayment amount would rise from $205 to $246. </p>
<p>Suppose the student spends six more years getting a doctorate in engineering. His or her loans for 
undergraduate and graduate studies would total $68,100 now, but a staggering $101,150 under the 
Republican proposal. </p>
<p><a name="6"><strong>UNFAIR TAX CUT FOR CAPITAL GAINS</strong></a> </p>
<p>The tax cuts for capital gains are the least justified and least fair to working people. </p>
<p>The income from capital gains is already taxed on highly preferential terms. The 1993 tax law 
changes which increased the top tax rate to 39.6 percent on amounts of taxable income in excess 
of $250,000 kept the top tax rate on capital gains at 28 percent, a full 11.6 percent lower. To 
make matters worse, last year a brand new tax preference was created which lowered the 
maximum tax rate on capital gains to 14 percent for certain new investments and certain newly 
issued stock. </p>
<p>The House tax bill further reduces taxes on capital gains by providing a 50 percent exclusion and 
indexing. This would make a bad situation dramatically worse. Tax preferences accorded income 
from capital gains result in taxing the wages and salaries of working people at a higher rate than the 
profits made by the wealthy on their sales of stocks, bonds, real estate and other property. It is a 
tax preference not available to most working men and women who pay the lion's share of taxes and 
who must meet their income tax obligations every payday. </p>
<p>The fact that 93 percent of all tax returns report zero income from capital gains underscores how 
skewed in favor of the rich this tax preference is. More than two thirds of all the benefits from 
capital gains tax preferences accrue to taxpayers with incomes in excess of $200,000 per year. </p>
<p>Cutting capital gains taxes will also stimulate the tax shelter industry, which is based heavily on 
schemes to convert ordinary income into preferentially taxed capital gains. The huge 50 percent 
exclusion, plus indexing, would mean almost two thirds of capital gains avoids taxation. This will 
prove to be an irresistible lure to these wasteful, revenue-losing and highly inequitable tax shelter 
activities. </p>
<p>The Senate denies Earned Income Tax Credits to undocumented workers and maintains indexing 
of the credit, but limits prospective increases. </p>
<p>Additional depreciation tax breaks for corporations via neutral cost recovery are unjustified. U.S. 
corporations are already taxed more lightly than their competitors in such highly successful industrial 
nations as Germany and Japan. Corporations have also shouldered a smaller proportion of the 
federal income tax burden in each successive decade since the 1950s. Corporate income taxes 
accounted for only 9 percent of federal revenues in 1993, down from 16 percent in 1973 and 31 
percent in 1953. Against this backdrop, there is no justification for further deep cuts in the form of 
a &quot;neutral cost recovery&quot; depreciation scheme that will cost $120 billion in lost revenues over the 
next ten years, according to Treasury Department estimates. </p>
<p><a name="7"><strong>DAVIS-BACON, SERVICE CONTRACT PROTECTIONS TO BE KILLED</strong></a> </p>
<p>The Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts are elimination targets of the Republican 
slash-and-burn attack on the budget and federal regulations. Republican hard-liners have vowed to 
do away with these protections, which assure that federal funds are not used to undercut prevailing 
wages. Congressional budgeteers estimate that doing away with these essential labor protections 
would result in $1.5 billion in annual budget savings. If these protections are kept, however, there 
would have to be cuts to make up these amounts in other areas of the budget. </p>
<p>The Davis-Bacon Act covers federally funded construction. The Service Contract Act is a 
prevailing- wage statute for workers providing cleaning, clerical and other services to the federal 
government. The purpose of these Acts is to ensure that competitors for federal government 
contracts compete on their management ability and quality rather than cutting the wages and 
working conditions of their employees. </p>

<hr>
<p><a name="8"><strong>MEDICARE TO BE CUT</strong> <strong>25 PERCENT BY 2002</strong></a> </p>
<p>The budget resolutions call for deep cuts in entitlements, especially Medicare. The Senate, for 
example, cuts Medicare by $256 billion, Medicaid $175 billion and other mandatory programs by 
$209 billion. Both proposals achieve cuts by reducing the rate of growth of the programs. 
However, these reductions in growth will actually result in significant reductions from the level of 
services under current law. The House bill cuts Medicare by $282 billion over seven years, 
Medicaid by $187 billion and other programs by $219. </p>
<p>Medicare cuts proposed in the Senate and House assume savings through greater efficiency, but 
there are likely to be higher costs on providers and beneficiaries. The Medicare program will be 25 
percent smaller in 2002 than it would be if the government honored its commitments under current 
law, according to a Joint Economic Committee (JEC) minority report. </p>
<p>Since 1965 Medicare has provided health care for people aged 65 and over. It is a nationwide 
health insurance program for the aged and certain disabled persons, consisting of hospital insurance 
and supplement medical insurance. There are over 31 million aged and 3.5 million disabled who 
have protection under part A alone. It is a middle class program where roughly 60 percent of the 
benefits go to the 77 percent of families with incomes below $75,000. But most of all it is an 
insurance program that people have paid into over their working years with the promise that they 
will receive medical coverage when disabled or retired. </p>
<p>Republicans have argued that cuts in Medicare are necessary to save the program, from being 
insolvent after the turn of the century. However, the proposed savings are $116 billion greater than 
estimates of what is needed by 2002 to rescue Medicare's Part A hospital insurance trust fund. </p>
<p>Minority Leader Gephardt said the House plan could cost retired people $1,300 in increased 
Medicare fees and reduced Social Security benefits by the time the budget is balanced in the year 
2002. </p>
<p>Senate Republican leaders want to appoint a commission to figure out how to hold down costs. 
Medicare reform will be addressed as a distinct legislative initiative in September although the 
figures will be included in the budget resolution. </p>
<p>Medicaid bears substantial cutbacks as the program is transformed into a block grant to the States. 
The proposed cuts would reduce the program by 30 percent compared to current law by 2002, 
according to the JEC report. Other benefit programs will be cut, including agriculture subsidies, 
welfare, student loans, veterans benefits and more. </p>
<p>Medicaid is a federal-state matching entitlement program providing medical assistance for 
low-income persons who are aged, blind, disabled, members of families with dependent children 
and certain other pregnant women and children. </p>
<p>A Senate proposal would change the basis for federal retiree pensions from the average of the top 
three highest salaries to the five highest annual salaries. The House has a similar provision for 
Foreign Service. </p>
<p>Both provisions increase the payment by federal workers. </p>
<p><a name="9"><strong>SOCIAL SECURITY TO BE CUT</strong> <strong>THROUGH CPI FLIM-FLAM</strong></a> </p>
<p>Social Security is the only pension for 6 out of 10 workers in private industry. All but the wealthiest 
retirees depend less on private pensions, more on Social Security. Between 70 and 80 percent of 
total income is from Social Security for retirees in the bottom 40 percent of incomes. </p>
<p>The budget plan supposedly excludes Social Security, Defense and interest on the debt. However, 
changes in the way cost of living adjustments are figured will reduce Social Security payments. The 
House, for example, assumes a Consumer Price Index flim-flam adjustment to cut by 0.6 of a 
percentage point beginning in 1999, which would reduce increases in Social Security benefits tied 
to the index and increase individual taxes. </p>
<p>The proposal would reduce the basic amount on which future adjustments are calculated, and the 
cumulative effect would be a total loss of several hundred dollars a year for the average Social 
Security beneficiary. </p>
<p>By 2002, the 0.6 CPI cut reduces Social Security payments by $10 billion or $240 per beneficiary, 
according to the JEC. The Senate assumes a CPI reduction of 0.2 percentage points, beginning in 
1999. </p>
<p>The cuts in Social Security would especially hurt low and middle income families. For example, 
only about 16 percent of the benefits under Social Security go to these with incomes above 
$75,000. Forty-two percent goes to these with incomes below $30,000. </p>
<p><a name="10"><strong>PRO-PEOPLE PROGRAMS</strong> <strong>TO BE CUT OR KILLED</strong></a> </p>
<p>The budget resolutions cut a huge swath out of domestic programs, covering everything from 
education and training, to spending on highways, and other infrastructure, housing, the environment, 
energy and other areas. </p>
<p>The budget proposals continue the Republican assault on the federal government and the 
scapegoating of federal workers. The House plans the elimination of the Departments of 
Commerce, Education and Energy. The Senate eliminates Commerce. </p>
<p>Overall domestic programs would be cut by about $190 billion over seven years based on the 
1995 freeze funding base used by the Republicans. Actually the real figure is $450 billion by 
traditional budget calculation based on current services. Current services is an estimate of the 
spending needed in future years to continue programs at their current levels, reflecting costs of 
continuing these programs at their spending levels without any policy changes. The House and 
Senate bills spend $1.77 trillion, roughly 20 percent less than current services, for domestic 
discretionary programs over seven years. </p>
<p>The Republicans compare their budgets to the 1995 freeze level, rather than to current services. 
Thus, their $190 billion 7-year reduction in domestic discretionary spending seriously understates 
the actual drop in programs from levels which would be necessary to maintain current services. </p>
<p>Domestic program cuts begin taking effect in 1996, with an overall reduction in the 5-6 percent 
range. In the year 2002, domestic programs would be roughly 30 percent below the current 
services level. </p>
<p>In order to make room for some program increases, many programs will be cut much more than 
the average amount. In the Justice area of the budget, the Senate proposes an increase of $27 
billion over seven years. While the Senate budget, for example, provides an additional $2.7 billion 
in funding for the FBI, drug enforcement and immigration and naturalization, there is a 65 percent 
reduction in funding for the Legal Services Corporation. </p>
<p>Hundreds of programs, agencies and commissions are targeted in the House and Senate bills. The 
House budget would eliminate a number of agencies, including the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting and the Economic Development Administration. The Senate would terminate the 
Interstate Commerce Commission, as well as phase out operating subsidies for Amtrak. The House 
would terminate 283 federal programs; the Senate 100 programs. </p>
<p>The National Service Initiative would be dropped by the Senate. The House bill includes a 
20-percent cut in Mine Safety and Health Agency funds. MSHA would be combined with OSHA 
and OSHA would be cut by 20 percent. </p>
<p>The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program supports a wide range of activities in 
cities across the country, including economic development, job creation, public facilities, public 
services and housing. The program would be cut by half beginning in fiscal 1996 in the Senate bill, 
20 percent in the House bill. </p>
<p>An attached appendix to this report gives more details of program cuts proposed by the budget 
resolutions for selected programs in employment and training, education, safety and health, housing, 
infrastructure and the environment, energy, transportation, economic development, federal workers, 
maritime and other areas. </p>
<p><a name="11"><strong>MILITARY SPENDING </strong></a></p>
<p>Military spending in the budget is affected by the proposals. There are significant real cuts from the 
current services level, reflecting in part the reduced international threats in the post Cold War era. </p>
<p>Both Houses and Senate resolutions assume that production of major weapons systems such as the 
Seawolf submarine would be continued. </p>
<p>The House would spend about $68 billion more than the Administration and the Senate propose. 
All three military budgets contain significant cumulative declines in inflation adjusted terms of from 
12 to 15 percent by 2001, according to the Defense Budget Project estimates. </p>

<p><a name="13"><strong>WHAT'S MAGIC ABOUT 2002? OR A ZERO DEFICIT ?</strong></a> </p>
<p>The federal budget is not out of control. The congress enacted a budget act in 1993 which reduced 
the deficit by $500 billion over five years. The budget deficit is declining as a percent of the Gross 
Domestic Product, making it more manageable in future years, without passage of a devastating 
balanced budget measure. </p>
<p>The congressional Black Caucus has offered a balanced budget which would cut spending by half 
the amount proposed by the House and Senate Republicans. The proposal would raise corporate 
taxes and taxes on the wealthy and not out Medicare, Medicaid or Welfare. See the box. </p>
<p>The deficit has declined from the 4.6-4.8 percent range of Gross Domestic Product in the 
mid-1980s to 2.8 percent in 1994. The Congressional Budget Office in January projected that 
annual deficits would rise to 3 percent only in the year 2000, assuming that the economy operates 
at its potential. Dramatically cutting spending under a balanced budget law would threaten that 
timeline. Further, the fact that the deficit is under control for the foreseeable future makes it possible 
to deal with emerging problems, such as the financial pressures of Medicare and the eventual need 
to put Social Security on a better long-term basis. </p>
<p>A more modest goal such as keeping the deficit below the level of growth of the economy is more 
realistic and desirable. It would result in the decline in the deficit as a percent of Gross Domestic 
Product over time. </p>
<p>The inflexible goal of balancing the budget by 2002 exclusively through spending cuts is arbitrary 
and unnecessary. It puts a particularly hard burden on the elderly, on working people, on college 
students, on children. This is grossly unfair and unjust -- and even more unfair if it includes 
significant tax cuts for wealthy individuals and profitable corporations. It ignores the tax subsidies 
that benefit primarily corporations and wealthy individuals. </p>
<p>Substantial revenues could be raised by closing tax loopholes which treat capital gains income and 
inheritance preferentially, and which reward corporations for exporting and destroying jobs. </p>
<p>Changing the foreign tax credit to a deduction, for example, could raise $16.5 billion. At present, 
U.S. based multinationals are able to take a credit against their U.S. corporate income tax 
obligations for income taxes they pay to foreign countries. This provides them with an incentive to 
invest abroad, costing the Treasury and shifting production overseas. Another example. Cracking 
down on transfer pricing abuse by multinationals, by which firms avoid taxes by shifting their costs 
of production on paper, could raise an additional $28.7 billion. Now a firm can over charge itself 
for an item produced by a subsidiary in a low tax country. This shifts its income out of the U.S. and 
into a low tax location. </p>
<p>The deficit is a moving target. All estimates will be out the window in the event of a recession, 
which would change budget and political realities significantly. The budget process should move 
toward balance in a deliberate manner, but there should be enough flexibility to deal with economic 
realities such as recessions as well as the unforeseen and emerging priorities. Furthermore, 
consideration should be given to improved tax equity and eliminating corporate tax and spending 
subsidies. Such measures would improve the quality of public policy and help lower the deficit. </p>
<p>Squeezing the budget into a balanced budget straitjacket is an unrealistic way to address national 
needs. It focuses on a single issue and fails to deal with other key priorities, including faster 
economic growth and full employment -- goals which help achieve a budget balanced over time. </p>

<p>APPENDIX A </p>
<p><a name="A"><strong>PROGRAM CUTS PROPOSED BY THE HOUSE BUDGET ACT</strong></a> </p>
<p>The House and the Senate budget resolutions target specific programs for cuts over seven years. 
Many of these programs directly or indirectly help workers and their families. While the two bills 
contain many similarities, there are a number of different programs and levels of detail. Some 
programs that would be affected by budget actions in the House of Representatives include the 
following in the areas of employment and training, education, safety and health, housing, 
infrastructure and environment, energy, transportation, economic development, federal workers, 
maritime, trade and export promotion, technology and miscellaneous. Proposed actions vary by 
program and cuts are from the fiscal 1995 level. Funding levels are generally measured in outlay 
amounts. Dollar cuts sometimes are small in 1996 and then rise for later years, which are shown 
below. <strong>PROGRAM 1995 FUNDING ALL PROGRAMS CUT BY</strong> </p>

</pre>
<p>The Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts are basic labor protections which assure that local 
prevailing wages are paid in federal contracts for construction and for service contracts. The 
purpose is to prevent the use of federal funds from undercutting local wage rates. </p>
<p>Training and Employment Services </p>
<p>Federal training assistance now provided through various specific programs aimed at particular 
problem groups such as: workers displaced by trade, disadvantaged minority youth, Indians, etc. 
are proposed to be combined into a massive job training block grant that is turned over to the 
states. Spending overall would be cut by 20 percent. Many specific programs would be eliminated 
as such. </p>

<p>This income-support program for long-term jobless workers provides an additional 13 weeks of 
unemployment compensation -- beyond the normal 26 weeks of state unemployment insurance 
payments -- for workers who are unemployed for extended periods of time when overall 
unemployment increases during a recession. This program also acts as an anti-recession stabilizer. 
During periods of high state unemployment, extended benefits, financed one-half by state payroll 
taxes and one- half by the federal unemployment payroll tax, are paid. </p>
<p>State UI and Employment<br>
Service Operations $810 Eliminate </p>
<p>The public employment service is a nationwide system providing no-fee employment services to 
individuals who are seeking employment and employers who are seeking workers. State 
employment service activities are financed by allotment to states distributed under a 
demographically based funding formula. Federal requirements would be repealed by doing away 
with the Wagner-Peyser Act. </p>

Trade Adjustment Assistance<br>
(NAFTA) $ 9 Eliminate<br>
Trade Adjustment Assistance<br>
(Benefits) $212 Eliminate </p>
<p>Adjustment assistance, including cash weekly benefits, training, job search and relocation 
allowances, are paid to workers as authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. Adjustment 
assistance, including weekly cash benefits, training, job search and relocation allowances, is paid to 
workers determined to be adversely </p>
<p>affected as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The training and NAFTA 
programs become part of a block grant, while the benefits program dies. </p>
<p>Office of the American Workplace $ 30 Eliminate </p>
<p>This office in the Department of Labor encourages labor-management cooperative practices and 
other practices that increase the skills of workers, assist them in becoming more productive and 
innovative, help them in obtaining better jobs. Elements are being transferred to other areas of the 
Labor Department. </p>
<p><strong>EDUCATION</strong> </p>
<p>Subsidy Program for Student<br>
Loans $5,237 Eliminate in-school subsidy </p>
<p>Federal student loans are the largest single source of financial aid for undergraduate and graduate 
students. The federal government helps lower- and middle-income students by paying the interest 
on their loans until the students finish their studies. The aid extends for six months after a student 
leaves school. This in- school interest exemption based on need benefits some 4.5 million students. 
It encourages students to complete their degrees, keeps them from facing enormous debts when 
they graduate, and lessens the chance they might default on repayment. </p>
<p>Bilingual and Immigrant Education $251 Eliminate </p>
<p>These programs provide assistance of local educational agencies and other entities to develop and 
enhance their capacity to provide high-quality instructional programs to children and youth of 
limited English proficiency. </p>
<p>Funding for Libraries $155 Eliminate Funding </p>
<p>This program assists public libraries in Improving access to public library services. States are 
encouraged to undertake activities that further the National Education Goals. </p>
<p>Head Start $3,339 Cut $209 million </p>
<p>This program provides comprehensive early childhood education services through the Department 
of Health and Human Services. It has been one of the most popular, most enduring and most 
successful programs originating from the Great Society of the 1960s. </p>
<p>Goals 2000 $133 Eliminate Funding </p>
<p>Goals 2000 sets eight national education goals and provides support for states and communities to 
establish challenging academic standards and advance school improvements through local 
participation. One goal is to raise the high school graduation rate to at least 90 percent. At present, 
many states have much lower graduation rates. California, for example, has a 77 percent rate. </p>
<p>TRIO Program $419 Eliminate funding </p>
<p>Five programs that assist at-risk students from getting access to higher education. Over 680,000 
students will benefit from these programs under the current year budget proposal. </p>
<p><strong>SAFETY</strong> </p>
<p>Occupational Safety and Health<br>
Administration (OSHA) $312 Cut 20 percent </p>
<p>New and revised standards are proposed and promulgated to protect the safety and health of 
workers. Compliance with occupational safety and health standards is gained in part by the physical 
inspection of plants and facilities, and by encouraging cooperation between employers and 
employees to ensure safe and healthy workplaces. Technical assistance provided on all aspects of 
standards setting, variances, compliance assistance, and enforcement programs. Compliance 
assistance is provided and OSHA maintains management information and statistical support for 
OSHA'S programs and field operations. </p>
<p>Mine Safety and Health Admin. $201 Cut 20 percent </p>
<p>Enforcement of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 includes inspection of mines, the 
development and promulgation of health and safety standards, assistance in mine rescue operations, 
investigations of serious accidents in mines, recommendations to reduce working hazards, and 
on-site education and training assistance. This activity assesses and collects civil monetary penalties 
for violations of safety and health standards. Transfer MSHA to OSHA. </p>
<p>National Institute of Occupational<br>
Safety and Health (NIOSH) $1,888 Cut $133 Million </p>
<p>The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts research and sets 
criteria for standards aimed at reducing on-the-job illness and injury. </p>
<p><strong>HOUSING</strong> </p>
<p>The House and Senate budget reconciliation bills cut programs back and create block grants for 
housing assistance. In the area of rental assistance, the Senate bill cuts $5.7 billion over 5 years, the 
House $37.4 billion. Both the House and Senate bills terminate all additional Section 8 rental 
assistance and the House bill provides renewal of only half of expiring rental assistance so that the 
total number assisted would decline at a time when housing problems for lower income people are 
getting worse. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that after seven 
years, 1.3 million fewer families would receive housing subsidies under the House budget than 
under the Administration's budget. Under the House bill, for example, in 1996, instead of adding 
50,000 incremental units of tenant-based assistance, there would be a loss of 78,000, a swing of 
128,000 units. </p>
<p>HOME Housing Block Grant $909 Cut $280 million </p>
<p>Proposed is a 10 percent cut in 1996 followed by a 20 percent cut in 1997. The HOME program 
provides flexible assistance to states and localities to help in developing rental and home ownership 
housing for lower income people. A part of the funds are allocated to rural areas and non-profit 
organizations have a setaside for some funds under the program. This program would be 
consolidated into a larger block grant. The Department of Housing and Urban Development 
estimates that the cuts </p>
<p>under the program over the next two years would result in 23,000 fewer units and families assisted 
through rehabilitation, new construction, and tenant based assistance. </p>
<p>Homeless Shelter Grants $ 88 Cut $31 million </p>
<p>This program authorizes assistance to promote development of supportive housing and services for 
deinstitutionalized homeless individuals, homeless families with children, homeless individuals with 
mental disabilities, and other homeless. Aid goes for acquisition, rehabilitation, construction, or 
leasing of structures for homeless as well as operating costs and supportive services. This program 
would be consolidated into a block grant. A ten percent cut in HUD's homeless programs in 1996 
would eliminate emergency services available to about 140,000 homeless and transitional services 
available to more than 99,000 homeless. The cut rises to 20 percent in 1997. </p>
<p>Public Housing Construction $571 Eliminate </p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has financed the construction of low 
rent housing for lower income people over the years. This is last resort housing for many, including 
the elderly poor and others who cannot afford decent housing in the private rental market. There 
are over one million public housing units in the U.S. Senate bill creates a block grant for public 
housing. </p>
<p><strong>INFRASTRUCTURE-ENVIRONMENT</strong> </p>
<p>Veterans Administration Major<br>
Construction $541 Cut $369 million </p>
<p>The VA provides a whole range of services to American military service veterans, including 
pensions, health services, housing assistance, education, burial services and more. The VA 
constructs hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, psychiatric buildings and small projects, including such 
things as parking lots. </p>
<p>National Park Service Operations $1,047 10 % Operations cut<br>
National Park Service New Construction $ 245 50 % Reduction<br>
</p>
<p>The Park System contains 368 areas and 80 million acres of land. These areas have been 
established to protect and preserve the cultural and natural heritage of the U.S. and its territories. 
Park visits total over 270 million annually. There is also a proposed 50 percent reduction in new 
construction and a 5-year moratorium on land acquisition proposed. </p>
<p>National Forest System $1,248 Cut $134 million </p>
<p>The 156 National Forest, 20 National Grasslands, and 9 land utilization projects are maintained 
under the Forest System, including the natural resources of timber, minerals, range, wildlife, 
outdoor recreation, watershed, and soil. There is a 10 percent cut in construction of trails 
proposed. </p>
<p>NOAA--Oceans and atmospherics $1,800 $350 million cut </p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration carries on a variety of activities related to 
marine and air navigation, marine fisheries, ocean and atmosphere research, National Weather 
Service and environmental satellites. NOAA construction is also proposed to be eliminated. 
NOAA would be dismantled and parts divided among various other agencies and 2 of the 4 
weather satellites would be shut down. </p>
<p><strong>ENERGY</strong> </p>
<p>Energy Supply R&amp;D $3,265 Cut $1,200 million </p>
<p>Energy supply research and development is conducted to develop new energy technologies and 
improve existing ones. These include solar and renewables, fusion and technologies for clean and 
efficient burning of coal. </p>
<p>Energy Conservation Research $691 $409 million cut </p>
<p>Energy conservation research involves research to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, 
industrial processes, advanced vehicle technologies and appliances. </p>
<p>Energy Information Administration<br>
(EIA) $82 Reduce by half </p>
<p>This would cause a cutback in the availability of energy statistics, reports and forecasts now 
supplied by the U.S. Department of Energy. </p>
<p><strong>TRANSPORTATION</strong> </p>
<p>Mass Transit Operating Subsidies N.A. $770 million cut<br>
Transit Capital Grants N.A. Cut $590 million<br>
</p>
<p>These programs provides resources for a wide variety of mass transit purposes, including planning, 
construction of facilities, purchase of buses and railcars, and for operating assistance. In 1995 the 
federal government spends $1.8 billion in urban formula grants for operations and capital 
expenditures. Mass transit facilities are needed in cities to balance transportation system and to 
eliminate transportation gridlock and reduce pollution. There is a $1+ billion cut resulting from 
changing the federal match rate for remaining capital expenditures to 50 percent. </p>
<p>Amtrak assistance $752 Eliminate </p>
<p>The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or Amtrak, was established in 1970. It is operated 
and managed as a for profit corporation. The government provides support for the on-going 
operations of Amtrak and capital grants to support Amtrak capital requirements as well as support 
for costs associated with long-term restructuring of the Corporation. Amtrak provides essential 
passenger rail service and provides some balance in the national transportation system, which is 
heavily skewed toward automobiles and air transport. </p>
<p>Local Rail Freight Assistance $26 Eliminate </p>
<p>This program provides discretionary and flat-rate grants to states for rail planning and for 
acquisition, track rehabilitation, and rail facility construction with respect to light density freight lines. </p>

</pre>
<p>Provides funds to continue the upgrade of passenger rail service in the corridor between 
Washington, D.C. and Boston. Program reductions would occur beginning in the year 2000. </p>
<p>High Speed Rail $14 Eliminate </p>
<p>The Next Generation High-Speed Rail Program will fund research, development and technology 
demonstration programs plus expenses in connection with analysis required to evaluate proposals 
under the program. </p>
<p>Intelligent Vehicle Development $18 Eliminate Funding </p>
<p>Vehicle systems intended to reduce traffic congestion, improve safety and aid motorists through 
electronic communication. Examples of such technologies include electronic toll-charging devices, 
message signs along highways and auto navigation devices that &quot;read&quot; road signs and traffic 
conditions and suggest alternative routes. </p>
<p><strong>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</strong> </p>
<p>Community Development Financial<br>
Institutions $34 Eliminate </p>
<p>Authorized in 1994, the CDFI fund will provide grants, loans and technical assistance to new and 
existing community development financial institutions such as community development banks. Funds 
support mortgage, small business and economic development lending in currently underserved, 
distressed neighborhoods. </p>
<p>Community Development Block<br>
Grants $4,000 Cut $924 million </p>
<p>This successful program of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development provides 
flexible development assistance to cities across the country. The program assists in infrastructure 
and housing development. The program would be cut by 20 percent in the House bill and 50 
percent in the Senate bill. </p>
<p>Appalachian Regional Commission $202 Eliminate </p>
<p>Program investments are made in the Appalachian Region for wide-ranging assistance including 
development and human resource development. The states, acting through the ARC, are 
responsible for recommending local and state projects within their borders for assistance under this 
program. Special targeting to distressed counties is a part of the state allocation formula. </p>
<p>Economic Development Admin. $317 Eliminate </p>
<p>The programs of the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration provide 
grants for public works and development facilities, other financial assistance, and the planning and 
coordination needed to alleviate conditions of substantial and persistent unemployment and 
underemployment in economically distressed areas and regions. </p>
<p>Federal support for TVA $141 End Federal Support </p>
<p>The Tennessee Valley Authority was created in 1933 as a government-owned corporation for the 
unified development of a river basin comprised of parts of seven states. TVA's responsibilities 
include maintaining water stewardship, development, recreation and power. </p>
<p><strong>FEDERAL WORKERS</strong> </p>
<p>The House budget abolishes the departments of Commerce, Education and Energy. Also, the 
House eliminates 14 agencies such as the Economic Development Administration. It terminates 283 
federal programs. These cuts would affect federal workers, whose numbers have declined in recent 
years. The number of federal workers declined by 66,000 to a level of 2,818,000 in the year 
ending March of 1995. There has been a decline of 267,000 federal workers since 1990. </p>
<p>Departments of Commerce, Energy,<br>
Education Eliminate </p>
<p>The Commerce Department houses the Bureau of the Census and numerous other agencies and 
departments related to exports and fostering business development. The Education Department 
manages 240 programs covering grants to school systems, student loans, national education 
statistics and more. The Energy Department manages environmental cleanup of weapons facilities, 
domestic energy supply, nuclear weapons stockpile, research and development in the area of 
energy conservation and supply. </p>

freight forwarders, ensuring that non-vessel operating common carriers are tariffed and bonded, 
ensuring that vessel owners or operators establish financial responsibility for death or injury to 
passengers or other persons on voyages to and from U.S. ports, and indemnification of passengers 
for the nonperformance of transportation. </p>
<p><strong>TRADE--EXPORT PROMOTION</strong> </p>
<p>The House and Senate resolutions contain numerous reductions in the trade and international 
programs supported by the U.S. The Senate bill, for example, reduces export financing and trade 
promotion programs by $755 million in budget authority and $404 million in outlays over five years. 
International Labor Organization </p>
<p>Separate legislation might reduce the $64 million U.S. contribution to the International Labor 
Organization to $53 million in the House. </p>
<p>National Endowment for Democracy </p>
<p>The National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which encourages the development of 
democratic institutions overseas, such as labor organizations, might be cut. The funding of 
International Institutes of the AFL-CIO could be vulnerable under a foreign aid authorization bill. </p>

jointly by the Agriculture Department and the State Department's Agency for International 
Development. Food is provided to the countries through low- interest, long-term loans and grants. 
The Senate proposes reducing PL480 food aid by $386 million in outlays over five years. The 
House also proposes reducing aid to the former Soviet Union and to Eastern Europe. </p>
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong> </p>
<p>Industrial Technology Services $181 Eliminate </p>
<p>This activity of the U.S. Department of Commerce supports the extension of technology to 
American industry and fosters the development of broad based high-risk technology by industry. 
The advanced technology program is the focus of a national effort to help accelerate the 
commercialization of technologies with commercial potential to stimulate economic growth. The 
manufacturing extension partnership emphasizes the role of the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) in transferring technologies to smaller businesses and extension services. A 
quality program extends U.S. competitiveness through quality technology development and 
information transfer. </p>
<p><strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong> </p>
<p>Federal funding for National<br>
Endowment for Arts and <br>
Humanities $351 Eliminate </p>
<p>National Endowment for the Arts programs encourage individual and institutional development of 
the arts, preservation of American artistic heritage and availability of the arts. The National 
Endowment for Humanities improves the quality of education and teaching in the humanities. </p>
<p>National Service Program $790 Eliminate </p>
<p>Encourages community service programs for education, public safety, human needs and the 
environment. Does so without displacing workers and helps participants pay for their education. </p>
<p>Welfare </p>
<p>The Senate cuts $47 billion from AFDC over five years, while the House appears to incorporate 
most of the measures in the welfare bill the House passed earlier this year, which aimed at saving 
$66 billion by 2000. There is the danger that under a radical change it would no longer be an 
entitlement, but be reduced to a block grant administered by the states. Substantial costs would be 
shifted to the states or else benefit levels could fall if the total assistance was reduced significantly. 
Organized labor has favored reform of welfare, but including safeguards and measures to make a 
reasonable transition for welfare recipients to work. Labor has expressed serious concern about 
the possibility of displacement of current workers. There may well be a shortage of jobs for welfare 
recipients in view of the large number of those unemployed and underemployed at present. Care 
needs also be taken so that reform is not punitive. </p>
<hr>
<p>APPENDIX B </p>
<p><a name="B"><strong>FEDERAL REGULATIONS TARGETED BY THE BUDGET RESOLUTION</strong></a> </p>
<p>The Republican-led budget assault on the federal government also includes a slash-and-burn attack 
on protections of safety, health and social concerns adopted over the years. The House and Senate 
Budget Resolutions contain assumptions about the repeal of the Davis-Bacon and the Service 
Contract Act labor protections. These laws assure that the government's power of procurement of 
construction or services is not used to undercut prevailing wages. In addition, the House resolution 
contains a list of federal regulations and mandates that, in their estimation, &quot;warrant elimination of 
reform.&quot; The House Budget Committee, which considers these regulations the most &quot;expensive and 
onerous,&quot; encourages authorizing and appropriations committees to wipe out or cripple these 
regulations, among others. </p>
<p>OSHA Ergonomics Rule. This would require employers to address repetitive motion injuries, 
injuries due to repeated hand, wrist, or other physical motions that cause of aggravate 
musculoskeletal disorders. </p>
<p>Worker Protection Standards. The Environmental Protection Agency issues worker protection 
standards under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act in 1992 and EPA has 
since ordered enforcement. The rule covers farmers in areas of safety, training, decontamination, 
information posting, emergency assistance, and worker reentry into fields after pesticides are 
applied. </p>
<p>Fall Protection. These construction regulations, drawn by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration in order to reduce accidents and injuries, safeguard workers and apply when 
employees are working high above the ground. </p>

balers or compactors, since it is hazardous work. </p>
<p>Comprehensive Occupational Safety and Health Programs. The Occupational Safety and Health

<p>The Community Reinvestment Act. This act requires depository institutions to reinvest a portion of 
depositors' funds back into the communities they came from in order to address unfair local 
community redlining. </p>
<p>Job Service Requirement. Under the Job Training Partnership Act, states must provide job 
placement services for men, women, and youths, with special priority for veterans. The Job Service 
also must maintain a national network to clear employer job openings statewide and between states

<p>Discussion Paper </p>
<h2>NAFTAmath</h2>
<h3>After Peso Devaluation in Mexico: A Tale of Two Countries</h3>
<h4>It was the best of times. . . . </h4>
<p>Five months after the meltdown of the peso, Mexican government
officials are making the claim the worst is over and that the
austerity package imposed on Mexico as part of the financial
bailout is yielding results. Mexico's finance ministry points to
a $540 million first quarter 1995 overall trade surplus thanks in
good part to the drop in import purchasing power and the surge in
exports. The Mexican stock market, the bolsa, has bounced back 30
percent to the 2000 level and has recovered some of the losses of
1994. The free- falling peso has stabilized in the past month and
now hovers near 6 pesos to the dollar. </p>
<p>Since the devaluation of the peso, exports from Mexico,
approximately 80 percent of which go to the U.S. are booming.
Overall exports in March grew 32 percent over the same period
last year to give Mexico a $460 trade surplus for the month. The
export boom was fueled by a 74 percent increase in mining
exports, a 70 percent increase in agricultural exports and a 29
percent increase in manufactured exports. Exports were notable in
the textile, chemical and mining industries. The U.S. trade
balance with Mexico continues to worsen and totalled a $3.8
billion deficit for the first quarter. </p>
<p>Contrary to NAFTA proponents who claimed that the agreement
would eliminate the need for the maquiladora assembly plants
located along the U.S. border, as many as 160 new maquiladoras
are likely to be established in 1995-96, according to a new study
by the forecasting service, WEFA. WEFA estimates that the number
of maquiladora jobs will rise by more than 130,000 to total
710,000 by the end of next year. </p>
<p>The maquiladora expansion confirms that producing in peso
denominated costs and selling in the U.S. for dollars is very
profitable for multinational firms operating along the
U.S.-Mexico border. William Smith of KPMG Peat Marwick claims,
&quot;You'll never get a better deal if you're buying a company
in Mexico where the costs of parts are extremely low and where
prices are lower than ever.&quot; After peso devaluation,
multinational employers in the maquilas will realize an annual
windfall of more than $750 million from lower labor costs. </p>
<hr>
<p>Top executives of U.S. companies producing in Mexico for the
U.S. market are well rewarded beyond the dreams of their Mexican
employees. In at least one case, the CEO's compensation was worth
far more than the companies entire annual Mexican payroll. Allied
Signal CEO Lawrence Bossidy took home $12.4 million last year,
while the company's 3,800 Mexican employees combined made an
estimated $7.8 million. At Ford, CEO Alex Trotman made $8.1
million, more than 2,000 times the annual pay of an average Ford
employee in Mexico. Ford has about 10,000 workers in its Mexican
assembly plants. </p>
<h4>It was the worst of times. . . .</h4>
<p>Things are much worse for ordinary Mexicans. With credit
tight, prices soaring, and hundreds of thousands of jobs already
gone, the peso's stabilization against the dollar won't mean much
to Mexicans struggling to survive. The real Mexican economy -
namely workers and small to medium-sized businesses - are
suffering their worst crisis in decades. </p>
<p>When stock market analysts and politicians say that the
Mexican economy is &quot;recovering&quot; what they mean is that
the speculative sector is stable. Christopher Walen of Legal
Research International warns, &quot;Unfortunately this has little
immediate or even long term benefit for or impact on the
productive sector where the majority of people live and the
income to service Mexico's foreign debt must be generated.&quot; </p>
<p>Official estimates of unemployment have doubled in the first
quarter. Most estimates are that 500,000-700,000 Mexican people
have lost jobs since the devaluation - the number is expected to
double before the end of the year. </p>
<p>The austerity measures imposed on Mexico as part of the
financial bailout include 35 percent hikes in fuel and energy
prices, raising the value added tax from 10 to 15 percent, and a
20 percent increase in electricity and gas billings. The
increased costs will hit hardest on those least able to pay. </p>
<p>Since most foreign made products are now out of their reach
following the peso devaluation, Mexican workers are primarily
concerned with real wages in pesos. During the Salines years of
1988 to 1994, the daily minimum wage in real terms fell from 10.9
pesos to 8.4 pesos. In 1995, with inflation expected to be 50-60
percent, Mexican workers will be hit by a substantial loss in
their standard of living. </p>
<p>Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee on May 24,
1995, Mexican businessman Javier Livas stated, &quot;I am
concerned that the enormous sacrifice to bring back foreign
investment will not have time to work and may easily end up in
unprecedented social unrest. The economic medicine may in fact
kill the patient. A dangerous feeling of helplessness is invading
the country.&quot; </p>
<p>One symptom of the economic crisis is the surge in the number
of street children. A 1992 U.N. survey estimated that 11,000
&quot;street children&quot; live in the Mexican capital,
consisting of homeless as well as those put on the streets by
their parents to bring home money. Today, there are 30,000 to
40,000 according to Jose Manuel Capellin, whose organization
operates eight shelters for children across Mexico City. </p>
<p>With the economic crisis already pushing Mexico to the limit
of its endurance, a severe drought across the northern half of
the country is killing hundreds of thousands of cattle, withering
crops and pushing the country deeper into debt with the U.S. The
loss of crops will eliminate crucial farming jobs at a time of
rising unemployment and, by forcing Mexico to import costly food
from abroad, could affect the county's ability to repay foreign
loans. In desperation, Mexico asked Washington's permission to
divert 26 billion gallons of water from the Rio Grande. Thus far,
the U.S. has declined. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Mexico City and Guadalajara, the country's two
largest cities, the extended dry season has contributed to record
setting pollution levels. Exceedingly high temperatures have
spurred a cholera epidemic in Tamaulipas and states further south
- triple the number of cases reported in 1994. </p>
<p>Another result of the economic crisis is the increase in
lawlessness. Shippers say truck hijackings in Mexico have
skyrocketed since peso devaluation. The surge in highway crime is
a big problem for business because 85 percent of the trade
between the U.S. and Mexico is carried by truck. The Mexican
police say 270 truck hijackings were reported on federal highways
alone in 1994, and there were many more on state and local roads. </p>
<h4>The worst is yet to come. . . . .</h4>
<p>The short term improvement in selected financial statistics
masks fundamental problems that indicate that the situation will
get worse in Mexico before it gets better. From mid-July to
mid-August, Mexico faces a &quot;payments bubble&quot; of $6.2
billion in short-term debt. The huge payout could put new
pressure on the peso. </p>
<p>Mexico's weaker banks are in big trouble - bad loans are
soaring to 10 percent of nearly $70 billion outstanding. Seven
banks have already had to borrow more than $1 billion from the
government to boost their capital to a minimum. And that
percentage is expected to grow in the second half of the year as
bankruptcies and unemployment multiply with the deepening
recession. The worry is that even strong banks will get so bogged
down in dealing with their troubled loans that they'll have few
spare resources to finance a recovery. Wealthy Mexican investors
took their money out of the country before the crash and have yet
to return. The U.S. bailout protected the interest of Wall Street
investors who purchased high-risk debt instruments in Mexico. </p>
<p>Predictions of the 1995 decline in economic output range from
the optimistic government estimate of -2 percent to the more
realistic private estimate of -5 percent. The economic
contraction will make it more difficult for Mexico to pay its
foreign debt, and increase the potential for social unrest at
home. </p>
<p>It is clear that NAFTA has provided the opportunity for
windfall profits for multinational companies exporting to the
U.S. under the protection of a free trade agreement. It is also
clear that the prosperity realized from increased trade has not
yet trickled down to the workers in Mexico. The peso devaluation
has precipitated an economic crisis for which the solution is to
once again squeeze the Mexican workers to the subsistence level
and below. So far, the combination of peso devaluation and NAFTA
has been detrimental to the interests of workers on both sides of
the border. </p>
<p>As a result of events following the enactment of the flawed
NAFTA, the AFL-CIO will work together with trade unionists from
other countries to make respect for basic worker rights and
standards a central feature of trade agreements in this
hemisphere. Addressing worker interests would clearly demonstrate
that movement toward freer trade can be beneficial to the
majority of people and not just corporate and political elites. </p>
