<H1>The Borneo Connection</H1>

<P>On the Baram River, in the rainforest of Borneo, beneath towering  broadleaf
trees, is a seventy-two-door longhouse called 
<A HREF="visituma.html">Uma Bawang.</A>  Several thousand
miles away, on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, is a small city boarderd on
the east by hills covered with pine and eucalyptus, and on the west by a
waterfront which looks through the Golden Gate.  In 1991, these two communities
were 
<A HREF="mayor.html">united</A> as sister
cities. </P>   

<P>

</B [IMG SRC="woman-basket.gif" ALT="Woman holding
basket" ALIGN="left"]>

Most
of the people of Uma Bawang are Kayans, one of the indigenous tribes of
Borneo who have lived in the rainforest for thousands of years, raising hill rice
and hunting wild boar.  Today the  Kayans are fighting to save the rainforest. 
Logging companies, many owned by relatives of highly placed officials in the
Malaysian Government, are clear-cutting their home, the world's oldest
rainforest, destroying species which have yet to be identified, and greatly
damaging the cultural fabric of the native people.</P>

<P>The people of Uma Bawang are not letting their forest, their way of life, and
their future be bulldozed without a struggle.  Against tremendous odds they are
fighting the logging companies with non-violent, but very assertive means.  They
write formal letters of protest to the government, they file suit in court, and
when all else fails they blockade the logging roads. In the past few years 346
native people have been arrested for forming human blockades.</P>

<P>However, the native people's pleas for the recognition of their human rights
have not been met with the greatest responsivenes in the Malaysian courts. 
They, like the indigenous people of many countries, must rely on the uncertain,
but not entirely impotent court of international public opinion.  In the late
1980s, the Malaysian government considered all environmentalists to be
subversives. Though he had broken no laws, Harrison Ngau, a native leader and
organizer with Friends of the Earth, was kept under house arrest for over a year
because of his environmental activism.  International pressure resulted in his
release, and in 1991 he was elected to the National Parliment as the
representitive of Sarawak, Borneo.</P>

<P>The Borneo Project is committed to fight for similar change.  We are a group
of citizens concerned with the destruction of rainforests and its attendent
destruction of native cultures.  The purpose of our group is to apply the
technques of citizen diplomacy to the arena of environmental politics through 
cultural exchanges, personal contacts, direct support and the power of the media.
We have witnessed the people of Uma Bawang mount a curageous struggle to save
their forest and control their destiny.  The Borneo Project is committed to support them as they now reach out to surrounding communities who face similar struggles. </P>

<H1><CITE>For Earth's Sake: The Life and Times of David Brower</CITE></H1>

<H2>Volume 1 of David R. Brower's autobiography</H2>

<H3><I>A Peregrine Smith Book, published in 1990 by Gibbs Smith Publisher</I></H3>

<H3>556 pp., hardcover, $24.95</H3>

<H3>ISBN: 0-87905-013-6</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>&quotWhatever you can do,<BR>or dream you can do, begin it.<BR>

Boldness has genius,<BR>

power, and magic in it &quot<BR>

- Goethe</BLOCKQUOTE>



Theodore Roosevelt said he would rather wear out than rust out;  David Brower is doing 

neither.  Now in his late seventies, he reminds one of the most potent environmental 

activists of our time.<P>



Over the past fifty years, Brower was a leader in the campaigns to save the Grand Canyon, 

six national parks and seashores, and the national wilderness system.  But while he can also 

count scores of successes, he still grieves over the loss of Glen Canyon on the Colorado 

River, and his lack of foresight which could have saved it from the dam waters which now 

cover it.<P>



In <STRONG>For Earth's Sake</STRONG>, David Brower tells about the beginnings that awakened 

his young spirit to the challenge of the natural world, especially the steep parts.  He 

introduces his friends who challenged him most, including those who assisted his ouster as 

the Sierra Club's first executive director.  Among those who adjusted his thinking are Ansel 

Adams, Rachel Carson, William O. Douglas, and Loren Eiseley.  Selecting his favorite and 

little-known accounts of early struggles, reappraising them, augmenting them with humor and 

stories both poignant and revealing, Brower tells about one man's commitment to saving the 

earth.<P>



To protect the beauty of the planet and the splendor of its life and wild places, Brower's 

message to us all is Peace On and With the Earth!<P>



<HR>



<BLOCKQUOTE>&quotNothing I have heard from anybody else has so affected my thinking so 

deeply as what I heard from David Brower.. In a complex, technological world, it is 

astonishing that one man could make as much difference as he has made and is still 

making.&quot<BR>

- Charles Kuralt</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot[Brower is] the most effective conservation activist in the world today.&quot<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quotAn enriching book.  The archdruid at his best.&quot<BR>

- Lester Brown, President, Worldwatch Institute</BLOCKQUOTE>



As a climber, David Brower scaled many previously &quotinsurmountable&quot mountains.  As a 

conservationist, Brower has brought a mountaineer's determination and reverence for nature 

to his efforts to protect the Earth and educate its human inhabitants.  He has kept dams out 

of the Grand Canyon and loggers out of Olympic National Park, established the National 

Wilderness Preservation System, added seven new regions to the National Park System, 

and helped to foster a mind-set that questions careless growth.<P>



<IMG SRC="mntriv.jpg"

 ALIGN=RIGHT>



In <STRONG>Let the Mountains Talk, Let the Rivers Run</STRONG>, the &quotarchdruid&quot of modern 

environmentalism, the man the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> designated the most 

effective conservationist in the world, offers a tough, witty, and impassioned game plan &quotfor 

those who would save the Earth.&quot  Now eighty-two years old, Brower also recounts the 

highs and lows of his controversial career, sparing no politician or public figure, least of all 

himself.  He frankly discusses his mistakes, such as compromising on the destruction of 

Glen Canyon Dam, and the strategic flourishes that have earned him both fans and foes, 

including the full-page, in-your-face national newspaper ads that helped save the Grand 

Canyon by asking, &quotShould we also flood the Sistine Chapel so that tourists can get a better 

look at the ceiling?&quot<P>



Brower issues visionary yet practical CPR - Conservation, Preservation, and Restoration - for 

the future.  With these wittily formulated &quotoperating instructions&quot for our planet, he imagines 

an international Green Cross and an Earth Corps, and he describes healthy cities with 

boundaries and wildlife havens; the importance of wildness, redwoods, rain forests, and 

wood substitutes; &quotgreen&quot businesses and the &quotMisfortune 500.&quot  While offering strong 

criticism for those who would harm the Earth, he advises environmental organizations on 

how they might more effectively work to restore both the natural world and the hope of its 

peoples.



<HR>



<BLOCKQUOTE>&quotDavid Brower has been for many years a steady force of nature, drawing 

us to see the natural world as a nurturer, teacher, inspirer, and partner.  [He has] been a 

pathbreaker, not given to easy answers or ruinous compromises... a man of great insight 

who cares deeply for his world.&quot<BR>

- former President Jimmy Carter</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>&quotIn the debate over the Earth's vanishing wildness no voice is wiser, 

wittier, or more eloquent than David Brower's.  In <STRONG>Let the Mountains Talk</STRONG>, 

he offers a vision for the next century that is intelligent, timely, and perhaps, above all, 

attainable.  And he increases our stock of a resource that's in precious short supply these 

days: Hope.&quot<BR>

- Joe Kane, author of <STRONG>Running the Amazon</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>&quotThis is the testament of one of the few authentic sages of our time. 

Brower's voice is passionate, perfectly cadenced, humorous, and very wise.  And original: 

while most writers point to where we are, this one draws the map.&quot<BR>

<TITLE>MAP's history and goals</TITLE>

<H1>MAP's history and goals</H1>

<H2>By A. Quarto, MAP Director</H2>

Since its inception in April, 1992, the Mangrove Action Project has addressed
key issues surrounding the rapid loss of mangrove forests.  MAP has grown into
an effective, pro-active international campaign, combining vital information
and contact exchange with effective lobbying pressures via action alerts and
published articles.   Our determined efforts are now paying off, as our network
has expanded into 40 nations, including nearly 300 non-governmental
organizations (NGOs).  <P>

Its work to protect threatened mangrove forests has involved MAP in human
rights issues and local community organizing.  We have seen many excellent
examples of local community involvement in sustainable mangrove management.  In
Thailand, the Yad Fon Association,  has worked with great success in 17 coastal
communities. Community managed mangrove forests have been established in many
small  villages, offering a very positive model for surrounding communities to
follow.  Reforestation and conservation efforts have proven themselves in
increased fish yields and enhanced livelihoods for participating communities.
MAP's imperatives are to promote and protect mangrove forest ecosystems and to
support the rights of local peoples for sustainable resource management.  
Uncontrolled shrimp aquaculture expansion quickly became a key focus, when we
realized that vast tracts of mangrove forests were being permanently lost to
install shrimp ponds in many nations around the world. For four years, we have
worked to prove that this industry is unsustainable and massively destructive
in its present mode of operation. It adversely affects mangrove forests,
fisheries, wildlife, other natural coastal resources, and coastal communities. 
<P>

I am clarifying MAP's role  for two reasons:

<OL>

<LI> There are many recent new members to MAP's network, as well as
environmental groups who have recently taken up the mangrove issue, who may not
be familiar with MAP's history and goals.<P>

<LI> Over the past  year, a powerful  outcry against the shrimp farming
industry, driven by coalitions in Asia, India, and Ecuador, has begun to call
for a world boycott of farmed shrimp.  MAP is in a unique position to help
coordinate  international campaigns through its existing network.

</OL>

Through its network and information exchange, MAP will increase public
awareness towards halting this boom/bust enterprise from further unsustainable
expansion. It will collaborate with  groups in the North to ensure that unified
campaigns develop which look to Southern NGOs for direction.  We will continue
to work at the policy and research level to ensure that corrective measures are
applied, so that future developments which impact mangrove forests and other
coastal resources are ecologically sustainable and socially just.<P>

10400 Penang,  Malaysia.<P>

An increasing groundswell of social  discontent  is developing  in the Asian
region against the adverse  effects of shrimp aquaculture.  Community
organizations and  ecology groups  are intensifying their protests against  the
shrimp farms  in  various countries, including  India,  Bangladesh, Thailand,
Malaysia and the Philippines. The  issue  is not confined to Asia.  In Ecuador,
which is also  a major shrimp exporter, there is a  campaign  against
aquaculture, with some environmental groups calling for a boycott of farmed
shrimp.

<H2>Communities Countering the Negative Consequences of Aquaculture</H2>

<H3>Bangladesh</H3>

Thousands of farmers have suffered from  the invasion  of their rice lands by
aquaculture owners and  from destruction  or  damage to their rice crops  by
seepage  of saltwater  from  the shrimp ponds. Shrimp owners  have  been buying
up the rice farmers' infertile lands  very cheaply, rendering  them landless.
One study estimated  that  300,000 people were displaced from their farmlands
by aquaculture in the Stakhira region alone.<P>

Disputes  between farmers and aquaculture owners have  often led  to  violent
clashes, with the death of at least two villagers to date. One of them, Jaber
Ali, was killed by a bomb attack arranged by shrimp-farm owners. Many
communities,  supported by social organizations like  Nijera Kori,  are 
organizing to defend  themselves.  In  September 1994,  villagers took over 32
shrimp farms in Khunla  in  a dispute over a large tract of riceland.

<H3>India</H3>

A strong grassroots movement has developed in  the Eastern  coastal states,
where angry communities have  organized  to prevent  the  building  of  shrimp
ponds  and  to protect themselves from  gang  violence  caused by   aquaculture
companies.  In  Andra Pradesh, villagers at Kurru  attacked  aquaculture farms,
uprooting the pumps and breaching the bunds  of  the ponds...

<H3>Malaysia</H3>

Fishing communities have suffered big  declines in  fishcatch  due  to clearing
 of  mangroves  and   river pollution caused by aquaculture ponds.  In one
district alone (Kuala Muda), 3,000  fishermen have complained about loss of
income. In  the  state of Pahang (Malaysia), a 5,000-acre  eel  farm  destroyed
valuable  wetlands and caused many villages to suffer  water shortage  due  to
pumping of groundwater for the  farm.   In Kerpan village in Kedah state,
several hundred farmers  have protested against the acquisition of their
ricelands by  the state  for use by an aquaculture project. The  farmers  have
taken their case to court.

<H3>Ecuador</H3>

The fourth biggest cultured shrimp producer  in the   world,  the environmental
 group   Accion   Ecologica  in March 1995 called for a consumer boycott of
cultured   shrimp  because  the  industry had destroyed most of the mangrove
forests  in some of  the country's coastal regions.

<H2>Campaign  Against Unsustainable Aquaculture</H2>

The opponents of shrimp aquaculture have now  increased their collaboration. At
a meeting in Madras last May,  several groups  met to discuss their common
problems and decided  to launch  an  international  campaign  against
unsustainable aquaculture. At the same time, Indian organizations set up a
national People's Alliance Against the Shrimp Industry (PAASI).<P>

Recently, a cost-benefit analysis commissioned by the Indian Supreme  Court
concluded shrimp  aquaculture  in  two states  caused  more  economic  harm
than  good.  In  Andra Pradesh,  the social and environmental costs outweighed
the economic benefits by a ratio of four to one whilst in  Tamil Nadu  the
losses were one and a half times greater than the gains.<P>

Studies like these reinforce the community organizers' view that  a halt should
be placed, at least temporarily, on  the shrimp  farms.   And the international
 and regional agencies  giving technical  or  financial  support should reflect
on the ill effects of this industry.<P>

<TITLE>MAP: To Boycott Or Not To Boycott,  That Is The Question!</TITLE>

<H1>To Boycott Or Not To Boycott,  That Is The Question!</H1>

</H2>By A. Quarto</H2>

Over the years, MAP has held off on a boycott, believing that such action would
be premature in the Northern shrimp consuming nations, until a broader-based
consumer awareness existed.  Also, we have hoped for a solution driven
campaign, such as promoting an "eco" certified shrimp product.<P>

Another important reason  is that MAP looks for the directive for a boycott  to
come from our coalition, particularly those in the impacted nations.   Thus, we
have been waiting for our Southern Hemisphere network members to coalesce such
a directive and actively guide us in a unified strategy.   Some of our Southern
NGO associates have now begun promoting boycott campaigns targeted at their own
country's farmed shrimp exports.

<UL>

<LI>Ecuador: A boycott campaign was initiated by Accion Ecologica  last March,
calling for a ban on consumption of Ecuadorian farmed shrimp.<P>

<LI>India:  The Orissa Krushak Mahasangh, PREPARE, and the recently formed
Peoples Alliance Against Shrimp Industry (PAASI),   have all recently called
for a worldwide boycott.<P>

<LI>Honduras: CODDEFFAGOLF, based in Honduras, which works with over 140
fishing communities around the Gulf of Fonseca, has just announced their
support for a shrimp boycott.

</UL>

Other recent international actions:

<UL>

<LI>The International Network Against Unsustainable Aquaculture (INUA): A newly
formed group based out of  Malaysia, is working with many international NGOs,
and is developing a campaign with Northern groups to boycott farmed shrimp in
the near future.<P>

<LI>Greenpeace International:  Greenpeace is considering initiating a shrimp aquaculture
campaign next year.<P>

<LI>United States:  A variety of U.S. groups have begun or expanded their
activities relating to mangroves and shrimp.  The Sea Turtle Restoration
Project, <A HREF="../strp/strpindx.html">STRP</A>, recently launched a "Turtle Safe Shrimp Campaign", targeting
trawler caught shrimp.   STRP mainly encourages trawler use of Turtle Excluder
Devices (TEDs) to protect sea turtles. STRP  thus promotes a "safe shrimp"
alternative for the commercial market.  Also, the Natural Resources Defense
Council, and the Environmental Defense Fund  have both dedicated staff to
research  the shrimp aquaculture industry.<P>

<LI>Canada:  Sierra Club Canada has asked that MAP help them launch an
international consumer awareness campaign that could lead to a boycott.<P>

<LI>Europe:  Sweden has already launched a boycott of aquaculture shrimp. 
Calls for a boycott     have also arisen in Switzerland during the past year.

</UL>

Since MAP is at the forefront of mangrove forest issues,  it must form a clear
position at this crucial period.  Our efforts to publicize the issues are
succeeding, spurring other groups to call for stronger action.  However, we
must ensure that those Southern member NGOs most affected by such a boycott are
supportive before we act on your behalf.<P>

<H2>We really need comments</H2>

We really need comments from our associates regarding your information and
views on the boycott question!
Are you aware of past successes, or failures,
with boycott campaigns?<P>

Can you, or your organization, participate in a
consumer campaign by sending MAP regular updates and facts?<P>

Please provide MAP
with a position paper, and any supporting documentation.  Send it to our <A HREF="mailto:mangrove@earthisland.org,mangroveap@aol.com">email</A>
or postal address.  Vandana Shiva, India representative for Third World Network
and the Director of PAASI, is currently facilitating coordination with Asian
members; MAP comments may also be sent to her.<P>

<TITLE>MAP: Boycott Review: Get Ready For The Long Haul</TITLE>

<H1>Boycott Review: Get Ready For The Long Haul</H1>

<H2>K. Cissna and E. Johnson, MAP Staff</H2>

To boycott or not to boycott may be the question, but where do we go from
there?  Many a boycott has come and gone in the United States, most creating
less than a ripple, a few creating dramatic changes over time.  In order to
execute a boycott in the U.S., we must know several things:<OL>

<LI>In what sense have past political or legal efforts  failed, such that we
may believe that a boycott is justified?<P>

<LI>What do we want to achieve?<P>

<LI>What will our targets be?<P>

<LI>What strategies will be used?<P>

<LI>What are the guidelines and solutions that we will offer?

</OL>

Below we offer a few very brief sketches of boycotts in the U.S., looking at
what made them succeed, or fail:

<H2>Greenpeace Boycott of Icelandic Fish</H2>

Greenpeace initiated a boycott of Icelandic white fish to force the country to
comply with the IWC and stop whaling.  GP went after major restaurant chains,
with high-profile public images.  It was successful in getting Shoney's a large
chain in the U.S. South, to stop buying Icelandic fish.<P>

<B>Result:</B> Shortly after this large contract was canceled, the Icelandic
government  agreed to comply with the International Whaling Commission in
regard to its whaling practices.<P>

<B>Analysis:</B>  Iceland was singled out, among other nations that also sell white
fish; thus, the restaurant chains were not being asked to eliminate a product,
but simply to buy elsewhere.  Iceland was particularly vulnerable, because its
economy is dominated by fish exports,  which are its main export revenue
source.  The whaling issue was well developed in public awareness in the United
States.  After the contract was canceled with Shoney's, Iceland was clearly
afraid that other buyers would follow suit, and this fear brought the
government to the bargaining table. Also, the campaign relied upon working with
an established international commission, the IWC, which exerted political
pressure on Iceland to comply with the  <I>international policies  previously
established</I> by the IWC.

<H2>RAN Boycott of Rainforest Beef</H2>

Rainforest Action Network (RAN) launched a national boycott against Burger King
to force the restaurant chain to stop buying beef raised in destroyed tropical
rainforests. The  boycott included a massive direct mailing campaign, full page
advertisements in major national newspapers, and hundreds of protests in front
of high-traffic restaurants, often near university campuses.  The dynamic and
creative protests were carried out mainly by "RAGs",  local groups of
Rainforest Action Network activists, in more than 50 cities across the U.S.  
In addition, activists showed up at business promotional events, board
meetings, and media conferences, in a "dogged pursuit" of the corporate giant.<P>

<B>Result:</B> Public response was strong.  Many restaurants saw a measurable decline
in the lunch customers, and media attention grew increasingly negative.  
Restaurant managers began complaining to corporate headquarters.  Burger King
announced that its restaurants would no longer serve "rainforest beef".<P>

<B>Analysis:</B>   In addition to expending considerable resources, this boycott
targeted a corporation with a very high consumer profile, therefore very
vulnerable to criticism.   According to Mike Roselle, board member of RAN, "the
threat to their good name was more important than saving a few cents on cheap
beef".   Rainforest Action Network has  had limited success with its ongoing
Mitsubishi boycott.   Mitsubishi does not rely as heavily upon a public image
as a restaurant chain.   Yet, in both cases, RAN  inititated dialogue with the
targeted corporations from the outset of its campaign, and has continued to
offer to talk about differences and proposed solutions.   Lastly, the beef
boycott occured at the same time that the public diet was beginning to shift
away from its love affair with beef because it was linked to heart disease and
other health problems for the consumer.

<H2>Boycott of General Electric & Nestle</H2>

A boycott of General Electric was initiated by INFACT in 1984, and ended in
1993, to protest the corporation's nuclear defense contracts.  The boycott
focused on getting large medical facilities and hardware stores to stop buying
GE products. Greenpeace and other groups also urged citizens to boycott GE.  A
centerpiece of the campaign was a video, "Deadly Deception", which won an
Academy Award for best short documentary.<P>

<B>Result:</B>   In 1993, GE sold all its shares in nuclear defense contracts.<P>

<B>Analysis:</B>  "A long and tortuous struggle", the INFACT boycott never had the
public impact of "rainforest beef".  Yet, their strategy of developing allies
among major buyers of GE products was more successful and less costly than a
major national public outreach.  What really put the boycott over the edge was
the tremendous success of the short documentary.  Upon receiving the academy
award, the video's producers said "boycott GE" on national television, and
shortly thereafter, GE announced its decision.<P>

INFACT calls its boycott of <I>Nestle</I> Corp. for selling infant formula
banned in the U.S. to African nations,  a "pseudo-success".  In response to a
very public citizen oriented campaign, which was widely covered by the media,
Nestle told the public it would stop.  INFACT accordingly dropped its boycott. 
However,  in practice, the corporation continued this and other unethical
practices in the Third World.  Now, there is another watchdog group hounding
Nestle's heels.



<H2>Earth Island's "Dolphin Safe Tuna" and "Turtle Safe Shrimp"</H2>

The <A HREF="../strp/strpindx.html">Sea Turtle Restoration Project</A>'s (STRP)
"Turtle-Safe Shrimp" campaign has similarities to  the dramatic "<A
HREF="../immp/immp.html">Dolphin-Safe Tuna</A>" campaign.  This campaign
obtained industry co-partners who agreed to abide by new rules.  The businesses
who did not change were boycotted, while those who did were rewarded with
public promotion.  Both campaigns rely upon their own certification process to
identify eco-friendly enterprises.<P>

<B>Result:</B> The dolphin safe tuna campaign, while having various problems,
has still been one of the most successful boycotts in the environmental
movement. At this point, the Turtle-Safe Shrimp campaign looks a  little more
problematic, but still very promising.<P>

<B>Analysis:</B>  One immediate reason  for success is that the U.S. public has
a great affection for dolphins.   The <A
HREF="../immp/immp.html">Dolphin-Safe</A> success was built on a simple
campaign design:  the tuna industry has only a few major
processors/distributors (Starkist, Bumblebee, etc.), whose public image is
carefully nurtured.  The market process for trawled shrimp, on the other hand,
is a maze of entry points, distributors, and buyers.  Shrimp  are much more
difficult  to track, identify , and certify, than tuna.   Another  problem with
STRP's shrimp campaign is that the current demand for  the turtle-safe product
is much higher than the available supply.    Several fine restaurants in the
San Francisco area are now lining up for turtle-safe shrimp, but only one
trawling outfit has completed its certification with <A
HREF="../strp/strpindx.html">STRP</A>.  The campaign began its consumer
campaign strategies before it was able to fully develop its certification
program with the shrimp trawling industry.  However, an  increase in
participating businesses is expected soon.

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

These examples indicate that successful boycotts must focus on targets which
are susceptible to public opinion, and which are also vulnerable economically,
such as Iceland's dependence on its fish exports.   A boycott is a blunt
instrument, relying on rapid public response.  Thus, it  must get across a 
fairly simple idea, if it is meant for mainstream public consumption.  The
early and continual use of dialogue with industries and government agencies, in
order to articulate and achieve clear goals, is important.  Rewarding
cooperative participants, while boycotting others, can bring powerful allies
and  pro-active solutions to campaigns.<P>

In most cases, a boycott is by no means an overnight reality, but rather a
commitment that may take many years.  Some successful boycotts have followed
well developed public awareness programs, but on review, this hasn't been
necessary in all cases.   Exclusively "boycott" campaigns have generally fallen
out of popularity with an increasingly cynical public in the U.S.    Yet,
sometimes the function of a boycott is more political than economic: the threat
of a boycott alone can bring governments, industries, and institutions to the
bargaining table.<P>

Any time a Northern group effects a boycott on a product from a developing
country, there are issues of discrimination, economic stability, and national
sovereignty.   Some MAP members have refused to support a boycott in the past
because it would create a negative backlash on their ability to work within
their nations.   If we are able to find a sustainable shrimp product to
endorse, will other members think it worthwhile to promote  producers from one
or two nations and punish the rest?<P>

We apologize that all the examples above are from the U.S.  They are meant as a
starting point, to raise some brainstorming questions.  We hope that
inernational MAP members will let us know your views and strategies.  MAP aims
hold a meeting in the U.S. in 1996, to facilitate Northern groups' coordination
 on shrimp/mangrove campaigns, and to present direction from the South.

<H1>Regional Updates</H1>

<H2>Africa</H2>

<H3>Urgent Alert: Shrimp Industry Vying for African Coasts--Cheap Labor,
Unpolluted Waters Are Enticements</H3>

"During the remainder of this decade the absolute gap between the average
salary of people in Africa and those in Asia will continue to grow. As a
partial result, Asian aquaculture entrepreneurs will find it increasingly
commercially attractive to develop aquaculture production units in Africa,
using a favorable physical environment, African labor, Asian technology and
capital from Asia or elsewhere..." (<I>The State Of World Fisheries And
Aquaculture</I>, FAO Fisheries Department Report, Rome, 1995, pg. 38)<P>

<H3>Message about Africa from MAP Director Alfredo Quarto</H3>

From the first days of MAP's formation, we have been aware of the rapid spread
of the shrimp aquaculture industry to new and relatively unspoiled shores. When
Taiwan's huge shrimp industry began deteriorating in the mid-1980s, due to
pollution and disease problems, astute industry investors began planting their
shrimp ventures along the coasts of unsuspecting neighboring nations. In the
early nineties, Thai shrimp entrepreneurs began to seek inroads into India,
Cambodia, Mexico, and other countries. And, in just a few years, India began
facing the same coastal pollution and habitat loss problems as Thailand.
Seemingly overnight, entire coastal villages have been displaced, left without
drinking water, or denied access to traditional fishing and food gathering
areas.<P>

As stated in the above mentioned FAO report, African nations may soon witness
the newest waves of shrimp farms aligning their rows of brackish water ponds
along coastlines. MAP urges our African members to help us sound the alarm
against unsustainable expansion of shrimp aquaculture. The same temptations of
tremendous profits, and increases in export earnings, which attracted other
nations, are bound to distract African government officials from the problems
associated with the industry.<P>

MAP encourages members to support African efforts at public outreach and
education As in Thailand, India, Ecuador, and elsewhere, far more than mangrove
forests are at stake here. The entire natural resource base along coastal
regions will be negatively affected, including the likely irreparable
disruption and displacement of countless coastal communities by a relatively
short-lived business venture.<P>

Please join us in this latest battle to protect mangrove forest ecosystems and
those coastal communities which depend on these invaluable resources. At
present, MAP has just a few members from Kenya, Ghana, Tanzania, and Senegal.
Pass the newsletter along, or let us know of individuals, NGOs, or institutions
in Africa who may wish to join MAP.

<H3>Burma - Thai-Burmese Joint Fisheries Venture </H3>

"Burma's Department of Fisheries and Thailand's NGO Asian Fishery Industries
Co. have formed a joint venture to fish and process marine product, produce
fishmeal and raise prawns. The department holds 40% of Myanma Narong Fishery
Industries, with a registered capital of 120 million Kyats (Burmese currency)."
(from the <I>Bangkok Post</I>, 20-June-95) Thai shrimp industry investors have
been courting other nations for international business partnerships aimed at
shrimp farming.<P>

The Thai companies entice Burma and other governments with promises of huge
returns on initial investments, neglecting to accurately relate the downside of
shrimp aquaculture. In fact, in many instances, Thai industry reps have
misstated that pollution and disease problems are well under control in
Thailand.<P>

<H3>Thailand- The MIDAS REPORT-Disease, Sustainability Problems</H3>

This year an important World Bank funded study on the sustainability of
Thailand's shrimp aquaculture industry was released. The report also contains a
critical analysis of Thailand's $30 million program for mangrove replanting.
Commissioned by the Thai government, the private consulting firm MIDAS
undertook an intensive analysis of the shrimp industry. Its unabashed report is
extremely important in that it draws some key conclusions. Following are some
excerpts from this report:

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Until now shrimp aquaculture has not been sustainable anywhere in
Southeast Asia. A four year project by the Institute of Aquaculture of the
University of Stirling has concluded:<P>

'An analysis of the development the intensive shrimp farming industry in
southeast Asia...has highlighted the historical unsustainability of the
industry....the unsustainable nature of the Thai intensive shrimp industry has
resulted in decreasing pond production, increased crop and farm failure...and
environmental and socio-economic degradation.."(pg. 49, <I>MIDAS Report</I>,
1995)<P>

"Of the total shrimp pond area it is estimated that more than 31,000 rai is in
encroached mangrove forest. The relevant government agencies seem to have had
no success in preventing clearing of protected forests. Mangroves are still
being encroached...This loss of extensive mangrove areas represents a
significant deterioration in the quality of the coastal environment....On the
basis of the above evidence it would be unrealistic to expect that in the short to mid-term small-scale aquaculture
will be operated in anything other than a deteriorating or degraded coastal
environment..." (<I>Ibid</I>, pgs. 53 and 54)</BLOCKQUOTE>

The report also concludes that Thailand's mangrove reforestation efforts are an
expensive failure, prone from the beginning to bad planning due to lack of
insight among government officials involved in the program This important
conclusive study is verified by other studies, which combined confirm that
Thailand's ride on the crest of the great wave of shrimp industry profit may
soon come to an abrupt end, as was the case in Taiwan just a decade before.

<BLOCKQUOTE> "...The shrimp farming industry in Thailand is reaching, if not
exceeding, its geographical boundary and ecological carrying capacity. The
concept and reality of 'limits to growth' is a hard fact which must be
recognized by all parties concerned..." ( from "Progression of Intensive Marine
Shrimp Culture in Thailand", by C. Kwei Lin, pg. 22, of Shrimp Farming Industry
In Thailand,1995).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Paradeep Convention and Save The Coast Movement</H3>

On October 15th, The Save the Coast Movement organized a large convention at
Paradeep Port, in Orissa, India. Around 5,000 coastal fishers and farmers
attended. MAP Director Alfredo Quarto attended as the guest speaker. The
convention was organized by the Indian NGO, Orissa Krushak Mahasangh.<P>

Paradeep Convention was dedicated to the two fishers who were shot to death at
Adhuan village on January 13, 1995, while peacefully protesting against shrimp
farming in their area. Representative fisher groups from throughout Orissa
attended, as well as visiting groups from neighboring coastal states. Many
speakers took the podium that day, and there were many emotionally charged
speeches. The Paradeep Convention represented a milestone in the fledgling Save
The Coast Movement.<P>

After only four years of intensive shrimp farm expansion along India's coasts,
the industry has destroyed vast stretches of once productive mangrove forests,
and has contaminated both land and water resources, creating tremendous
hardships for traditional coastal dwellers. Shrimp industry hired thugs have
tried to suppress the growing sentiments of popular resistance. These so-called
"prawn mafias" were responsible for many terrorist-style actions against
peaceful protests, including beatings, shootings, and arson.<P>

A more unified grassroots resistance was required in India. The Paradeep
Convention represented such a step taken along the long road to political and
social democracy. The following excerpt is taken from the Declaration of the
Paradeep Convention:

<BLOCKQUOTE> "This convention of the coastal people under the banner of Save
The Coast Movement, particularly of agriculturists, agriculture labourers and
fishermen community, resolves to carry on a determined struggle against
indiscriminate proliferation of brackish water prawn culture and urges upon the
people to mobilize themselves and strengthen the organizational base at
grassroots level to defeat the nexus between prawn entrepreneurs,
administrators and politicians....<P>

" The convention further calls upon the affluent countries to boycott prawn
import for consumption, which is nothing but the blood, sweat and livelihood of
the common people of the Third World countries..."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>India Supreme Court Decision Pending</H3>

India's Supreme Court will, or may already have made a precedent setting
decision on extensive measures to greatly restrict shrimp farming along the
coasts of India. Among the nearly 14 pages of proposed guidelines, there are
requirements that no shrimp farms be built in natural mangrove areas, in
ecologically sensitive wetlands, or on productive agricultural lands. Also,
access to the sea must not be restricted by the shrimp ponds and waters from
underground aquifers cannot be used in the aquaculture process.<P>

The Indian recommended measures would go far in restricting this otherwise
runaway industry. However, a strong lobbying effort by the powerful shrimp
investors may succeed in blocking this timely move. Supreme Court action, if
taken, will set a very positive example for other nations beset with similar
issues. Already, the temporary injunction against further shrimp aquaculture
expansion in three coastal states has caused a stir.<P>

M. C. Mehta is the courageous lawyer pushing for legal reform of the shrimp
industry. The press calls him "India's Green Warrior" because of his successful
and undaunting record battling environmental issues of significance in India's
Supreme Court. Mehta has won several precedent setting cases in the past,
including cleaning up pollution affecting the Ganges River, and cleaning up the
polluted air corroding the famous Taj Majal.<P>

Since Mehta became involved in the shrimp aquaculture case, he has received
several death threats via the mail and telephone, but he is determined to carry
on his important work. He states that any laws passed will need popular support
to ensure their enforcement. Even with the temporary injunction against further
shrimp farm developments, there have been several incidents of non-compliance.
These infractions have been opposed by local coastal residents. In a personal
interview Mehta described the remarkable courage of those Indian fishers and
farmers who have risked their lives in their continued non-violent resistance
to the shrimp farm 'mafias". Some have physically placed themselves in front of
the bulldozers to stop the illegal building of new ponds.<P>

As he has done many times in the past, Mehta has taken on this case pro-bono.
MAP is assisting his important efforts by supplying him with needed documents
and contacts to help further substantiate his case in the Court.

<H3>Sri Lanka - Massive Popular Outreach</H3>

There is a growing popular movement in Sri Lanka to curb the expansionary
appetite of commercial shrimp farming ventures. A massive poster and leafleting
campaign recently passed out around 35,000 leaflets in the southern province.
The outreach was organized because the government had issued permits to
establish shrimp culture on 3,000 additional acres of coastal lands in the
vicinity of important fishing lagoons and fragile wetlands areas in the south.
Of the estimated 8,000 total acres of mangrove forested lands found in Sri
Lanka in 1982, only a small fraction still exists in the northwestern province.
Much of the regions' mangrove forests were lost to shrimp ponds. According to a
report received from the Environmental Foundation Limited in Sri Lanka, "There
are about 10,000 acres of legal and illegal prawn culture areas, and now their
productivity has gone down due to the pollution and other environmental
problems as well as the bacteria diseases. Now they are looking for alternative
lands from southern province.<P>

"... we are trying to stop their effort and.. have big support from the public
in that area..." (from an e-mail message sent by Hemantha, Senior Environmental
Scientist for EFL)

<H2>Latin America</H2>

<H3>Mexico - World Bank Loan Proposal Postponed For Further Study</H3>

The World Bank's proposed $50 million or more loan to develop Mexico's
aquaculture industry has again been postponed. The Bank is permitting a longer
review process to take place via the NGOs involved in the process. MAP is
providing relevant documents and information on the issues of aquaculture and
coastal resources internationally to help broaden the analysis.

<H3>Ecuador - Smoke and Mirrors: Ecological Reserve, and Shrimp Farms Too</H3>

<H4>K. Cissna, Latin America Coordinator</H4>

MAP visited Ecuador in November to
investigate NGO and government efforts to resolve the mangrove crisis. Accion
Ecologica's call for a boycott last March had produced some action towards a
long hoped for ecological reserve in the northern province of Esmeraldas.
Unfortunately, the final product, announced by the government in October, is a
grave disappointment to most of the NGOs working on the coast. While the entire
region of Cayapas-Mataje has been declared an "ecological reserve", the zone
has actually been classified in different potential uses, leaving most of the
total land area "exempt" from the more stringent ecological prohibitions. The
actual protected area includes the fringe of mangroves along coastlines and
river mouth estuaries, and a buffer of between 50 to 100 meters between
mangrove trees and other vegetation.<P>

Some interesting progress has been made in setting up zone committees which
include the NGOs, industry, affected coastal people, and government agencies,
to help increase enforcement of the laws and resolve conflicts among user
groups. However, while these committees have been somewhat effective in the
south, to the north in Esmeraldas, coastal people feel betrayed and ruined by
the current situation. Essentially, the reserve is worse than no reserve,
because it provides a premise for shrimp farming expansion in the north.<P>

In Muisne, Esmeraldas province, over 90% of the mangroves have been destroyed
since 1986, even while a series of laws protected the mangroves on paper. The
local NGO is cynical of the government's commitment to, and capability of,
keeping aquaculturists within the newly prescribed perameters in the province. Coastal
fishers and NGO leaders have taken it upon themselve to physically, at their
own expense, bring forestry officials to sites of illegal mangrove cuts so that
they will be forced to do their jobs and arrest the transgressors. Villagers
have stood in front of bulldozers on occasion, paralyzing pond construction.<P>

Meanwhile, villages further north, who are most likely to be affected by new
developments, have become much better organized over the past year. The crisis
situation has brought various environmental groups into the fray; local groups
are trying to activate their impoverished members into a unified campaign to
demand a halt to further shrimp farming expansion in the northern "gem" of
mangrove forest ecosystem.<P>

What is striking about the Ecuadorian situation is the lack of facts. We were
surprised to repeatedly find that technical studies do not exist which would
analyze the impacts of developments, capacity of the land area, extent and
causes of fisheries declines, and various other environmental and social costs.
Although satellite photo analysis of geographic changes is supposed to be
completed every other year, some documents utilize satellite data from 1989, or
1991, as their most current information. Both environmental groups and the
government are thus working in the dark, even while drafting laws and
declarations which will have a profound impact on Ecuador's future, and the
immediate survival of coastal peoples.<P>

<B>"Clown" Study Pushes Aquaculture Agenda:</B> Two rushed studies have been
completed in the past year, for the purpose of establishing the ecological
reserve. However, while both studies were inadequate, there they part company.
The first was produced by a technical institute, EcoCiencia, which bid and won
a government contract to do the reserve study. EcoCiencia took 45 days to
investigate the area, travelling by canoe and outboard boats to reach
inaccessible areas.<P>

When EcoCiencia's results came out, the National Aquaculture Chamber was
displeased. The Chamber paid another private team to produce a second study to
counter the first. This study, utilizing a technical team from Petroleum
Services of Ecuador, Inc. (SERPET) and led by a Dr. Roger Fay, of Texas A & M
University, was accomplished after just 9 days in the area in question.
According to the Quito-based IUCN South America Wetlands Director, Tarcicio
Granizo, the report is a "clown study", which blatantly pushes the agenda of
the Chamber at great environmental and social cost. When EcoCiencia examined
the findings of the Dr. Carlos Valle, the biologist hired by SERPET, it found
that in many instances, Dr. Valle's reccomendations were ignored in the final
study. Among the Chamber study's claims:

<UL>

<LI>"mangroves are...of a low diversity"<P>

<LI>"the ecosystem of the mangrove is exremely resistent, with a great capacity
to support contamination...(it) is not fragile..."<P>

<LI>"The direct nutrition from the mangrove trees to aquatic organisms is
restricted."<P>

<LI>"The mangrove ecosystem generally does not contain species in danger of
extinction; there are some exceptions, but not in Ecuador...it is not a unique
habitat for permanent or migratory species"<P>

<LI>"It is not an attractive scene aesthetically such as one would find in
coral reefs"<P>

</UL>

Meanwhile, Dr. Valle concluded that, " the area offers an opportunity to see
one of the best and most exuberant examples of mangroves existing in the
Eastern Pacific...a high diversity of animal species, especially native birds
and 19 migratory species, and various species in danger of extinction,
including the coastal crocodile, tigrillo, and others"<P>

Dr. Fay's vision of ecoturism for the zone:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The focus of tourism is provided by the introduction of large scale shrimp
cultivation...this signifies that the shrimp farms would be open and available
for tours."</BLOCKQUOTE>

EcoCiencia claims Dr. Fay's "simplistic and reductionist vision of the
mangrove" allows him to define the mangrove as the "gathering of plant
communities along the borders of tropical coasts". This definition permeates
the study's conclusions, which fail to address many ecological services
provided by mangroves, including its holistic role as a point of union,
interacting with sea, coastal land, ground waters, and atmosphere.<P>

Although the second study was paid for and commissioned by the very industry
which has an obvious agenda to promote shrimp culture development of the area,
its conclusions are forming the "scientific" basis for government policy in
Ecuador.<P>

Copies of the report summaries, and the commentaries of Dr. Fay and EcoCiencia,
are available from MAP. <I>We strongly encourage MAP's members, particularly
academic advisers, to take some time to read through these documents, and send
your comments to Ecuador.</I> To request your copies and Ecuadorian addresses,

<H3>Florida Everglades Supporters Seek a Two Cent Sugar Tax</H3>

By Bob Riley

According to local citizens, sugar farming has severely damaged and polluted
the entire ecosystem of the Florida Everglades, an irreplaceable mangrove
habitat . Local NGOs and business leaders ask that letters be sent to Senators
Leahy, Graham, Lugar and Specter, who sit on the commitment overseeing the
sugar tax. Below is a sample message:<P>

"I am writing to solicit your support for the Everglades restoration and the
proposed two cent tax on sugar. It is reasonable that those who use natural
resources for economic gain, and adversely impact the surrounding environment,
should help to bear the economic costs of sustaining that environment. Saving
the Everglades and other south Florida natural areas is crucial to the entire
region's economic health, according to the Commission on a Sustainable
Florida." (Mr. Riley is a resident of Melbourne Beach, Florida.)<P>

upcoming UNESCO conference ECOTONE V, which will be held in Ho Chi Minh City.
The theme of this conference, <I>"Community Participation in Conservation,
Sustainable Use and Rehabilitation of Mangroves in Southeast Asia,</I>" is
particularly relevant to MAP's work promoting community managed mangrove
forests.<P>

<H3>Bangladesh</H3>

An important international conference held from Nov. 9-11
1995, was organized by Nijera Kori, a Bangadeshi NGO, which addressed
international shrimp aquaculture expansion. This conference aimed to develop
strategies and a stronger regional network for Asian groups. Those wishing to
contact Nijera Kori to find out more about the conference or its papers can do
so at: P.O. Box 5015, New Market, Dhaka-1205, Bangladesh.

<H3>Legal and Regulatory Workgroup</H3>

The International Law Institute is

<H1>MAP's mission statement</H1>

<TITLE>MAP's mission statement</TITLE>

<H2>MAP objectives</H2>

The Mangrove Action Project (MAP), a project of
Earth Island Institute, is addressing the serious problems associated with
prawn aquaculture. MAP is a growing international coalition consisting of
environmental, human rights and community-based groups.  MAP coalition members
include organizations based both in threatened, and in industrialized nations,
where the cultured prawns are mainly consumed.  MAP is actively involved in
raising public awareness about these important issues.<P>

The Mangrove Action Project has three main objectives:<P>

<UL>

<LI>To raise worldwide public awareness about the mangrove forests and
related issues.<P>

<LI>To help protect and restore the world's remaining mangrove forest areas.<P>

<LI>To protect and promote the rights of indigenous coastal peoples, including
fishers and farmers, especially in relation to indigenous people retaining
their rights to sustainably manage their own coastal resources.<P> </UL>


Mangrove Ecosystems Provide:<P>

<UL><LI>Sheltered nursery and spawning grounds for much of the world's costal
marine life.<P>

<LI>Vast quantities of forest detritus, ensureing rich nutrients for sea
life.<P>

<LI>Needed protection of shorelines from erosion by waves and storm action. The
bracing roots of the mangroves protect sea grasses and coral reefs from
otherwise devastating siltation.<P>

<LI>Essential habitat for many varietites fo endangered species - rare birds,
<A HREF="../strp/strpindx.html">sea turtles</A>, manatees, and <A
HREF="../immp/immp.html">dolphins</A>.<P>

<LI> Natural resrouces for traditional costal fishers and farmers who depend on
a healthy mangrove ecosystem for their cultures and livelihoods.<P>

</UL> Mangrove forests are found in both the tropical and sub-tropical regions
of the world.  The widest range of mangrove species exists in tropical
Southeast Asia. Three species are found along Florida's coast.  It has been
estimated that there are over 40 million acres or about 16 million hectares of
mangrove forests remaining in three regions of the world.<P>

<UL><LI>Asia contains about 46% of the world's mangrove forests. (Indonesia has
the largest are of mangrove forests in the world with an estmated 12.2 million
acres, or about 4.9 million hectares.)<P>

<LI>The Americas have around 35%.<P>

<LI>Africa has nearly 17%.<P> </UL> <H2>All for the Sake of Prawns and
Profit</H2> Modern industrial development now threatens the world's remaining
mangroves. The greatest threat to mangroves is the aquaculture industry -
especially shrimp or prawn aquaculture.<P>

Costal pollution from other industries is also an increasing threat.<BR> The
charcoal industry regulary harvests large tracts of mangroves.<BR> Tourism
development often results in mangrove destruction.<P>

<H2>A Billion Dollar Nightmare</H2> Millions of coastal fishers and farmers are
also adversely affected by prawn farming. The prawn aquaculture industry often
clears vast areas of mangrove forests and coastal farmlands for the
construction of large artificial ponds. Huge quantities of prawns are raised
within these shallow, brackish water ponds.  (Approximately 80% are produced in
the Eastern Hemisphere.)<P>

The so-called "prawn fever" is a relatively new malady.  Yet it is rapidly
spreading along the world's mangrove-forested coast, leaving pollution and ruin
in its wake.  Prawn awuaculture has become a multi-billion dollar industry
financed by multi-national corporations and wealthy investors.<P>

Mangrove forests are being destroyed at an alarming rate to make way for theis
burgeoning export industry.  Often, on those same lands once rich with
mangroves, the profitable, but destructive, prawn farms are closed in just a
few years.  Insurmountable pollution problems eventually plague the ponds
themselves.<P>

Yet, big business investors, undaunted by the inevitable decline in proawn
production, simply reopen business elsewhere, always looking for new, as yet
unspoilt grounds to begin again.<P>

This scenario of destruction has visited the coasts of Taiwan, China,
Bangladesh, The Philippines, <A HREF="../gsc/thai.html">Thailand</A>,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Ecuador, Columbia, and many other countries.  And now, the
prawn industry is establishing footholds in Vietnam, Cambodia, Burma, Iran,
Yemen, Mexico, and other parts of Asia, Latin America and Africa.<P>

Each year total prawn production increases. Record years follow record years.
In 1992, nearly 700,000 metric tons of prawns were aqua-culturally produced
worldwide.  Presently, Japan and the U.S. are the world's top importers of
prawn products.<P>

<H2>The problem with prawn aquaculture</H2> Serious problems with prawn
aquaculture include:<P>

<UL><LI> Destruction of the world's remainging mangrove forests.<P>

<LI>Loss of invaluable wildlife habitat, thus further threatening endangered
species and bio-diversity.<P>

<LI>Serious declines in world's tropical coastal fisheries.<P>

<LI> Poisoning both coastal waters and adjacent farmlands with dangerous
additives and antibiotics found in prawn feeds resulting in further serious
declines in food productivity contributing to food shortages for indigenous
peoples.<P>

<LI>Salinization and pollution of nearby ground waters, including drinking
water.<P>

<LI>Reduction in available protein for local communities becomign nealy 90% of
aquaculture raised prawns are exported.<P>

<LI>Deaths, injuries and property damage associated with denuded coastlines
where natural protective buffer zones once provided by the mangroves were
removed to make way for encroaching prawn farms.<P>

<LI>Massive problems of coastal destabilization, including heavy erosion and
siltation resulting in loss of both sea grasses and coral reefs.<P>

<LI>Activation of the acid-sulfate in the soils.<P>

</UL>

<H2>What you can do:</H2>

MAP is the leading effort to end the worldwide destruction of mangrove forests
caused by unsustainable prawn farming.  We need your help in spreading the
word. Write a letter to:<P>

Mr. Lewis Preston<BR> World Bank President<BR> 1818 H St. NW<BR> Washington, DC
20433 <P>

and ask him to more closely monitor World Bank funding to ensure that
ecologically and socially destructive projects such as prawn aquaculture are
not funded in the future.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Green Hope on Black Mesa</TITLE>

<H1>Green Hope on Black Mesa</H1>

<H2>by Tracey Silberman</H2>

Arizona -- Violent drops of rain splashed red desert dust onto Highway 264 just outside of
Hotevilla, one of the last <A HREF="../slfp/status.html">Hopi</A> settlements to reject modern utilities. As I turned north toward the
historic homeland of the Dine (Navajo) people, my headlights caught a storm-soaked billboard
rising out of the sagebrush. It read: "RELOCATION IS GENOCIDE."<P>

For more than 20 years, the Dine of northern Arizona's Black Mesa region have
been fighting eviction from their traditional homelands. In 1974, the US
Congress arbitrarily redefined the high <A
HREF="desert.html">desert</A> region of Black Mesa (including Big
Mountain, a Dine sacred site) as land belonging to the Hopi tribe. All Dine
living in the area were told to relocate. Only nine Dine families remain on the
disputed land.<P>

The Dine and Hopi had lived in harmony for centuries, but the relocation order severed this traditional
relationship. The Peabody Coal Company, with a large mine in nearby Kayenta, has long coveted the
coal and uranium that lie beneath native land. The Navajo tribal government favors resource
extraction because it provides income. Unfortunately, the benefits of this "community
empowerment" strategy do not outweigh the disruption of the community, and the health and
environmental hazards caused by mining.<P>

A slurry pipeline that runs from Peabody's Kayenta mine
to Bull Head City, Nevada, uses two-to-three million gallons of Navajo Aquifer water daily. As a
result, the whole Dinnebito Watershed ecosystem is drying up, causing a loss of vegetation and
increasing erosion. At present rates of usage, water resources are expected to run dry in 15 years.<P>

Most of the Dine who accepted the relocation offer had to give up their traditional way of life.
Culturally displaced, they were forced off the land and thrust into the cash economy. Meanwhile,
expanding mining operations have disrupted the landscape, leaving behind shadeless, shelterless
grasslands, inhospitable to traditional Navajo sheepgrazing. Sheep do not eat snakeweed, a
sun-tolerant exotic weed that has invaded the mining-damaged land, choking out native plants and
grasses. Mining operations have destroyed sacred sites (disrupting the practice of religious
ceremonies), eradicated rare medicinal plants, destroyed critical wildlife habitat, and exacerbated
air pollution and groundwater contamination.<P>

<H3>Coal vs. Culture</H3>

Several independent groups have formed to deal with the environmental problems on these
embattled native lands, the most prominent being the Big Mountain Support Group, Dine Alliance,
Dine CARE (Citizens Against Ruining the Environment) and the Black Mesa Permaculture Project
(BMPP).<P>

The Dine Alliance was originally formed to battle for religious freedom, insisting on
access to traditional Dine sacred sites on the disputed land. "First we fought physically and now we
fight paper wars. We have no economy and our only money is through [making] crafts, and many
times there is no time for that," says Dine Alliance's Louise Benally.<P>

The Dine Alliance has evolved
into a lobbying group that is challenging mining operations that threaten Dine land and health. As
Benally, the main force behind Dine Alliance, angrily insists, "We are human beings who are being
denied our land. We drink the water and breathe the air, and we do not agree with living in a
contaminated environment."<P>

Because there are virtually no governmental regulations for mining on
reservation lands, Dine mineworkers are routinely subjected to unhealthy working conditions and
toxic pollutants. According to the Dine Alliance, the last time anyone used Office of Surface Mining
(OSM) regulations to challenge Peabody's activities was in 1968.<P>

After 40 years of Bureau of
Indian Affairs (BIA) oversight, many Dine have begun to lose their cultural identity. In a culture
that is so tied to the land, without land there can be no culture. "The Creator made all things for a
purpose. He made the Hopi to plant corn and me to graze sheep," says Dine farmer William Begay.
Reflecting on the success of his new cornfield and the loss of his sheep-ranching way of life, he
jokes, "Maybe I'm becoming a Hopi."<P>

<H3>Resist and Restore</H3>

The Black Mesa Permaculture Project was established in 1991 to heal the Earth and revive Navajo
culture through the principles of permaculture -- land restoration, revegetation, erosion control
and water-table replenishment. BMPP teaches local families how to restore damaged soils and
enhance self-sufficiency through the creation of productive, sustainable, land-based systems that
provide food, energy and shelter. Permaculture (a conjunction of "permanent" and "agriculture")
was developed in Tasmania in 1974 by Australian Bill Mollison, who was determined to put the
"culture" back in agriculture.<P>

One of permaculture's guiding principles -- the concept that
everything is connected to everything else -- echoes a basic tenet of Indigenous philosophy.
Permaculture's interdependent, non-hierarchical nature not only mirrors healthy ecosystems, it
also parallels Dine society's mutual, non-hierarchical sharing of information, cooperation and
support.<P>

Traditional Dine teachings say that by using the land and offering respect, the land in turn
will take care of you. When the spirit dies, it returns to the land. In permaculture, everything is
recycled. The system is said to work if it manages to sustain itself. BMPP believes that
permaculture's goals of self-sufficiency and sustainability can play a major role in advancing
sovereignty and self-determination in a culturally sensitive way.<P>

Permaculture is helping to draw
Dine kids back to the land. Justin Willy, an elementary science teacher at the Little Singer School
in Winslow and one of BMPP's instructors, helps children remember where they came from by
integrating permaculture principles with traditional teaching and language in his classes. Like Dine
culture, permaculture works with the elements and the seasons, Willy explains. All sustainable
systems and cultures, he says, work with nature, not against it.<P>

Willy firmly believes in education
and environmental restoration to ensure the survival of his people. He teaches his students that,
"the more we care for the land, the more the land will care for us."<P>

Each year, BMPP hosts a public
permaculture course. Non-natives pay $250 for the two-week workshop, which enables BMPP to
offer the course free to Indigenous people. This year's course was attended by 18 participants,
including several Dine from other parts of the reservation, members of Nevada's Shoshone Western
Defense Project and members of the Yaqui and Paiute nations.<P>

The workshop began in late May at the
Begay home in Black Mesa. Classes were held in the Begay's hogan, a traditional eight-sided,
mud-roofed, log dwelling. Work parties soon moved into the surrounding area armed with picks and
shovels. Through three days of rain and a week of relentless heat, the diverse group of volunteers
labored with local residents to construct compost piles, cisterns and swales (soil structures built
on a contour to catch runoff) at several homesites. Since permaculture stresses the use of locally
available materials, workers built compost bins from chicken wire, and reinforced cisterns with
plywood and rocks. The only item purchased was a galvanized gutter used to channel rainwater from
a rooftop to a cistern.<P>

Ironically, while Peabody is allowed to tear open the land and poison the air,
Bureau of Land Management laws state that reservation residents may not change, build on, or
"improve" the land in any way. Of course, that was exactly what we were doing -- building swales
and gabions (dam-like rock structures that catch silt) to channel and conserve the moisture,
constructing gardens and improving the soil by providing moisture and nutrients.<P>

During the ten days of the workshop, BIA agents drove through the property three times, twice stopping at the
Begay's house. Usually the residents of the house just kept their heads down and would not
acknowledge the intrusion.<P>

One day, while collecting wood near the family's home, we were pulled
over and brusquely questioned by the Hopi Tribal Police. After informing us that we needed a permit
to cut wood and that the Begay family was supposed to tell the police if they were having guests, the
officer let us go. He could have given us a $200 fine and confiscated the wood.<P>

It is through this type of intimidation that the tribal governments and the BIA hope to force the few remaining Dine to
leave. But these Dine are not going to give up. They stay because they have a true connection to the
Earth. The Big Mountain groups' persistence has shown other Navajos that their only hope to
survive on these lands lies with restoration.<P>

Louise Benally is optimistic for the future of Black
Mesa. "We have felt help and inspiration from the environmental movement. In the last few years,
this has made our voice stronger. Previously environmental issues did not cross cultural issues.
But with Mount Graham and Yucca Mountain and Black Mesa -- seeing sacred sites environmentally
degraded -- we have been able to work together on these issues."<P>

Around the campfire on the last
night of the workshop, voices echoed under a warm, star-filled sky. "We claim the sacred
mountains and the two rivers connecting them as sovereign land. We don't recognize the old white
man's law. The tribal government has oppressed us to support them, but now the tribal government
wants to meet with us. We will show them that we can make change. We can change things if we start
right where we are. It can be done, we can have control."<P>

<H1>The Sacred Land Film Series -- a detailed description</H1>
<TITLE>The Sacred Land Film Series -- a detailed description</TITLE>

Australian Aborigines. Tibetan pilgrims. Indians of the <A HREF="../journal/mclibel.html">Brazilian</A> rainforest
and the American Southwest. Around the globe, indigenous people sing the same
songs. They sing of sacred land -- those special places where countless
generations of women and men have sought and experienced the profound mystery
of life on Earth -- where human beings have traditionally learned the values of
awareness and responsibility, humility and respect.<P>

But indigenous people sing also of loss and strife and grief, because the
demand for raw materials and energy resources in industrial,
technologically-advanced nations is pushing the machines of destruction deeper
and deeper into the last wild places on the planet. Everywhere, sacred lands
are under siege. Australia's aboriginal people confront uranium mining,
Brazil's Yanomami fight dams and deforestation, A HREF="../journal/blmesa.html">Hopis</A> and Navajos protest coal
slurrylines that destroy precious springs, and Tibetans face destruction of
their temples and natural sacred sites.<P>

Hundreds of indigenous cultures have perished in recent centuries as a result
of modern industrial society's rapid expansion. With the vanishing people went
ancient knowledge of their homeland, their ecological heritage, their sacred
places. In recent years, the survivors have begun to organize and speak out.
Today, as we face a global environmental crisis, what these indigenous people
have to say about the appropriate relationship between humankind and the
natural world holds valuable lessons and may be essential to the survival of
all human life on the planet. But what do we know of their stories and beliefs,
their dreams and struggles? What do we know of sacred land, the ethics that
protect it, and the songs that celebrate it? <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>White fingers press the keys of a small field computer. A woman's
voice asks "We're at the southern edge, aren't we?" "Yes," responds a male
voice. An orbiting satellite beams a signal back to the computer, registering
latitude and longitude, which are recorded on a map. "Using a mining company's
tools to register a sacred site, ironic isn't it?" says the anthropologist to
the Aborigine. Gazing out over a dry swamp in central Australia, Engineer Jack,
the site's traditional custodian, tells the story of how two weary ancestral
snakes took refuge here during the Dreamtime creation era and were revived by
porridge made from the seeds of a tree in the center of the swamp. Clacking two
stones together he sings a song. "The ceremony given to us by those ancestors
is performed here every year," says Engineer Jack to the anthropologist with
whom he is working on a land claim in an attempt to stop the local mining town
from drilling into the swamp for water. The waterhole is on a "songline"
connecting it to other important sites in the Walbiri people's territory,
places which were also visited by the ancestral snakes and which are now
important sources of food and medicine, and are initiation sites for the young.
"What I want to know," says the Aboriginal elder, "is how white man can claim
that he can own the land and the water, own the spirit in
nature."</BLOCKQUOTE>

Sacred places in the natural world have been known to every culture from
ancient times to the present. Peoples of India, Egypt, Tibet, North and South
America and the British Isles historically based their civilizations on an
understanding of their relationship to the forests and streams around them, the
mountains and stars above them. While the experience of sacred land is often a
personal one, cultures throughout history have designated specific places as
sacred because of recurring human experience at these sites. Certain places
associated with fertility, healing, clairvoyance, prophetic dreams, ancestral
burials, important historical events or supernatural phenomena have come to be
respected, protected and utilized for the beneficial results experienced there.
These are the sacred places of the planet, where human beings experience
transcendence of the physical plane and discover an ever-deepening relationship
to themselves, to the Earth, to other species, to the life force.<P>

Mythologist Joseph Campbell observed that all mythic heroes seek a place of
peace and rest -- the center. From that center, from that peace, flows
enlightened action. Historian Mircea Eliade showed that religious cultures
throughout time have been founded on an <I>axis mundi</I>, the center of the
universe, which takes many shapes -- a cosmic mountain, an old cedar tree or a
village plaza -- and which connects communities to the transcendent and insures
communication with the spirit world. To connect with the unseen force behind
life, and to maintain health and harmony, these indigenous cultures and mythic
heroes have based their actions on the insight that the human body comes from
the Earth, is the Earth. Collectively, this wisdom teaches that we are the
consciousness of the Earth and that certain places have the power to reveal
these truths and remind humanity of this responsibility. But European
civilization long ago severed those bonds with the land and for centuries has
evolved an increasingly mechanized, urbanized lifestyle that mines the Earth
for its bounty and exports a utilitarian world view to other cultures. In
religion, science and language we have become secularized and detached. We have
lost our center.<P>

Many people within Western culture are struggling to make intimate contact with
the natural world, to recover ceremony and rediscover a sense of the sacred.
Yet few among us seem to know how to talk about these things, let alone how to
pursue this quest for meaning. Thinkers like Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, Carl
Jung and Joseph Campbell initiated the search for a new frontier linking
psychological and ecological health.<P>

And today, a growing number of people are seeking solutions to the
environmental crisis by restoring personal and cultural connections to the
Earth, to the unconscious, to the elusive dimension we call the sacred. One
aspect of this search is to explore how we in  technological society lost our
connection to the land; another is to understand how earth-based people are
fighting to preserve theirs. <P>

The films will explore the difference between <I>natural</I> sacred sites and
<I>man-made</I> sites of worship -- a forest where silence is needed for a
vision quest in contrast to a church's inner sanctum, a waterfall where spirits
dwell in contrast to a shrine honoring a saint, a rock formation marking the
birth place of a mythic hero in contrast to a house where George Washington
slept, the San Francisco Peaks in contrast to Jerusalem. Natural sacred sites
are rarely regarded as legitimate places of worship and are generally not
valued as sources of inspiration by members of urban-based cultures.
Consequently, they are not protected by legal systems which otherwise provide
protections for the freedom to worship. On the contrary, sacred sites in nature
are often regarded as cultural artifacts or commercial commodities to be
developed for tourism or exploited for television advertisements. And
indigenous people are rarely portrayed in film as <I>real people</I> -- they
are cultural curiosities in the minds of most Euro-Americans. Indigenous people
must be allowed to tell <I>their own story</I> if people from urban, industrial
societies are going to be open to their wisdom, to care about their survival,
and to understand the meaning and support the protection of natural sacred
sites.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill Tallbull, a Northern Cheyenne Professor from Lame Deer College
in Montana, stood on a sandstone cliff at Mesa Verde National Park. Looking out
over a deep canyon full of pinon and juniper, he said, "The reason white people
don't understand our sacred places is that their religion is a
<I>commemorative</I> religion that celebrates people and historical events,
while our religion is a <I>living religion</I> based on ceremonies of renewal. Our
life goal is to maintain spiritual harmony, to appease and affirm the spirit
life of a place -- hence our tie to the land. We see and feel God
<I>everywhere</I>. 
We cannot allow a sacred place to become dormant or to be defiled. It is too
dangerous. We are the stewards."  "So how do you protect such a place?" I
asked. "We have a hell of a teaching job to do," he replied.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The <B>Sacred Land</B> films will probe the relationship between culture and
land, explore the root causes of the violence being done to the Earth by industrial
civilization, and highlight the words and world views of earth-based peoples
from around the world. We believe that one way out of the current
environmental/spiritual crisis is to re-establish 
an understanding and a sense of sacred land within Western culture. Honoring
sacred places, ours and others', may be the only way we can repair our tattered
ties to the land. <P>

<H1>The Premise of the Sacred Land Film Project</H1>
<TITLE>The Premise of the Sacred Land Film Project</TITLE>

by Christopher McLeod, Project Director<P>

Fifteen years immersion in environmental issues has convinced me that the
ecological crisis is, at its root, a spiritual crisis that stems from a culture
that is disconnected from nature and the spiritual forces of the natural world.
This disconnection long ago led to an imbalanced emphasis on material values.
Spending a lot of time among the Hopi, Navajo, Wintu, Tibetan, Australian
aboriginal and other indigenous people around the world -- attending
ceremonies, listening to stories, walking to places in the landscape that hold
great cultural and historic significance -- questions took shape in my
Euro-American mind. Why do we have no sacred sites? What is the cost of this
absence in our culture in terms of the health of individuals, of the culture,
of the planet? Why have we no language to discuss experiences at sacred sites?
How might we re-discover these places and remember the practices that are
appropriate to them? I came to the viewpoint, through my Native American
friends' experiences and way of seeing the world, that cultural disintegration
is the direct result of disconnection from the land, and that sacred sites are
at the heart of, and are inextricably linked to, the very practices and beliefs
that nurture connection to the earth that sustains us.<P>

These experiences have inspired the Sacred Land Film Project.<P>

I feel deeply that we need stories -- stories of ceremony, stories of elders,
stories of struggles to protect sacred sites. These stories can be told
powerfully on film, with visual images of the sites and heartfelt words spoken
by the traditional caretakers of the powerful natural sanctuaries that exist
throughout all of the world.<P>

To understand the meaning and importance of sacred sites, we also need experience, <I> authentic </I> experience. Many people have already had transformative experiences at places like Machu Pichu or Chaco Canyon, where a sacred site is marked by a shrine. Others have had these life-changing experiences in the wild -- in a canyon, on a mountaintop, in the ocean, in our own backyards. Indigenous people are willing to teach and guide us as we seek these experiences, but the process should not be taken lightly. This is not a New Age fad. There are rules. There is etiquette. There are cultural secrets. Powerful forces are at work at the heart of sacred places.<P>

I recently showed Florence Jones three hours of film footage. We watched her singing
in trance, praying to Panther Spring on Mt. Shasta, and blessing native people
at a healing ceremony atop Universe Rock on Cold Springs Mountain -- images
that capture spiritual connection to place and illustrate how a trained healer
works with the powers of the natural world. After seeing the footage, Florence
said: "I want to show this video to the Forest Service to show them how
important these sites are to my people." <P>

Our sense of urgency grows with the ongoing need to interview elders before
they pass away. Also, the 1994 national elections manifested a new and
potent threat to sacred sites: the "wise-use"/private property rights movement.
Mt. Shasta may be the first victim. Florence Jones recently won an important victory
and it has already been undone. The Department of the Interior in
March 1994, recognized Mt. Shasta -- in its entirety -- as a national historic
site due to its "spiritual significance" to Native Californians. Ten days after
the November 1994 elections, however, this historic decision was reversed under
intense pressure from local property owners. A proposed ski resort once again
threatens Florence's sacred spring, and the implications for native land rights
are ominous. This story will be at the heart of our first film on Mt. Shasta
and Florence Jones.<P>

This is an important moment to be producing documentary films that can capture
these stories as they unfold. It is clear that now is the time to get some of
these urgent stories out to the public. Our current plan is to complete a film
on Florence Jones and Mt. Shasta as we work with the Hopi and move towards a
second piece on the Four Corners area. Then, with two films in distribution, we
will be in a good position to raise production funds for our larger vision: a
continuing series on the meaning of sacred land to cultures around the world.
<P>

As the current social and legislative climate moves America toward
privatization of public lands, many of us feel a deeply renewed commitment to
take concrete action that will eventually help bring about real ecological
change in our society. Media is a vital tool for educating the general public
and influencing people in positions of power. With so much of the media
concentrated in a shrinking number of hands and progressive government support
for documentary filmmaking on the verge of being eliminated, independent media
have never been so important or so difficult to produce. Independent voices can
help focus on the real issues that underlie the frustration and search for
meaning that in all likelihood cannot be addressed in the mainstream media. To
accomplish this ambitious and challenging project we must work together with,
and gain the support of, like-minded funders -- people who see the
environmental crisis as a spiritual crisis. We hope you will join us in this
effort.<P>

We have some wonderful and important footage and are ready to continue filming.
Your support at this critical time in the project's evolution would be
enormously helpful. Our production budget for these first two film segments is
$300,000.<P>

<H1>SLFP Project Status</H1>
<TITLE>SLFP Project Status</TITLE>

The Sacred Land Film Project is currently producing the first two in a series
of films on the meaning of sacred land to a variety of cultures around the
world. Our first film focuses on Mt. Shasta, in northern California, and
Florence Jones, an 87-year-old  medicine woman who may be the last in a long lineage of healers from the Wintu tribe. The second film focuses on the Four Corners area
of the American Southwest, homeland of the A HREF="../journal/blmesa.html">Hopi</A> and Navajo, a region described by Hopi spokesman Thomas Banyacya as "a sacred chamber" which the Hopi
protect through prayer and ceremony.<P>

A little project history: Our original plan was to produce a four-part series that would tell stories of sacred sites and indigenous cultures around the world.
Project Director Christopher "Toby" McLeod made a five-month, round-the-world research trip in 1991-2 to develop this global film series. His experiences on that research trip are detailed in the winter 1993-4 issue of <A HREF="../journal/journal.html">Earth
Island Journal</A>.<P>

After spending two years (1992-3) fundraising we decided that coming up with $2.5 million for a film series that is both political and spiritual would take a long time, especially in the current
economic and political climate. We elected to begin production close to home --
at Mt. Shasta and in Hopi country -- with several elders who are caretakers of
sacred sites and whose knowledge and wisdom, we feel, simply must be preserved
and shared.<P>

And so, after two years of research and development, 1994 marked the start of
production of the Sacred Land Film Series.<P>

In August 1994, we filmed four days of ceremonies in northern California,
working with Wintu medicine woman Florence Jones. It was an
incredible experience and we were able to capture scenes that we once thought
we might never be able to film. We filmed a sunset fire ceremony with Mt. Shasta rising on the western horizon, a healing ceremony at Panther Spring on Mt. Shasta and another healing ceremony at Universe Rock. We also filmed a four-hour meeting between Florence and the local district ranger of the U.S. Forest Service, in which Florence stated her strong opposition to a ski resort that is proposed for the slopes of Mt. Shasta and which would desecrate Panther Spring. It was an auspicious beginning to the production phase of the film series. Our experience at Mt. Shasta is described in detail in the winter 1994-5 issue of <A HREF="../journal/journal.html">Earth
Island Journal</A>.<P>

In 1995, we continued our work with Florence Jones and 86 year-old Hopi
spokesman Thomas Banyacya, filming key scenes that will make up the heart of
the first two films in the Sacred Land Film Series. <P>

In August 1995, we confronted one of the central questions of the film series:
Is the destruction of sacred sites intentional or does it occur out of ignorance?
In the spring of 1995, a major California timber company cut down several important trees in a sacred grove that serves as a Wintu men's prayer and fasting site. Florence Jones had previously journeyed to the site with the forester from the company to point out its boundaries. The area was marked off with ribbons to
identify it as a cultural site and each tree was painted with the word "NO." A
week later, chainsaw-wielding loggers entered the site and cut down three big
Douglas Fir trees. Our film trip up the mountain with Florence and three
employees of the logging company, along with Florence's attorney Patricia
Cummings, after the trees were cut down, is described in the film project's 1995 Annual Report. <P>

In November 1995, we found ourselves on the edge of the Hopi mesas,
interviewing Thomas Banyacya about the spiritual center his people have
inhabited and cared for through prayer for thousands of years. In the camera's
view over Thomas' shoulder was a simple but distinctive mesa, the place from
which the spirits of the deceased depart from this world. Thomas told the story
of the Spanish occupation of Hopi land in the 17th century. Hopi religion was
suppressed and their ceremonies were stopped. "There was no rain," said Thomas.
"Famine began to spread. It could destroy the whole earth like a flood. We had
to stop it. All Pueblos rose up one day and got rid of the churches and the
priests. We began singing and dancing and the rain started coming again. So,
this Four Corners area is very important."<P>

In 1996, we will continue our film work with Florence and Thomas, documenting their struggles to protect sacred sites and their efforts to explain the importance of these spiritual places to those who will listen.  <P> 

After several years of
careful preparation, we are now gathering the wealth of material from which
good films are made. And we are excited about narrowing the focus of the project from the four-part global series to these two initial films. We believe that two films on specific sacred sites and the elders who love and protect them will be a good start to the larger, global film series. We will soon have two finished films in distribution. They will be invaluable in fundraising, and the material from them can easily be edited into the larger series.<P>

<TITLE>STRP: First Dolphin-Safe Tuna, now Sea Turtle-Safe Shrimp?</TITLE>

<H2>First Dolphin-Safe Tuna, now Sea Turtle-Safe Shrimp?</H2>

<H3>ASPCA, The Fund For Animals, The Humane Society of the United States Join Earth Island Institute in Turtle-Safe(TM) Shrimp Eco-labeling Campaign<P>

Mutilated Sea Turtles Wash Ashore on Texas Beaches</H3>

San Francisco -- Citing the federal government's apparent inability to end the drowning deaths of thousands of endangered sea turtles every year in US waters, a coalition of over 45 environmental and animal protection organizations and concerned businesses has launched a consumer-powered campaign to end the slaughter. The Turtle-Safe(TM) Shrimp Program works with responsible shrimp fishers who use fishing gear which allows sea turtles to escape from shrimp nets. <P>

"From its inception in 1866 the ASPCA has been, and will continue to be, committed to protecting endangered sea turtles," said Jamie Cotel Altman of the ASPCA."Turtle Excluder Devices, or TEDs, are inexpensive devices which, when sewn into shrimp nets, serve as an easy means of escape for sea turtles. Use of TEDs is mandated by federal law."<P>

Despite such laws, in 1995 over 2,000 sea turtles washed up dead on US beaches. These high numbers support the widely-held belief that many US shrimpers, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, are disabling their TEDs because they fear a reduced catch. Yet when used properly, TEDs can actually increase the overall shrimp catch and lower operating costs.<P>

"Shrimpers who properly and consistently use TEDs, and sign contracts with Earth Island Institute agreeing to participate in a monitoring program, are certified as Turtle-Safe," explained Todd Steiner, Director of the Sea Turtle Restoration Project of Earth Island Institute. "They are permitted to use our Turtle-Safe logo on their shrimp, and display signs on their boats. For our part, we help increase demand through our ever-growing activist network, and by publicizing the campaign and the product."<P>

Over 100 sea turtles have stranded since shrimp season opened, only a few weeks ago. Many of these turtles have had their flippers and/or heads cut off. Some have even been shot. One Kemp's ridley sea turtle had been shot twice and had a rope tied around one flipper; presumably the rope had been tied to a weight in hopes of "sinking the evidence." The Kemp's ridley is one of the most endangered animals on earth.<P>

"The addition of large national organizations with millions of members, such as the ASPCA, The Fund for Animals and The Humane Society of the United States, will enable us to reach millions of US citizens with our message: Don't eat shrimp unless it's Turtle-Safe," added Carole Allen of Help Endangered Animals - Ridley Turtles (HEART), a Houston, Texas-based organization which has spearheaded the coalition-building effort. "Shrimpers who refuse to save sea turtles need to feel the economic pressure millions of caring consumers can wield."<P>

"Shrimp fishing is one of the most wasteful fisheries in the world," said Dr. John W. Grandy of The Humane Society of the United States. "In addition to drowning thousands of sea turtles every year, shrimp nets capture and kill ten pounds of non-target species for every pound of shrimp caught. TEDs reduce this "by-catch" by up to 60%. They reduce impacts to sea turtles and to the entire marine environment."<P>

"The National Marine Fisheries Service has proven itself unwilling to take meaningful action to save these gentle creatures from extinction," said Cleveland Amory, best-selling author and president of The Fund for Animals. "We will use the power of the pocketbook to bring about change and protect this endangered species. Scientists agree: we need some areas of the Gulf to be closed to shrimp fishing, and we need to limit the number of shrimp boats in the fleet. It's out of control."<P>

"We did it for the dolphins," pointed out Steiner, referring to Earth Island's successful campaign to end the drowning of dolphins in tuna nets by convincing shoppers to boycott tuna. "We can do it for the sea turtles. Georgia shrimpers who are participating in this campaign provided over one million pounds of Turtle-Safe shrimp to the marketplace in our pilot project phase last year. We invite Texas shrimpers to get on board."<P>

<H2>Shrimp Embargo Today [May 1] for 40 Nations</H2>

<H3>Affecting $1 Billion of Exports Environmentalists Applaud Victory for Sea Turtles!</H3>

May 1, 1996 

The U.S. Department of State announced an embargo of all wild-caught shrimp from
all but a handful of nations today. The action results from a successful
lawsuit filed by environmentalists in the United States Court of International
Trade. Judge Thomas J. Aquilino ordered the government to enforce an amendment
to the Endangered Species Act which requires nations exporting shrimp into the
U.S. to use "comparable" sea turtle technology in the harvest of shrimp
beginning May 1, 1996. <P>

Of the more than 70 nations that export shrimp to the U.S. only <B>36 were found
to be in compliance</B>. Their wild-caught shrimp can still be exported to the U.S.
<B>Those countries are</B>: <P>

<UL>

<LI>The 13 nations who adopted the use of turtle excluder devices: Belize,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Mexico,
Indonesia, Nicaragua, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela.<P>

<LI>The 15 nations who fish in cold water where sea turtles do not occur:
Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Ireland,

<LI>The 8 nations which only harvest shrimp using manual rather than mechanical
means: Bahamas, Brunei, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Oman, Peru, Sri

Over 40 nations are currently embargoed from importing their shrimp into the
U.S., pending implementation of sea turtle conservation measures, including the
use of Turtle Excluder Devices.<P>

<TITLE>STRP: U.S. Judge Denies Motion To Postpone Deadline For Shrimp Embargo</TITLE>

<H2>U.S. Judge Denies Motion To Postpone Deadline For Shrimp Embargo</H2>
<H3>Embargo on May 1st for Nations Who Do Not Adopt Sea Turtle Conservation Measures</H3>
 

17 April 1996<P>

A U.S. federal Judge has denied a last-minute attempt to once again delay implementation of a provision of the Endangered Species Act requiring the use of a turtle-saving device on the shrimp nets of foreign vessels for an additional year.<P>

Thomas J. Aquilino Jr. of the United States Court of International Trade (formerly called U.S. Customs Court) ruled against the U.S. government's "motion for a modified order" and has ordered the government to "prohibit not later than May 1, 1996 the importation of shrimp or products of shrimp wherever harvested in the wild with commercial fishing technology which may affect adversely (those species of) sea turtles." This ruling upholds an earlier ruling on December 29, 1995 by the same court ordering an embargo May 1 of nations not in compliance.<P>

The lawsuit, brought by the Earth Island Institute, Sierra Club, The Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals compelled the government to enforce an amendment to the Endangered Species Act requiring "comparable" sea turtle conservation technologies be adopted by countries wishing to sell shrimp in the U.S. market. The law requires foreign vessels to use turtle excluder devices (TEDs) which allow turtles to escape from shrimp nets, and are already required on U.S. shrimp vessels.<P>

In a sharply-worded opinion, Judge Aquilino admonished the government for seeking an additional delay after more than six years of illegal delays, "Nonetheless, and also seemingly in spite of the one and a half years' lead time originally afforded by Congress in the statute and the  five first days of May since [i.e. five years], as well as the aforesaid four months advance warning the timing of the Court's decision entailed, come now the defendants with a motion for "modification" of that decision....Such a hearing has been held, and the paucity of evidence in support of the motion enables this decision to be expeditious... At first blush, the foregoing declarations were of sufficient moment to cause the court to convene immediately, at which hearing the defendants and intervenor-defendant were afforded an opportunity to present evidence in support thereof. They did not. Little was added to the few facts already included in their scripted generalizations. Either they could not or would not answer rudimentary questions seemingly relevant thereto."<P>

Judge Aquilino wrote, "The papers upon which the defendants now apparently rest are revealing, but they are also contradictory and/or unsupportive of the extraordinary relief requested... Facts and circumstances such as the foregoing hardly favor modification of the annual deadline the U.S. Congress enacted in 1989.... If as Secretary Claussen points out, nations have been on notice of section 609, even before as well as after its formal enactment in 1989, then the presumed anticipation of Congress has been realized, and any additional extension of time for all countries, including those certifiable now, would be more than anomalous... Certainly, this mandate to negotiate "as soon as possible" and to apprise Congress "not later than one year after the date of enactment" hardly bespeaks an additional annum of delay more than six years after the date."<P>

In regard to reports submitted to Congress by the Under Secretary of State in 1993 and 1995, which insisted that the government's "commitment to promoting, as a matter of policy, equivalent measures to protect sea turtles in other areas where sea turtles are taken incidental to commercial shrimp fishing operations," Judge Aquilino chided the government's inaction saying, "those representations may have been nothing more than lip service." <P>

The Judge had apparently lost patience with the government's continuing delays through additional court maneuvers. He wrote he was considering sanctions against the government. "Clearly in the court's judgment, the defendants violated [CIT Rule 11(c)] these expectations in the presentment of their motion for modification. In fact, it has engendered exactly the kind of confusion which the rule has been adopted to prevent. Whether the perception of impossibility the defendants attempt to perpetrate applies to foreign exporters or to themselves is not certain. Whichever, the governing law, the controlling facts and their expectable allegiances and duties are (or should be) clear enough to state that, but for the desirability of curtailing further litigation, this court would order the defendants to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed pursuant to CIT Rule 11(c)."<P>

Todd Steiner, Director of the Sea Turtle Restoration Project of Earth Island Institute said, "This strongly worded decision illustrates the government's strategy of using litigation to delay the inevitable. Judge Aquilino ordered the enforcement of a clear and unambiguous law to protect sea turtles from drowning in shrimp nets by requiring nations who export shrimp to the U.S. to use turtle excluder devices (TEDs) or lose the privilege of selling that shrimp in the U.S. market." He continued, "Enforcement of the May 1 deadline is sure to save more than 100,000 a year from the excruciating death of being forcibly held under water and drowning. We hope the strong opinion of Judge Aquilino will convince the government to give up on its strategy of delay, and get on with the business of enforcing a law aimed at helping the ancient sea turtles reverse their rendezvous with extinction."<P>

The Judge's decision (Slip Op. 96-62) was made on April 10, 1996.

<TITLE>STRP: Giant Legal Victory for Sea Turtles!</TITLE>

<H1>STRP: Giant Legal Victory for Sea Turtles!</H1>

<H2>70 Nations must adopt sea turtle conservation measures or face shrimp
embargo on May 1st.</H2>

Great news for sea turtles!  On December 29, 1995 a federal judge ruled in
favor of a lawsuit brought by the Sea Turtle Restoration Project (STRP),
forcing all countries that export shrimp to the United States to adopt sea
turtle conservation measures for their shrimp fleets by May 1, 1996 or face an
embargo of their shrimp products.  The American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, The Humane Society of the United States, the Sierra Club
and the Georgia Fishermen's Association were also parties to the lawsuit.<P>

An elated Todd Steiner, Director of STRP, stated, "This decision will save more
than 100,000 endangered sea turtles from needlessly drowning in shrimp nets
every year, ending the largest killing of endangered species occurring in the
world right now."  STRP estimates that at least 124,000 turtles may be captured
and killed every year in the nets of foreign shrimp boats.  <P>

Steiner added, "We're  overjoyed that Judge Aquilino had the courage to
overturn the US State Department, putting environmental protection ahead of
so-called 'free trade' issues.  Most importantly, sea turtles will no longer be
unnecessarily killed for a cheap shrimp salad."<P>

Judge Thomas J. Aquilino of the United States Court of International Trade
directed the Secretaries of State, Treasury and Commerce (defendants) "to
prohibit not later than May 1, 1996 the importation of shrimp or products of
shrimp wherever harvested in the wild with commercial fishing technology which
may affect adversely those species of sea turtles the conservation of which is
the subject of regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce on June 29,
1987... and to report the results thereof to the Court on or before May 31,
1996."  The court, formerly called US Customs Court, is in New York City. <P>

Prior to this ruling, the US only required 14 Atlantic and Caribbean nations to
use turtle excluder devices (TEDs) on their shrimp vessels if they wished to
export shrimp to the US.  Even these nations were not required to use them on
the Pacific coast.  The lawsuit compels the US Department of State to ban the
importation of shrimp into the US from <B>all nations</B> that have not reduced sea
turtle mortality from shrimp fishing operations by 97 percent, the level that
can be achieved with the proper use of TEDs on all vessels.  Now, all countries
that harvest shrimp in waters shared with sea turtles, and export their product
to the US, will be required to use TEDs no matter where they fish, or face an
embargo May 1, 1996.<P>

"This is a monumental decison.  We have successfully accomplished what we set
out to do: end the government's violation of the law in order to protect these
vulnerable marine animals from extinction," said Josh Floum, attorney at
Heller, Ehrman, White and McAuliffe, who represented environmentalists pro
bono. <P>

"The administration had thwarted the will of Congress and the American people
by not enforcing this law which is aimed at the global protection of endangered
and threatened sea turtles.  Using every procedural hurdle possible, the
agencies delayed our day in court for nearly five years, resulting in the
capture of more than 500,000 sea turtles.  As a result of our lawsuit, the
world's oceans are now safer for these magnificent animals,"  said Nicole
Walthall, attorney.  <P>

"This case also set an important precedent on the issue of standing for
environmental and conservation plaintiffs, " Walthall continued.  "Clarifying
the Supreme Court's 1992 decision on standing in <B>Lujan v. Defenders of
Wildlife</B>, this decision clearly establishes environmental plaintiffs' right to
seek judicial enforcement of US laws, like this one, aimed at the global
protection of threatened and endangered animals."  <P>

Nations can come into compliance quite simply, by installing TEDs on all
shrimping vessels that fish in waters shared with sea turtles, as has been done
by the US fleet.  Seventy nations are affected.  The largest eight exporters to
the United States (by weight) of wild-caught shrimp are India, Indonesia,
Thailand, Mexico, Malaysia, Brazil, Korea (ROK), and Japan.  (This does not
include farm-raised shrimp).<P>

US shrimpers also hailed the decison, as it "levels the playing field" in the
competitive shrimp market while protecting marine ecosystems.  Jack d'Antignac,
US shrimper and President of the Georgia Fishermen's Association, said,
"Members of the Georgia Fisherman's Association have been using TEDs and
protecting sea turtles even before their use became mandatory in the US.
Foreign countries not using TEDs are willfully killing sea turtles.  It's way
past time that shrimpers from all countries start using TEDs in order to
preserve our shared marine environment.  The relatively small loss of shrimp
caused by TEDs is more than compensated for by the improved quality of our
catch.  TEDs save turtles, reduce the unnecessary killing of countless fish,
and protect the marine environment on which we all depend.  It will be easy
enough for these other countries to use TEDs, if they have the sincere desire
to do so."

<TITLE>STRP: New Study Shows 60,000 Sea Turtles Caught Each Year in Central
American Shrimp Nets</TITLE>

<H2>New Study Shows 60,000 Sea Turtles Caught Each Year in Central
American Shrimp Nets</H2>

More than sixty thousand sea turtles a year are captured by the approximately
350 vessels that make up the shrimp fleets of the seven Central American
nations, according to a new study by STRP Central American Director Randall
Arauz Vargas. The report was presented to the 16th Annual Sea Turtle
Conference, held in February, 1996 at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. <P>

Most turtles captured are olive ridleys, with lesser numbers of greens,
hawksbills and leatherbacks.  The vast majority are caught off Central
America's Pacific coast.  Only 500 sea turtles are caught off these countries'
Caribbean coasts each year.  Ironically, these nations (under pressure from the
US government) have all passed laws requiring TED use only on their Caribbean
fleets, allowing the continued drowning of tens of thousands of turtles on the
Pacific side each year.<P>

Previous estimates of the numbers of sea turtles captured in shrimp nets
worldwide have been "guesses" at best.  The US is the only nation that has
conducted in-depth studies.  Estimates for other countries have been based on
the assumption that sea turtle capture rates per ton of shrimp caught are
similar to such rates for the US.

"Randall has pulled together the best available data from Central America and
we now have a much better understanding of the magnitude of the problem.  It is
obvious we need international implementation of TEDs to help save the turtles,"
said Jack Woody, one of STRP's scientific advisors.  <P>

The report is available from STRP by sending a SASE (52 cents).

<H1>Turtle-Safe Shrimp Makes Waves</H1>

<TITLE>STRP: Turtle-Safe Shrimp Makes Waves</TITLE>

Turtle-Safe&#174; shrimp has made the leap from the boat deck to the
marketplace, landing in restaurants and markets on both US coasts.<P>

The Turtle-Safe campaign takes a new market-oriented approach to the old
problem of sea turtles drowning in shrimp nets.  Shrimp caught by fishermen who
join the program carry a Turtle-Safe seal on the package.  The seal lets
consumers know which shrimp was caught using fishing gear that allows turtles
to escape.<P>

Publicity, including a full-page advertisement (run in the New York Times in
July 1995), a brochure, and a television public service announcement, informs
consumers about the sea turtle/shrimp interaction and how consumer demand can
make a difference.  Fishermen who use turtle excluder devices (TEDs) receive
recognition for their efforts.  For the first time, there's a way to tell their
shrimp from other shrimp and encouragement for others to follow their
example.<P>

The program started with forward-looking fishermen from Georgia.  One from
South Carolina has also joined the program.  Georgia fishermen were pioneers in
turtle protection, developing the first excluders to keep out jellyfish and
horseshoe crabs as early as the late 1960s.

The first boxes of fresh Turtle-Safe shrimp were shipped last fall, a peak time
for Georgia white shrimp, to distributors in San Francisco, Boston, and Denver.
 In addition the Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF) served Turtle-Safe
shrimp at events at the landmark Claremont Hotel in Oakland, CA, and at One
Market in San Francisco.<P>

OFRF, California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF), and the Rainforest
Alliance's Smart Wood Program, have generously offered support and advice that
helped get Turtle-Safe shrimp on menus and in stores.  The CCOF program was
created and is managed by the farmers themselves.  A first step in that
direction for the Turtle-Safe program is the Turtle-Safe Advisory Board. 
Fishermen, dock owners, and OFRF's executive director Bob Scowcroft are among
the board members.<P>

Turtle-Safe shrimp is in the pilot program stage. You can help get more
Turtle-Safe shrimp on the market by asking for it at restaurants and
supermarkets.  This lets them and, in turn, their suppliers know that their
customers want only shrimp caught while protecting sea turtles.  <P>

<TITLE>STRP: Gulf Crisis Worsens</TITLE>

<H1>Gulf Crisis Worsens</H1>

<H2>Top Scientists join in our lawsuit to save critically endangered Sea
Turtles.</H2>

Sea turtles continued to strand (wash up dead) on US beaches in record numbers
in 1995 (see chart), a continuation of the problem that re-surfaced in 1994.
Two separate Endangered Species Act lawsuits have been filed against the
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), in an attempt to force NMFS to take
effective action on this crisis. <P>

All parties agree that the major source of mortality is from shrimp fishing,
although there is significant disagreement over the precise cause.  Is the
problem primarily caused by "cheaters" dismantling TEDs while fishing?  Is it
"pulse-fishing" (turtles being caught multiple times with insufficient recovery
time between captures)?  Is it an increase in turtle populations, so there are
more to kill?  Or could it be the unmentionable: TEDs are not as effective as
believed?<P>

<H2>Government Response Inadequate</H2>

In a biological opinion issued November 14, 1994, required under the Endangered
Species Act, NMFS wrote, "the continued long-term operation of the shrimp
fishery in the nearshore waters of the southeastern United States is likely to
jeopardize the continued existence of the highly endangered Kemp's ridley sea
turtle."  In order to issue an incidental take exception which would allow
shrimp fishing to continue, NMFS had to put in place a "reasonable and prudent
alternative" that would "ensure no jeopardy" to the Kemp's ridley sea turtle.
That alternative became known as the "Emergency Response Plan" (ERP).  The ERP
included weekly monitoring of sea turtle mortality, and temporary 30-day
increases in enforcement when strandings exceeded historical averages for two
consecutive weeks.  <P>

<B>In 1994, 2,149 sea turtles stranded, including at least 565 Kemp's ridleys.
In 1995, with the government's ERP in full operation, 2,175 turtles stranded,
including at least 373 Kemp's ridleys.</B><P>

The Kemp's ridley is one of the most endangered animals on earth.  Less than
1000 breeding females remain, all nesting on one beach.<P>

<H2>Conservation Groups Sue To Force Action</H2>

A lawsuit was filed by Earth Island Institute, Carole Allen, founder and Chair
of HEART (Help Endangered Animals - Ridley Turtles), and The Humane Society of
the US.  The suit charges that the ERP is inadequate to solve this chronic
problem, and calls for major reform, including closing critical Kemp's ridley
habitat in the Gulf of Mexico to shrimp fishing.  Of critical importance were
the biological opinions provided by three prominent sea turtle scientists in
support of this lawsuit (see sidebar).  <P>

Another lawsuit, filed by the Center for Marine Conservation (CMC), is
attempting to compel the government to enforce the ERP, which it felt the
government was not doing.<P>

These most recent lawsuits follow years of NMFS foot-dragging over
implementation and enforcement of TEDs.  CMC has published an excellent account
of this controversy, entitled "Delay and Denial: A Political History of Sea
Turtles and Shrimp Fishing."  It seems that every time the environmental
community sues or threatens to sue, NMFS comes up with a "new plan."  This
solves their legal problem, since federal judges usually take a "wait and see
attitude" to see if the new plan will work.  This is where we find ourselves
today as we await yet another "new rule", promised in November 1995, but tied
up in bureaucratic delay.<P>

Did the ERP plan fail because it was not adequately enforced, or because it was
a bad plan to begin with?  With the 1996 shrimping season opening in a month or
so, this is hardly the point.  The preliminary stranding figures for 1995
already exceed the record numbers of 1994.  Strong and decisive action is
needed to ensure that 1996 isn't another disastrous year for endangered sea
turtles.<P>

<H2>Area Closures Needed to Protect Kemp's Ridley</H2>

The Earth Island/HEART/HSUS lawsuit calls for an injunction to prohibit
shrimping in times and areas where sea turtles are known to occur in high
numbers, until the government can ensure that shrimping activities will not
jeopardize the continued existence of the endangered sea turtles.  These areas
include nearshore waters in parts of Texas and Louisiana, but are only a small
part of the range of the shrimp fishing fleets of the Gulf.<P>

"NMFS' plan has failed miserably.  The Kemp's ridley turtle is one of the most
endangered species in the world, and the government agency responsible for its
protection continues to concoct half-hearted schemes, such as the so-called
'Emergency Response Plan,' which appear to be designed more to protect the
shrimp industry than the endangered sea turtles," said STRP Director Todd
Steiner.  He continued, "We will not stand idly by while a species that
outlived the dinosaur disappears from earth right before our eyes.  It's
criminal and unforgivable." <P>

<H2>Shrimp Industry in Denial</H2>

The turtles that have washed up dead represent only a fraction of those
actually killed.  Many die and never wash ashore, and some that wash ashore are
never found.  Some turtles are being maliciously mutilated, either to send a
message of non-compliance or in hope that cut-up turtles will sink or become
shark food, thus destroying the evidence of mortality.  Turtles ripped from
their shells, decapitated turtles and turtles with flippers missing and metal
bars tied to them have washed up on our shores from Texas to South Carolina.<P>

Shrimp fishers in the Gulf have been quick to blame their economic woes on
turtle-saving regulations issued under the Endangered Species Act.
Environmentalists counter that the shrimp fishery in the Gulf is not
sustainable.  The number of vessels fishing  for shrimp in the Gulf has
increased 250 percent since the 1950s, yet the amount of shrimp harvested has
not increased significantly (from approximately 90 million pounds to 128
million pounds).  <P>

Meanwhile, the vessels and the amount of nets being pulled have gotten bigger,
the cost of operating the vessels has gone up dramatically, and US shrimpers
have to compete with cheap imported farm-raised shrimp.  The numbers of vessels
shrimping in the Gulf must go down if shrimpers are going to have a chance of
surviving economically.  Unfortunately, more and bigger shrimp vessels are
still being built at the present time.<P>

Environmentalists blame NMFS for failing to adequately regulate the fisheries
or protect endangered sea turtles.  Steiner said, "The facts are clear. The
shrimpers are overfishing the resource, the fishery is overcapitalized and NMFS
is doing nothing to limit entry. This is a disaster occurring right before our
eyes -- what is happening to the turtles is only a symptom of what's happening
to the marine environment.  Turtles, shrimpers and the ecosystem are all the
losers."<P>

<H2>Scientists declare Lack of faith in the National Marine Fisheries
Service</H2>

In their supporting declarations to our lawsuit, these top sea turtle
scientists clearly state their lack of faith in the National Marine Fisheries
Service, and the need for immediate action to halt the sea turtle crisis in US
waters.<P>

<H3>Dr. Pam Plotkin<BR>
Former NMFS Acting National Sea Turtle Coordinator</H3>


"In my professional opinion, the ERP (Emergency Response Plan) is unlikely to
protect sea turtles... My best professional judgement, based on the
inadequacies in the ERP and the importance of the nearshore habitat, is that
the nearshore waters of the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico should be immediately
closed to shrimping."<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Dr. Peter Pritchard<BR>
Co-author of the definitive National Academy of Sciences
report "Decline of the Sea Turtles"</H3>

"Given the high continuing levels of sea turtle strandings described above, the
Plan is a failure and cannot be relied upon to reduce sea turtle mortalities to
an acceptable level.... based on my thirty years experience, an immediate
moratorium in nearshore Texas waters is necessary to insure the continued
existence of the Kemp's ridley."<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Jack Woody<BR>
Former Sea Turtle Coordinator, US Fish and Wildlife
Service</H3>

"Unless the cause of this loss is promptly addressed and halted in 1995 (which
the government's plan is unable to accomplish), the species' survival remains
in grave jeopardy.  A number of actions, implemented properly, could greatly
curtail the further loss of turtles for this and future seasons.  To begin
with, there must be some seasonal trawling closures in defined areas [along the
Gulf Coast]."

<TITLE>STRP: Save the Endangered Species Act</TITLE>

<H1>Save the Endangered Species Act!</H1>

When Congress passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973, it gave the US one of
the strongest pieces of environmental legislation in the world.  The ESA not
only mandated federal agencies to identify and list species at risk, but also
to write and implement recovery plans.<P>

The ESA has been strengthened three times since then: in 1978, 1982 and 1988. 
But now in 1996, with ecosystems unravelling under an onslaught of industrial
exploitation, the ESA itself is in danger of extinction.  With the ESA up for
reauthorization, the so-called "Wise Use" (Unwise Abuse) Movement and its
friends in the 104th Congress have been on the offensive, depicting the ESA as
unwieldy, expensive and outmoded.  They would like to see the ESA eliminated or
drastically weakened in order to allow industrial activity (including shrimp
fishing) to proceed unimpeded, no matter what the impact to endangered species
and their habitats. <P>

A number of "wise-use" bills have been offered up by anti-ESA politicians. 
Fortunately, the public supports protecting endangered species, and largely
sees past the hype to the real intent of bills which would "amend" the ESA. 
<P>

The Young/Pombo bill (HR 2275), which passed the House Resources Committee in
October 1995, is a severe piece of legislation.  Its provisions would
specifically harm sea turtles and other endangered and threatened marine
species.  <P>

Under the Young/Pombo bill, shrimp fishermen would be exempted from using
Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs), if the shrimpers make donations to conservation
programs for sea turtles, such as the protection of nesting beaches.  TEDs have
proven to be 97% effective in saving sea turtles when properly used; the
removal of TED requirements would drastically hurt sea turtles.  There is
little point in protecting nesting beaches while allowing turtles to drown by
the thousands at sea.<P>

HR2275 would also lift the ban on importation of wildlife and wildlife products
governed by the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species
(CITES).  <P>

Other unpopular extremist bills, such as those authored by Kempthorne (R-ID)
and Gorton (R-WA) would severely damage the country's efforts to protect
endangered wildlife and plants, including the six species of sea turtles
currently listed as "endangered" or "threatened" under the ESA. <P>

Last fall Congress placed a moratorium on new listings of threatened or
endangered species, by eliminating the funding necessary for the US Fish and
Wildlife Service to undertake such listings.  This means many species at risk
are not getting the protection they need.  This will actually <B>increase</B> the
ultimate cost of recovery; while debate drags on the situation for imperilled
species can only worsen.<P>

The fact that this is an election year may push the ESA reauthorization issue
into 1997.   In the meantime, wildlife advocates must pressure their
representatives to oppose attempts to weaken the ESA, and let them know there
is public support for <B>stronger</B> endangered species legislation.

<H2>Save India's Bhitar Kanika: Critical olive ridley sea turtle nesting
beach</H2>

In our last newsletter we filled you in on the precarious status of the Bhitar
Kanika Wildlife Sanctuary on the Bay of Bengal in Orissa, India.  This
international treasure, 415 miles square, is the worlds most important nesting
beach for the olive ridley sea turtle.  Bhitar Kanika also contains the
second-largest contiguous mangrove forest in India, provides critical habitat
for the endangered estuarine crocodile, and is home to over 80,000 wading
birds.<P>

Construction of a commercial fishing port adjacent to Bhitar Kanika threatens
the ecological integrity of the area.  The port would include 500 shrimp
trawlers, a processing plant and shrimp farming operations.  Intensive shrimp
trawling would quickly diminish local fisheries, while shrimp farming would
deforest and pollute the ecosystem.  The terrible effects of shrimp trawling on
sea turtles are well-known.<P>

Last year, in response to international pressure, the Chief Minister of Orissa
State voiced his support for making Bhitar Kanika a National Park, and
potentially a United Nations Biosphere Reserve.  Unfortunately, the Chief
Minister lost his seat in the last election, and the new Chief Minister has
been slow to support protection for Bhitar Kanika.<P>

<H3>Please Take Action!</H3>

The fight is far from over!  We must continue to put international pressure on
the Indian government.  Please send letters or postcards to the Indian
officials below, expressing your desire that Bhitar Kanika be protected.<P>

<TITLE>STRP: Sea turtle products for sale at Vietnam Airport</TITLE>

<H1>Sea turtle products for sale at Vietnam Airport</H1>

The Sea Turtle Restoration Project has recently received reports and photo
documentation of sea turtle products being sold in the duty-free section of
Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City airport.  These products, made from endangered
hawksbill sea turtles, include eyeglass frames, cigarette holders, hair pins,
fans, necklaces and whole stuffed turtles.<P>

Vietnam has recently joined the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  Sea turtle products are available for
sale throughout Vietnam, but as a new CITES member Vietnam agreed to ban
<B>international</B> trade in these products.  Selling sea turtle products to people
<B>after</B> they have passed through customs on their way out of Vietnam violates the
spirit, and potentially the letter, of the CITES ban.<P>

This is just one example of a global problem: the sale of endangered species
products in airports around the world.  Our concerns have been brought to the
attention of Dr. Sue Lieberman of the US Fish and Wildlife Service' Office of
Management Authority, who will be discussing the matter with CITES authorities
when she meets with them next.<P>

STRP is working with other concerned groups to bring an end to this heinous
practice.  We will take every step possible to see that these products are
removed from the duty-free shop, and to end all trade in endangered sea
turtles.

<H1>Greek sea turtle activist bombed.</H1>

Sea turtle activists on the Greek island of Zakynthos, who are fighting to
protect the Mediterranean's most important loggerhead sea turtle nesting beach,
have long been targeted by interests opposed to restrictions on tourism
development.  Activists have been shot at, beaten, had their offices set on
fire, and received telephone threats and verbal harasssment.<P>

On September 29, 1995, 3.3 pounds of dynamite exploded on the roof of the Sea
Turtle Protection Society of Greece (STPS) and Zakynthos Ecological Movement
(ZOK) office.  Fortunately none of the 15 ZOK staffers and three children who
were working on the organization's newsletter at the time were killed, although
architect Nikos Lykouresis, a founding member of ZOK, was wounded.<P>

STPS has gathered 51,000 signatures on a petition to the Greek government to
establish a National Marine Park on the island of Zakynthos.  Despite support
for the marine park from most Zakynthos residents, the local hoteliers' chamber
and the European Union (which has promised funding for the proposed park),
pro-development politicians continue to block protection of these critical
loggerhead sea turtle nesting beaches.<P>

<H1>Turtle-Safe Shrimp News</H1>

<TITLE>STRP: Turtle-Safe Shrimp News</TITLE>

Turtle-Safe shrimp has made the leap from the boat deck to the marketplace,
landing in restaurants and markets on both U.S. coasts.<P>

The Turtle-Safe campaign takes a new market-oriented approach to the old
problem of sea turtles drowning in shrimp nets. In the first years after the
U.S. government required shrimp fishermen to use turtle excluder devices about
1990, many environmentalists and fishermen alike thought the turtles were safe.
The past two years proved them wrong. More than 4,000 washed up on U.S. shores.
 Based on pre-TEDs U.S. figures, the Sea Turtle Restoration Project estimates
shrimp nets are fatal to 155,000 each year in other countries.<P>

Shrimp caught by fishermen who join the program carry a Turtle-Safe seal on the
package. The seal lets consumers know which shrimp was caught using fishing
gear that allows turtles to escape.<P>

Publicity, like the New York Times ad that ran in July, a brochure, and a
television public service announcement, informs consumers about the sea
turtle-shrimp interaction and how their demand can influence the outcome.
Fishermen who use turtle excluder devices (TEDs) receive recognition for their
efforts. For the first time, there's a way to tell their shrimp from other
shrimp and encouragement for others to follow their example.<P>

The program started with forward-looking fishermen from Georgia. Georgia
fishermen were pioneers in turtle protection, developing the first excluders to
keep out jellyfish and horseshoe crabs as early as the late 1960s.

The first boxes of fresh Turtle-Safe shrimp were shipped last fall, a peak time
for Georgia white shrimp, to distributors in San Francisco, Boston, and Denver.
Bread & Circus stores in Boston, owned by Whole Foods Market, were among stores
that carried the shrimp. The Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF) served
Turtle-Safe at two events, one at the landmark Claremont Hotel in Oakland,
Calif., and the other at One Market in San Francisco.<P>

OFRF, California Certified Organic Farmers, and the Rainforest Alliance's Smart
Wood Program, have generously offered support and advice that helped get
Turtle-Safe shrimp on menus and in stores. The California program was created
and is managed by the farmers themselves. A first step in that direction for
the Turtle-Safe program is the Turtle-Safe Advisory Board. Fishermen, dock
owners, and OFRF's executive director Bob Scowcroft are among the board
members.<P>

Turtle-Safe shrimp is in the pilot program stage and the shrimp is in short
supply. You can help get more on the market by asking for Turtle-Safe shrimp.
Even though the winter months are the off-season for Georgia shrimp, just
asking for Turtle-Safe creates demand. It lets restaurants, supermarkets, and,
in turn, their suppliers know that their customers want only shrimp caught
while protecting sea turtles.<P>

<H1>Turtle-Safe(tm) shrimp</H1> 
<TITLE>STRP: Turtle-Safe(tm) shrimp</TITLE>
<H2>Program Description</H2>


Turtle-Safe(tm) shrimp is a consumer-based tool for protection of
endangered sea turtles. By buying only shrimp caught using fishing gear that
allows turtles to escape from shrimp nets, consumers can both support fishermen
who are conscientiously using this gear and provide an incentive to others to
follow their example.<P>

Six of the seven species of sea turtles are listed as endangered or threatened
in the U.S. Endangered Species Act and in international treaties. As shrimp
nets drag through the water, they capture sea turtles and tons of unwanted fish
along with the shrimp. If the turtles can't escape, they drown. A metal grid
sewn into the net can avoid most of these deaths. Known as a Turtle Excluder
Device, or TED, the grid guides turtles to a hole in the net. Shrimp pass
through the grid and into the back of the net.<P>

TEDs are required by law in the United States. But some fishermen sew closed
the trap door that lets the turtles escape, and the United States still imports
shrimp from countries that don't require TEDs or that require them for only
part of the fleet. The Turtle-Safe label for the first time lets consumers know
which shrimp were caught using methods that protect turtles.<P>

The label goes on shrimp caught by fishermen who sign an agreement with Earth
Island Institute stipulating that they will use TEDs properly and allow
monitoring by Turtle-Safe program observers. Docks, processors, and others in
the distribution network can sign agreements to identify shrimp as Turtle-Safe
and keep it separate from other shrimp.<P>

A publicity campaign is aimed at educating the public about this serious threat
to sea turtle survival and the broader issues of fish bycatch and marine
ecosystem protection, while directing demand to Turtle-Safe shrimp. The goal is
to use demand to pressure other countries to require TEDs and show fishermen
that there are rewards for using them.<P>

The program draws on dolphin-safe tuna and organic certification programs. The
dolphin-safe campaign, also organized by Earth Island Institute, forced reforms
in tuna fishing practices that are now U.S. law. <P>

Turtle-Safe shrimp will enable consumers to eat shrimp knowing that they were
caught without killing turtles. Fishermen who catch shrimp safely will see
their efforts recognized and an increase in demand for their shrimp. And fewer
turtles will die when more countries require the devices and make sure they're
used properly.<P>

The Turtle-Safe campaign is one of several programs of the Sea Turtle
Restoration Project. Todd Steiner is the founder and director of the
project.<P>

<H2>STRP's philosophy</H2> The Director of the STRP, Todd Steiner states, <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"David <A HREF="../brower/browerbr.html">Brower</A>, founder of
Earth Island Institute, often speaks of 'peace on and with the earth.' To this
vision we would add - justice and respect for the environment and all people.
As an action-oriented group, we feel our values are best reflected by our work.
We are attempting to protect the ecological needs of endangered species while
meeting the needs of disenfranchised local people who themselves have been
exploited by a system that has profit as its only goal. We work closely with
and coordinate our international campaigns with the emerging environmental
movements in the countries where we work." </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

In addition to taking direct action on issues it perceives as critical, a goal
of the STRP is to be a catalyst for action by the larger environmental
community and a resource for information on sea turtle campaigns for various
organizations. The Project has an internship program that brings undergraduate
and graduate students, recent graduates and law students into the organization
to function as staff members. Individuals from Yale University, World College
West, Northern Arizona University, Colorado College, U.C. Santa Cruz, U.C.
Berkeley, U.C. San Diego, Pitzer College, and Golden Gate University School of
Law have all participated. The exchange of information and skills enhances the
work of the organization and is mutually educational to interns and staff
alike. STRP has also presented papers at professional meetings, has given
presentations at various schools in the San Francisco area, at universities and
at corporations in the region. <I>Ancient Sea Turtles: Their Last Voyage?</I>,
a video co-produced by STRP is distributed nationally to educational
institutions.<P>

STRP is the plaintiff in a major lawsuit aimed at international protection of
sea turtles and is being represented by the prominent San Francisco law firm of
Heller, Ehrman, White and McAuliffe. The firm is providing its services on a
<I>pro bono basis</I>.<P>

<TITLE>Beyond the 'Scenic By-Ways'</TITLE>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Beyond the 'Scenic By-Ways'</H2><P>


The Southern Rockies, world-renowned for their scenic beauty and outstanding recreational opportunities, are in trouble.  Decades of impact from resource extraction such as logging, road-building, mining and grazing, has left a legacy of damage that poses serious threats to the region's ability to sustain wildlife and wild habitat.  While some pristine pockets of untouched wilderness remain, the fact is that just over the ridge from that spectacular view are clearcuts, badly-eroding roads, polluted streams and trampled vegetation.  The intact pieces that are left are insufficient to sustain the biological integrity of the region.  While the damage is extensive,  much of it can and must be healed if we are to prevent further deterioration of habitat quality, and the decline of numerous species of animal and plant life.

<P>


 Comprehensive watershed management offers the best chance of protecting, restoring and enhancing the region's watershed resources .  All concerned and affected parties must be brought together in a coordinated effort to develop and apply a long-term, sustainable strategy for watershed management which will address the problems of environmental degradation, habitat fragmentation, loss of biodiversity, declining local economies and quality of life.
<P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Healing the Damage</H2><P>

Restoring damaged ecosystems requires the coordinated efforts of a diverse group of people.  Local community members must team up with indiginous leaders, scientific experts and environmental activists to determine the needs of the land, and the most appropriate method of healing the damage.  The Southern Rockies Restoration Project is working to establish Watershed Councils in each of the regions watersheds, and to give them the tools necessary to plan and carry out effective restoration projects.<P>

<CENTER>

There is but one ocean though its coves<BR>

have many names;  a single sea of atmosphere<BR>

with no coves at all;  the miracle of soil, <BR>

alive and giving life, lying thin on the only earth,<BR>

for which there is no spare.<P>



We seek a renewed stirring of love for the earth.<BR>

We plead that what we are capable of doing to <BR>

it is often what we ought not to do. <BR>

We urge that all people now determine that an untrammeled wildness shall remain here<BR>

to testify that this generation had love for the next.<P>



We would celebrate a new renaissance.<BR>

The old one found a way exploit.<BR>

The new one has discovered the Earth's limits.<BR>

Knowing them, we may learn anew<BR>

what compassionand beauty are, and pause<BR>

to listen to the Earth's music.<P>



We may see that progress is not<BR>

the accelerating speed with which we multiply<BR>

and subdue the Earth nor the growing number<BR>

of things we possess and cling to.<BR>

It is a way along which to search for truth,<BR>

to find serenity and love and reverence for life,<BR>

to be part of an enduring harmony,<BR>

trying hard not to sing out of tune.<P>

<TITLE>Brower Fund: CPR for the Earth</TITLE>

</HEAD>



<BODY>

<BODY BGCOLOR="ADEAEA">



<H1>CPR for the Earth</H1>



<BLOCKQUOTE>&quotDavid Brower has been for many years a steady force of nature, drawing 

us to see the natural world as nurturer, teacher, inspirer, and partner. [He has] been the 

pathbreaker, not given to easy answers or ruinous compromises...  A man of great insight 

who cares deeply for his world.&quot</BLOCKQUOTE>

--Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter<P>



David Brower is an elder of the environmental movement, and a visionary spokesman.  He 

has inspired countless wilderness advocates to dedicate their lives as stewards of the 

Earth.  David has a proven track record of being a non-compromising ally of the Earth, and 

his inspirational lectures challenge us to be bold leaders.  In his lifetime David has 

participated in some of our nation's greatest environmental battles.  &quotToo much of our 

work,&quot he opines &quotmearly slows the rate at which things are getting worse, we must invest 

ourselves and our time towards making things better.&quot  David fears we are a nation being 

eroded by its addiction to growth, living off natural resource capital, not just the interest.  

Despite many discouraging signs, Brower remains an optimist, intrigued by human potential.

<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>&quotSo speed the healing of the planet we all share.  The cost of the Green 

Century is so essential that it warrants compulsory investment.  There will be a guaranteed 

return.  Failure to make that investment will cost far more than humanity and our fellow 

sentient beings can afford.&quot</BLOCKQUOTE>

--David Brower<P>



David Brower regularly travels across the country and overseas delivering his prescriptions 

for peace, on and with the Earth.  Now 83, David Brower draws on nearly sixty years of 

environmental activism to promote CPR for the Earth.  David Brower's CPR for the Earth 

lecture promotes planetary <STRONG>C</STRONG>onservation, 

<STRONG>P</STRONG>reservation and <STRONG>R</STRONG>estoration.  David 

argues that the combined use of these strategies will afford us a future by design, not by 

default.<P>



David regularly speaks to college audiences, government agencies, multi-national 

corporations and appears on national media programs and in publications.  He is particularly 

interested in reaching out to the younger generation, and to the business community to 

share his knowledge and to inspire change.  Few speakers can articulate the need for 

renewed hope in our common future than David Brower.<P>



Honoraria from David's speaking engagements help support fledgling environmental and 

social initiatives through the <A HREF="brower.html">Brower Fund</A> at 

<A HREF="../index.html">Earth Island Institute</A>.  By inviting David Brower to speak at 

your next conference, group meeting or festival you will take an important step towards 

committing yourself and others to the opportunities for a more ecologically sustainable, 

peaceful and just society.<P>



David is available to speak on a wide variety of issues, and is careful to acknowledge the 

specific concerns of the host group.  Past lecture topics include:  Land Conservation,  The 

Meaning of Wilderness to Science, On 50 Years of Environmental Activism, Overcoming 

Barriers to World Peace, and Economics of Sustainability.<P>



In the Past year David has delivered speeches to tens of thousands of people accross the 

country.  These lectures have included:  Patagonia Inc. (all company meeting), Interface 

(annual meeting), Sella Foundation (Italy), United States Environmental Protection Agency 

(twice), The Presidio Conference, The Windstar Foundation, The Charlie Rose program 

(national television), and dozens of others.<P>

<A HREF="../baikal/baikal.html">Baikal Watch</A> use PC's.
If your not sure what you've got, give you can contact <A HREF="mailto:kenyarb@earthisland.org">Ken Yarborough</A>.<P>

<H2>Macintosh</H2>

For Mac's, we'd one of these: "II" series, LC, Performa, Quadra, Centris or PowerPC (gulp!). Powerbooks
or Duos would be fantastic too.<P>

<H2>PC</H2>

For PC's, we'd prefer 486 or Pentium (gasp!) PC's or laptops.<P>

<H2>Other stuff</H2>

If you want to help get more of Earth Island on the "information super-highway," we need modems that

<TITLE>Earth Island's Mission</TITLE>
<H1>Earth Island's Mission</H1>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../eiwnorm.jpeg"><BR>

Life on Earth is imperiled by human degradation of the biosphere.  Earth
Island Institute develops and supports projects that counteract threats
to the biological diversity and cultural
diversity that sustain the environment.  Through education and
activism, these projects promote the conservation, preservation, and
restoration of the Earth. <P>

<H2>From the Executive Directors John A. Knox & David Phillips</H2>

When Earth Island Institute became a membership organization in 1986, neither
of us imagined what a growing and vibrant network of projects would evolve. Our
successes owe a great deal to our unique structure. Our core staff researches
emerging issues and educates the public about effective action.  We nurture the
development of projects to address these issues, and provide a support
structure within which projects can concentrate on content rather than
administration and get the job done.<P>

<H2>Many Projects...</H2>

Acting globally and locally -- for <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">dolphin protection</A>, inner city
restoration, forest conservation, and a host of other issues -- Earth
Island is a major player on behalf of the Earth.<P>

We are a network of innovative activists dedicated to the Earth and its
diverse communities.  Our projects focus on specific environmental
threats and offer creative, effective solutions.<P>

In our first 13 years, Earth Island has produced remarkable results in
a wide range of environmental issues:<P>

<H2>Environmental Restoration</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Mobilized international technical assistance for Russian
environmental leaders seeking protection and restoration of Siberia's
<A HREF="../baikal/baikal.html">Lake Baikal</A>.<P>

<LI>Won significant wetlands restoration for Southern California in the
settlement of a Clean Water Act lawsuit.<P>

</UL>

<H2>Endangered Species</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Forged the landmark agreement with US tuna companies to buy only
<A HREF="../immp/immp.html">dolphin-safe</A> tuna.<P>

<LI>Pressured the Mexican government to halt the sanctioned killing of
endangered <A HREF="../strp/strpindx.html">sea turtles</A>.<P>

</UL>

<H2>Sustainability</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Exposed environmentally and culturally disastrous practices of the
<A HREF="../journal/journal.html">World Bank</A> and Hydro-Quebec in the promotion of large-scale
hydro-electric projects.<P>

</UL>

<H2>Environmental Justice</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Produced <A HREF="../slfp/sacredla.html">films</A> to help native peoples protect their lands from
reckless mining and <A HREF="../journal/haarp2.html">energy development</A>.<P>

<LI>Exposed the effects of environmental neglect, such as abandoned gas
stations, on inner city neighborhoods.<P>

<LI>Created a subsistence organic garden for the homeless in Berkeley,
California.<P>

</UL>

Earth Island Institute was founded in 1982 by veteran environmentalist
David <A HREF="../brower/browerbr.html">Brower</A> -- first executive director of Sierra Club, founder of
Friends of the Earth, campaigner for wild places, and advocate for
environmental restoration.  His initiatives for the environment
continue through the <A HREF="../brower/brower.html">Brower Fund</A>, a project of Earth Island.<P>

<HR>

<H1>Organizational Model</H1>

Earth Island Institute is comprised of a diverse array of <A
HREF="../allproj.html">projects</A> supported by the core organization. Once adopted
by the Earth Island board of directors, projects operate autonomously under the
general supervision of Network Services staff and the board.<P>


Central to the concept of Earth Island is the belief that action should take
precedence over bureaucracy.  EII incubates new initiatives and provides a
support system for on-going projects.  By providing assistance in strategic
planning,  fundraising, public relations, database management, and accounting,
the Institute offers a lean and flexible organizational structure to advance
the work of its more than thirty projects.<P>


EII publishes the acclaimed quarterly <A HREF="../journal/journal.html">Earth Island
Journal</A>.  In addition to reporting on wide-ranging activities and
campaigns as it brings its readers "local news from around the world," the
Journal also acts as a major outreach tool for Earth Island's projects.<P>


Citizen activists and emerging environmental leaders are drawn to Earth Island
as a place to implement ideas.  Projects can grow quickly, with the advice and
support of Earth Island Institute staff.  Grassroots initiatives - often begun
by activists expanding the boundaries of traditional environmentalism - gain
stature by becoming part of an established organization.<P>


Earth Island Institute believes that environmental and societal issues are
inter-related and that solutions to our most pressing problems require sharing
of resources, cooperation, and coalition building. Projects based in Earth
Island's headquarters share office facilities and equipment as well as ideas
and contacts.  Projects with offices out-of-state and around the globe benefit
from a support center in San Francisco, a major nexus of the international
environmental movement.<P>


Considerable cross-pollination and collaboration occur between projects. Those
working on the environmental rights  of multicultural
city dwellers interact daily with those working to protect <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">marine mammals</A>.  Activists preserving ancient <A
HREF="../strp/strpindx.html">sea turtle</A> populations work alongside
environmentalists concerned with the rights of indigenous
populations. Those working on sustainable food production can confer with
alternative energy advocates.  Environmentalists focusing on <A
HREF="../baikal/baikal.html">Russia</A>, <A HREF="../berkborn/berkborn.html">Borneo</A>, Japan and the <A HREF="../tibet/tibet.html">Himalayas</A> share
information with those working in the Americas. 
Staff, interns, and volunteers have the opportunity to work with small emerging
projects while being part of one of the country's most well-respected,
internationally recognized environmental organizations.<P>

<IMG SRC="carl-sml.gif"><P> <TITLE>A Message from Earth Island Institute's
President</TITLE> <H1>A Message from Earth Island Institute's President</H1>

Both challenges and accomplishments marked the year 1994.  Every day the media
carried stories about the changing atmosphere, loss of habitat, and threats to
biological and cultural diversity.  But as
Earth Island's President,  I can look back with pride on the work that our
staff, volunteers, and members have done to make the planet healthier and more
accommodating for all life.<P>

The principles of social justice must be at the heart of efforts to protect our
planet.  Our vision must offer a real alternative to seeing the tropical
rainforest as either a private laboratory for multinational pharmaceutical
companies or an inviolate preserve, ignoring the needs of indigenous
populations.  We must avoid the misuse of environmental issues as a way of
rationalizing the economic status quo.  We cannot manipulate terms so that the
legitimate need for population control becomes a code word for racism.<P>

Alienation from the source of our abundance and well-being - the natural
environment - is a greatly disturbing trend.  The loss of this contact with
living and growing things, even rudimentary knowledge of where food and water
come from, presents serious consequences that we have no way of measuring.<P>

The alarming results of the national elections in November 1994 and the
escalating attacks on our environment and on the disenfranchised remind us that
we must never become complacent.  In 1995, Earth Island continues to be a place
where environmental leadership is cultivated and where the struggles for
ecological consciousness and social justice draw nourishment.  Thank you for
your support.<P>

Carl Anthony, President<P>

<H2>Campaign Mission:</H2>
Earth Island Institute's (EII) International Marine Mammal Project (IMMP) works
to make oceans safe for marine mammals worldwide. We strive to eliminate
dolphin mortality caused by the international tuna fishing industry, to end the
use of driftnets, and to stop tuna purse-seine fishers from encircling dolphins
in their nets. In addition, we aim to stop the resumption of commercial whaling
worldwide and to promote sustainable fishing.<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H2>Dolphin Death Act Stopped!</H2>

Earth Island Institute announced today that the "Dolphin Death
Act," H.R.2823 and S.1420, has been stopped in the U.S. Senate and will not
become law.<P>

"These bills would have crippled dolphin protection and misled millions of
Americans," explained David Phillips, Director of Earth Island Institute. 
"Thanks to the public outcry and to the leadership of Senator Barbara Boxer
(D-CA) and the bipartisan group of Senators and House members, the dolphin-safe
label is safe"<P>

<TITLE>Bluewater Network</TITLE>

<IMG SRC="bwheader.gif" WIDTH=536 HEIGHT=141 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5>

<h2>Responsible boaters want to know:<br>

Can we use outboard motors and "jet skis" and save the waterways, too?</h2>

<H3>Why we shouldn't use the two-stroke motor:</H3>

<IMG SRC="graph3.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT  WIDTH=280 HEIGHT=345 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5> <A
HREF="pollute.html">Pollution</A> from <A HREF="2stroke.html">two-stroke
motors</A> - outboards, personal watercraft, and jet boats - amounts to the
equivalent of fifteen Exxon Valdez spills annually. This equals 1,000,000,000
pounds of gas and oil, and represents as much hydrocarbon pollution as that
created by all the automobiles in the United States. Worldwide, two-strokes
produce 3,000,000,000 pounds of hydrocarbon emissions per year. Recent studies
at the University of Stockholm have demonstrated that the biological effects of
exhaust from two-stroke engines are "...a serious threat to the marine
environment."

<H3>Who is Bluewater Network?</H3>

Bluewater is a coalition of scientists, <A HREF="industry.html">marine
industry</A> experts, and concerned individuals with a shared commitment to the
health of the planet's water resources. Bluewater's members include fishers,
sailors, kayakers, canoers, swimmers, surfers, windsurfers, divers, rafters,
and other marine enthusiasts who wish to protect our water ecosystems from
pollution.<P>

Bluewater was founded by marine activist and sailor, Dr. Russell Long, who
became aware of the damage caused by two-stroke engines through his work with
fishers in South India. His studies revealed that the two-stroke is destroying
traditional fishing life in the Third World by bringing about tremendous
pollution and associated ecosystem devastation.

<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H3>"The Secret Spill"</H3>

While the effects of this <A HREF="pollute.html">pollution</A> are largely
unseen, the spent oil and gas from pleasure boats floats on the surface
microlayer of bays, lakes, rivers, and seas, which are the sites for
reproduction and sensitive early-stage development of most fish species. These
areas are the base of the food chain for fish eggs, larvae, algae, crab
lobster, shrimp, and plankton. Research demonstrates that chromosomal damage,
malformations, stunted growth and high mortality rates of fish and larvae occur
at extremely low levels of surface layer hydrocarbon pollution, levels which
may already exist in many US water bodies. Scientists have determined that a
polluted microlayer " .<B> . . has the potential to poison much of the complex
food web, including fish, crustaceans, whales, and seabirds."</B> (Mele, 1994)

<H3>What is the two-stroke motor?</H3>

The <A HREF="2stroke.html">two-stroke</A> motor is used in most outboards and
personal watercraft (e.g., jet skis). It has an extremely inefficient design,
and lacks a catalytic converter, fuel injection, electronic ignition, or any of
the other devices currently used to reduce emissions in automobiles. As a
result, twenty-five percent of gasoline and oil used by two-stroke marine motors
is leaked directly into the water. The EPA estimates that from 1997 to the year
2025, these motors will create 20,000,000,000 pounds of hydrocarbon pollution
in the US alone.

<H3>Bluewater's plan to address marine pollution.</H3>

Bluewater's goal is to eliminate the damaging pollution from two-stroke motors.
Bluewater is promoting less harmful propulsion alternatives such as 4-stroke,
inboard/sterndrive, electric, catalytic converters, and other higher efficiency
motor options. We will also educate marine enthusiasts to the <A
HREF="4steps.html">actions they can take</A> to stop pollution damage to the
environment from two-strokes and other sources.

<H3>Won't you join us?</H3>

preserve the world's water ecosystems. Four steps you can take now are listed

<P>&quot;..in our race to modernize we must respect the ancient

<H2>Why Borneo?</H2></CENTER> 

<P> For millennia,
Borneo's indigenous communities have taken care of their home in the world's oldest rainforest.  The forest in return has provided the resources necessary for these communities to survive.   Today these well-established and complex relationships between the land and its rightful inhabitants are under pressure.</P>

<IMG SRC="born-map16.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT alt="Map of Borneo" VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5>

<P>
 In recent years, the fragile rainforest ecosystems of Borneo have come under the saw. Ignoring traditional land
claims made by native peoples, logging companies and oil palm plantations are clear-cutting the forest at
an unprecedented rate.  Costs to future generations from the extinction of medicinal plant species and other vital genetic resources are impossible to estimate.  However, the current costs to indigenous communities in Borneo are immediate and apparent.                                         Contaminated river systems, degraded forests and other spoils of heavy industry continue to erode the abundant resource base upon which a unique and resourceful people have depended for thousands of years.</P>

<P></P>


<BR CLEAR=ALL>


<CENTER>
<H2>Who We Are</H2></CENTER>

<P> </P>

<P>In Sarawak, the heart of Malaysian Borneo, lies an important center of
resistance--the Kayan village of 
<A HREF="visituma.html">Uma Bawang</A> This
village has long established a democratic and environmentally-sound way of using and managing the rainforest. If Uma Bawang succeeds in
wresting control of the rainforest from the logging companies and returning it
to the longhouse it will be a model for rainforest communities everywhere. The people of Uma Bawang have been a positive force
and a source of inspiration for their persistent attempts to bring social and
environmental justice to their region. In 1991, when Berkeley and Uma Bawang
became sister communities, The Borneo Project (formally the Berkeley Borneo Big Home Project) was born.  </P>

<P>
 The Borneo Project is a volunteer based non-profit organization using citizen diplomacy, outreach, direct assistance and cultural exchange to further indigenous rights and
promote rainforest preservation in Borneo.  In response to the needs of indigenous communities, we are developing innovative 
<A HREF="projects.html">projects </A>which enable local villages to secure traditional land claims and network with international and Borneo-based NGO's working toward indigenous rights.  We are monitoring violations of human and land rights in Borneo and dedicated to educate the public of these issues. Finally we are a fund raising organization with a majority of our contributions going directly to support vital projects of the Uma Bawang Residents Association. </P>

<TITLE>Sea Turtle Restoration Project (STRP)</TITLE> <H1>Sea Turtle Restoration
Project (STRP)</H1> <IMG SRC="strp.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2><P>

The Sea Turtle Restoration Project (STRP) works to protect sea turtle
populations in ways that meet the ecological needs of the sea turtles and the
needs of the local communities who share the beaches and waters with these
endangered species.  We use a multi-faceted approach which includes grassroots
action, multi-media campaigns, hands-on conservation projects, environmental
education, and litigation. We rely on tax-deductible donations from individuals
and private foundations, as well as the <I>pro bono</I> services of numerous
supporters, and are grateful to all for their help and support.  By
incorporating interested individuals into our work, we are able to share and
learn new strategies.  We welcome your input and assistance.

<H2>STRP's philosophy</H2> The Director of the STRP, Todd Steiner states,
"David <A HREF="../brower/browerbr.html">Brower</A>, founder of Earth Island
Institute, often speaks of 'peace on and with the earth.' To this vision we
would add - justice and respect for the environment and all people. As an
action-oriented group, we feel our values are best reflected by our work. We
are attempting to protect the ecological needs of endangered species while
meeting the needs of disenfranchised local people who themselves have been
exploited by a system that has profit as its only goal. We work closely with
and coordinate our international campaigns with the emerging environmental
movements in the countries where we work." <P> <BR CLEAR=ALL>

In the Mangrove Forest life abounds. One can find shorebirds,
crab-eating monkeys, fishing cats and mud-skipper fish that skim across exposed
swamp mud making their way between water holes exposed at low tide.  Mangroves
are the rainforest of the sea - unique in both the plant and animal life they
support.  the tres have adapted special aerial roots and salt-filtering tap
roots that enable them to thrive in brackish water swamp lands.<P>

<H1>The Sacred Land Film Project</H1>
<TITLE>The Sacred Land Film Project</TITLE>

<H2>(c) 1995 by Christopher McLeod </H2>

The goals of the Sacred Land Film Project are to deepen public understanding of
sacred land, to help protect sacred sites and indigenous cultures, and to
rekindle reverence for the land within technological society. Our method of
achieving these goals will be a series of documentary films comparing the
land ethics and spiritual values of various cultures, as described by the
people of those cultures. By focusing the films on individuals whose sense of
the sacred is rooted in the place where they live, we hope to portray, through
intimate personal testimony, diverse cultural attitudes toward the land. <P>

The film series focuses on a number of crucial, timely issues: biological and cultural diversity, religious freedom and land rights, indigenous peoples' insights into connections between mind, culture and land, and the ecological ramifications of the spiritual vacuum in western culture. Like sacred
places, the project needs your help and invites your participation.<P>

The Sacred Land Film Series is being produced by Christopher McLeod under the
fiscal sponsorship of the non-profit Earth Island Institute of San Francisco.
McLeod has produced three award-winning, hour-long documentaries, all of which
have been broadcast on national television: <B>Poison in the Rockies </B>(for
the PBS series <B>Nova</B>), <B>Downwind/Downstream </B>and <B>The Four
Corners: A National Sacrifice Area?</B> He recently produced <B>Voices of the
Land</B>, a twenty-minute preview of the Sacred Land Film Series. <P>

All of these films are available from Bullfrog Films, Oley PA 19547, tel:
1-800-543-3764.<P>

The first two films in the series are on Mt. Shasta and the Four Corners area
of the American Southwest. Initial filming has focused on 87-year old Wintu
medicine woman Florence Jones and 86-year old A HREF="../journal/blmesa.html">Hopi</A> spokesman Thomas Banyacya, two important Native American elders who have spent
their lives fighting to protect sites sacred to their people from desecration.
For Florence, it is the McCloud watershed to the south of Mt. Shasta. For
Thomas, it is the spiritual center extending in the four directions from the
Hopi mesas to the sacred mountains and beyond -- an area that Thomas describes as "a sacred chamber" which the Hopi protect through prayer and ceremony.<P>

<H1>Stewards of the Earth (SE)</H1>

Stewards of the Earth (SE) is based in Goleta, California, on a century-old organic farm surrounded by urban development, which supplies local residents with nearly 100 different varieties of fruits and vegetables through a community supported agriculture program and retail store.  SE conducts educational activities about food and agriculture, including:  tours and live-in programs for school classes; lecture programs and concerts; "from the field to the plate" cooking classes; horticultural therapy for individuals with physical and developmental disabilities; and training programs for at-risk youth in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties.  SE has produced <I>From the Good Earth, A Celebration of Growing Food Around the World</I>, an illustrated book, as well as multi-media slide show, traveling exhibition, and public lectures dealing with food and agricultural issues across five continents. The project is developing an organic agricultural training program for inner city youth from the Los Angeles area which will culminate in an installation of an urban organic farm in that area.  Project Director: Michael Ableman. <P>

<TITLE>The Tibetan Plateau Project</TITLE>
<H1>The Tibetan Plateau Project</H1>
<IMG SRC="tpp-mt.gif"><BR>
Founded in 1992, the Tibetan Plateau Project (TPP) of Earth Island Institute is the first grassroots environmental organization in the U.S. to comprehensively address environmental and development issues in the greater Tibetan Plateau region. This area encompasses portions of Bhutan, China, India, Nepal and Tibet. <P>

	TPP seeks to safeguard the abundant bio-diversity of the greater Tibetan Plateau through efforts that:
<UL>
<LI>Promote the conservation of medicinal plant and wildlife resources;
<LI>Support community-based biodiversity conservation and economic development projects;
<LI>Educate the international community about the threats facing biodiversity in the Tibetan Plateau region; and that
<LI>Develop solutions that can be used as models for environmental protection and restoration throughout the region.
</UL>
	TPP believes that the active participation of traditional healers and mountain communities is critical to environmental protection and sustainable development in the region. TPP actively cooperates with these communities to develop strategies for conservation and economic development that are culturally and environmentally appropriate. <P>


<H2>Medicinal Plant Conservation</H2>
The Tibetan Plateau region is estimated to contain 10,000  species of plants, of which 1,000 have known medicinal or economic value. Many of these plants are already threatened by habitat destruction or over-exploitation. In cooperation with the Muktinath Traditional Medical Center (MTMC), located in Jharkot, Nepal, TPP is developing projects to  protect and conserve medicinal plants, to support the practice of Tibetan medicine and to assist local communities in developing income-generating projects using medicinal plants. <P>

		In 1995, TPP plans to assist the MTMC and a doctor of Tibetan medicine with the conservation of medicinal plants and the promotion of community health services in the following ways:

<H2>Endangered Species Protection</H2>
In 1992, TPP began efforts to protect the argali, a wild Asian sheep, through provisions of the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). The argali is rare in nine Asian nations due to hunting and habitat destruction. TPP's advocacy helped establish a 1993 ESA regulation for the argali that classified all subspecies of the sheep as endangered throughout the majority of its range. Now, ESA regulations must be extended to cover the rest of the argali's habitat if the species is to be fully protected. <P>

	TPP is also compiling research that is expected to reveal that a wide range of plants and animals in the region is still threatened. Ultimately, TPP may formally request the US government to extend the ESA provisions that protect the argali to these species also. <P>


<H2>Increasing Worldwide Awareness</H2>
A fundamental aspect of TPP's work is communicating information about the threats facing the greater Tibetan Plateau region. TPP maintains databases that enable project staff to provide information to the public on environmental and development issues in the Plateau region. TPP has catalogued more than 300 contacts for international non-governmental organizations, academics and individuals active in protecting the greater Tibetan Plateau region. The project also maintains a bibliography of more than 250 articles, books and periodicals covering relevant issues. This information is available to members for free and to non-members for a nominal fee. TPP is also preparing reports on environmental threats to the Plateau region, particularly hydroelectric development and the endangered species trade, for release in late 1995.<P>

<H2>How You Can Help</H2>
Individuals and organizations can assist in countering environmental degradation in the greater Tibetan Plateau region by becoming informed about the issues and by supporting TPP's work. An annual membership includes regular updates from TPP and quarterly issues of EII's award-winning environmental newsmagazine, <A HREF="../journal/journal.html">Earth Island Journal</A>. Please contact TPP for membership information.<P>

Earth Island Institute is mostly Macintosh based, even though some projects such as 
<A HREF="../gsc/gschome.html">Global Service Corps</A> and 
<A HREF="../baikal/baikal.html">Baikal Watch</A> use PC's.
If your not sure what you've got, give you can contact <A HREF="mailto:kenyarb@earthisland.org">Ken Yarborough</A>.<P>

<H2>Macintosh</H2>

For Mac's, we'd one of these: "II" series, LC, Performa, Quadra, Centris or PowerPC (gulp!). Powerbooks
or Duos would be fantastic too.<P>

<H2>PC</H2>

For PC's, we'd prefer 486 or Pentium (gasp!) PC's or laptops.<P>

<H2>Other stuff</H2>

If you want to help get more of Earth Island on the "information super-highway," we need modems that
are 9600 baud or better (14.4 or 28.8 would be great!)<P>

<H1>Earth Island's Mission</H1>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../eiwnorm.jpeg"><BR>

Life on Earth is imperiled by human degradation of the biosphere.  Earth
Island Institute develops and supports projects that counteract threats
to the biological diversity and cultural
diversity that sustain the environment.  Through education and
activism, these projects promote the conservation, preservation, and
restoration of the Earth. <P>

<H2>From the Executive Directors John A. Knox & David Phillips</H2>

When Earth Island Institute became a membership organization in 1986, neither
of us imagined what a growing and vibrant network of projects would evolve. Our
successes owe a great deal to our unique structure. Our core staff researches
emerging issues and educates the public about effective action.  We nurture the
development of projects to address these issues, and provide a support
structure within which projects can concentrate on content rather than
administration and get the job done.<P>

<H2>Many Projects...</H2>

Acting globally and locally -- for <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">dolphin protection</A>, inner city
restoration, forest conservation, and a host of other issues -- Earth
Island is a major player on behalf of the Earth.<P>

We are a network of innovative activists dedicated to the Earth and its
diverse communities.  Our projects focus on specific environmental
threats and offer creative, effective solutions.<P>

In our first 13 years, Earth Island has produced remarkable results in
a wide range of environmental issues:<P>

Earth Island Institute was founded in 1982 by veteran environmentalist
David <A HREF="../brower/browerbr.html">Brower</A> -- first executive director of Sierra Club, founder of
Friends of the Earth, campaigner for wild places, and advocate for
environmental restoration.  His initiatives for the environment
continue through the <A HREF="../brower/brower.html">Brower Fund</A>, a project of Earth Island.<P>

<HR>

<H1>Organizational Model</H1>

Earth Island Institute is comprised of a diverse array of <A
HREF="../allproj.html">projects</A> supported by the core organization. Once adopted
by the Earth Island board of directors, projects operate autonomously under the
general supervision of Network Services staff and the board.<P>


Central to the concept of Earth Island is the belief that action should take
precedence over bureaucracy.  EII incubates new initiatives and provides a
support system for on-going projects.  By providing assistance in strategic
planning,  fundraising, public relations, database management, and accounting,
the Institute offers a lean and flexible organizational structure to advance
the work of its more than thirty projects.<P>


EII publishes the acclaimed quarterly <A HREF="../journal/journal.html">Earth Island
Journal</A>.  In addition to reporting on wide-ranging activities and
campaigns as it brings its readers "local news from around the world," the
Journal also acts as a major outreach tool for Earth Island's projects.<P>


Citizen activists and emerging environmental leaders are drawn to Earth Island
as a place to implement ideas.  Projects can grow quickly, with the advice and
support of Earth Island Institute staff.  Grassroots initiatives - often begun
by activists expanding the boundaries of traditional environmentalism - gain
stature by becoming part of an established organization.<P>


Earth Island Institute believes that environmental and societal issues are
inter-related and that solutions to our most pressing problems require sharing
of resources, cooperation, and coalition building. Projects based in Earth
Island's headquarters share office facilities and equipment as well as ideas
and contacts.  Projects with offices out-of-state and around the globe benefit
from a support center in San Francisco, a major nexus of the international
environmental movement.<P>


Considerable cross-pollination and collaboration occur between projects. Those
working on the environmental rights  of multicultural
city dwellers interact daily with those working to protect <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">marine mammals</A>.  Activists preserving ancient <A
HREF="../strp/strpindx.html">sea turtle</A> populations work alongside
environmentalists concerned with the rights of indigenous
populations. Those working on sustainable food production can confer with
alternative energy advocates.  Environmentalists focusing on <A
HREF="../baikal/baikal.html">Russia</A>, <A HREF="../berkborn/berkborn.html">Borneo</A>, Japan and the <A HREF="../tibet/tibet.html">Himalayas</A> share
information with those working in the Americas. 
Staff, interns, and volunteers have the opportunity to work with small emerging
projects while being part of one of the country's most well-respected,
internationally recognized environmental organizations.<P>

<IMG SRC="carl-sml.gif"><P> <TITLE>A Message from Earth Island Institute's
President</TITLE> <H1>A Message from Earth Island Institute's President</H1>

Both challenges and accomplishments marked the year 1994.  Every day the media
carried stories about the changing atmosphere, loss of habitat, and threats to
biological and cultural diversity.  But as
Earth Island's President,  I can look back with pride on the work that our
staff, volunteers, and members have done to make the planet healthier and more
accommodating for all life.<P>

The principles of social justice must be at the heart of efforts to protect our
planet.  Our vision must offer a real alternative to seeing the tropical
rainforest as either a private laboratory for multinational pharmaceutical
companies or an inviolate preserve, ignoring the needs of indigenous
populations.  We must avoid the misuse of environmental issues as a way of
rationalizing the economic status quo.  We cannot manipulate terms so that the
legitimate need for population control becomes a code word for racism.<P>

Alienation from the source of our abundance and well-being - the natural
environment - is a greatly disturbing trend.  The loss of this contact with
living and growing things, even rudimentary knowledge of where food and water
come from, presents serious consequences that we have no way of measuring.<P>

The alarming results of the national elections in November 1994 and the
escalating attacks on our environment and on the disenfranchised remind us that
we must never become complacent.  In 1995, Earth Island continues to be a place
where environmental leadership is cultivated and where the struggles for
ecological consciousness and social justice draw nourishment.  Thank you for
your support.<P>

Carl Anthony, President<P>

Earth Island Institute (EII) was founded in 1982 by <A
HREF="brower/browerbr.html">David Brower</A> to foster the work of creative
individuals by providing organizational support in developing <A
HREF="allproj.html">projects</A> for the conservation, preservation, and
restoration of the global environment.  EII provides results-oriented
individuals the freedom to develop program ideas, supported by services to help
them pursue those ideas, with a minimum of bureaucracy. <P>

By providing assistance in program strategy, public relations, database
management, accounting, and project coverage through <A
HREF="journal/journal.html">Earth Island Journal</A>, EII offers a cost
effective organizational structure to advance the work of its diverse projects.
While EII administers and provides support services for some thirty projects,
it does not directly fund or subsidize these projects.  Project directors
manage their own fundraising efforts with foundations and the general public.

<P><B>Director of ReThink Paper </B></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE = 5>It isn't surprising that John Tierney's revisionist piece, &quot;Recycling
is Garbage,&quot; recently reared its ugly head in <I>The New York Times
Magazine</I>. In fact it would appear to be a well timed and succinct part
of a complex, subtle strategy set forth by the timber and plastics industries
along with other Wise Use movement organizers. <BR>
<BR>
Just when <I>The New York Times</I> and other newspapers are under public
scrutiny for their paper procurement policies, this piece appears. Is it
coincidence? <I>The Times</I> has been under public pressure to use more
environmentally sound pulp for its pages--and especially to stop purchasing feedstock
derived from ancient forests in British Columbia's Clayoquot Sound and elsewhere for
its rag. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks to Tierney, however, for pointing out that it takes 75,000 trees
to produce one Sunday edition of <I>The New York Times</I>. It's a horrifying
number indeed. What Tierney failed to point out was that <I>The Times</I> 
has been deriving its newsprint from forest-destroying companies
such as Fletcher Challenge and MacMilllan Blodell. <BR>
<BR>
I had to shake my head in dismay when reading, in the venerable <I>New
York Times Magazine</I>, the rhetoric of the timber and plastic industries,
the former asserting that trees are a renewable resource, and that we have more trees
today in America than ever before. This totally misses the ecologists' point.
<FONT COLOR = GREEN><FONT SIZE = 5>The issue isn't about numbers of individual trees; if it were, the timber industry could
raze and replace every forest on the continent with tree farms and nobody
would care. The issue, instead, is about trees in unspoiled habitats, about intact 
watersheds, about forest ecosystems that support complex chains of interdependent life. 
These natural forested ecosystems--unlike tree farms--play a vital role in making Earth
inhabitable for all humans and wildlife.</FONT COLOR><FONT COLOR = BLACK><FONT SIZE = 5><BR> 
<BR>
Tierney cites Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute to the effect that trees
are an agricultural crop. Indeed some paper companies farm trees, so why
doesn't <I>The Times</I> restrict itself to using tree-farmed fiber? Perhaps
because much of the tree-farmed fiber available domestically is good only
for making popsicle sticks, not paper. <FONT COLOR = GREEN><FONT SIZE = 5>Better yet, 
why doesn't <I>The Times</I>take corn stalks and turn them into perfectly good paper? That would
be truly wise resource use, especially in light of the fact that the United
States has a vast supply of agricultural residues available for papermaking
(more than 283 million tons per year from corn, wheat, rice, oats, cotton,
and other annuals), and the know-how and technology to process it.</FONT COLOR>
<FONT COLOR = BLACK><FONT SIZE = 5> We could
pay American farmers for their waste, thereby eliminating the need to burn
it and cutting back on air pollution. We'd be saving energy because corn
stalks are easily pulped compared to trees, and of course produce far less
pollution and toxic by products. We could continue to divert paper waste
into the same batches of paper being produced from farm residues, thereby
closing the recycling loop. <BR>
<BR>
What's most alarming about <I>The Times </I>piece is that it seems to be
part of a well-organized campaign supported by transnational corporations
seeking to undo the nation's environmental laws. In this light, it isn't
odd at all that Tierney idiotically compares McDonald's garbage output favorably
to that of a small Mexican family. Most Mexicans don't eat food out of plastic
containers--and if they did, you can bet they'd reuse that container for 100
various other purposes until it couldn't be used again. <BR>
<BR>
Tierney's figures on the amount of waste generated by a typical McD's meal
(about 2 ounces of garbage for each customer served) are ludicrous. Perhaps
that figure would be the right number if McDonalds produced all of its McChicken
sandwiches and Quarter Pounders with organically raised chickens and cows,
lettuce, tomato, and onions. <FONT COLOR = RED><FONT SIZE = 5>But Tierney didn't look far enough backwards
into the cycle of a fast-food sandwich. He didn't ask how many pesticides
and fertilizers were used on the vegetables, how much grain and land went
into fattening up the chickens and cows for slaughters, how many chemicals
were used to produce the packaging, or how much toxic waste flushed into
the environment from the production and long-distance transportation of
the packaging, livestock, and produce across the country.</FONT COLOR><FONT COLOR = BLACK><FONT SIZE = 5> <BR>
<BR>
Pointing out that biodegradables don't necessarily decompose in airless
landfills raises another question: Why are we throwing out resource-rich
materials in the first place? Paper can and should be repulped for new cardboard
and paper. I'm sure William Rathje of the University of Arizona would agree.
Mummifying renwable, reusable resources is inefficient. <BR>
<BR>
Paper versus plastic? Here Tierney's inviting the wrong response. The correct
answer is--neither. Instead, take along a hemp tote-bag to the grocery store.
Get used to carrying it, and get out of the garbage loop. It isn't that
hard to do. The time someone spent calculating how much landfill space it
takes to dispose of one paper bag versus twelve plastic bags would have
been enough to sort through some waste baskets and divert the renewables
to the appropriate recycling bin.<BR>
<BR>
Tierney reached the heights of absurdity in extrapolating from the case of
the &quot;neutral&quot; college student who spends an apparently burdensome
eight minutes a week separating recyclables in his building. From that bit
of data, Tierney deduces that the City of New York is spending a whole $3,000
to support the student's habit. Would Tierney prefer the college student
spent those eight minutes smoking a cigarette or two? What would be the
government's expense in that case? You can bet recycling would look pretty
darned cost-effective in comparison. <BR>
<BR>
Tierney argues that new staples cost very little, so why go to the expense
of recycling them? He seems to suggest that the marketplace cost of purchasable goods reflects
their true cost. But surely Tierney must realize that cost has very little to do
with price. Perhaps he needs to re-read those seminal ecological texts he
refers to. We live in an economy where the prices of goods are set and dictated
by corporate forces and scales of economies. They decide how much we will
pay for products.<BR>
<BR>
Revisionism is a tricky and dangerous enterprise. Fortunately, Tierney's
revisionism is relatively minor compared with, say, that of &quot;scholars&quot;
and journalists trying to expunge the Holocaust. Yet his obsession seems
just as severe. He seems bent on proving that toxics activist Lois Gibbs
is a threat to liberty, and that the tragedy of Love Canal and places like
it never happened. Maybe next he'll be trying to prove that children and
animals in the small Texas town of Winona aren't really afflicted with cancers
and mutations caused by emissions from the local hazardous-waste facility.
Tierney seems bent on whitewashing the entire waste industry. <BR>
<BR>
The crafty way in which Tierney weaves figures, and the way he upholds them
with bogus arguments, is amazing, even funny. It had me in stitches, laughing
at its transparent absurdity. But now that I realize it's not a joke, it's
got me mad as hell. Perhaps I should thank Tierney and <I>The New York Times
Magazine</I> for lighting a fire under environmentalists like myself, proving
that our evangelical journey is far from complete. We'll just have to work
harder to gain converts to the recycling cause. I look forward to the day
Tierney himself surrenders his soul to the environmental cause and joins me 
and my fellow muckrakers in sorting through garbage rather than creating it. <BR>

Tree-Free Fibers</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The US Department of Agriculture has spent 40 years investigating
  more than 500 plants to find the best fiber for pulping paper. While hemp
  has historically been the most recognized plant for tree-free paper, the
  USDA has identified another plant, kenaf, as the most viable fiber to produce
  tree-free paper.<BR>
  <BR>
  There are numerous agrifibers ideally suited for paper production, including
  kenaf, hemp, agricultural residues (cereal straws, cotton linters, etc.),
  and reclaimed fabric. Most of these agrifibers yield more pulp-per-acre
  than forests or tree-farms, and require fewer pesticides and herbicides.
  In addition, fewer chemicals and less time and energy are needed to pulp
  and bleach agricultural fibers. In fact, agrifibers can be effectively
  brightened using totally-chlorine-free (TCF) bleaching processes, thus
  eliminating the production of highly toxic chlorine byproducts (such as
  dioxin) commonly associated with paper production. Crops such as hemp and
  kenaf also provide a means of adding strength to recycled fibers without
  using wood. </FONT></P>

<H2>Background and History of the Global Service Corps Organization</H2>







<br>







Rick Lathrop<br>



Executive Director<p>







The idea behind Global Service Corps (GSC) began evolving in 



1992 during my mid-career graduate studies.  Prior to that time I had gained 



experience as a high school teacher, a print advertising account 



representative, a non profit administrator, and an adult holistic educater and 



leadership trainer.  My graduate studies were part of the Human and 



Organization Development Ph.D. program at The Fielding Institute in Santa 



Barbara, California.  At Fielding I became interested in global studies, 



particularly in the area of sustainable development, and discovered that there 



were few educational programs available for adults to gain first-hand 



experience in the field of international development.  With the assistance of 



a small start-up grant from Fielding, I began the development of a program of 



short-term, "mini Peace Corps" types of experiences to provide Fielding students 



and others international grass roots exposure to global issues.  The concept 



soon expanded to include participation of adults from all walks of life 



interested in this kind of experience.  I began developing the GSC program 



part time while continuing my studies, finished my Masters degree 



in Organization Development in August of 1994, and have since been working full time 



on this endeavor.<p>







In 1993, GSC developed a working relationship with Global 



Routes, an organization which had been providing international community 



service summer programs for high school and college students for about ten 



years.  The two principals of Global Routes are friends of mine and they 



offered to assist me with the development of Global Service Corps by providing 



their non profit status along with their administrative expertise and 



international contacts.  Acting as the nominal adult division of Global Routes, 



GSC began to establish volunteer service programs for adults, 



with an emphasis on village-based sustainable development.  The first project 



trip took place in December of 1993 in Costa Rica, when 7 volunteers spent two 



weeks volunteering at the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve and the Curu 



Biological Reserve.  The GSC program expanded to Kenya in 1994, with projects 



relating to small scale food production utilizing biointensive gardening, and 



community based health care education.  In 1995, a project was established in 



Thailand with a present emphasis on teaching English and community service. 



During this time, GSC also began providing <A HREF="long.html">longer term service opportunities</A>



for adult volunteers.<p>







In August of 1995, GSC took another step in its development by 



becoming a project of <A HREF="../index.html">Earth Island Institute</A> (EII) in San Francisco.  EII was 



founded in 1982 by David Brower, first Executive Director of the Sierra Club, 



and founder of Friends of the Earth.  EII supports over 30 environmentally 



related projects ranging from <A HREF="../baikal/baikal.html">Baikal Watch</A> 



(protection of the Baikal Lake in Russia) to the <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">International Marine Mammal Project</A> (dolphin and whale protection including the "Free Willy" 



project), and the Urban Habitat Program 



(support for socially-just and ecologically-sustainable urban communities).  



GSC is now benefiting from the support of the Earth Island network services 



which include assistance in project administration, accounting, promotion, 



fund development and computer services.  The relationship established with 



Earth Island Institute acknowledges the inherent connection between sustainable 



development and environmental concerns. This relationship is providing connection 



to other environmentally oriented social action endeavors. The increasing availability 



and applicability of electronic communications is opening doors for at-distance volunteering 



and connections which has great potential. GSC has recently initiated a quarterly newsletter 



in both <A HREF="print.html">print</A> and <A HREF="updt.html">electronic</A> 



editions.<p>







Over the course of the development of GSC, the organization has benefitted from 



the all-volunteer efforts of various staff members.  Volunteers have assisted 



GSC with office administration, research, project coordination, in-country 



logistics, accounting, promotion, electronic communications and general 



support. One of the major reasons for the initiation of this organization was 



to provide opportunities for adults to become more actively involved in 



addressing our many global issues.  GSC will continue to emphasize volunteer 



participation as opportunities become increasingly available.<p>







GSC is now embarking on its first fund development campaign in 



order to establish a paid staff, to increase support of project development, 



and to establish an efficient vehicle to notify potential volunteers of this 



program.  It is our hope that GSC can expand its provision of 



international service opportunities to greater numbers of interested adult 



volunteers in the U.S. and other developed countries.  At the same time, we 



continue to strengthen our connections with our host communities.  We welcome your participation in 



the development of this program.  See <A HREF="invol.html">How you can be involved</A> and

<H2>From Earth Island's Executive Directors<BR>John A. Knox & David Phillips</H2>







When Earth Island Institute became a membership organization in 1986, neither of us 



imagined what a growing and vibrant network of projects would evolve.  Our 



successes owe a great deal to our unique structure. Our core staff researches emerging



issues and educates the public about effective action.  We nurture the development 



of projects to address these issues, and provide a support structure within which 



projects can concentrate on content rather than administration and get the job done.<P>

<h2><center>New Partners in Collaboration</center></h2>







<body>







<br>







Global Service Corps is pleased to announce the initiation of collaborative ventures with two new 



institutional partners, both of whom share with Global Service Corps the values of appropriate international 



sustainable development, collaboration, volunteer service, and experiential education.<p>







Presidio World College (PWC) is a new educational institution emerging at The Presidio of San Francisco, 



a 1,480 acre U.S. National Park being developed as a "global center for exchanging ideas on critical 



environmental and social challenges."  The mission of Presidio World College is to prepare men and women 



to find sensible, practical ways to achieve social and economic development while restoring and sustaining 



our environmental commons, and to see the goal of sustainable development in global terms, across the 



real differences that exist among various nations and cultures. PWC will offer degree and non-degree 



programs in Sustainable Development Studies, which emphasizes the common ground between economics 



and the environment, internationally and cross-culturally.  These programs will include a Bachelor of Arts 



Degree, a Master of Arts Degree (in collaboration with GSC institutional partner, The Fielding Institute), and 



a Sustainable Later-Life Design program for "second-stage learners,"  men and women in transition in their 



forties, fifties, and beyond.<p>







All three of these programs will include experiential education components where students will live and 



study in a culture very different from his or her own while being involved in a sustainable development 



project.   The study will include both academic and practical work including language and cultural studies.  



Global Service Corps is assisting PWC with the development of these international field study components, 



utilizing the existing GSC service project trips as a foundation.  While the first class of bachelor degree 



students is not expected to arrive until fall of 1997, PWC will be immediately launching internship programs 



for both Bachelors and Masters Degree students enrolled in other academic institutions.  The Sustainable 



Later-Life Design program is scheduled to begin in the summer or fall of this year, and the Masters Degree 



program soon thereafter.  For further information about these PWC programs and particularly the new 



internship opportunities, contact Global Service Corps.<p>











New Forests Project (NFP), is a project of The International Center, a non-profit research and educational 



organization that focuses on promoting democracy in developing countries, resolving regional conflicts 



and implementing sustainable development projects.  New Forests Project was founded in 1982, and 



present Director Stuart Conway joined NFP in 1990.  While serving as a Peace Corps Volunteer in 



Guatemala, Stuart recognized the vital role reforestation and agroforestry (the combining of trees with 



agricultural crops on the same land) can play in environmental conservation and regeneration in Central 



America.  Stuart was particularly interested in working directly with the campesinos (peasant farmers), the 



people who are on the front lines of the deforestation that is occurring in Central America and



elsewhere in the developing world.  Due to social, economic and political factors over which they have 



little control, such as unequal distribution of land, limited educational opportunities and widespread 



poverty, resource poor farmers are forced to cut forests in order to have a small field to plant enough 



crops to feed their families.  New Forest Project is reaching out to these farmers and their families through 



community tree nurseries and training programs now located in Honduras, Haiti, El Salvador and 



Gautemala, as well as in Ethiopia and the Philippines.<p>







Global Service Corps was introduced to New Forests Project by Jessica Goldberger, a GSC Volunteer on 



the February, 1994 Kenya Biointensive Gardening Project Trip.  At the time, Jessica was the Director 



Coordinator of the NFP World Seed Program and she began supplying seeds to our Kenya project.  Stuart 



Conway and GSC Director Rick Lathrop soon began discussions about GSC Volunteers assisting with NFP 



activities.  Our first collaborative venture will be the initiation of a sustainable mini-farming seminar and 



community training program modeled after the Kenya Biointensive Project.  For further information about 



NFP, visit their World Wide Web site at: http:/www.igc.apc.org/nfp, or contact them at: 



731 Eighth St., SE, Washington, DC 20003; telephone: 2025473800; Email: icnfp@clark.net.

<H2><center>Joshua Bruce -- New GSC Latin America Program Coordinator</center></H2>







<body>







<BR> 







Global Service Corps is pleased to welcome Joshua Bruce as our new Latin America Program Coordinator.  



After completing a semester internship with GSC this past  December, Joshua returned to Humboldt State 



University (California) where he is completing his B.A. in Recreational Administration, with a concentration 



in community service. In January, Joshua visited the New Forests Project training center in Guatemala and 



met with the center coordinator, Leonel Jarquin.  During this time, initial planning took place for our new 



Guatemala project.  Joshua will be returning to Costa Rica to lead our June, August and December trips 



and will also lead the first Guatemala project trip in October.<p>







Joshua brings to his new position with Global Service Corps a wealth of experience in Latin America and 



outdoor education.  He spent his junior year in high school in Brazil where he became fluent in Portuguese 



and has since developed a proficiency in Spanish.  An avid outdoorsman, Joshua has lead a variety of 



outdoor training programs and is an experienced white water rafter.  He is also certified as an Emergency 



Medical Technician. Joshua is a fun-loving and well organized trip leader as well as a committed 



environmentalist and community servant.  He has already made a number of close friends in our host



communities in Costa Rica and Guatemala and they are looking forward to his return.  We are pleased to 



have him as part of the GSC team.<p>

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: Building with Woodless Lumber By David Lorenz and David C. Pettijohn</TITLE>

<H1>Building with Woodless Lumber</H1>
<H2>By David Lorenz and David C. Pettijohn</H2>

One hundred years ago, most fuels, construction materials, clothes, inks,
paints, fibers and chemicals were made from plant matter. By the 1980s, less
than five percent of industrial products and fuels came from biological
materials.<P>

Now industry may be moving away from the oil derrick and towards the silo for
its supplies. New technologies, new laws and an environmentally aware public
are ushering in a new materials base for the 21st century.<P>

Historically, the abundance of US forests encouraged the use of wood as the
only biological construction material. In coming years, however, wood will be
giving up this monopoly. An increasingly available supply of low-cost,
cellulose-based waste and advancing non-wood processing technologies have set
the stage for the rapid expansion of a new industry.<P>

The wood-products industry has spawned a new generation of materials composed
of waste cellulose made into composite materials. Waste-material fibers are
arranged in varying orientations while a heated press compacts the fibers into
a solid panel of composite board.<P>

In 1994, the wood-products industry used less than 110,000 tons of cellulosic
wastes. In 1996, however, the manufacture of "woodless lumber" products will
increase by 400 percent, and straw will account for two-thirds of the expanded
use. By the year 2000, there may be as many as 40 companies marketing 1.7
million tons of alternative construction materials, attracting $750 million
worth of investment capital and employing more than 3000 workers.<P>

This rapidly expanding industry will experience no lack of raw materials. The
US generates at least 160 million tons of waste cellulose each year. In theory,
simply using all available waste straw could replace as much as 80 percent of
US wood-based construction materials.

<H2>Panels From Waste</H2>

The vast majority of houses built in the US today use "stick" or "platform"
framing, consisting of 2"x4" lumber studs for the walls and roofs.<P>

One alternative building-system uses structural panels consisting of a core of
insulating material (typically  extruded foam or paper) sandwiched between wood
structural panels. The components are glued together to form a wall panel
four-to-eight-inches thick. On average, structural-panel systems use 25 percent
less wood in wall construction than normal stick-framing.<P>

Agriboard Industries of Fairfield, Iowa, began producing Oriented Strand Board
(OSB) panels in 1995. This year, Agriboard will manufacture 200,000 square feet
of structural panels (enough for approximately 500 average-sized homes),
utiliz-ing approximately 900 tons of straw per year. Within the next seven
years, the company plans to triple its production and estimates that OSB will
cost $2.69-$3.12 less per square foot than conventional stick-frame homes.<P>

Cereal grain straws also are being used for the production of particle board
and plywood substitutes. Isobord Industries in Toronto, Canada plans to open
several $50 million facilities, each capable of producing six million cubic
feet of industrial-grade particle board per year. Each plant will use
approximately 180,000 tons of wheat straw per year.<P>

Urban waste wood and construction debris are other underutilized material
sources for panel products, accounting for approximately 20 million tons of all
US municipal solid wastes. Evanite Fiber Corporation in Corvallis, Oregon,
makes a hardboard product for use as paneling and pegboard. Forty-eight percent
of the board is made from urban wood waste and 45 percent comes from scrap
pallets, shakes and utility spools. Only five percent of the final hardboard
fibers is derived from virgin wood. Approximately 1.5 million cubic feet of
hardboard product are produced per year by Evanite, using 40,500 tons of waste
wood fibers.<P>

Several firms use recycled paper to manufacture non-structural panel products.
Gridcore Systems International Corporation, in Long Beach, California, converts
waste corrugated cardboard and recycled newsprint or office papers into 
panels. Construction and demolition debris, rice hulls, kenaf, jute and bagasse
also have been used. Gridcore's new facility will produce approximately 6.3
million square feet of panels annually using about 3100 tons of waste fibers.<P>

The Homasote Company in West Trenton, New Jersey has manufactured panel
products from recycled paper for 90 years.   Homasote(R) board can be sawed,
drilled and fastened to other boards, while providing, on average, better sound
and thermal insulation with lighter weight than traditional wood.<P>

Phenix Biocomposites, Inc. in St. Peter, Minnesota, manufactures Environ(TM)
Biocomposite  from soy flour and recycled newsprint. With the working
properties of wood and the appearance of gra-nite, the product is twice as hard
as oak and provides three times better abrasion resistance. Phenix
Biocomposites currently is producing about 60,000 cubic feet of the product per
year, using 1600 tons of recycled news-print and 50,000 bushels (1100 tons) of
soybeans.

<H2>Local Savings; Local Profits</H2>

Communities that host these manufacturing plants can reap two economic
benefits: a reduction in waste disposal costs by as much as $100 million and an
increase in local economic activity of more than $250 million annually.<P>

Where the burning of agricultural straw is illegal, the cost of disposal can be
as high as $40 a ton for some farming communities. A 50,000 ton per year
manufacturing facility thus collectively could save farmers $2 million.<P>

Farmers who bale and haul the straw  would earn net profits of more than $22.50
per ton. Under this arrangement, a wheat farmer with an average-sized farm of
500 acres would net approximately $11,250 a year. A planned Isobord facility in
North Dakota is expected to generate approximately $6.3 million in additional
income for farmers through sale of wheat straw.<P>

Because these new manufacturing faci-lities tend to be modestly scaled (20,000
to 180,000 tons per year), they lend themselves to local or cooperative
ownership. This arrangement ensures that a large portion of the profits
generated will be retained and returned to the local economy.<P>

<H1>Is Zapatista Rebellion Rooted in Oil?</H1>
<H2>by John Ross</H2>

<I>See also </I><A HREF="s96-20.html#oil">Oil Protesters Attacked</A><I> by Sunita Chethik, Global Exchange</I><P>

Ocosingo -- The exact amount of oil and gas estimated to lie beneath Chiapas' Lacandon jungle is a
closely guarded secret, but it may be a key variable in the Mexican government's response to the
Zapatista uprising that rocked the region in January, 1994.<P>

The roots of the Zapatista rebellion are drenched in oil, observed Jesuit Father Mardonio Morales,
who has spent 30 years walking the canyons of the Lacan-don jungle in the state of Chiapas, the
Zapatista's base area.<P>

"Great interests are at play in the Lacandon -- the lives of the Indian communities and the
unrestricted control of natural resources..." wrote the 70-year-old priest, one of the key religious
workers in Bishop Samuel Ruiz's San Cristobal de las Casas diocese. Everywhere the white-bearded
Morales traveled, from the heart of the jungle to the highland mountains, he saw chapopote (crude
oil) oozing from the ground. The local Mayans continue using chapopote in native medicines.<P>

The Zapatista's enigmatic spokesperson, Subcommander Marcos, also discussed the role played by
oil in the region, saying that the Mexican government's counter-insurgency strategy in Chiapas was
tied to the strategic oil needs of the United States. According to Marcos, US President Bill Clinton's
financial bailout of Mexico came with a condition: "Here is the money, but I want the oil."<P>

Morales and Marcos are not the only ones who have noticed the Lacandon region's oil potential --
for two decades, the giant Mexican national oil company PEMEX has surveyed deposits and drilled
test holes throughout the vast jungle. US interests also studied the region in 1985-1986, but the
results remain secret.<P>

Marcos pinpointed the largest above-ground oil stratum in the world in Valle Amador, under the
Pichucalco ejido (collective farm) in the Lacandon jungle. "It's of a very high quality and very
inexpensive to exploit, because it is under your fingertips. You can practically smell the gas," said
Marcos.<P>

Morales speculated that the reason the Mexican government invited tens of thousands of farmers to
settle in the Lacandon in the 1960s and 1970s was not to raise crops but to provide cheap labor for
the cattle ranching industry and then for PEMEX and its subcontractors.<P>

"Wherever PEMEX waves its magic wand, a road appears," Morales marveled. The January 1, 1994, rebellion by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) temporarily
shut down oil exploration in the Lacandon -- 1400 workers and much equipment were hauled out of
the zone. Morales reported that oil exploration resumed in spring 1995, following the first round
of peace talks between the government and the rebels.<P>

PEMEX is tight-lipped about the Lacandon's oil potential. "We've tried unsuccessfully, for years,
just to get PEMEX to give us a list of wells in the jungle," said Ignacio March, director of the
Southeast Center for Research and Study, a San Cris-tobal environmental research institute.<P>

Mexico has 74 active oil fields -- most of which are offshore -- and has overtaken Venezuela as the
world's sixth-largest oil producer. Additional deposits are clustered in Veracruz and Tabasco, just
across the Chiapas state line.<P>

Three years ago, PEMEX representatives informed their US counterparts that a "large field" had
been discovered in the municipality of Ocosingo, in the Lacandon.<P>

The first recorded clash between the EZLN and the Mexican Army took place in Ocosingo's canyons on
May 21, 1993, just off the dirt road leading to the Nazareth 101-104 wells. The Nazareth wells
were not oil-rich, but they produced natural gas -- millions of cubic feet daily.<P>

"Mexico needs natural gas more than it needs oil right now," said California-based Mexican oil
consultant George Baker. Mexico is committed to natural gas conversion by 1998, and
infrastructure and investment depend on the development of new fields. "Ocosingo could be that new
field," hypothesized Baker.<P>

PEMEX also is interested in the region known as the Marques de Comillas along the Guatemalan
border. In the 1980s, the then-secretary of ecology sent civil engineer Ramon Ponciaga to the area
to troubleshoot environmental concerns. Ponciaga recalled that PEMEX met resistance from settlers
in the region, many of whom already had been radicalized by the Guerrilla Army of the Poor, a
Guatemalan insurgent organization present throughout the border region.<P>

Local settlers' groups blocked roads, kidnapped company officials and seized machinery when
PEMEX failed to pay indemnities and complete promised roads. Souring government-settler
relations led PEMEX to beat a strategic retreat from the region in 1989.<P>

"The petroleum beneath Marques is perfectly exploitable," said Ponciaga, "but the social problems
there make extraction impossible."<P>

After the Zapatista rebellion broke out, drilling sites became staging areas for military retaliation,
and some oil camps now are full-fledged garrisons.<P>

Whatever the extent of oil and natural gas deposits in the Lacandon, mused researcher Arturo
Lomeli, "it's clear that PEMEX is not going to be able to get at those deposits until the government
has signed a peace treaty with the EZLN."<P>

<H1>Oil Protesters Attacked</H1>
<H2>by Sunita Chethik, Global Exchange</H2>

Mexico -- For more than 20 years, Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company, has
plundered and polluted the Mexican environment. Some 125 Pemex spills were
recorded in 1995 alone. Pemex nets an estimated $2 million each day, but
villagers who have lost farms to oil fields still cannot get roads paved;
schools and health clinics remain impoverished. Traditional medicinal plants no
longer grow on lands scoured by acid rains. Fish no longer swim in polluted
streams and lakes. In some regions, production of corn, beans and coconuts has
fallen by as much as 60 percent. Skin rashes and respiratory diseases are
epidemic.<P>

On January 29, thousands of native Chontal Indians in the Mexican state of
Tabasco blocked roads leading to 60 oil wells and demanded an end to oil
expansion, as well as compensation to farmers for environmental and health
damages.<P>

On March 8, thousands of Mexican police and soldiers attacked a blockade in
Nacajuca, clubbing and teargassing more than 2000 nonviolent demonstrators
(mostly women), arresting more than a hundred and brutally beating movement
leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.<P>

"It is the poor who are defending the beauty of our planet," observed a member
of the Tabasco Human Rights Committee."

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: Japanese Timber Giant SLAPPs Canadian Natives By Joyce Nelson</TITLE>

<H1>Japanese Timber Giant SLAPPs Canadian Natives</H1>

<H2>By Joyce Nelson</H2>

Canada -- A recent Ontario court ruling has ominous implications for free
speech, native rights and economic justice all across Canada. On January 23,
1996, Ontario's Divisional Court released a decision in favor of Manitoba-based
Daishowa Inc. that prohibits Toronto-based Friends of the Lubicon [FoL, 485
Ridelle Ave., Toronto, ON, M6B 1K6, Canada; (416) 763-7500] from continuing its
campaign to promote secondary boycotts of Daishowa's customers.<P>

Timber giant Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co. Ltd., a Japanese multinational,
has obtained provincial timber rights to log most of the 10,000 square
kilometer (4000 square mile) territory in northwestern Alberta to which the
Lubicon Lake Indian Nation [3536 106 St., Edmonton, AB, T6J 1A4, Canada; (403)
436-5652] claims unextinguished aboriginal rights.<P>

The company turns trees into paper bags and other packaging materials to supply
Japan's inordinate appetite for pulp and paper products. Since 1991, FoL has
led Canadian and European boycott campaigns against Daishowa's packaging
products, effectively persuading some 30 major retail chains in Canada to
switch to other suppliers. But "Daishowa has many customers in the US," FoL
representative Kevin Thomas said, "including the <B>Washington Post</B>."<P>

The January ruling temporarily enjoins FoL from interfering with Daishowa's
business by "unlawful means, including picketing and threats of picketing aimed
at Daishowa's customers." FoL is appealing the ruling, which overturns a May
1995 decision by the Ontario Court's General Division that supported the
legality of FoL's secondary boycott activities. Meanwhile, Daishowa is seeking
an injunction that permanently prohibits FoL from organizing secondary boycotts
and is suing the volunteer group for more than $5 million in damages.<P>

Activists consider this case a classic SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public
Participation), a tactic increasingly used by powerful corporations to silence
grass-roots opposition. The purpose of a SLAPP is to intimidate citizen
activists, exhaust their limited resources and keep them from exercising their
democratic rights.<P>

Karen Wristen, a lawyer with the Vancouver-based Sierra Legal Defense Fund
representing the FoL, warned that Daishowa previously had asked that the
injunction apply not only to FoL, but also to any member of the public familiar
with the order. Thomas said, "At this stage, the case has the potential to take
away the boycott tool from everyone. The court is saying that if a boycott
causes harm to a company, it must be illegal."<P>

<H2>The Lubicon and the Land</H2>

For decades, the 500-member Lubicon Lake Indian Nation has struggled for a just
settlement of its land claim in northern Alberta. While no treaty entitling the
Lubicon to their land claim ever was negotiated, the tribe claims territory
located between the Peace River to the west, Wabasca River to the east,
Whitefish Lake to the south and Buffalo Head Hills to the north. Their
traditional territory has been exploited repeatedly, first by oil companies and
now by the forest industry.<P>

In February, 1988, the Alberta government announced that Daishowa would build
the Peace River mill -- the largest hardwood pulp mill in Canada -- west of the
Lubicon community, Little Buffalo Lake. The Lubicon were not informed about the
mill in advance.<P>

And according to Anne Champagne, a researcher for the Future Forests Alliance,
a Canadian forest-protection umbrella group, the Lubicon "were not told, nor
were they informed that the provincial government had sold the trees from their
entire territory." The Alberta and federal governments have given Daishowa more
than $74.7 million in subsidies for the project.<P>

In September, 1989, without any settlement of the Lubicon land claims, Daishowa
and the Alberta government signed a 20-year Forest Management Agreement (FMA)
giving the company a timber lease to 29,000 square kilometers (11,600 square
miles) northern Alberta.<P>

Daishowa agreed, in 1988, to wait for a settlement of Lubicon land claims
before logging. But once the FMA was signed, Champagne charged, the company
proceeded to "sub-contract the logging to smaller companies, which Daishowa
claimed were not bound to honor Dai-showa's no-cut agreement." A Daishowa
subsidiary began logging on Lubicon lands in Fall, 1990 and ceased in November,
1990.<P>

Lubicon protests against Daishowa commenced after its Peace River pulp mill
opened in 1990, and in 1991, FoL was formed. In 1992, Daishowa sold the mill to
Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd., a joint venture owned by Daishowa Paper
Mfg. Co. and Marubeni Corp., another Japanese forestry multinational.<P>

<H2>Divide and Conquer</H2>

On November 18, 1993, the new federal Minister of Indian Affairs, Ron Irwin,
publicly stated that a Lubicon land settlement was a federal priority.
According to Chief Bernard Orninayak, the strategy of the former Conservative
Party federal government was "to maintain the pretense of sincere negotiations
in order to deflect criticism and buy time until the Lubicon society
deteriorates to the point where the Lubicon people can no longer fight for our
rights." The Liberal Party government, elected in 1993, has continued this
tactic, while at the same time, corporate forces attempt to erode the Lubicon's
resolve.<P>

"The Lubicon believe that the company will begin cutting on their land during
the winter of 1996-97," Wristen says. Meanwhile, the lawsuit seeking a
permanent injunction and damages from FoL is scheduled for a court hearing on
April 29.<P>

Thomas explained, "Every year, the boycott has gotten bigger. Daishowa got
tired of waiting for us to go under, so now they're trying to wipe us out."
Thomas places the case in a larger context: "With the federal and provincial
governments in Canada getting out of the field of regulating corporate
activities, the only resort left is public pressure through things like
boycotts. If that tool is taken away, then what?"<P>

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: Nuclear Mayhem at Monju by Aileen Mioko Smith</TITLE>

<H1>Nuclear Mayhem at Monju</H1>

<H2>by Aileen Mioko Smith</H2>

<I>See also</I> <A HREF="s96-22a.html#breeder">Fast-Breeder Leak in Russia</A><P>

Japan -- A sodium leak and fire on the night of December 8, 1995, at Japan's
prototype fast-breeder reactor came as no surprise to Japanese citizens who had
been campaigning to prevent the $5.9 billion Monju reactor from operating. Every
prototype breeder reactor in the UK, Russia, France and Germany has been plagued
one way or another with sodium leaks and/or fires. It was bound to happen at
Monju.<P>

Fast-breeder reactors generate both electricity and plutonium: using "fast
neutrons," they actually produce (or "breed") more plutonium than they consume.
While water is used to cool conventional uranium-fueled reactors,
plutonium-fueled fast-breeders must be cooled with sodium.<P>

Monju's primary and secondary cooling systems are designed to carry 220 tons of
the reactor's total 1700 tons of sodium. Sodium reacts violently with air and
water -- the two most abundant substances on Earth -- and is extremely corrosive.
Fast breeders pump hundreds of tons of liquid sodium through pipes immersed in
water shielding the reactor core. These pipes are less than four millimeters
thick.<P>

If an accident occurs in a uranium-fueled reactor, the nuclear core  can suffer a
melt-down; a plutonium-fueled reactor will explode. What activists fear most is
that Monju will erupt, spewing tons of deadly plutonium into the environment.<P>

Of the world's ten known fast-breeder  accidents (in France, Russia and the UK),
the Monju accident in Fukui prefecture clearly was the worst. Former nuclear
engineer and Monju critic Jinzaburo Takagi stated that it was only a matter of
"luck" that there was not "a radioactive release or even an explosion of the
whole reactor."<P>

Using the Chernobyl accident as a guide, a 1994 Greenpeace report estimated that,
if 17 percent of Monju's fission products were released, fallout from the seaside
plant would spread well beyond Guam.<P>

Immediately following the accident, the Director General of the Science and
Technology Agency (STA), the agency in charge of Japan's plutonium program,
rushed to state that Japan's nuclear-power program -- including Monju-- would
continue.<P>

<H2>Storming Monju</H2>

Japan's Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC), a
government corporation that operates Monju, lied repeatedly to the public about
the accident. PNC made an unsuccessful attempt to suppress video footage that
showed the cause of the accident: a ruptured pipe in a secondary cooling system
that spilled an estimated 2-3 tons of sodium -- the largest leak in the history
of fast-breeder technology. One of the reasons PNC gave for releasing the
misinformation was that Monju is too important to Japan's energy program to
jeopardize the reactor's operation. Following revelations that the agency itself
had been involved in trying to withhold the video, one PNC official committed
suicide.<P>

Had it not been for a courageous act by a group of Fukui prefectural officials in
the early morning  of December 11, PNC's attempted cover-up probably would have
succeeded and no one ever would have learned the extent of the accident.<P>

In a daring invasion, the officials managed to place themselves inside the
reactor. This desperate action came as the result of a bitter experience at
Fukui's  Tsuruga Unit I reactor in the early 1980s. When Tsuruga Unit I leaked
radiation, Fukui prefectural officials went to the gates of the plant, but were
ordered to leave. They were told that they could be prosecuted for obstructing
the execution of government affairs.<P>

Fukui prefectural officials laid their lives on the line when they made their way
into Monju that night, but once they were inside and reported what they saw to
the world, it was too late -- the national government could no longer put
pressure on them.<P>

<H2>Monju Dangers</H2>

Monju (named by its builders after the Buddhist bodhisattva of wisdom) is located
in Fukui Prefecture on the tip of the Tsuruga Peninsula, facing the Japan Sea.
Fukui is neck-deep in nuclear power, with 15 plants, including Monju -- the
highest concentration in the world. Nuclear power generates a third of Japan's
electricity, and the government has announced plans to produce 42 percent of its
power from reactors by 2010. But many Fukui residents want to break the nuclear
habit. In 1995, more than 220,000 residents signed a petition asking that no
additional reactors operate in Fukui.<P>

Monju was built by the PNC, the same government agency that created an
international scandal in 1994 when it issued an 11-minute pro-nuclear cartoon
featuring "Mr. Pluto." (In this video, a small boy drinks a plutonium-laced glass
of water and merrily visits a toilet, while a flushing sound and a logo announce:
"Feels Great! All Fresh!")<P>

Plutonium is so deadly that it can cause lung cancer in microgram quantities. One
gram of plutonium, evenly distributed, could create hundreds of thousands of
cancer victims. Only a few millimeters of space separate the reactor's fuel rods,
which are inserted between the control rods that slow the nuclear reaction. When
fuel rods overheat, they can bend and stick. If the control rods cannot be
inserted properly, Monju could explode.<P>

Monju uses 1700 tons of sodium and operates at 500 degrees centigrade -- much
hotter than conventional reactors. The reactor, which is particularly vulnerable
to earthquakes, is located 700 meters (2300 feet) from an active earthquake
fault. Damage to highways and structures during the Hanshin earthquake of 1995,
which devastated the city of Kobe, was "never supposed to happen." Earthquake
experts are now pointing to the Tsuruga region in Fukui as the most likely place
for Japan's next major quake.<P>

Both PNC and the STA insist that the reactor will be able to withstand
earthquakes and will never have an explosive accident, but they have refused
repeated requests to support their claim with documentation. PNC and STA also
maintained that there would be no sodium leaks at Monju.<P>

<H2>Heads in the Sand</H2>

At a January 20, 1996, public meeting between PNC, STA and local citizens, it
became apparent that PNC's emergency plans for a reactor accident at Monju were
shockingly inadequate. Monju is the only nuclear plant in Japan that required its
staff to seek approval for emergency shutdowns from its main office in Tokyo.
(PNC has vowed to change its emergency procedures, but has not yet done so.) But
when frantic plant operators telephoned for permission, no one answered the
phone. The technicians kept running the plant,  knowing that it was leaking
volatile sodium. Because of this delay, the shutdown did not take place until
nearly five hours later.<P>

According to Monju's operating manual, reactor operators are supposed to make
their emergency shutdown decisions by reading a sodium-level indicator that
should show leakage. But the indicator's margin of error turns out to be 7.5
tons. During the December accident, the operators saw "no change" in the level of
sodium.<P>

One of the plant design's most important safety precautions is preventing sodium
from contacting air. But Monju's construction is not air-tight. The plant's
safety manual says nothing about shutting off ventilation ducts in the event of a
sodium leak. In the December accident, continued ventilation fueled the fire and
spread fumes thousands of square yards, penetrating six levels of the plant. At
one point, operators actually walked into the room to see what was happening,
letting in more air.<P>

Monju's fire-fighters lacked training and tools to battle sodium fires. There was
virtually no protective gear and only small, conventional extinguishers. But
better tools would have made no difference: the fire-fighters only work during
the day and the accident occurred at night.<P>

And PNC still refuses to call the accident a "fire." Borrowing from US
nuclear-industry terminology, Japan's official government language for this type
of accident is "jisho," which means an "incident." When PNC officials tied to
characterize the event as a jisho, however, they were shouted down by enraged
local officials.<P>

<H2>More Blunders</H2>

The list of design blunders goes on. The exhaust duct is next to the intake duct.
This design sucked escaping fumes from the sodium reaction right back into the
building and further spread the damage.<P>

The only way to stop a reactor cooling pipe from leaking is to drain all the
sodium out of it. But Monju's drainage tank, which is supposed to receive the
super-hot sodium, is not designed to withstand high temperatures. Consequently,
the operators had to wait until the sodium cooled off. In the meantime, they had
no recourse but to let the pipe keep leaking.<P>

There is a steel lining on the floor of the secondary cooling system designed to
prevent leaking sodium from reaching the concrete floor below. Direct contact
with the cement could trigger a hydrogen explosion, and Monju's sodium fire
damaged this steel lining, leaving it rippled and discolored. One portion
actually melted. According to Monju's licensing safety review, this is not
supposed to happen. It is evident that PNC's analyses (approved by STA) simply
underestimated how hot sodium can get.<P>

The Monju licensing safety review claims that the plant can manage a
150-cubic-meter (approximately 150-ton) sodium leak. According to this scenario,
the sodium would fall immediately to the floor (with minimum splattering),
quickly to be whisked away into a sump -- thus causing minimum contact with air.
But does such a scenario reflect reality?<P>

At Monju, an air duct opened directly beneath the leaking pipe. Sodium hit this
duct, then a floor grating below, and splattered, which magnified its surface
area exposed to the air and accelerated combustion.<P>

When citizens asked for video footage of PNC experiments on sodium leaks and
fires conducted at its Oarai research facility, PNC produced clips only of leaks
that fell straight down. PNC said that it "could not find" the video of the
splatter tests.<P>

In the wake of PNC's various embarrassing videotape snafus, the STA has taken
advantage of the government agency's loss of credibility and its inability to
prevent the accident to take nearly total control of the Monju investigation. But
STA is the agency that approved PNC's licensing safety review on Monju. The
investigative situation has become a case of the fox guarding the chicken coop.
The national government needs to establish a truly independent commission with
foreign expertise to examine the accident.<P>

The December accident was not simply the result of a failed sodium temperature
indicator gauge. It was a failure of Japan's entire plutonium program -- with
Monju as its centerpiece -- which is designed to operate with no independent
oversight. Monju is blatantly unsafe, yet the program goes forward with the STA
acting as both promoter and regulator. Japan's Nuclear Safety Commission is
skeletal, lacks enforcement power and is made up of members of the "nuclear
club."<P>

<H2>Flying Blind</H2>

Monju is like an experimental airplane piloted by the PNC, except it does not
"answer the phone" -- the aircraft is on automatic pilot. The hapless passengers
include every man, woman and child in the Fukui region, downwinders, such as the
people of Shiga, Nagano, Fukushima, and Tokyo, and all of Lake Biwa -- the source
of drinking water for eight million people. Unlike a passenger jet, however,
Monju's design does not include a life raft.<P>

The battle to close Monju has just begun. The issue pits the national
government's power against the desire for safety and independent decision-making
in the Kan-sai region -- including greater nuclear enforcement powers, increased
financial autonomy and the public's right to know.<P>

In the future, will the media really inform the public about important nuclear
issues (such as the fact that Japan's fast-breeder reactors will not generate
even one percent of Japan's energy by the year 2050, even if the program goes
forward as scheduled)? Will the Japanese parliament finally act on this issue, or
will the bureaucracy continue to run the show in cooperation with the nuclear
lobby? The answer depends on how much the public gets involved.<P>

<H1>Fast-Breeder Leak in Russia</H1>

Russia (Via EcoNet) -- On January 31, 1996, approximately one ton of radioactive
steam escaped from an experimental plutonium fast-breeder reactor in
Dimitrovgrad's Scientific Research Institute near Kiev.<P>

The release occurred when a construction crane struck critical safety equipment.
On February 1, plant officials told the Socio-Ecological Union, a Russian
eco-group, that although the radioactive level was three-to-four times normal,
"there were no victims." That same morning, Echo Moskvy broadcast a report that
radioactivity near NIIAR was about 20 times normal. The accident left nearly 200
square meters (240 square yards) poisoned with radioactive cobalt, iodine and
manganese.<P>

Contaminated snow was collected for disposal as liquid waste. Greenpeace Moscow
reported that "the Dimitrovgrad facility is known for its disposal of liquid
radioactive waste by pumping it directly into the environment."<P>

<H1>Chernobyl Remembered</H1>

<I>See also</I> <A HREF="s96-24a.html#Campaign">A Campaign for Nuclear Abolition</A>.<P>

Ukraine -- In September, 1994, a leaked UN report observed: "The name
'Chernobyl' has... become synonymous with our fear of a technological
catastrophe. Almost 400,000 people have been forced to leave their homes as a
result of the nuclear power plant explosion of April 26, 1986.<P>

"It is estimated that at least nine million people were directly and indirectly
affected by the Chernobyl disaster. An area the size of England, Wales and
Northern Ireland combined -- over 160,000 square kilometers (64,000 square miles)
-- is estimated to have been contaminated...."<P>

Seventy percent of the fallout came down in Belarus, the country most exposed to
Chernobyl's radioactive hazards.<P>

Cesium and strontium have poisoned 60,000 square-miles in Ukraine, turning a
Rhode Island-sized area into an officially designated "Zone of Alienation."<P>

The <B>Los Angeles Times</B> reports that "The zone has become a wildlife refuge." In
the absence of humans, the number of boars has increased 800 percent, while the
moose population doubled. In the decade since the accident, eagles, cranes,
wolves, otters and endangered black storks have returned and appear to be
thriving.<P>

According to the <B>Times</B>, the proliferation of wildlife has lead scientists to the
remarkable conclusion that "the benefits of a human-free environment can outweigh
even the biological costs of radiation."<P>

In the long haul, the prognosis may not be so rosy. After a five-year study in
which minks were fed "relatively small doses" of radioactive contaminated meat,
biologist Victor Riasenko found that the animals lost their fur in the first
year. Fewer animals survived with each succeeding generation and, by the fourth
generation, none of the newborn minks survived.<P>

In April, people around the world will mark the anniversary of the Chernobyl
explosion with marches and support drives for the victims. Major actions are
planned in The Netherlands, Belgium and the UK.<P>

Over April 12-26, the Union Salvation of Chernobyl and for Mother Earth

@motherearth.kooppunt.be</A>] will walk from Kiev to Chernobyl, crossing through the
contaminated landscape. Radiation levels in the abandoned villages around
Chernobyl are still "at least 10 times higher than the officially allowed
level," reports Krista van Zelzen, who visited the area in 1995. Van Zelzen
recalls a landscape of "deserted and decayed houses, plants running wild, a
single village lunatic who refuses to accept that these lands cannot be lived
on...."<P>

The US Green party, Greenpeace and the Nuclear Information and Resource Service

"We have the technical means to create a nuclear weapons-free world in about a
decade," Joseph Rotblat said on accepting the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize. Reminding
his listeners that "the very first resolution of the General Assembly of the UN
-- adopted unanimously -- called for the elimination of nuclear weapons," Rotblat
noted that "the Cold War is over, but Cold War thinking survives" among the
nuclear superpowers.<P>

"Abolition 2000," a global grassroots campaign within the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty negotiations, is committed to abolishing nuclear weapons
"within a time-bound framework of 10 to 20 years."<P>

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: World Court Debates Nuclear War by John Burroughs and Jacqueline Cabasso</TITLE>

<H1>World Court Debates Nuclear War</H1>
<H2>by John Burroughs and Jacqueline Cabasso</H2>

The Netherlands -- Last November's historic World Court hearings on the legality
of nuclear weapons opened some cracks in the nuclear bloc (US, UK, France, Russia
and China). In two and a half weeks of extraordinary arguments, US allies
Australia and Japan sided with the world's non-nuclear states in making the
anti-nuclear case.<P>

The hearing before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague came in
response to requests from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN General
Assembly for a non-binding advisory opinion on whether or not the threat or use
of nuclear weapons is permissible in any circumstance. Some 45 states made oral
or written arguments to the court. While the proceedings were front-page news in
Japan, Australia and the South Pacific, European coverage was marginal. A virtual
press blackout was maintained in France and the US.<P>

The ICJ (popularly known as the World Court) is the judicial branch of the UN and
the world's most authoritative court on questions of international law.<P>

Non-nuclear countries (Australia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia,
Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Qatar, Samoa, Zimbabwe, the Marshall
Islands, the Solomon Islands, and San Marino) argued that atomic weapons are
instruments of mass destruction -- like treaty-banned chemical and biological
weapons -- whose effects are indiscriminate, uncontrollable and, therefore,
illegal. The nuclear states countered that no treaty expressly prohibits nuclear
weapons. Whether the use of nuclear weapons is permissible, they claimed, depends
on the circumstances and cannot be prejudged.<P>

Citing the law of war codified in the Hague and Geneva Conventions, international
environmental law and codes of human rights, non-nuclear countries argued that
protection of civilians, the environment and succeeding generations from the
effects of warfare rules out any use of nuclear weapons -- whether offensive or
defensive. They noted that radiation's dead-ly effects transcend both space and
time.<P>

"Any use of a nuclear weapon," said Solomon Islands representative Philippe
Sands, would violate a general duty under environmental law to protect
"freshwater resources, the marine environment, biodiversity, the climate system
[and] the ozone layer."<P>

Australia's strong stand, made on the opening day of the hearings, was especially
surprising, coming as it did from a US strategic ally. Australian Foreign Affairs
Minister Gareth Evans declared that it is "illegal not only to use or threaten
use of nuclear weapons, but to acquire, develop, test or possess them."
Therefore, he said, nuclear states "must, within a reasonable time frame, take
systematic action to eliminate completely all nuclear weapons."<P>

Japan took a somewhat ambivalent stance, with Ambassador Takekazu Kawa-mura
asserting that "the use of nuclear weapons is clearly contrary to the spirit of
humanity that gives international law its philosophical foundation." As the
Associated Press reported, Kawamura "fell short of stating whether his government
considers nuclear arms to be illegal, apparently fearful of angering Washington."<P>

Ignoring pressure from Tokyo, the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki traveled to
the Netherlands to present emotional appeals for the abolition of nuclear
weapons.<P>

Despite historical evidence to the contrary, US Defense Department attorney John
McNeill argued that nuclear weapons can, in fact, be used with discrimi-nation.
McNeill told the court that "[n]uclear weapons... can be targeted in ways that
either increase or decrease resulting incidental civilian injury and collateral
damage; and their use may be lawful or not depending upon [the enemy's] conduct."<P>

Zimbabwe's representative, Jonathan Wutawunashe, countered that the Geneva
Conventions prohibit attacks that cause extensive civilian casualties <B>regardless</B>
of the justification.<P>

Non-nuclear countries also maintained that, while there is no treaty explicitly
banning the use of nuclear weapons, a "customary" prohibition akin to a common
law standard has emerged based upon scores of General Assembly resolutions over
three decades, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), regional nuclear-free
zones, and a 50-year practice of non-use in war since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. New
Zealand's Attorney General Paul East told the court that the NPT has
"delegitimized" nuclear weapons by forbidding most states from their acquisition
and committing the nuclear states to their elimination.<P>

For the US, McNeill responded that "the policy of nuclear deterrence has saved
many millions of lives from the scourge of war during the past 50 years. In this
special sense, nuclear weapons have been 'used,' defensively, every day for over
half a century -- to preserve the peace."<P>

Costa Rica's representative, Carlos Vargas Pizarro, replied, "We consider that it
is as difficult to establish that deterrence has kept the peace -- or, for that
matter, has not kept the peace -- as it is to prove that ghosts exist, or do not
exist.... Nor can there be any guarantee that nuclear war will not occur in the
future."<P>

Malaysia's UN representative, Tan Sri Razali Ismail, spoke for many of the
world's non-nuclear states when he declared: "Five countries cannot arrogate to
themselves forever the exclusive privilege of having their fingers on the nuclear
trigger.... If the laws of humanity and the dictates of the public conscience
demand the prohibition of such weapons, the five nuclear-weapons states, however
powerful, cannot stand against them."<P>

Placed on the defensive by an onslaught of powerful arguments backed by decades
of condemnation of nuclear weapons, the nuclear states implored the court to
decline to answer the question of legality. The non-nuclear countries argued just
as strongly that it is the court's duty as the UN's judicial branch to respond to
the General Assembly and the WHO.<P>

Despite their proclaimed impartiality, World Court judges generally reflect the
interests of their countries. By custom, the judges include representatives from
the five permanent members of the Security Council (US, UK, Russia, France,
China).<P>

In rendering a decision, the court will, in effect, be choosing between a General
Assembly majority that has long condemned nuclear weapons and the Security
Council, which (controlled by the five nuclear-armed superpowers) has the real
decision-making power in the UN. The decision is expected in May.<P>

<HR>

John Burroughs, attorney for the Western States Legal Foundation (WSLF) in
Oakland, California, and Jacqueline Cabasso, WSLF executive director, were in The
Hague with the World Court Project, co-founded by the International Association
of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms, International Physicians for the Prevention of
Nuclear War and the In-ternational Peace Bureau. A longer report on the hearing
appears in the March/April issue of <B>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</B>.

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: Echoes From Hiroshima by Mayor Takashi Kiraoka</TITLE>

<H1>Echoes From Hiroshima</H1>
<H2>by Mayor Takashi Kiraoka</H2>

The Hague (November 7, 1995) -- Mr.  President  and Honorable  Members of the
Court, I am Takashi Hiraoka, Mayor of Hiroshima City. I am here today,
representing Hiroshima citizens who desire the abolition of nuclear weapons. More
particularly, I represent the hundreds of thousands of victims whose lives were
cut short and the survivors who are still suffering the effects of radiation, 50
years later.<P>

The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki shattered all war precedent.
The mind-numbing damage these nuclear weapons wrought shook the foundations of
human existence. Their enormous destructive power reduced utterly innocent
civilian populations to ashes. Women, the elderly and the newly born were bathed
in deadly radiation and slaughtered.<P>

History is written by the victors. Thus, the heinous massacre that was Hiroshima
has been handed down to us as a perfectly justified act of war. As a result, for
50 years we have never directly confronted the full implications of this
horrifying act for the future of the human race.<P>

I am not here in this court, however, to debate responsibility for the dropping
of the atomic bombs. Japan also committed shameful acts during World War II. I
would like to convey to the people of the world what kind of damage befell
Hiroshima and to appeal for the abolition of nuclear weapons so that this tragedy
is never repeated.<P>

<H2>Death: Instant and Indiscriminate</H2>

At 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, the atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima exploded
580 meters [1914 feet] above the heart of the city. Beneath the atomic bomb's
monstrous mushroom cloud, human skin was burned raw. Crying for water, human
beings died in desperate agony.<P>

The bomb used a single kilogram of uranium 235 to produce energy equivalent to 15
kilotons of TNT. The force of the atomic bomb was the equivalent of... an
instantaneous attack by more than 3000 B29s -- the world's largest bombers in
1945.<P>

An intense flash of light flooded the city center. With the roar that followed,
enormous pillars of flame burst toward the skies. A majority of buildings
crumbled, and many people died.<P>

The unique characteristic of the atomic bombing was its instantaneous and
universal destruction. Old, young, male, female, soldier, civilian -- the killing
was utterly indiscriminate.<P>

On that day, there were approximately 350,000 people in Hiroshima. The city
government presently estimates that some 140,000 had died by the end of December
1945. Entire families were wiped out. The local community was in disarray.
Records were lost to fire. Thus, even today, we have no truly accurate casualty
figures.<P>

I was away when Hiroshima was bombed, so I was spared the atomic bombing itself.
But my most-beloved relatives and many acquaintances were killed. A cousin, a
first-year student at a girls' school, was 800 meters [2640 feet] from the
hypocenter. She died that night.<P>

Those who survived will never escape the psychological and physical effects of
the bombing. Many records, such as diaries, pictures, photos and movies, depict
the damage done to Hiroshima. But those who were there [and survived] universally
emphasize that no depiction comes close to the actual experience. The bomb
reduced Hiroshima to an inhuman state utterly beyond human ability to express or
imagine. I feel frustrated at not being able to express this completely in my
testimony.<P>

I worked for a time on a newspaper in Hiroshima, and I will never forget the
badly scarred face and hands of one of the women who worked with me. She had lost
her husband to the bomb. She was 33 years old at the time of the bombing and was
l700 meters [5610 feet] from the hypocenter. In 1950, she described her
experience in detail.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Somewhere a voice shouted, 'Hey, there's a parachute. A parachute is coming
down!' Without thinking, I looked in the direction indicated by the voice. At
that instant -- flash. The sky in the direction I was looking was pure light. I
don't know how to describe that light, like a fire burning in my eyes. It was
like the eerie bluish-purple sparks that electric street cars make at night, only
trillions of times brighter. But that isn't exactly right either. The light was
followed by a roar that reverberated to the bottom of my belly, and I was
instantly slammed hard against the ground. When I opened my eyes, I saw nothing
but darkness.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

I noticed a terrible stench in the air. Without thinking, I took the towel that
was tucked into my belt and firmly wiped my nose and mouth. That was when I
realized for the first time that there was something wrong with my face. The skin
that I wiped just peeled, slipped right off. I was shocked.<P>

The skin on my right hand slipped off from the second joint of my fingers and
just dangled sickeningly from the tips of my fingers.<P>

She fled in a dream-like state and made it to a relief station in the suburbs.
Summer turned to autumn, and still the flesh of her wounds continued to melt
away. The wounds were the color of a crushed, ripe tomato. No new skin would
form. She died 16 years ago.<P>

<H2>Inhumane Nuclear Weapons</H2>

Today, 50 years after peace was regained, people continue to suffer the effects
of radiation.<P>

At the United Nations General Assembly in 1961, resolution 1653(XVI) was adopted.
The resolution states that:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The use of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons would exceed even the scope of war
and cause indiscriminate suffering and destruction to mankind and civilization
and, as such, is contrary to the rules of international law and to the laws of
humanity.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

It is clear that the use of nuclear weapons, which cause indiscriminate mass
murder and leave survivors to suffer for decades, is a violation of international
law. In addition, the development, possession and testing of nuclear weapons is a
violation of international law.  As long as nuclear weapons exist, the human race
faces a real and present danger of self-extermination.<P>

The issue of nuclear weapons should not be a matter of political relationships
among nations. The fate of the human race is in your hands.<P>

The Hague (November 14, 1995) -- I hope that the court will understand that I
cannot be unemotional about the facts of my experience with nuclear weapons. My
name is Lijon Eknilang. I was born on Rongelap Atoll in the Marshall Islands, and
I lived there at the time of the nuclear weapons testing program conducted by the
Administrating Authority for the United Nations during the period of the Pacific
Island Territories Trusteeship [post-WW II to 1986].<P>

On the morning of March 1, 1951, the day of the "Bravo" shot, there was a huge,
brilliant light that consumed the sky. We all ran outside our homes to see it.
The elders said another world war had begun. I remember crying.<P>

Not long after the light from Bravo, it began to snow in Rongelap. We had heard
about snow from the missionaries and other Westerners who had come to our
islands, but this was the first time we saw white particles fall from the sky and
cover our village.<P>

Of course, in 1951, Marshallese children and their parents did not know that the
snow was radioactive fallout. My own health has suffered very much as a result of
radiation poisoning. I cannot have children. I have had miscarriages on seven
occasions. On one of those occasions, the child I miscarried was severely
deformed -- it had only one eye. I have also had thyroid surgery to remove
nodules. I have lumps in my breasts.<P>

Marshallese women suffer silently and differently from the men who were exposed
to radiation. Our culture and religion teaches us that reproductive abnormalities
are a sign that women have been unfaithful. For this reason, many of my friends
keep quiet about the strange births they have had. In privacy, they give birth,
not to children as we like to think of them, but to things we could only describe
as "octopuses," "apples," "turtles" and other things in our experience. We do not
have Marshallese words for these kinds of babies, because they were never born
before the radiation came.<P>

Women on Rongelap, Likiep, Ailuk and other atolls in the Marshall Islands have
given birth to these "monster  babies." Many of  these  women are from atolls
that foreign officials have told us were not affected by radiation. We know
otherwise, because the health problems are similar to ours. One woman on Likiep
gave birth to a child with two heads. Her cat also gave birth to a kitten with
two heads. There is a young girl on Ailuk today with no knees, three toes on each
foot and a missing arm.<P>

The most common birth defects on Rongelap and nearby islands have been
"jellyfish" babies. These babies are born with no bones in their bodies and with
transparent skin. We can see their brains and hearts beating. The babies usually
live for a day or two before they stop breathing. Many women die from abnormal
pregnancies, and those who survive give birth to what looks like purple grapes
that we quickly bury.<P>

My purpose for traveling such a great distance to appear before the World Court
is to plead with you to do what you can not to allow the suffering that we
Marshallese have experienced to be repeated in any other community in the world.
I know first-hand what the devastating effects of nuclear weapons are over time
and over long distances, and what those effects mean to innocent human beings
over several generations.<P>

The story of the Marshallese people since the nuclear weapons tests has been sad
and painful. Allow our experience, now, to save others from such sadness and
pain. I ask the court to consider the experience of the Marshallese and to give
the people of our world what security you can for their health and for the safety
of the environment upon which their survival depends.<P>

<A NAME="Holocaust"><H1>A Holocaust of Christians</H1>

On August 9, 1945, the American bomber carrying an atomic bomb abandoned the
primary target of Kokura (present-day Kitakyushu City) because of poor visibility
and flew to the secondary target, Nagasaki. Nagasaki was also covered by clouds,
but the airplane was running short on fuel. When the bombardier caught a glimpse
of the Urakami area through a crack in the clouds, he hastily released the atomic
bomb.<P>

The Urakami district was home to a large Christian population that had kept the
light of faith alive during the long period of persecution from the 17th to 19th
centuries. The atomic bomb laid the neighborhood to waste and instantly killed
8,500 of the 12,000 Christians living there.<P>

-- Iccho Itoh, Mayor of Nagasaki.

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: It Takes a Village: West Africa Hosts Ecocity III</TITLE>

<H1>West Africa Hosts Ecocity III</H1>
<H2>by Richard Register</H2>

Senegal -- Two of the most crucial issues of humanity's built habitat -- the
sustain-ability of urbanization and the form of cities -- are unlikely to be
adequately addressed at Habitat II (the UN Conference on Human Settlements set
for Istanbul this summer) but these crucial topics were a major concern at the
Third International Ecocity Conference in West Africa. Habitat II can learn from
"Ecocity III."<P>

EcoCity III  (previous conferences were held in Berkeley, California and
Ade-laide, Australia) took place January 8-12, in the small, traditional
Senegalese village of Yoff on the outskirts of Dakar. The event was co-convened
by Eco-Village at Ithaca, New York, and the Association for the Economic,
Cultural and Social Promotion of Yoff.<P>

Conceived as a meeting of urban and rural peoples, as well as a gathering of
different races, religions, nationalities, languages, levels of wealth and
lifestyles, Ecocity III became a forum both for examining flaws in the
"overdeveloped world" and exchanging the best ideas from mainstream urban
civilization and the traditional village -- in this case, the African, Moslem,
French- and Wolof-speaking town of Yoff.<P>

The spectacular cross-cultural experience of Ecocity III refuted the argument
that urban ecological concerns are only of interest to members of the white
middle-class. Moving beyond progress reports, the conference raised some
compelling questions, some of them aimed directly at Habitat II.<P>

Habitat II's "Action Plan" calls upon the  world to "respond adequately to rapid
urbanization." But is world urbanization really the positive and inevitable thing
that Habitat II organizers celebrate -- to the extent of calling their conference
on "settlements" the "City Summit"? Might it not be healthier to learn something
from rural villages that remain in better balance with nature than cities?<P>

Ecocity III concluded that "rapid urbanization itself may be a disastrous mistake
requiring immediate reassessment and reversal."<P>

"Human beings are at the center of concerns for sustainable development," says
the draft Action Plan of Habitat II. "Yet," counters the Ecocity III declaration,
"human society is wholly dependent upon the health of natural living systems of
our biosphere." Instead of facilitating urbanization, ecocity advocates would
promote the revitalization of villages and small cities, along with restoration
of local agriculture and bioregions.<P>

The concept of a city's  <B>form</B> barely enters into preparations for Habitat II. But
Ecocity III identified the form of modern cities -- sprawl-driven,
automobile-dependent, highway-dominated, oil-addicted -- as one of society's
greatest ecological and human disasters.<P>

It is not just that cities are in bad shape. They are the wrong shape -- flat.
Their very form gobbles land, demands oceans of oil, alters the Earth's
atmosphere, disrupts its climate and exacts the bloody sacrifice of a quarter
million human lives a year on streets and highways.<P>

Instead of relying on a vision of high-powered transportation links struggling to
hold the pieces together, EcoCity III challenges people to build something
fundamentally different. EcoCity III advocates the development of "ecovillages"
and "ecocities" -- compact, primarily pedestrian, communities that closely mix
living, working and social spaces.<P>

<H2>A 500-Year-Old Democracy</H2>

Three hundred Ecocity III delegates from 30 countries -- representing every
inhabited continent -- attended the conference in Yoff, a traditional farming and
fishing village ruled by a democracy of elders. The peaceful village, which has
existed undisturbed for 500 years, employs no police. But urban sprawl now
reaches out from Dakar and threatens the town, as the city closes in from all
sides.<P>

Yoff's population is approaching 40,000, having doubled over the past 20 years.  
     Meanwhile, village farmland is shrinking, sanitation is declining and
beaches and coastal buildings are washing into the sea. While new housing is
needed, the villagers recognize the threats to their culture and environment
posed by most urban models of growth. Yoff joined with EcoVillage at Ithaca in a
bold bid to discover and build a better way of living.<P>

Using homestay arrangements for conference attendees, villagers welcomed 150
delegates into their small, many-roomed homes surrounding private courtyards.
Typically, a husband, two wives, several brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts,
uncles, many children and a few grandparents greeted guests several times a day.<P>

Sitting in a family circle, shoeless on the straw-matted floor, guests ate rice,
millet, vegetables and chili-seasoned fish from a common bowl. Instead of flush
toilets, guests used the traditional hole-in-the-floor.<P>

Although 40 percent of the village is "unemployed," i.e., without salaried  jobs,
everyone is welcome around the dinner plate. In Yoff, one experiences almost no
social insecurity.<P>

<H2>The Conference Begins</H2>

In the morning, buses rented by the Mayor of Dakar rushed Ecocity III
participants four miles to the high-tech conference center. As co-convener Joan
Bokaer, from EcoVillage at Ithaca, settled into one of the huge auditorium's
plush seats -- each equipped with six channels of simultaneous translation -- she
admitted that she was "shocked, overwhelmed by the contrast" between the opulent
center and the traditional village.<P>

Mayor Mamadou Diop of Dakar and Abdoulaye Bathily, Senegal's Minister of
Environment and the Protection of Nature, presided over the opening ceremonies.<P>

A thousand people gathered in the audience, including hundreds of African
villagers, and listened to the panel discuss the state of the Earth's natural,
social, economic and urban environments.<P>

Large blocks of the audience  would stand suddenly, singing and swaying in
response to a comment from the stage, then sit back down. Later a drum would
sound, and another section of the audience would rise and sing.<P>

"Are conferences always like this in Africa?" a conference-goer asked one of the
hosts. "Never," the man said. "Ninety percent of these people have never been at
a conference center before. Nobody ever asked them their opinion. It's the first
time they were invited."<P>

The six-day conference included more than 60 featured talks (in English, French
and Wolof) and slide presentations demonstrating steady ecocity progress in
countries ranging from Malaysia and Australia to Brazil and the US, from Sweden
and Russia to Mali and South Africa.<P>

Tukumbi Lumumba-Kasongo of Zaire, nephew of Patrice Lumumba, sketched the
political and economic context of the conference on a continent attempting to
emerge from 500 years of slavery, colonialism and exploitation, which owes its
creditors (largely the former colonial powers) the equivalent of 30-to-40 years
of work for every person in many countries of Sub-saharan Africa. It is hard to
meet such a system on its own terms, which is why many conferees advocated
learning from villages that live in balance with nature, while moving forward to
renewable technologies.<P>

Amalia Cordova, curator for the Museum of Pre-Columbian Art in Santiago, Chile,
described Caspana, a village that existed for hundreds of years before the
Spanish arrived, and survives today with its traditions, architecture and water
distribution canals still intact. The town is an oasis of green in the vast
barrens of the Atacama Desert.<P>

Representing Curitiba, Brazil (perhaps the world's closest approximation of an
ecocity), was Cleon Ricardo dos Santos, director of the Open University for the
Environment. Dos Santos described how the city's new "double articulated"
bus-trains are attaining transit efficiencies comparable to conventional subway
systems at a small percentage of the cost.<P>

Jeff Kenworthy from Perth, Australia discussed new urban rail lines, "transit
villages" and progress in mixed-use urban development patterns in Vancouver,
Canada and Frieberg, Germany.<P>

US EPA representative Harriet Hill reported that "constructed wetlands"
(artificial marshes for cleansing wastewater) are working well at many sites.<P>

Anders Nyquist discussed the extraordinarily energy-efficient buildings of the
village he founded in northern Sweden. Nyquist's "eco-cycle" architecture and
technology emphasize nearly complete recycling. Farmers buy urine, collected from
Nyquist's "separating toilets," for quality fertilizer, while feces are composted
in worm boxes.<P>

Lee Boon-Thong reported on the exodus from Sarawak's forest villages after
logging and economic interests lured inhabitants to the cities. While cultural
and ecological changes are overwhelming and perhaps inevitable, he argued,
villages could adapt some outside practices to fit their own customs and natural
environments, while halting, or perhaps reversing, the out-migration.<P>

Lim Poh Imm, a Malaysian city planner, proposed the creation of an ecocity
network to exchange ideas and enrich the diversity of economic activities,
agriculture and appropriate technologies in villages around the world. Why not
allow in the best of the outside world, she asked, rather than the worst?<P>

The peaceful and cooperative democracy of Yoff and neighboring villages
profoundly impressed Ecocity III's foreign participants. Listening to the
villagers, we began to understand the importance of human cooperation to keep the
peace and maintain safe streets.<P>

In Yoff, as in most communities of the South, people understand that Northern
consumption can be more environmentally destructive than overpopulation.<P>

The conference demonstrated that "Nobody has all the answers and everybody has
some." People need to keep talking and keep learning from one another. In the
same spirit, Habitat II can learn valuable lessons from the deliberations of
Ecocity III.

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: Habitat II: The Shelter Crisis</TITLE>

<H1>Habitat II: The Shelter Crisis</H1>

In 1995, the world's human population stood at 5.76 billion. While other species
are driven to extinction, the human family keeps growing -- and demanding
shelter.<P>

The United Nations has called the world's "shelter crisis" nothing less than a
"threat to international peace and security."<P>

In four years, most of the world's people will live in cities -- the majority
crowded into 21 sprawling "megalopolises" teeming with populations that exceed
ten million. Third World countries will host seventeen of these megacities.<P>

Environmentalists are concerned that such massive urbanization is unsustain-able,
that the environmental impacts of megacities will prove devastating, that
providing even the most basic human needs for five billion urbanized humans will
be impossible.<P>

Responding to these concerns, the UN will hold its second Conference on Human
Settlements -- "Habitat II" -- in Istanbul, Turkey, from June 3-14. The
conference is expected to draw 25,000 delegates from 180 countries. The main
themes of Habitat II (also known as "The City Summit") are "adequate shelter for
all" and "sustainable human settlement development in an urbanizing world."<P>

The UN Global Report on Human Settlements released in March, estimated that 500
million urban dwellers are homeless or have inadequate housing. With one million
people pouring into the world's cities each week, the report warned, "housing
cannot keep up with an exploding urban population, which will double from 2.4
billion in 1995 to 5 billion in 2025."<P>

Despite the report's alarming finding that one factor in the "unabated
rural-urban migration" is "the gradual transformation of rural areas to urban
centers." Nonetheless, Habitat II remains distinctly pro-city. The preamble to
the Habitat II Agenda calls cities "engines of growth and incubators of
civilization." The report concludes: "Massive urbanization is the only way the
world can survive the massive population increase," since only cities "can
provide essential services more cheaply and on a larger scale than rural areas."
Habitat II's solution to an ever-growing population simply is to envision
ever-bigger cities.<P>

The most controversial phrase in Habitat II's draft "Statement of Principles and
Commitments" and "Global Plan of Action" refers to housing as a "right." At the
final pre-conference meeting in New York City, in February, 1995, The <B>Earth Times</B>
reported that, "The main opposition to the concept of the right to housing came
from the United States." US spokesperson James Rubin, sounding more like an
emissary from Newt Gingrich than Bill Clinton, insisted that, "Any document which
emphasizes a government-oriented approach [to meeting shelter needs]... will be
unacceptable to the US." According to The <B>Earth Times</B>, Rubin insisted that the
final document must emphasize "private sector and market-oriented solutions."<P>

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: Walking Yoff's Soft Paths by Richard Register</TITLE>

<H1>Walking Yoff's Soft Paths</H1>
<H2>by Richard Register</H2>

Walking through Yoff by starlight, we explored the narrow, nighttime streets
wrapped in the dry, cool breezes off the Sahara. With no smog, no glare, the
desert sky was a velvet-black treasure chest of stars sparkling over the
soft-sand streets.<P>

The entire town is built on deep, fine-grained sand that sandals, thongs and bare
feet float as much as walk through. Yoff's soft streets create an environment in
which children play more freely than I've ever seen. Youngsters congregate on the
rooftops, climb high walls, jump off, chase one another, fall down. But as a
guest from the US observed, "you fall down, but you don't get hurt." Sure enough,
there are none of the bloody knees and elbows and dewy eyes we see in the land of
asphalt and concrete.<P>

By day, the hundreds of smiling, open-faced children run up to shake visitors'
hands and hold on with lingering giggles. There are none of the conversations
that plague adult/child meetings in the wealthy countries -- exchanges hinging on
pretty clothes, new toys, appearances or the presumed suspicion of strangers.<P>

The first French to arrive in Senegal reported that the Lebou villagers
maintained a peaceful republic. (France, at that time, was still a monarchy.) The
people of Yoff also never signed a treaty acknowledging foreign administrative
control. In 1864, the French commander of the Isle de Goree confided, "The
population has an indomitable passion for independence."<P>

Ironically, Yoff did not lose its ancient tribal lands until Senegal gained its
freedom from France in 1978. Shortly after, the new national government -- black,
not white; Senegalese, not French -- privatized large tracts of land and located
the national soccer stadium, airport and conference center directly on top of the
Lebou's ancestral farming lands.<P>

The Senegalese government contracted with China to build the soccer stadium on
farmland expropriated from Yoff. Today, Spanish fishing vessels and large
Japanese factory fishing ships deplete the fish stocks that once sustained Yoff's
economy.

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: Design, Ecology, Ethics and the Making of Things by William McDonough</TITLE>

<H1>Design, Ecology, Ethics and the Making of Things</H1>

<H2>by William McDonough</H2>

If what we make with our hands is to be sacred and honor the Earth that gives us
life, then the things we make must not only rise from the ground, but return to
it -- soil to soil, water to water -- so everything that is received from the
Earth can be given back freely, without causing harm to any living system. This
is ecology. This is good design.<P>

If we go back in the history of architecture, we see that architects always are 
working with two elements, mass and membrane. We have the walls of Jericho --
mass -- and we have tents -- membranes. Ancient peoples practiced the art of
building with mass, constructing adobe-walled huts to anticipate the scope and
direction of sunshine. They knew how thick a wall needed to be to transfer the
heat of the day into the winter night, and how thick it had to be to transfer
coolness into the interior in the summer.<P>

We only have to look at the Bedouin tent to find a design that accomplishes six
things at once. In the desert, temperatures often exceed 120 degrees. There is no
shade, no air movement. The black Bedouin tent, when pitched, creates a deep
shade that brings one's sensible temperature down to 95 degrees. The tent has a
very coarse weave, which creates a beautifully illuminated interior, having a
million light fixtures. Because of the coarse weave and the black surface, the
hot air inside rises and is drawn through the membrane. This creates a breeze
from outside that drops the sensible temperature further to 90 degrees. When it
rains, the fibers swell up and the tent gets tight as a drum. And, of course, you
can roll it up and take it with you. The modern tent pales by comparison to this
astonishingly elegant construct.<P>

Our modern industrial culture, however, has adopted a design stratagem that
essentially says: if brute force or massive amounts of energy do not work, you
are not using enough of them. We have made glass buildings that are more about
buildings than they are about people. The hope that glass would connect us to the
outdoors was completely stultified by sealing buildings. This design creates
stress, because people are meant to be connected with the outdoors, not trapped
inside.<P>

Le Corbusier said in the early part of this century that a house is "a machine
for living in." What has happened is that designers are now creating for the
machine and not for people. People talk about solar-heating buildings, even about
solar heating cathedrals. But it is not the cathedral that is asking to be
heated, it is the people. To solar-heat a cathedral, one should heat people's
feet, not the air 120 feet above them.<P>

<H2>Materials, Energy and Life</H2>

There are three defining characteristics of design that we can learn from the
natural world. The first characteristic is that everything we have to work with
is already here -- the stones, the clay, the wood, the water, the air. All
materials given to us by nature are returned to the Earth without the concept of
waste as we understand it. In nature, everything is cycled constantly, with all
waste becoming "food" for other living systems.<P>

The second characteristic is that energy supporting this cycle of life comes from
outside the system in the form of perpetual solar income. Nature operates on
"current income," it does not mine or extract energy from the past, it does not
use its capital reserves, and it does not borrow from the future. Natural design
employs an extraordinarily economical and efficient system for creating and
cycling nutrients, and  modern methods of manufacturing pale in comparison.<P>

Finally, the characteristic that sustains this system of metabolism and creation
is biodiversity. Preventing living systems from running down and veering into
chaos is the  miraculously intricate and symbiotic relationship among millions of
organisms.<P>

As a designer of buildings and systems, I ask myself how to apply these three
characteristics of living systems to my work. How do I employ the concept of
"waste equals food," of "current solar income," of "protecting biodiversity" in
design?<P>

I grew up in the Far East, and when I came to this country, I was taken aback
when I realized that Americans were not people with lives, but consumers with
lifestyles. When did America stop having people with lives? On television, we are
referred to as consumers, not people. But we are people, with lives, and we must
make and design things for people. And if I am a consumer, what can I consume?
Food, juice, some toothpaste. But actually, very little that is sold can be
consumed. Sooner or later, almost all of it has to be thrown away. I cannot
consume a television set or a VCR or a car.<P>

I work closely with Michael Braungart, an ecological chemist from Hamburg,
Germany, and we focus on three distinct product types. First, there are
"consumables" -- products that, when eaten, used, or thrown away, literally turn
back into dirt and become food for other living organisms. Consumables should not
go into landfills, but on to the ground to restore the soil's life, health and
fertility. This means that shampoo bottles should be made of beets that
biodegrade in compost piles. Fabrics should safely return to the Earth without
persistent toxins, mutagens, carcinogens, bioaccumulating substances, heavy
metals or endocrine disrupters.<P>

Second are products of service, also known as "durables" -- these include
television sets and cars -- that provide entertainment or transportation. To
eliminate waste, products of service should not be sold, but licensed to the
end-user. Customers may use them as long as they wish, even sell the license to
someone else, but when the end-user is finished with, say, a television, it goes
back to Sony, Zenith, or Philips. It is "food" for their manufactur-ing systems.<P>

Today, you can dump a TV into the garbage can and walk away. In the process, we
deposit persistent toxins throughout the planet. Products of service must
continue beyond their initial product life, be owned by their manufacturers and
be designed for disassembly, remanufacture and continuous reuse.<P>

The third type of product is called "unmarketables." Welcome to the world of
nuclear waste, dioxins and chromium-tanned leather. Unmarketables are products or
sub-components of products that no one wants and, in many cases, people do not
even realize they are buying. These products must cease to be sold, and those
already sold should be stored until we can figure out a safe and nontoxic way to
dispose of them.<P>

I remember when my firm was hired to design the office for an environmental
group. The director said during contract negotiations, "We are worried about
people getting sick from indoor air quality." We decided that it was our job to
find materials that would not make people sick when placed inside a building.
What we found was that those materials were not available. We had to work with
manufacturers to find out what was in their products and we discovered that the
entire system of building construction is essentially toxic. We still are working
to develop new  materials that address indoor air-quality concerns.<P>

For a New York men's clothing store, we arranged to plant 1000 oak trees to
replace the two English oaks used to panel the store. We were inspired by a
famous story told by Gregory Bateson about New College in Oxford, England. It
went something like this: The college had a main hall built in the early 1600s
with beams 40-feet long and two-feet thick. A committee was formed to try to find
replacement trees because the beams were suffering from dry rot. If you keep in
mind that a veneer from an English oak can be worth seven dollars a square foot,
the total replacement costs for the oaks were prohibitively expensive.<P>

A young faculty member suggested, "Why don't we ask the College Forester if some
of the lands that had been given to Oxford might have enough trees to call upon?"
And when they brought in the forester, he said, "We've been wondering when you
would ask this question. When the present building was constructed 350 years ago,
the architects specified that a grove of trees be planted and maintained to
replace the beams in the ceiling when they would suffer from dry rot." Bateson's
remark was, "That's the way to run a culture." Our question and hope is, "Did
they replant them?"<P>

In Frankfurt, Germany, we created a day-care center designed to be operated by
the children. It contains a greenhouse roof that has multiple functions: it
illuminates, heats both air and water, cools, ventilates and shelters from the
rain -- just like a Bedouin tent. During the design process, the engineers wanted
to completely automate the building, like a machine. The engineers asked, "What
happens if the children forget to close the shades and they get too hot?" We told
them the children would open a window. "What if they don't open a window?" We
told them that, in that case, the children probably would close the shade. "What
happens if the children don't close the shade?" We finally told them that the
children would open windows and close shades whenever necessary, because children
are not dead, but alive.<P>

The children would now have ten minutes of activity in the morning and ten
minutes of activity in the afternoon, opening and closing the windows and shades.
Both the children and teachers love the idea. Because the design included solar
hot-water collectors, we added a public laundry so that parents could wash
clothes while waiting for their children. Because of advances in glazing, the
day-care center design requires no fossil fuels for heating or cooling. Fifty
years from now, when fossil fuels are scarce, there will be hot water for the
community and  social center, and the building will have paid back the energy
"borrowed" for construction.<P>

<H2>The Ethics of Design</H2>

As we become aware of the ethical implications of design -- not only with respect
to buildings, but in every aspect of human endeavor -- they reflect changes in
the historical concept of who or what has rights. When you study the history of
rights, you begin with the Magna Carta, which was about the rights of white,
English, noble males. With the Declaration of Independence, rights were expanded
to all land-owning white males. Nearly a century later, we moved to the
emancipation of slaves, and during the beginnings of this century, to suffrage,
giving women the right to vote.<P>

The pace picks up with the Civil Rights Act in 1964, and then in 1973, the
Endangered Species Act. For the first time, the rights of other species and
organisms to exist were recognized. We essentially have  "declared" that <I>Homo
sapiens</I> are part of the web of life. If Thomas Jefferson were with us today, he
would most likely be calling for "Declarations of Interdependence" that recognize
that our ability to pursue wealth, health and happiness is dependent on other
forms of life, that the rights of one species are linked to the rights of others
and none should suffer remote tyranny.<P>

We must face the fact that what we see across the world today is war, a war
against life itself. Our present systems of design have created a world that
grows far beyond the environment's capacity to sustain life into the future. The
industrial idiom of design, failing to honor the principles of nature, can only
violate them, producing waste and harm. If we destroy more forests, burn more
garbage, drift-net more fish, burn more coal, bleach more paper, destroy more
topsoil, poison more insects, build over more habitats, dam more rivers, produce
more toxic and radioactive waste, we are creating a vast industrial machine, not
for <B>living</B> in, but for <B>dying</B> in. It is a war that only a few more generations can
survive.<P>

We must recognize that every event and manifestation of nature is "design."
Living within the laws of nature means expressing our human intention as an
interdependent species -- aware and grateful that we are at the mercy of sacred
forces larger than ourselves, and obeying these laws in order to honor the sacred
in each other and in all things. We must come to peace with and accept our place
in the natural world.<P>

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: Eco-Housing</TITLE>
<H1>Eco-Housing</H1>

"Buildings use roughly a third of the energy and two-thirds of the electricity in
the US -- and, unfortunately, waste most of it," the Rocky Mountain Institute
reported in its 1994 study, Better Buildings by Design [RMI, 1739 Snowmass Creek
Road, Snowmass, CO 81654-9199; (303) 927-3851]. "The good news -- now being
demonstrated by farseeing architects, developers, contractors and engineers -- is
that the numerous institutional barriers to efficiency can be profitably
overcome."<P>

Here is a brief list of some of the resurgent technologies that represent the
"soft path" approach to meeting human shelter needs.

<H3>Rammed Earth.</H3>

Earth and water, the world's oldest building materials, can be used
to build a home that provides year-round comfort with minimal use of energy. And
the building material comes directly from the building site. One of the best
texts available is <B>The Rammed Earth House</B> [Chelsea Green Publishing, Co. PO Box
428, White River Junction, VT 05001; (802) 295-6300].

<H3>Straw Bales.</H3>

"The idea of building anything out of straw can seem laughable,"
notes the introduction to <B>The Straw Bale House</B> [Chelsea Green Publishing], "but
traditional cultures throughout the world have long recognized the value of
straw, grasses, and reeds as building materials, and have used them effectively
in combination with earth and timber to create shelter for thousands of years."
The first straw bale homes in the US were built in Nebraska more than 100 years
ago. The GreenFire Institute [1509 Queen Anne Avenue North, #606, Seattle, WA
98109; (206) 284-7470] hosts on-site building workshops across the country.

<H3>Cob Cottages.</H3>

Using ancient building techniques from the British Isles, cob
cottages employ "unbaked, unconsolidated, hand-formed earth" to build durable,
energy-efficient homes that can cut lumber consumption by 75 percent. <B>The Cob
Cottage Company</B> [Box 123, Cottage Grove, OR 97424; (503) 942-3021] provides
workshops around the US demonstrating how earthen buildings can be uniquely
hand-formed into beautiful live-in sculptures.

<H3>Earthships.</H3>

Why burn tires and pollute the air when old  tires can be filled with
rammed earth to form Earthship shelters with "virtually indestructible"
three-foot thick walls? Earthship designs [Earthship Global Operations, PO Box
2009, El Prado, NM 87529; (505) 751-0462; fax: -1005; <A HREF="mailto:earthship@ interserv.com">
earthship@ interserv.com</A>]
include water-catching metal roofs, photoelectric panels and dry solar toilets.

<H2>Organizations</H2>

<B>Habitat for Humanity International</B> [121 Habitat Street, Americus, GA 31709-3498;
(912) 924-6935; fax: 924-6541], a nonprofit ecumenical Christian organization
with 1200 US affiliates, is responsible for building 10,000 new homes each year.
Last December, HFHI embarked on an "international effort to enhance environmental
responsibility in the construction and maintenance" of new homes. Habitat homes,
built by volunteers in as little as six-days, are built to last. When Hurricane
Andrew raked South Florida, it flattened homes that took six months to build: all
27 Habitat homes survived the storm. "It is the stated mission of Habitat for
Humanity to eliminate poverty housing from the face of the Earth," states HEFI
founder Millard Fuller. Habitat has built 40,000 homes in 46 countries and all 50
states.<P>

<B>Global Green USA</B> [(310) 277-6200], the US partner of Mikhail Gorbachev's Green
Cross International, promotes "resource-efficient building practices."<P>

<B>Habitat International Coalition</B> [Cordobanes #24, Col. San Jose Insurgentes,
Mexico, 03900, DF; (5) 651-6807; fax: (5) 593-5194] coordinates the global
grassroots Global Campaign for the Right to Housing, and its monthly newsletter
reports on the fight for "just, democratic and sustainable cities."<P>

<B>Ecological Design Association</B> [EDA, The British School, Slad Road, Stound,
Gloschester, GL5 1QZ, UK] was founded to "promote ecological design and link
designers in a global network."<P>

<B>Center for Resourceful Building Technology</B> [PO Box 3866, Missoula, MT 59806;
(406) 549-7678] studies the environmental impacts of building materials and
publishes the Guide to Resource Efficient Building Elements.<P>

<B>The Co-Housing Company</B> [1250 Addison Street #13, Berkeley, CA 94702; (510)
549-9980] assists people interested in creating shared living solutions.<P>

<B>The Ecological Design Institute</B> [10 Liberty Way, #185, Sausalito, CA 94965; (415)
332-5806] offers a comprehensive range of educational, research and design
services.<P>

<B>Natural Building Network</B> [Box 1110, Sebastopol, CA 95473] is a group of
architects and builders promoting energy-efficient and ecological design.

<H2>Publications</H2>

<B>The Adobe Journal</B> [PO Box 7725, Albuquerque, NM 87102; (505) 243-7801] celebrates
earth-based construction techniques that "provides shelter to 40 percent of the
world's population." This beautifully illustrated oversized magazine believes
that modern architects, planners and housing officials can draw lessons from
"generations of earth-builders whose distilled practical knowledge may provide
the most important and available solution for the world's housing crisis, as well
as reducing the problems of deforestation and pollution."<P>

<B>The Natural House Catalog</B> [Gaia Books Ltd., 20 High Street, Stround,
Gloucestershire, GL5 1AS England; 44-1453-752985; fax: 44-1453-752987] was

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: A New Challenge: Overcoming Green Sexism by Diane Valantne, Joy Belsky, and Sally Cross</TITLE>
<H1>A New Challenge: Overcoming Green Sexism</H1>
<H2>by Diane Valantne, Joy Belsky, and Sally Cross</H2>

The simmering dissatisfaction of female forest activists first boiled over at the
1993 Ancient Forests Conference in Ashland, Oregon. Some women were annoyed about
the phallic humor from the podium; others were concerned about the general lack
of female participation. An ad-hoc session on sexism in the environmental
movement attracted a broad diversity of activists -- first-timers, seasonal
volunteers, staff of national groups and long-time grassroots activists.<P>

Three months of hard work followed, resulting in a statement called "The Ash-land
Principles," which discussed the relationship between the destruction of our
environment, the oppression of women and the denial of so-called "feminine
values." Later work on the principles led to the development of "Guidelines for
Organizations," which presented two major goals:

<UL>

<LI>achieving proportional representation of women and minorities in all areas of
an organization, including leadership ranks; and,<P>

<LI>creating an atmosphere where everyone feels included, respected and valued.<P>

</UL>

The goals were accompanied by guidelines for hiring, leadership development,
meetings, office atmosphere and public conferences.<P>

A few months later, the 1993 Land Air Water (LAW) Conference convened in Eugene,
Oregon under the banner: "Indigenous Peoples: Sacred Roots, Sacred Ties." While
the organizers did include a committee on sexism, the conference was disrupted by
a group of Native American drummers protesting the all-white makeup of the
televised keynote panel. Clearly, many people were becoming frustrated with the
continued lack of diversity within these environmental conferences.<P>

The next year, the 1994 LAW Conference listed two male speakers for every woman.
The meeting's theme, "Raising our Voices for the Earth," should have read:
"Raising our Mostly Male Voices for the Earth."<P>

With a sense of fun, we recommended that attendees send only one-third of the $25
registration fee to reflect the fact that only one-third of the presenters were
women. The conference organizers -- all students at the University of Oregon Law
School -- were not amused. They let us know, in no uncertain terms, how hard they
had worked trying to find more women to invite. They accused us of criticizing
rather than helping.<P>

We responded by sending them the names of 20 women who were well-qualified to
speak at the conference and reminded them that people are judged by results, not
by good intentions. We hold natural resources agencies to this standard in court,
and we did not see any reason to lower standards for environmental organizations.
The LAW conference organizers subsequently were able to find additional women to
invite, including some from our list.<P>

<H2>Genderbusting Goes National</H2>

With this victory in hand, we started deconstructing every conference
announcement we received, pouring over a slew of glossy brochures for events
sponsored by the US Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and several Western
universities. A conference on "Sustaining Rangeland Ecosystems" listed only six
invited women out of 55 speakers; one on "Ecosystem Management in Western
In-terior Forests" listed three women out of 54 speakers; another on "Forest
Health and Fire Danger in Inland Western Forests" listed five women out 54
speakers. The LAW Conference's one-to-two ratio was looking better all the time.<P>

We wrote to the organizers of each conference, pointed out the seriously skewed
ratios, and explained that "under-representation of women... perpetuates the myth
that only men have the training, the ability, or the interest to participate in
management of our public lands."<P>

Copies of these letters were sent to the secretaries of Interior and Agriculture,
the Chief of the Forest Service, deans of the universities, conference sponsors
and local newspapers -- along with lists of 60-90 women scientists, land managers
and newspaper reporters who were qualified to speak at each conference.<P>

Despite their PhDs, the howls of protest from the professionals were even louder
and more indignant than those of the law students. One letter from Forest Service
and Washington State University organizers used the terms "malicious" and
"slanderous" to describe us.<P>

All the host organizations had strong policies promoting gender diversity. Their
program committees included women, and every one of those committees discussed
the necessity of inviting more women. But they did not. Those women who cared
about balance were voted down and the "good old boys" continued to invite their
buddies. It was not until ONRC chastised the organizers in protests and in the
press that they altered their behavior.<P>

<H2>Women Respond</H2>

Letters, phone calls and flowers started arriving at ONRC from the women we had
recommended as speakers. These women spoke about the pain and frustration of
being left out of conferences and ignored by their peers. The letters were
indescribably sad and familiar -- educated, talented, productive women who had
received little recognition for their work and faced slow career advancement.<P>

An assistant professor of range management wrote: "I constantly battle the
insidious and covert barriers to women in our field. I often tire of the battle,
and, at times, I have considered changing my career. I do not believe I could
have composed such a powerful letter, and I doubt that I would have had the
courage to send it. Thanks for standing up for me and other women professionals."<P>

The media was slow to show interest, but ONRC's request for a Congressional
investigation into sex discrimination at conferences funded by federal monies
gave the story the news value it needed.<P>

ONRC's commitment to gender balance was put to the test when it became one of the
hosts of the 1994 National Forest Reform Rally. We spent days on the phone
recruiting speakers and discovered, once again, the pressures working against
gender balance at conferences.<P>

The ancient forest issue is one of the oldest in the environmental movement, and
most of the leaders are men -- and they all wanted to give talks. On the other
side were women who often had little speaking experience and did not wish to get
their first experience at a national meeting.<P>

The final gender breakdown of speakers at the event was 39 to 36 (male to
female). We had proven that, with extra effort, gender balance could be achieved.
The women added diversity of thought, speaking styles and perspective, and the
conference helped pave the way for a new generation of leaders to gain experience
and recognition.
The authors, staffmembers of the Oregon Natural Resources Council (ONRC), have
worked  tirelessly to attack sexism in the environmental movement. Their campaign
of direct action has helped bring more equitable gender representation to
environmental and scientific conferences.<P>

When the 1995 LAW brochure arrived, we did a quick count: the ratio was two women
to three men. An improvement, but there is still work to be done.<P>

<H2>Some Final Thoughts</H2>

Our first piece of advice is: do not be afraid to confront the issue head-on. As
a movement and profession, environmentalists are committed to the principle of
protecting biodiversity. We should not accept the human equivalent of a
monoculture at our conferences, when, with a little effort, we can have a diverse
and healthy forest.<P>

Second, be prepared for angry responses. In the modern world, everyone imagines
themselves to be totally liberated. Challenges are bound to create anger and
denial. Do not be intimidated.<P>

Third, repetition is the key. Our first letter to the conference organizers had
no effect; the second letter had no effect either; but the third letter broke
through the denial.<P>

We were lucky. Not only were the three of us working together and supporting each
other, but we belong to an organization in which everyone strongly believes in
the importance of diversity; not just as a fairness issue, but as an
environmental issue as well.<P>

It helps to have support. If you have to go it alone, do so, but you will not
really be alone. You will be representing a much larger group, many of whom have
lost the ability or strength to speak for themselves.<P>

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: Attacks on Women: A Tax on Men by June Stephenson</TITLE>
<H1>Attacks on Women: A Tax on Men</H1>
<H2>by June Stephenson</H2>

The greatest US environmental offender is the federal government -- run by
men.... Ninety-four percent of people arrested and sent to jail are men. Whether
robbery, burglary, arson, white-collar crime, crime against children, crime
against women, crime in government, crime against the environment, drug dealing,
drunk driving, murder, treason or gang violence, crime is a masculine statement.<P>

Ten years ago there were approximately 200,000 people in US prisons. Today there
are approximately one million Americans behind bars. Incarcerated men outnumber
women by a ratio of 94 to 6. Men dominate the ranks of individuals on parole or
probation -- all 2.4 million of them.<P>

Male criminals cost this country more than $61 billion each year in incarceration
and judicial expenses. This figure does not include the cost of the
billion-dollar savings-and-loan scandal, nor the costs of toxic-waste cleanup.<P>

We cannot expect men to police their own or take responsibility for their
contribution to violence: they are too much a part of it. So besides building
more prisons and jailing more offenders, what is left? Nothing short of ensuring
that men pay for male-perpetrated crime.<P>

Half of US taxpayers are women and all of these women pay for male crime with
their tax dollars. A $100 criminal justice system "user fee" could be added to
men's IRS returns. Of course, there would be screaming and hollering about such a
fee, but one might ask, is $100 a year too much to ask to help curtail crime?<P>

The concept of one group paying more for services is not new. Insurance companies
in many states charge young men aged 18 to 26 more for car insurance than other
people, because males in this age group cause most of the car accidents.<P>

If men recognize that crime is a male statement for which males must pay more
than females, there is a possibility they might help to "clean up their act."<P>

<A NAME="Nukes"><H2>No Nukes Are Good Nukes</H2>

Thailand -- On December 15, 1995, after 12 years of negotiations, Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Burma, Cambodia, Laos and the
Philippines declared Southeast Asia a nuclear- weapons-free zone. The treaty
marked the highlight of the first-ever summit of all ten members of the
Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN). While Philippine President Fidel
Ramos praised the treaty for helping to "secure a less anxious future for
peoples throughout Southeast Asia," the US and China complained that the
"nuclear-free" declaration could interfere with their nuclear-powered and
nuclear-armed vessel movement.

<A NAME="Catching"><H2>Catching the Wave</H2>

China -- Despite US Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's 1995 trip to Beijing to
woo contracts for US nuclear reactors, the world's largest nation is not about
to become a nuclear-dependent economy. Since 1958, China has harvested
electrical energy from the ocean's tides. Eight "trial" tidal power stations
already generate 6.12 MW of electricity. The five-station Jiang-sha Trial
Station at Leqing Bay in Zhejiang Province has an installed capacity of 3.2 MW.
Jiangsha, the world's third-largest tidal power station (France and Canada have
larger plants), is the first "two-way" tidal generator -- it produces power
both when the tide flows and when it ebbs.

<A NAME="Heavy"><H2>Heavy Waterworld</H2>

Germany -- In 1973, work began near the Westphalian town of Kalkar on what was
to have been Germany's first breeder reactor. Germany has spent DM7 billion
($4.9 billion) on the reactor without producing a single watt of electricity.
After two decades of technical and financial problems, the Bonn government
decided to throw in the towel. Eight months after Bonn put the abandoned
40-acre site on the auction block, a potential buyer stepped forth. According
to <B>The Week in Germany</B>, the owner of a chain of amusement parks in The
Netherlands "intends to turn the plant into a family recreation center,
complete with hotels and sports facilities, that will feature a variety of
water rides." The Dutch entrepreneur will call his park <B>Kern-Wasser-Wunderland</B>
("Nuclear Water Wonderland").

<A NAME="Tobacco"><H2>Tobacco Is Haram-ful</H2>

Malaysia -- What do Joe Camel and Salman Rushdie have in common? Both have been
targeted for elimination by factions of the Muslim faith. Last fall, the
Malaysian National Islamic Affairs Council passed a <B>fatwa</B> (holy law) declaring
smoking to be <B>haram</B> (a vice forbidden to Muslims). According to the Malaysian
consumer magazine <B>Utusan Konsumer</B>, the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer
Affairs "has informed the Director General of the Islamic Affairs Division in the
Prime Minister's Department that the fatwa should, in fact, be printed on every
pack of cigarettes sold." In addition to containing 4000 hazardous chemicals
(including butane, arsenic, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, vinyl chloride,
radioactive polonium-210 and nicotine), the newspaper notes that "Cigarettes sold
in Malaysia have almost twice the amount of tar and nicotine than those in the
US."

<A NAME="50th"><H2>50th US Park</H2>

Samoa -- The Utah-based Seacology Foundation [(800) 489-1SAV] has presented the
1996 Indigenous Conservationist of the Year Award to A. P. Lutali, Governor of
American Samoa. Lutali was instrumental in creating the 9000-acre National Park
of Samoa -- the 50th US national park and home of the Pacific boa and the Pacific
Island flying fox. The flying fox (actually a large bat) is a major pollinator of
the island's forests. The park will offer new protection to the bat, which has
been hunted for its meat.

<A NAME="Manna"><H2>Manna From Hebron</H2>

USA -- Saltcedar trees (Tamarix) were imported to the US from Israel in 1837 to
stabilize stream banks. Today, the saltcedar ranks as one of the ten worst weeds
in the west, dominating more than 1.5 million acres from Kansas and Texas to
California and Montana. Saltcedar crowds out native cottonwoods, willow and
mesquite, and its salty leaves poison the topsoil. US scientists now believe that
they have found a native predator to control the saltcedar. Israel's manna scale
(<B>Trabutina mannipara</B>), "a beneficial sap-sucking insect the size of a green pea,"
is best known for its starring role in the Book of Genesis, where swarms of
insects excreted sweet streams of honeydew, the "manna that fell from Heaven" and
saved the starving Israelites.

<A NAME="Whom"><H2>Whom Do You Trust?</H2>

UK -- In 1995, according to the annual MORI Business and the Environment survey,
82 percent of British citizens polled claimed that they trusted scientists
working for environmental groups, while only 48 percent trusted industry
scientists. Government scientists had the trust of just 38 percent. According to
<B>BBC Wildlife</B>, MORI also discovered that "the proportion of environmental
activists more than doubled... from 14 percent of the adult population in 1988 to
31 percent in 1991." Since 1993, "a steady two thirds of the public" have
disagreed with the statement: "There isn't much that ordinary people can do to
help protect the environment."

<A NAME="CITI"><H2>My CITI by the Bay</H2>

USA -- A $10,000 electric automobile goes on sale in California this year. The
lead-acid/Ni-Cad battery-powered CITI (Clean, Intelligent Transportation, Inc.)
is based on the Norwegian "City Bee" electric car. The small (five-foot by
nine-foot), 1650-pound CITI features a dent-resistant thermoplastic body over an
aluminum "space frame" body, air conditioning and air-bags. Freeway-ready at
speeds up to 65 mph, the CITI is also "fully recyclable." The CITI will be built
at the former Alameda Naval Air Station, an abandoned defense depot now being
converted for peacetime use.

<A NAME="Adios"><H2>Adios, Mexico City</H2>

Mexico -- Mexico City's government buildings, cathedrals, 20 million residents
and 3.5 million cars are sinking into the ground -- four-and-a-half inches per
year -- as Latin America's largest (and thirstiest) megacity drains underground
aquifers twice as fast as rainwater can replenish them. The city has dropped 22
feet since 1935. The Fine Arts Building, the National Palace and heavy stone
cathedrals are slumping, tilting and cracking. Water and sewer lines are
rupturing, threatening to pollute the city's remaining aquifer with chemical and
organic wastes. Charles DuMars, a University of New Mexico law professor and
co-chair of a US-Mexico water study, told the Cox News Service that once aquifers
are contaminated, "it's economically unfeasible to clean them up. Once it happens
it's irreversible." DuMars estimated that the situation could become "very
urgent... in two, three, five years."

<A NAME="Star"><H2>Star Wars Lives</H2>

Last October 25, an explosion and fire demolished a building at
the 1578-acre Lockheed-Martin facility near Orlando, Florida. Company and
Department of Defense officials refused to discuss the incident, but John Pike of
the Federation of American Scientists believes the explosion involved "special
access, black programs" of the federal government's plan to build a secret
Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars") space weapon. While the government
claims that Star Wars spending cost taxpayers $32.6 billion between 1983-1993,
the Congressional Research Service (CRS) estimates that the Pentagon actually
spent "at least $70.7 billion" on space weapons research. The CRS explained that
the missing $38.1 billion was hidden in off-budget "generic" and "all other
projects" spending. According to the Christian Science Monitor, "The purposes of
most of these programs are not disclosed, even to the lawmakers who vote on the
military's annual budgets."<P>

<A NAME="Bunker"><H2>"Bunker Bomb" Being Built</H2>

At last spring's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
Extension Conference, American representatives told the world that the US had no
plans to develop new nuclear weapons. At that very moment, however, the
Department of Energy (DoE) secretly was working to develop the B-61 strategic
bomb, an "earth penetrator" capable of plunging deep underground to destroy
buried targets. Citizens Against a Radioactive Environment [CARE, 5720 East
Avenue, #116, Livermore, CA 94550; (510) 433-7148] reports that the weapon "was
approved outside the regular budget process and without congressional debate, by
means of secret letters to key committee chairs." The DoE insists the weapon is
merely a "modification" of an older bomb. CARE maintains that building this
weapon "undercuts a [nuclear weapons test ban] before it is even signed."<P>

<A NAME="NIMS"><H2>NIMS (Not In My School)</H2>

Arizona Republicans, alarmed that their schoolchildren
had been encouraged to write "advocacy" letters (to save dolphins, forests and
predators), passed a law banning "environmental advocacy" in the state's
classrooms. School officials in Idaho, Oklahoma and Oregon also have placed
restrictions on teaching environmental issues. Florida, North Carolina and
Wisconsin are considering similar laws. Ironically, a study by the nonprofit
Consumers Union found that the most widely available "environmental materials" in
classrooms are sponsored by business groups such as the American Gas Association
and the National Livestock & Meat Board.<P>

<A NAME="What"><H2>What Next, Nuclear Gnats?</H2>

After Glen James, a former engineer at California's
San Onofre nuclear power plant, contracted terminal leukemia, he sued the plant's
owner, Southern California Edi-son, for failure to ensure plant safety. James
cited a Nuclear Regulatory Commission report that faulted SCE's monitoring
systems for not being sensitive enough to detect "fuel fleas," radioactive specks
of reactor fuel that can run loose inside the work spaces of nuclear plants. Fuel
fleas are even more dangerous than the "radon daughters" that can enter homes
from buried radioactive rock deposits. After a two-month trial, however, a jury
failed to find in James' favor. SCE released a report praising the jury's
verdict, claiming that its corporate heart went out to James' family and signing
off with the observation that, after all, "today, one out of three Americans will
die of cancer."<P>

<A NAME="Our"><H2>Our Tax Dollars at Work</H2>

Last November, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
dispatched 100 members of the State Security Service to London. Press reports
identified the armed men as "hit squads" sent to "liquidate the Egyptian regime's
enemies abroad." According to wire service reports, 40 of the killers sent to
track down and eliminate Islamic fundamentalists were "trained in the United
States."<P>

<A NAME="Nuclear"><H2>Nuclear Hara-Kiri</H2>

In Japan, Nuclear power plant manager Shigeo Nishimura
reported that his company had covered up the severity of an accident at the
experimental Monju breeder-reactor. On January 13, shortly after his findings
were made public, Nishimura penned a letter of apology to his boss and plunged to
his death from the window of a Tokyo hotel.<P>

<A NAME="Pimping"><H2>Pimping for the Pentagon</H2>

The rape of a schoolgirl galvanized Okinawa, Japan,
against the presence of US military forces, but the situation in South Korea may
be even worse. Gwy Kirk, Director of Women's Studies at Antioch College, reports
that "every day, US military personnel [in South Korea] commit two or three
crimes against Korean civilians --  murders, rapes and sexual abuse, arson,
theft, fraud -- all beyond the reach of Korean law." In most countries subject to
US military occupation, prostitution routinely is supported and supervised by the
Pentagon. "Since 1945," Kirk reports, "there has been an agreement between the
two governments authorizing the sexual servicing of US personnel." An estimated
18,000 South Korean "bar girls" currently are registered with health authorities.<P>

<A NAME="Pravda"><H2>Pravda -- Not!</H2>

Disgusted by the level of Kremlin disinformation on Russia's war
in Chechnya, one leading news agency felt compelled to add the following caveat
to its dispatches: "Dear subscribers! Interfax does not exclude the possibility
that sometimes these reports are intended to serve purposes other than to
inform."<P>

<A NAME="Nip"><H2>Mole Nip</H2>

To Native American activist/actor Russell Means, who is lending his
name to a plan by First Entertainment Inc. to revive two classic Harley-Davidson
"Indian" motorcycles from the 1940s -- the "Chief" and the "441 Straight." Means
reportedly is asking American Indian casino owners to contribute the $30 million
needed to kick-start the assembly lines.<P>

<A NAME="Kiss"><H2>Mole Kiss</H2>

To neo-Vegan Lisa Simpson of Fox Network's <B>The Simpsons</B> for pitching
the concept of meat-free diets to an audience of more than 14 million viewers.<P>

To director Jodi Foster for a nice anti-fur moment in her wicked
family comedy, <B>Home for the Holidays</B>.<P>

<A NAME="Moth"><H2>Moth-Mashing Microbes</H2>

USA -- After a 14-year effort by Louis A. Falcon, a University of California
professor emeritus of entomology, the EPA has approved the use of a microbial
pesticide (the granulosis virus) to protect apples, pears and walnuts from attack
by the codling moth. While standard spraying with the pesticide Guthion
(azinphosmethyl) kills all insects, both good and bad, Fal-con's baculovirus only
affects a few specific insect pests. When chemical companies refused to back the
research, the US Department of Agriculture and Cali-fornia's Environmental
License Plate Fund came to the rescue. Half of the $5 million research cost was
provided by the nonprofit Association for Sensible Pest Control, Inc. (ASPCI), a
coalition of  organic growers. ASPCI boardmember and apple farmer Tim Bates
claims that Falcon's microbe "works better" than the other biological pesticides
like ryania and Bacillus thuringensis.

<A NAME="AKZO"><H2>The AKZO-Nobel Prize</H2>

The Netherlands -- Ten years ago, chemical stench and eye-watering pollution
drove local residents to blockade the Diosynth chemical plant in the southern
Netherlands. In the last two years, reports Environmental News From The
Netherlands, "a detailed environmental management system reduced [the plant's]
solvent emissions by 95 percent," and Diosynth, a branch of the Dutch chemical
group AKZO-Nobel, has gone on to win a national prize for environmental care.
According to Environmental News, "the driving force behind the change was the
workforce."

<A NAME="Solar"><H2>Solar Market Dawns in Far East</H2>

Germany -- The Munich-based company Siemans Solar GmbH predicts that the market
for photovoltaic power in the Far East -- now generating approximately 15,000 KW
annually -- will grow 25 percent by the year 2000. In India alone,
solar-generated electricity is expected to jump from 5000 KW to 20,000 KW by
1997, thanks to the government's program to equip 100,000 rural homes with
sun-powered lighting. Siemans will ship more than one million solar cells to
India from its manufacturing plants in California.

<A NAME="Mattress"><H2>Mattress Matters</H2>

USA -- Each year, two million tons of waste pour into US landfills, and among the
bulkiest items are mattresses. The Outcycle Project works to reduce the nation's
annual $4 billion landfill bill by returning "virtually all used mattress
components to other industries for use in new products." This first-of-its-kind
project was created by The Verlo Mattress Company, Inc. [Rt. 4, Hwy. 59E, PO Box
298, Whitewater, WI 53190]. Verlo "outcycles" discarded mattresses by reclaiming
fabric, foam and cotton padding, wood and steel. Is there a downside to
outcycling? Perhaps just this:  according to Verlo's press release, "Each
mattress is broken down into its base components by prison labor forces."

<A NAME="Charcoals"><H2>Charcoals to Newcastle</H2>

UK -- Britain's backyard barbequers burn 60,000 tons of charcoal each year to
bake their burgers and bangers. Ninety-five percent of the charcoal is imported,
with a third coming from Southeast Asia's mangrove forests. A newly designed
Viper Kiln, developed by Yorkshire inventor David Hutchinson, promises to revive
the British charcoal industry with small, highly efficient, portable burners.
While a ton of waste wood sells for #18 ($28) a ton as pulp, it is worth #700
($1100) once it has been turned into charcoal. BBC Wildlife reports that the
revival of small-scale charcoal operations "not only rejuvenates British
woodlands, it also provides labor-intensive rural jobs and takes the strain off
endangered habitats."

<A NAME="Saving"><H2>Saving Trees Creates Jobs</H2>

USA -- After logging in national parks was curbed in 1991 to protect the northern
spotted owl, Republican lawmakers complained that the restrictions would cost
thousands of jobs. A December 1995 report by the Natural Resources Defense
Council found that, as of 1993, 2254 loggers had lost their jobs -- a 21 percent
decline. However, the NRDC reported, after logging restrictions were enacted,
total employment in the region actually swelled by 45,363 jobs -- mainly from
increased tourism and retail sales. Surveying economic data from 17 of
California's Sierra Nevada counties, the NRDC found that logging accounted for
only one percent of employment and income in the timber towns. "For every
timber-related job lost, 20 new jobs were created," the NRDC reported.

<A NAME="Do"><H2>Do-it-Yourself Development</H2>

Eritrea -- Despite average annual incomes of less than $150, citizens in the
African nation of Eritrea have spurned international development loans. "We have
the capacity for self-sufficiency. We don't believe aid can solve our problems,"
said President Isaias Afewerki. The government has mobilized workers to build
rail lines and roads by offering donated foodstuffs as payment. Eighty percent of
Eritreans are still farmers, and agriculture accounts for 70 percent of export
earnings. Each summer, Eritrean schoolchildren spend two months planting trees
and restoring mountain sides. Eritrea's minister of marine resources, Saleh Meky,
curtly explained the reasoning behind his country's maverick path: "Handouts have
brought nothing to Africa but disaster."

<A NAME="Eco"><H2>Eco-City Campaign</H2>

Denmark -- Responding to the challenge of Agenda 21 (the guide to environmental
sustainability produced at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro), delegates
from 32 countries met in Aalborg in 1994 and signed a Charter of European Cities
and Towns Towards Sustainability. Two existing "eco-cities"in the New World -- 
Davis, California and Curitiba, Brazil --helped inspire the European eco-city

<A NAME="Green"><H2>Green Solvents From Down Under</H2>

Australia -- Most industrial and household solvents are derived from alcohol and
hydrocarbons, which can damage  the environment and human health. Ren Kenbao, a
research student at the Victoria University of Technology in Melbourne [c/o Dr.
Douglas Kagi, VUT, PO Box 14428, MMC, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia] has created
a range of "organic solvents" that are "worker-friendly and environmentally
sound." The water-based emulsions and solutions can be used in place of toluene,
xylene and mineral turpentine.

<A NAME="Congress"><H2>"Congress, Have you Flipped?"</H2>

USA -- With the backing of Earth Island and 20 other eco groups, Gary Hirshberg,
president of Stonyfield Farm, has placed a unique appeal on the lids of millions
of yogurt cups. Yogurt  lovers are asked to send their lids to Congress and
demand laws that protect "a healthy Earth."

<A NAME="Victory"><H2>Victory for Sea Turtles</H2>

 On January 5, in a ruling dubbed one of the greatest
conservation victories of all time, the US Court of International Trade (CIT)
determined that all shrimp-exporting countries must adopt sea turtle conservation
measures by May 1, 1996, or face an embargo of shrimp products destined for the
US.<P>

The lawsuit, challenging the US Secretaries of State, Treasury and Commerce, was
filed by EII's <A HREF="../strp/strpindx.html">Sea Turtle Restoration Project</A> [STRP, Box 400, 40 Montezuma
Avenue, Forest Knolls, CA 94933; (415) 488-0370], the American Society for the
Preservation of Cruelty to Animals, the Humane Society of the US and the Sierra
Club.<P>

"This decision will save more than a hundred thousand sea turtles from needlessly
drowning in shrimp nets every year, ending the largest killing of en-dangered
species occurring in the world right now," stated STRP director Todd Steiner.
"We're overjoyed that [federal judge Thomas J.] Aquilino had the courage to
overturn the US State Department, putting environment protection ahead of
so-called 'free-trade' issues."<P>

The ruling compels the State Department to ban shrimp imports from all nations
that have not reduced sea turtle mortality by 97 percent -- a level easily
achieved with the use of Turtle Excluder Devices. TEDs are inexpensive ($50-$400)
metal grids sewn into shrimp nets to guide turtles toward an escape hatch.<P>

Industry lobbyists have long claimed that using TEDs would force shrimpers out of
business, but Steiner noted that US shrimp trawlers have used TEDs successfully
since 1989. According to Jack d'Antiagnac, president of the Georgia Fisherman's
Association, "TEDs save turtles, reduce the unnecessary killing of countless fish
and protect the marine environment on which we all depend. It will be easy enough
for countries to adopt the use of TEDs, if they have a sincere desire to do so."

<A NAME="Wild"><H2>Wild and WACky</H2>

 Earth Island's Board of Directors has approved EII's newest
project, <B>Wildlife Alive</B> -- California (WAC), dedicated to the protection and
restoration of wildlife and habitat throughout the state. WAC also works to
defend state laws such as the California Endangered Species Act, recently under
fire from right-wing legislators. WAC played a  role in the successful statewide
effort to defeat Proposition 197, a mountain lion "management plan" designed to
repeal a 1990 initiative and reinstate mountain lion trophy hunting.<P>

WAC director Mark J. Palmer, a former executive director of the Whale Center and
the Mountain Lion Foundation, most recently has worked with EII's <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">Marine Mammal
Project</A> coordinating congressional efforts to protect dolphins.

<A NAME="Journal"><H2>Journal Wins Reporting Award</H2>

 Project Censored has selected two <B>Earth Island
Journal</B> stories -- "EPA Study Reveals Dioxin Dangers" by <B>Stephen Lester</B> (Spring
EIJ) and "<A HREF="methbro.html">Campaign Against Methyl Bromide: Ozone-Killing Pesticide Opposed</A>" by
Anne Schoenfield (Summer EIJ) -- from more than 700 nominations nationwide to
rank among the 25 top "censored" stories for 1995. Schoenfield's article  was
judged one of the "Top Ten Best Censored Stories of 1995." For the full story,
see the new book, Censored, with an introduction by Walter Cronkite (Seven
Stories, 632 Broadway, New York, NY 10012. $14.95).<P>

The Journal's expose of Project HAARP, the Pentagon's plan to "burn holes" in the
ionosphere (one of the "Ten Best Censored Stories of 1994"), recently generated 
documentary on the Canadian Broadcast Corporation's "Undercurrents" and two
reports on Fox Network's "Sightings."<P>

In other media news, UTNE Reader saluted <A HREF="../brower/browerbr.html">David Brower</A> as one of 1996's leading
"Visionaries" in its March issue, and Mother Jones ran a long feature on the
shrimp-saving efforts of <A HREF="../strp/strpindx.html">STRP</A> and the 
<A HREF="../map/map.html">Mangrove Action Project</A>, headed by Alfredo
Quarto.

<A NAME="As"><H2>As Goes Maine...</H2>

 The director of EII's <B>Northern Forest Forum</B>, Jamie Sayen, has
joined forces with the Ban Clearcutting Campaign (BCC) in Maine to support a
referendum on November's statewide ballot that would prohibit clearcutting. "This
is not just a local issue," says BCC director Jonathan Carter. "It not only sets
a national precedent for eliminating clearcutting, but it puts industry on notice
that the citizens of Maine and the rest of the nation will not tolerate the
wanton destruction of our natural heritage in the name of huge corporate
profits."<P>

Because the pro-forest referendum has wide popular support, pro-industry forces
have launched a campaign of distortion and misinformation to defeat it.
Grass-roots support is crucial -- whether you live in Maine or not. To get
involved, contact: BCC, Box 2218, Augusta, ME 04438; (207) 623-7140.

<A NAME="Carl"><H2>Carl Anthony Goes to Harvard</H2>

 Earth Island president and Urban Habitat Program
director <A HREF="../eins/carls_msg.html">Carl Anthony</A> is a resident  fellow at Harvard University's Institute of
Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. Carl will spend the spring
leading a non-credit study group focused on environmental justice issues.

<A NAME="On"><H2>On the Web</H2>

 EII's presence on the worldwide web
continues to grow with more than 380 pages of on-line publishing (including
issues of the 
<A HREF="journal.html">Journal</A>; 
Race, Poverty & the Environment; 
<A HREF="../baikal/baikal.html">Baikal Currents</A>; 
<A HREF="../strp/strpindx.html">STRP</A> Newsletter and 
<A HREF="../immp/keiko.html">IMMP</A>'s Ocean Alert). In addition to these full-text publications,
EII's web site offers  simple-to-use, advanced 
<A HREF="/scripts/wwwwais/config=ei">search capabilities</A> (to find all
our information on dolphins, for example, just type the word "dolphins.") EII's
web page is registering 27,000 "hits" each month.

<A NAME="Bon"><H2>Bon Voyage</H2>

 Managing editor Justin Lowe, an eight-year veteran of <B>Earth Island
Journal</B>, has pulled up stakes and set off on a six-month tour of Asia. Assistant
editor John Sterling has accepted a new position reviewing grant proposals for
Patago-nia, the outdoor clothing manufacturer. EII would like to extend warm
thanks to both Justin and John for their support over the years and welcome
Journal intern <B>Charmaine Oakley</B> who has come on-board as the Journal's new
assistant editor.

<A NAME="Rarest"><H2>Rarest US Tree Is Dying</H2>

USA -- The Florida torreya, the rarest tree in North America, grows exclusively
along a short span of river flowing between Florida and Georgia. Nicknamed the
"stinking yew," after its foul-smelling needles, and closely related to the
taxol-yielding Pacific yew, the newsworthy torreya's population has been
falling since the 1950s. Plant biologists at Cornell University report that a
usually benign fungus called <I>Pestalotiopsis microspora</I> is ravaging the rare
trees, and the consequent die-off threatens the torreya with extinction.
Researchers are baffled as to the cause.

<A NAME="El"><H2>El Nino and Strandings</H2>

USA -- University of San Diego student Wendy Dunlap-Harding reviewed National
Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) data on California coast marine mammal
strandings from 1982 to 1992 and concluded that El Nino -- the oceanic weather
change -- drove sea lions ashore. In an average year, NMFS recorded fewer than
750 stranded sea lions, but when the warm waters of El Nino began to push
northward, the average number of stranded sea lions soared to 1750.
Dunlap-Harding theorized that warm water displaces supplies of cold-water fish
that marine mammals feed upon and forces the beaching-behavior on starving sea
lions.

<A NAME="Matter"><H2>A Matter of Taste</H2>

UK -- Many British environmentalists scorn sycamore trees as invasive pests
imported from the European mainland. But scientists at London's Roehampton
Institute have found a British subject that absolutely loves the sycamore --
the lowly dormouse. Dormice ordinarily are thought to be berry, nut and pollen
connoisseurs, but researchers discovered that this food vanishes by June,
leaving the dormice to survive on a diet of caterpillars, beetles and aphids.
And the best place to dine on insects? The sycamore tree.

<A NAME="Windsor"><H2>Windsor, Spare That Tree</H2>

UK -- Hundreds of trees along Queen Anne's Ride in Queen Elizabeth's Windsor
Great Park were saved from the ax last year, when scores of citizens, shocked
by the prospect of their destruction, trespassed onto royal land and took up
residence in the treetops. The royal ranger had intended to clearcut a one-mile
stretch of "untidy" trees -- some of them 275 years old -- and substitute a
neat row of 1000 saplings. HRH the Duke of Edinburgh bowed to the public outcry
and promised to protect the trees in the interests of biological diversity and
arboreal seniority.

<A NAME="Born"><H2>Born to Be Different?</H2>

USA -- In a study of 700 children, Harvard psychology professor Jerome Kagen
found that 20 percent of babies responded with fear when presented with new
stimuli (lights, bells, a new face). Two-thirds of these infants grew up to
become shy, right-brain-dominant children. Another 35 percent of the babies
welcomed new experiences and, by the age of three, most had become extroverted
left-brain-dominant "chatterboxes." If true, the difference between a happy,
novelty-seeking child and a wary, change-fearing child (and, perhaps, liberally
inclined vs. conservative-minded adults) may simply be the result of an
immutable biological imprint.

<A NAME="In"><H2>In Search of Mr. Chubby Toes</H2>

Indonesia -- While the abominable snowman, Sasquatch and Yeti, still elude
scientists, researchers claim to be closing in on <B>orang pendek</B>, the cagey
bipedal primate of West Sumatra. <B>BBC Wildlife</B> has published photos depicting
plaster casts of the pendek's unique footprints. Unlike any other primate, the
pendek's large toe is stepped-back, angling out sharply from a curved heel. The
pendek stands at least 1.2 meters (four feet) tall and sports a coat of short
buff-to-black body hair. Researchers at the Kerinei Seblat National Park have
identified several distinct footprints belonging to individuals they have named
"Marathon Man," "Mr. Burglar," "Newcomer" and "Chubby Toes."

<A NAME="Elephant"><H2>Elephant ER</H2>

Thailand -- The Western mindset has had a deadly impact on Thailand's
elephants. "For hundreds of years, men treated elephants as friends. Now that
relationship has been broken," veterinarian Preecha Puangkam told the
Associated Press. "People treat them like a car -- if it breaks down, they get
rid of it and get a new one." Puangkam, who runs an "elephant hospital" in
Lampang, reports treating growing numbers of elephants suffering from beatings,
festering wounds and overwork. At the turn of the century, 100,000 domesticated
elephants lumbered through Thailand's cities and villages, while hundreds of
thousands roamed free. Today there are fewer than 5000 domesticated elephants
and only 2000 in the wild. Friends of the Elephant reports that the domestic
population is sinking at a rate of 2-5 percent annually. Puangkam's elephant
hospital survives, in part, from donations sent by the producers of the 1995
Disney film, <B>Operation Dumbo Drop</B>.

<A NAME="Killer"><H2>Killer Whale Killer</H2>

USA -- A pod of killer whales caught in the 1989 <B>Exxon Valdez</B> oil spill is
dying a slow death. Before the Chevron tanker leaked 11 million gallons into
Prince William Sound, the pod numbered 36 whales. Today the pod has dwindled to
22. The deaths of females and juveniles has destroyed the pod's complex social
structure and surviving members now swim alone. Since the spill, the number of
harbor seals, the orcas' prey species, has fallen six percent each year.

<A NAME="Japan"><H2>Japan to Kill More Whales</H2>

Japan -- In 1994, when the International Whaling Commission created an
eight-million-square-mile whale sanctuary in the waters surrounding Antarctica,
Japan was the only IWC member to vote against the reserve. This February, Japan
ordered its whaling fleet to enter the sanctuary and slaughter 360-to-440 minke
whales -- a 33 percent increase over Japan's 1995 whale kill. The White House
has decided not to apply trade sanctions against Japan.

<A NAME="Bacteria"><H2>Bacteria Go Wild</H2>

The Netherlands -- Scientific experts assumed that the release of genetically
engineered biological pesticides was fairly safe -- believing that naturally
occurring biological pesticides were not capable of long-term survival in the
wild. Dutch studies now reveal that the popular biological pesticide <I>Bacillus
thuringiensis</I> (Bt) does not die within a few days, but can remain active a year
or more. Bt spores were found to thrive in both dead and living insects. "There
are no previous examples of the spores reproducing in living organisms," Dutch
researchers marveled. Because Bt sometimes resembles Bacillus cereus (a
bacteria that can cause diarrhoea) and Bacillus anthracis (which can cause
anthrax), Dutch authorities are calling for mandatory DNA testing before the
release of biological pesticides.

<A NAME="National"><H1>National Farm Bureau Backs Hemp</H1>

Via EcoNet -- The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), the largest farming
organization in the US, with 4.6 million members, unanimously passed a
resolution at its 77th annual convention in Reno, Nevada on January 10, that
reads: "We recommend that the American Farm Bureau Federation encourage
research into the viability and economic potential of industrial hemp
production in the US. We further recommend that such research include planting
test plots in the US using modern agricultural techniques."<P>

The AFBF's endorsement coincided with the introduction of the Industrial Hemp
Production Act in the Colorado state legislature. The Hemp Production Act (Bill
96-67), sponsored by Senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn), would allow regulated
cultivation of industrial (low-THC) hemp by Colorado farmers. The bill permits
planting no more than 40 acres of industrial hemp in Colorado in 1996 for
agricultural, commercial and scientific research. The bill would allow hemp
production to increase in subsequent years.<P>

Bob Winter, president of the Weld County Farm Bureau, is working with Colorado
State University to develop a research plan for producing the first hemp crop
in Colorado. International Paper, Masonite and Inland Container Corporation
have expressed interested in Colorado hemp as an alternative fiber source. Some
environmental groups view hemp as a viable alternative to trees for paper
manufacture.<P>

Industrial hemp production also has been endorsed by the Colorado Farm Bureau,
the Kentucky Farm Bureau and the Wisconsin Agribusiness Council.<P>

"The support of the American Farm Bureau Federation adds great credibility to
the industrial hemp movement. Hopefully, our state legislators will see the
economic potential of industrial hemp... and allow Colorado to become the first
state to produce hemp in the US in over 40 years," said Laura Kriho of the
Colorado Hemp Initiative Project [PO Box 729, Nederland, CO 80466; (303)
784-5632].

<A NAME="Read"><H1>I Read the News Today, Oh Boy</H1>

In January, the cost of home delivery for San Francisco's two daily papers
jumped nine percent. Announcing the price increases, the <B>San Francisco Examiner</B>
and <B>Chronicle</B> jointly explained that "after salaries, newsprint is the largest
expense for American newspapers. [The papers] consume about 100,000 tons of
newsprint each year. Two years ago, a metric ton of newsprint cost $437. Today,
it costs $811 -- an increase of 85 percent." <B>San Francisco Chronicle</B> business
reporter Herb Greenberg explained the root cause of the rising costs: "Paper
producers are running out of virgin forests and, in the past half-dozen years,
a number of newsprint plants have shut down." Has the cost of your newspaper
gone up in the past year? If so, contact <A HREF="mailto:rtp@earthisland.org">Rethink Paper</A> at Earth Island
Institute for information about non-wood paper alternatives.

<HR>

<A NAME="Plant"><H1>Plant Kenaf and Help Us Plant Trees!</H1>

Celebrate Earth Day 1996 by planting  kenaf, a fast-growing, annual African
plant that can grow as high as 15 feet in five months. Earth Island Journal is
the only US magazine printed on  tree-free paper made from kenaf.<P>

The Journal provides seed packets, an eight-page Grower's Guide and background
information on kenaf for a minimum donation of $3. The donations are used by
the Journal's Green Pages Fund to plant trees throughout the world.<P>

To date, Green Pages donations have helped plant trees in Kenya, Haiti, Costa
Rica, Nicaragua, Mexico, Papua New Guinea and India.<P>

To order a Kenaf Seed Kit, send a check to "Green Pages Fund" c/o EIJ, 300

<A NAME="Free"><H2>Free Trade Gasses Clean Air</H2>

Geneva -- The World Trade Organization (WTO), successor to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), issued its first-ever ruling by a
dispute-settlement panel on January 18, finding that the US Clean Air Act
constituted a restraint to free trade. Oil companies in Venezuela and Brazil
had complained that US Clean Air Act regulations interfered with their ability
to sell their dirtier petroleum products on the US market. According to Trade
News, "The WTO panel said that, while the US had every right to set its own
environmental standards, it was in breach of fair trade rules by discriminating
against imports." Under the WTO ruling, the US must either lower its air
quality standards or face unspecified trade sanctions. US trade rep. Mickey
Kantor (a pro-Free-Trader who stubbornly insisted that such an anti-US ruling
would be unlikely), has vowed to appeal the ruling. (While he is at it, perhaps
Kantor could also lodge a WTO complaint against foreign fruit importers who
insist that US produce be treated with the soil fumigant methyl bromide.)

<A NAME="Carrot"><H2>The Carrot and the Celery Stick</H2>

USA -- During his 18 years in the Senate, Jim Sasser repeatedly voted against
granting China "most-favored-nation" trading status because of its poor human
rights record. Now US ambassador to China,  Jim Sasser pragmatically is placing
corporate need before human rights by  supporting trade with China. "When we
trade with China, we do more than sell them goods," Sasser argues. "Some of our
values and some of our customs and some of our culture goes with it." This,
Sasser says, is the best way to assure that China will "ultimately conform...
to our definition of human rights." (Among the culture-altering US goods that
Sasser is pushing in China -- cars and nuclear reactors.)

<A NAME="Britannia"><H2>Britannia Waives the Rules</H2>

UK -- Britain's reputation as a haven for political dissidents took a hit in
January when the government's Home Office ordered the deportation of Mohammed
Masari, a leading critic of the oil-rich Saudi Arabian monarchy. Explaining the
order to deport Masari to the Caribbean island of Dominica, Home Office
minister Ann Widdecombe said simply, "We have got enormous export
considerations." In December, the Saudi royal family threatened to halt new
contracts with UK firms unless Masari was expelled. Parliament member George
Galloway called Britain's capitulation "a sordid act of obeisance to the arms
dealers in Britain and the dictators in Riyadh." UK firms provide the Saudi
monarchs with $7.77 billion worth of arms.

<A NAME="Neem"><H2>Neem Tree Patent Blocked</H2>

India -- In 1993, the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Natural
Resource Policy [New Delhi-110 016, India] launched a campaign against plans by
WR Grace, a US multinational, to acquire a patent on the neem, a tree with many
healing properties. The campaign collected over a million signatures of
individuals from all walks of life opposed to patenting the tree. The neem is a
cultural and religious symbol in India, and its use is part of every home's
daily routine. The US-based Foundation for Economic Trends has joined forces
with Indian campaigners to challenge WR Grace's neem patents in the US Patent
Office. In the closing days of 1995, India's hotly debated Patent Amendment
Bill failed to clear the Upper House of the Parliament. The bill's failure
means that Indian laws will not be changed to protect transnational
corporations. [Note: A Conference on Genetic Engineering in Food and
Agriculture, is scheduled for May 24-25 at Ft. Mason Center in San Francisco,
CA. For more information, call; (415) 522-0352]

<A NAME="Computers"><H2>Computers Cause Urban Sprawl</H2>

USA -- Last September, Republican budget-cutters bludgeoned the Congressional
Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) out of existence. During its 23-year
span, OTA research provided timely warnings about the downside of chemical,
industrial and medical technologies. The OTA's final report, "The Technological
Reshaping of Metropolitan America," issued a surprising warning that new
information technologies could torpedo urban economies and accelerate suburban
sprawl.<P>

Since employers now can use computers to export work to distant terminals, a
new "footloose economy" will arise, making metropolitan areas "larger, more
dispersed and less densely populated." The OTA's report claimed that the
"information highway" threatens to have the same impact on the core city that
the federal Interstate Highway System had in the 1950s -- it will subsidize
sprawl and encourage the middle-class to abandon the inner city.

<A NAME="Merge"><H2>Merge, Merge, Merge</H2>

USA -- The US set a record for corporate mergers in 1995 with 9008 business
"marriages" -- up nearly 400 percent over the previous year. The Associated
Press reports that the average deal topped $51 million. It was a great year for
US banks, as well. Citicorp earned $3.46 billion, Chemical Banking Corp. netted
$1.8 billion, Wells Fargo earned $1 billion and First Interstate Bancorp took
in $885.1 million. First Interstate might have done better but it wound up
being swallowed by Wells Fargo in a $11.6 billion hostile takeover. As part of
its assault on First Interstate, Wells Fargo placed a full page ad on January
17, claiming that it had "committed $45 billion to community reinvestment
lending over the next ten years, contingent upon a merger with First Interstate
Bank." (Just a friendly reminder, Wells Fargo.)

<A NAME="Purge"><H2>Purge, Purge, Purge</H2>

USA -- In 1995, worker  benefits and wages fell three percent  below 1994
levels, marking the smallest gain since the US began keeping records in 1982.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that half of the  workforce is forced to
find a  new  job every four years. Workers lucky enough to find new  jobs take
an average 14 percent drop in wages. "Labor is not in a position to argue,"
observed Robert G. Dederick, a consultant for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
Princeton economist Henry Farber found that more men (15 percent) lost jobs
during the 1991-93 economic recovery than during the 1981-83 recession. While
slack work is the main cause of job loss during a recession, the new tide of
unemployment results from "abolished positions," the  result of corporate
"restructuring" and "down-sizing" required by  the "globalized economy." In
January, US companies fired 97,379 employees, one of the largest monthly
layoffs in history. Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an international outplacement
firm, predicts that "worse could be in store this year as more companies  merge
and slash redundant employees."

<A NAME="Welcome"><H2>Welcome to McPlanet</H2>

USA -- In 1995, a new McDonald's restaurant opened somewhere on Earth every 17
hours. Now McDonald's Corp. plans to double its global restaurant expansion to
eight restaurants per day over the next two years -- i.e., a new restaurant
every three hours. McDonald's wants to open 2500 to 3200 restaurants in 1996
and 1997. Between 1800 and 2200 will take traditional restaurant form --
approximately two-thirds of these will be built outside the US. The remaining
700 to 1000 will comprise satellite restaurants in airports, retail stores and
gas stations (40 percent to be built abroad). McDonald's currently operates
more than 18,000 restaurants in 89 countries.

<A NAME="Kassel"><H2>Kassel Burgers Bite Back</H2>

Germany -- A German court has ruled that McDonald's must pay an anti-rubbish
tax on disposable dishes, cans and packaging.  The fast-food giant challenged
the tax, first levied two years ago in the city of Kassel, on the grounds that
it would swallow up to 80 percent of McDonald's profits. Unmoved by the plea,
the court upheld the tax, noting that each McDonald's generates 60 tons of
plastic rubbish a year.  The Australian publication <B>New Vegetarian</B> reports that
McDonald's already owes the city 800,000 Deutschmarks in back taxes.

<A NAME="Suit"><H2>The Suit Is on the Other Foot</H2>

South Africa -- Britain's Sky News reports that when McDonald's attempted to
open two new restaurants in South Africa, it ran into an unusual (for
McDonald's) obstacle -- a trademark lawsuit. During the apartheid years, the
corporation allowed its South Africa trademark to lapse. Two local entrepeneurs
snapped it up and opened their own fast food restaurant called McDonald's --
complete with golden arches. A South African supreme court judge has ruled that
McDonald's failed to re-register its trademark properly and had, therefore,
forfeited the right to use it. According to <B>The Financial Times</B>, Ron McDonald
has found a ready ally in the person of US commerce secretary Ron Brown, who
reminded South African officials that more than 230 US companies have invested
in South Africa and warned that future investments could be jeopardized unless
the trademark issue was resolved.

<A NAME="Ronald"><H2>Ronald's Secret Agents</H2>

UK -- In 1995, the McLibel Trial, a mammoth legal battle between the $26
billion a year McDonald's Corporation and two unemployed London activists,
became the longest civil case in British history. McDonald's filed suit over a
leaflet entitled "What's Wrong With McDonald's?"<P>

According to the British magazine <B>Private Eye</B>, McDonald's recruited seven
"agents" to infiltrate London Greenpeace (not affiliated with the well-known
environmental group) in hopes of thwarting the anti-McDonald's leaflet
campaign.<P>

At its peak, the activist group claimed only ten members. The spys, to disguise
their identity, threw themselves  into the anti-McDonald's campaign, even
agreeing to hand out the leaflets that became the subject of the libel
complaint. Private Eye opines that this may be the first case in libel history
where a company has sued over material  distributed by its own agents.

<A NAME="BBC"><H2>BBC Censors Vandana Shiva</H2>

UK (Via EcoNet)  -- In January, BBC Radio 4 invited Vandana Shiva, director of
The Research Foundation for Science and Ecology, to discuss the effects of
multinational corporations on India's farmers, environment and culture.<P>

The night before the program was to air, BBC lawyers, fearing libel suits,
informed Shiva that they would not allow her to speak -- even after she offered
not to mention any companies by name.<P>

"This is an illustration of the insidious nature of Britain's libel laws,"
claimed the McLibel Support Campaign. "Large organizations, like McDonald's,
take advantage of this by threatening to sue at every opportunity."

<A NAME="McDonald"><H2>McDonald's is Scared Shirtless</H2>

USA -- Last October, McDonald's demanded that Vegan Action (VA), a national
nonprofit educational organization, "immediately cease manufacturing and sale"
of their popular McVegan T-Shirt design, citing trademark infringement law.
McDonald's abruptly decided to withdraw its threats after Vegan Action went
public with news of the impending suit. One of the main issues stressed by VA
is that McDonald's uses its logo, its mascot Ronald McDonald and its cast of
cartoon characters to market a high-fat, junk-food diet directly to young
children. McDonald's clearly does not want to see a serious public debate on
these important issues.<P>

During a victory party held at Smart Alec's Healthy Fast Food Restaurant, in
Berkeley, California, VA's mascot, Reggie McVeggie, handed out complimentary
veggie burgers.<P>

VA Coordinator Leor Jacobi expressed relief that, "Now that this nonsense from
McDonald's is over, we can continue with our  vital  mission,  enhancing public
awareness about the many benefits of a vegan diet. This is a victory for
everyone concerned with the public's health."<P>

<H3>What You Can Do</H3>

Vegan Action can provide props, literature, signs, stickers
and veggie burgers to pass out at your local McDonald's franchise. VA can
arrange a meeting between Ronald and Reggie McVeggie. Contribute $35 or more to
 VA's campaign and receive a McVegan T-shirt and a campaign packet. Contact

<A NAME="McSpotlight"><H2>McSpotlight Hits the Web</H2>

UK -- On February 16, McLibel defendants Dave Morris and Helen Steel launched
the McSpotlight World Wide Web site [http://www.mcspotlight.org/] from the
street in front of McDonald's London office, using a cellular phone/modem
connected to the Internet.<P>

McSpotlight, the most comprehensive database on a multinational corporation
ever assembled, was compiled by a huge team of volunteers working in 14
different countries.<P>

McSpotlight's founders claim that the web-site will drive "the final nail
in[to] the coffin of McDonald's attempts to suppress criticism. They cannot
hide the truth any more."<P>

With the power of the Internet, advertising budgets no longer are the
restraining factors dictating how far a message can be heard. McSpotlight
potentially could reach 70 million people across the globe with everything that
McDonald's doesn't want the public to know.

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: US-Canada "Free-Trade Freeway"</TITLE>

<H1>US-Canada "Free-Trade Freeway"</H1>
<H2>by Randy Ghent/APM</H2>

USA -- On November 20, 1995, a consortium of highway developers led by
Washington, DC-based Transportation Industries International (TII) unveiled its
plan to build a massive 370-mile, four-lane, heavy-freight toll road from
Winni-peg, Manitoba to Duluth, Minnesota.<P>

The $1.3 billion project proposes the first truck-only route in North America.
The route would permit Canadian grain now shipped to Thunder Bay, Ontario to
cross the border into Duluth.<P>

James Ball, president of TII, called the project "an innovation that could very
easily spread continent-wide." He plans to propose similar projects elsewhere.<P>

The Alliance for a Paving Moratorium   has launched a campaign to stop the toll
road, which APM calls "an environmental, health and safety nightmare."<P>

The toll road would displace wetlands, farms and local landowners. Under the
banner of "eminent domain," developers could seize any property in the toll
road's path after offering "just compensation." By creating a wildlife
migration barrier, the road would threaten the integrity of the "Minnesota
Biosphere Recovery Strategy" formulated by conservation biologists.<P>

The road would increase safety hazards by doubling the weight limit on US
interstates and allowing quadruple-trailer trucks. Project backers also have
declared: "Our goal is never to allow the highway to be closed by inclement
weather."<P>

According to Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways, a US automobile-driver
advocacy group, "crash rates increase when the weight of the truck increases.
Trucks that weigh 65,000 pounds are involved in more than twice as many fatal
crashes as trucks weighing 35,000 to 50,000 pounds. Very long trucks pose a
hazard, because they cannot turn safely and are liable to incur more severe
crashes." In 1990, the fatality rate of combination trucks
per-billion-ton-miles was nearly four times greater than that of freight
railroads.<P>

Use of the new highway, instead of the current railroad system, would increase
petroleum dependence and air pollution. Oak Ridge National Laboratory research
shows that trucks consume about eight times more energy than trains. Compared
to freight trains, trucks emit three times the nitrogen oxide and carbon
monoxide, and ten times the volatile organic compounds and diesel particulates
per-billion-ton-miles. Because Canada has been cutting its rail subsidies,
highway developers see the toll road as an opportunity to further undermine
rail's share of the grain-shipping market.<P>

"Developers cannot remedy the scheme's disastrous social and environmental
effects, so we all suffer as they get a fossil-fueled free lunch," said APM
founder Jan Lundberg.<P>

Expenditures to defend US oil supplies cost taxpayers $15 billion per year, or
$23.50 per barrel, Lundberg explained. Similarly, the US-Canada toll road would
be impossible without $690 million in Minnesota state and US federal loans,
available with five percent interest and delayed-debt servicing.<P>

In addition to forging ties with citizens' groups in communities along the
proposed route, the APM has sent letters to more than 200 Minnesota officials
citing the project's risks and requesting local vetoes. Under Minnesota law,
each city and county along the route has veto power over the project.<P>

"We should invest in rail for the long term, instead of wasting money and
increasingly scarce petroleum on destructive modes of shipping," Lundberg said.
"It's foolish to fund and build new roads with government assistance when we
can't even afford to maintain the roads we've got."<P>

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: US Fast-Food Giants Rock India</TITLE>

<H1>US Fast-Food Giants Rock India</H1>

India (Via EcoNet) -- US-based McDonald's plans to open several stores in
Bombay and Delhi this spring. Unable to promote beef burgers in a country that
reveres cows, McDonald's instead will sell mutton burgers. The sheep meat will
come from Al Kabeer abattoir near Hyderabad, India. Al Kabeer, Asia's largest
meat-packer, kills about 5000 animals per day.<P>

US-owned Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC is, in turn, owned by PepsiCo) hopes to
invest $40 million to open a chain of its restaurants across India. Last year,
when KFC opened its first outlet in a Delhi suburb,  a coalition of farmers,
vegetarians and environmentalists immediately besieged the restaurant.<P>

Local officials closed a KFC shop in Bangalore after excessive levels of
monosodium glutamate were found in KFC chicken. In response, the New Delhi
government announced that national health standards would be rewritten to allow
higher amounts of MSG in Indian food.<P>

On January 30, more than 100 irate farmers stormed the reopened Bangalore
restaurant, smashed windows and demanded that KFC leave India. The protesters,
from the ten-million-member Karna-taka Rajya Ryotha Sangha (KRRS) Indian
farmers' union, contend that foreign fast-food chains will degrade India's
culture, agriculture and environment.<P>

Scores of farmers were jailed and charged with looting, despite the testimony
of an anonymous KFC employee, who reported that no equipment was damaged,
nobody was injured and no money was stolen.<P>

On February 3, KRRS' 62-year-old founder, Prof. MD Nanjundaswamy, was jailed,
denied bail and charged with looting, attempted murder and other offenses,
although he was not even present during the farmers' protest.<P>

The farmers maintain that multinational entry into the food sector threatens
the livelihoods of more than 70 percent of the Indian population and is the
first step toward destruction of India's food security. One of the worst
aspects of fast-food chains, KRRS claimed, is KFC's introduction of large-scale
factory-farming of chickens.<P>

KFC  plans to open six outlets in Delhi by this year. However, the company's
ride will not be easy. In fact, India could be the first place where the
expansion of multinational fast-food chains is halted.<P>

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: "Bangladesh Effect" Hits US</TITLE>

<H1>"Bangladesh Effect" Hits US</H1>

Last September, the prestigious Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
concluded that Earth's weather is changing and that human activities -- most
prominently the burning of fossil fuels and the cutting of forests -- are the
cause. According to the <B>New York Times</B>, climate change will bring "widespread
economic, social and environmental dislocation...."<P>

In recent years, the world's cities have been pummeled by violent snowstorms,
floodwaters, tornadoes and  blistering temperatures. Summer heat killed 300 in
Chicago; winter snows from Vermont to Georgia buried millions. The number of
Atlantic hurricanes doubled in the last year; tornadoes have increased
five-fold since the 1950s.<P>

On January 22, <B>Newsweek</B> boldly linked the winter's massive snowstorms to
"catastrophic global warming" and indicated that the future promised "more
floods, worse hurricanes, longer droughts and, yes, heat waves."<P>

1995 was the year that the "Bangladesh Effect" hit the US. As torrential rains
pounded the continent, mountainsides stripped of forest cover began to move. In
January, British Colom-bia's logging-ravaged Clayoquot Sound suffered 260
landslides during a single four-day storm.<P>

President Clinton rushed $65 million in flood aid to Oregon, Washington and
Idaho. By February of 1995, Clinton had issued only one weather-related
disaster declaration; by the second month of 1996, Clinton had issued 27.<P>


For the first time in history, Portland's water supply  became undrinkable as
mud spilled into the Bull Run watershed off hills that have lost a third of
their forests to logging in the last 33 years.<P>

Winter mudslides brought together forest activists and politicians, who
demanded an end to the "timber salvage" rider. The timber industry has used
"salvage" logging as a pretext to cut both dead and living trees in US forests.
Even President Clinton now admits that signing the bill was a mistake.<P>

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: Ecologists Buy Ecosystems</TITLE>

<H1>Ecologists Buy Ecosystems</H1>

<H2> by Brian Vincent, NWEA</H2>

Via EcoNet -- Conservationists are employing a surprising new tactic to keep
cattle off sensitive lands and timber-cutters out of forests -- outbidding
ranchers and loggers for federal grazing permits and timber sales on public
bids.<P>

Last October, the Northwest Ecosystem Alliance [NWEA, PO Box 2813, Bellingham,
Washington 98227; (360) 671-9950;  <A HREF="mailto:bvincent-@pacificrim.net">bvincent-@pacificrim.net</A>] submitted a sealed
contract bid for the Thunder Salvage timber sale offered in Washington state's
Oka-nogan National Forest. NWEA offered $4.25 per board foot of timber -- one
penny higher than the minimum acceptable bid of $4.24 -- for the right to keep
the trees standing. The US Forest Service rejected the bid, claiming that it
had been sent to the wrong address. The <B>Omak-Okanogan County Chronicle</B> reported
that the USFS later admitted that it would have had a "very difficult time
awarding them [NWEA] the sale."<P>

The Thunder Salvage sale would involve constructing new roads and  logging 3.5
million board feet of timber from one of the largest undeveloped areas
remaining in Washington state. USFS studies state that logging could jeopardize
imperiled salmon runs and rare species, such as lynx. But conservationists
cannot challenge the project on environmental grounds, because of the "logging
without laws" rider, passed last August.<P>

Like most USFS timber sales, Thunder Mountain will cost the government far more
than it will generate in revenues. Planning alone has already cost the USFS
well over $200,000, whereas the minimum bid will gross the government only
$15,000 -- less than a tenth of its costs -- or about 30 cents per tree.<P>

"The Forest Service is managing our forest like a soup kitchen for timber
companies, so we've come to take our place in line," said Mitch Friedman, NWEA
Executive Director. "The $15,000 we're offering is a great deal for the public,
since we promise not to cut the trees or ask for additional federal hand-outs
for road construction and replanting."<P>

According to NWEA ecologist Evan Frost, "Those trees are worth far more
standing -- to protect wildlife, soils, water quality and fisheries -- than
what the Forest Service is asking to cut them down. The least the Forest
Service can do is sell us the timber and prevent the environmental damage that
would come with salvage logging."<P>

On December 20, at an auction held at Okanogan National Forest headquarters,
NWEA was declared the highest bidder for contract rights to the Thunder Salvage
timber sale. This marked the first time in the history of the National Forest
system that a party apparently has won rights to a timber sale with no intent
to cut the trees.<P>

NWEA's winning bid of $8.25 per thousand board feet beat out three competing
timber companies and actually doubled the government's profit to about 60 cents
per tree.<P>

"It was like a post-Christmas sale at Walmart, with public forests at bargain
prices," said NWEA's Friedman. "The Forest Service is playing Santa to the
timber industry, but Grinch to taxpayers. You can't blame us for shopping a
bargain -- we, at least, will pay our money, but leave the trees and wildlife
habitat intact."<P>

Meanwhile, in New Mexico, Forest Guardians and the Southwest Environmental
Center successfully bid on 2078 acres of state trust lands in the Rio Embudo
region in 1995. The two environmental groups have also gone after leases
traditionally held by ranchers on lands administered by New Mexico's Land
Office. These lands represent some of the most imperiled ecosystems in the
southwest. Transferring the management of thousands of acres of overgrazed land
to environmental groups would allow for the restoration of habitat degraded by
years of livestock-grazing.<P>

"We believe removing cattle is the only way to restore these once-rich
ecosystems," stated Forest Guardian's John Horning. In February, Horning
informed the <B>Journal</B> that Forest Guardians [612 Old Santa Fe Trail, Suite B,
Santa Fe, NM 87501; (505) 988-9126; <A HREF="mailto:fguardians@igc.apc.org">fguardians@igc.apc.org</A>] had won the rights
to four new parcels but "rancher pressure" had blocked nine other conservation
bids. "Cowboy socialism still reigns supreme in the Old West," Horning
declared. But insurgent eco-capitalism is starting to turn the tables.<P>

<TITLE>Spring 96 Journal: Holy Humanure! by Sara Chamberlain</TITLE>

<H1>Holy Humanure!</H1>

<H2>by Sara Chamberlain</H2>

Joseph Jenkins describes Americans as "phecophobes" -- people afraid of their
own excrement. Jenkins, the author of <B>The Humanure Handbook</B> [PO Box 607, Grove
City, PA 16127], argues that flushing "humanure" (feces and urine) down the
toilet not only wastes an "essential and critical agricultural resource," but
also needlessly pollutes the environment. Jen-kins, who is privy to a great
deal of practical experience, notes that humanure, properly composted, is an
excellent, free source of soil-enriching nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous
for home fertilizer use.<P>

With each flush of the toilet, Americans waste five-to-six gallons of drinking
water -- five billion gallons a day. Every year, Americans flush 1.4 billion
pounds of nitrogen, 456 million pounds of potassium and 194 million pounds of
phosphorous into septic tanks and sewer pipes. Each year, wastewater treatment
in the US employs 1.2 billion pounds of chlorine -- a known human carcinogen
and fish mutagen.<P>

If Americans composted humanure instead of dumping it into drinking water,
pollution could be curbed, water saved and soil fertility improved. Jenkins
cautions, however, that "raw humanure carries with it a significant danger in
the form of... pathogens," such as intestinal parasites, harmful bacteria and
viruses. Fortunately, a composting process that employs heat-producing
microorganisms to digest organic materials can raise temperatures significantly
above that of the human body and destroy the pathogens.<P>

The <B>Humanure Handbook</B> clearly explains, in a breezy, amusing and
well-illustrated format,
everything- you- need- to- know- to- bring- the- out-house- in-house. The Jenkins family
has been composting its wastes since 1971 -- collecting humanure in a
five-gallon bucket under a toilet seat in the bathroom and covering it with
sawdust to eliminate odors. Every couple of days, they add a fresh bucket of
humanure to their compost pile and cover it with leaves or straw. The compost
rapidly produces a fine, dark, disease-free humus to fertilize the vegetable
garden.<P>

The "moldering method," another composting technique, involves the slow, cool
decomposition of excrement in a sealed receptacle. Excrement -- covered with
sawdust, leaves, dolomite (calcium) and ashes to eliminate odors -- is left
undisturbed for a number of years. Although this passive composting method
destroys most pathogens in about three months, it may not kill all of them,
which makes it inappropriate as fertilizer on food crops.<P>

Jenkins concludes that we must overcome our phecophobia and follow the example
of the Chinese, who cultivate "night soil" as an art form and "give prizes for
the best compost in a county, then have inter-county competitions," or the
Taiwanese, whose appreciation for humanure makes this natural fertilizer a hot
commodity on the black market.

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: To Burn or Not to Burn?</TITLE>

<H2>To Burn or Not to Burn?<BR>
By Bill Stern</H2>

Some 30,000 tons of chemical weapons currently are stockpiled on eight US
military bases, with smaller amounts scattered in more than 30 states, and an
additional 45,000 tons stored in the former Soviet Union. Left over from every
international conflict from WW I to Vietnam, these weapons contain HD (mustard
gas), VX, GB-sarin, GD-soman and GA-tabun (all nerve agents). Under a joint
US-Russian agreement, these weapons (which are capable of killing the entire
human population many times over) are to be destroyed by the year 2004.<P>

Some of the aging stockpile of US chemical weapons -- rockets, bombs and
artillery projectiles -- have already shown signs of leakage. If chemicals
seeping from an M55 rocket were to reach a neighboring chamber containing
explosives, the interaction could trigger an explosion in a bunker containing
hundreds of rockets and set off a chain reaction.<P>

While both countries agree that these weapons should be destroyed as quickly as
possible, controversy surrounds the methods of disposal. The US Army destroyed
4000 tons of GB-sarin through chemical neutralization experiments between 1972
and 1976, but in the process produced a greater tonnage of toxic chemical salts
containing traces of the nerve agent. This line of research has been abandoned.<P>

In 1979, the Army built a pilot incineration plant at Tooele, Utah. Despite
inconclusive results, the Army chose incineration as the primary means of
carrying out its Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program.<P>

Since 1982, the incineration program has been plagued with problems, not the
least of which has been the growth of cost estimates from $1.7 billion in 1985
to more than $11 billion in 1995. The first full-scale incineration program,
conducted at Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, experienced extensive technical
problems, including parts failures, a fire, an explosion and nerve gas
releases.<P>

Despite these problems, the Army continues to assure Congress that incineration
is safe and effective, and has built a second large incinerator in Tooele. This
facility has yet to begin operation, due largely to the whistleblowing of its
chief of safety, Steve Jones, who compiled a list of 119 specific safety
problems. As Jones complained to <B>The New York Times</B>, "It's just an unsafe
design."<P>

Nonetheless, the Army has received $134 million to start building a chemical
weapons incinerator at the Anniston Army Depot in Alabama and $13 million for
incinerator construction design at Umatilla, Oregon and Pine Bluff, Arkansas.
Lawsuits and permit acquisition likely will delay construction.<P>

Communities near incineration facilities increasingly have banded together to
protest predicted releases of dioxins, furans and unburned agents. The Army has
no information on the effects of the long-term release of trace amounts of
nerve gas on human populations. Locals also fear that once the weapons are
gone, the Army will ignore its promise to dismantle the incinerators and
instead bring in other toxic wastes to burn.<P>

Fortunately, research into disposal alternatives has advanced. In 1991,
Greenpeace produced a report citing 28 disposal methods that promised to be
cheaper and safer than incineration. Lobbying by the Chemical Weapons Working
Group convinced Congress and the Army to consider alternatives to incineration.
In 1995, research at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground revealed that the
addition of near-boiling water and sewer sludge induced microbial activity that
completely broke down the mustard gas. Now the Army is considering building a
pilot plant that uses this technique. Researchers also found that simply adding
room-temperature water to VX and allowing it to sit for 50 days resulted in
near-complete breakdown, producing only non-lethal byproducts.<P>

Activists also are urging the Army to adopt the technique of weapons
"recom-position." This process minimizes the danger of explosions by separating
the agents from their aging containers and adding water or other catalysts to
begin their breakdown. The stabilized chemicals are then placed in new
containers. Recompo-sition renders the chemicals useless as weapons while
allowing more time for the research and testing of alternative disposal
methods. Recomposition is relatively inexpensive and is technically much
simpler than incineration, and thus has less potential for human error and
mechanical failure -- unlike incineration technology, which rivals nuclear
energy in its complexity and potential for failure.<P>

Russia has also built an incinerator, but public protests prevent it from
operating. While the country has disposed of some 120,000 tons of chemical
weapons, sometimes unsafely and haphazardly, it has no comprehensive disposal
plan. Russian scientists reportedly oppose importing US incineration
technology.<P>

A joint US-Russian scientific team is now exploring a number of simpler,
cheaper, safer and more effective treatment options, including low-temperature,
chemical and pressure-neutralization techniques. It remains to be seen if this
news will reach US and Russian decision-makers.

<H2>What You Can Do</H2>

Write Congress requesting funding for the recomposition of chemical weapons,
continued research into neutralization and a neutralization pilot plant; ask
for a halt to the incinerator boondoggle. For more information, contact the

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: The Rise of the Independent Nation of Hawai'i</TITLE>

<H2>The Rise of the Independent Nation of Hawai'i</H2>

<H3>January 15, 1893: A Date that will Live in Infamy</H3>

On January 15, 1873, two Americans, John Schofield and B. S. Alexander, arrived
in the sovereign republic of Hawai'i for a two-month "pleasure excursion."
Though their true mission was not revealed for 25 year, both men were Army
generals sent by US Secretary of War Belknap to map Pearl Harbor and evaluate
its military and commercial potential.<P>

The generals liked what they saw. US Minister to Hawai'i John Stevens
subsequently advised US Secretary of State Hamilton Fish that the US would be
able to "annex" the 132-island chain if "... the planters, merchants, and
foreigners... will induce the people to overthrow the [Hawaiian] government,
establish a republic, and then ask the United States for admittance into its
Union."<P>

The story of the secret US plot to overthrow the Hawai'ian monarchy is told in
Rich Budnick's richly illustrated book, <B>Stolen Kingdom: An American Conspiracy</B>
(Aloha Press, PO Box 4183, Honolulu, HI 96812). Seizing Hawai'i was a logical
extension of the racist doctrine of Manifest Destiny. As Republican Secretary
of State James Blaine saw it "The decline of the native Hawaiian element in the
presence of newer and sturdier growths must be accepted as an inevitable
fact...." Turning Hawai'i into a white-run empire would, in Blaine's view, assure
"replenishment of the vital forces of Hawai'i...."<P>

A group of powerful US, Canadian and European landholders organized a secret
"Hawai'ian League" to topple the reign-ing government and establish themselves
as Hawai'i's new rulers. As one of the league's sugar-barons put it, the new
government would assure "the rights of the white people...."<P>

In 1892, Stevens warned that Hawai'i had reached "the parting of the ways. She
must now take the road which leads to Asia, or the other, which outlets her in
America... and binds her to the care of American destiny." On January 4, 1893,
the <B>USS Boston</B> steamed off of Honolulu for ten days of "target practice" with
US Minister Stevens aboard, ostensibly enjoying a "vacation."<P>

On January 16, Stevens ordered US troops ashore "to protect American lives and
property." The next day, fearing loss of lives and the bombardment of the
Iolani Palace, Queen Lili'uokalani yielded to the US demand for abdication.
Stevens promptly appointed an 18-member provisional government -- 15 of them
Americans, none of them native Hawai'ians.<P>

In her statement of surrender, however, Lili'uokalani chose her words
carefully. She accepted her fate "under protest" and yielded her authority only
"until such time as the government of the United States shall, upon the facts
being presented to it, undo the actions of its representatives...."<P>

One hundred years later, Lili'uokalani's request for a fair hearing was
granted. In 1993, the US Congress held hearings and passed Public Law 103-150,
which acknowledged that "American and European sugar planters... and financiers
deposed the Hawai'ian monarchy" abetted by John Stevens who "caused armed naval
forces of the United States to invade the sovereign Hawai'ian nation...." PL
103-150 acknowledged that the invasion largely destroyed an Indigenous culture
characterized by "a highly organized, self-sufficient, subsistent social system
based on communal land tenure...."<P>

The law also offered an apology "on behalf of the people of the United States
for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai'i on January 17, 1893" and directed
the president of the US to "acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow."
Under international law, the ramifications are quite clear.<P>

In 1994, 400 Native Hawai'ians gathered at the Iolani Palace and cheered as
Iaukea Bright of the Ohana Council declared, "The <I>kanaka maoli</I> [Hawai'ian
people] proclaim our right of self-determination as a people in accordance
with... the United Nations Charter."<P>

The Hawai'ian sovereignty movement continues to grow, with hundreds of
sometimes competing native support groups calling for self-rule. One of
thesegroups is the Nation of Hawai'i [Executive Office, PO Box 80, Waimanalo,
O'ahu, Hawai'i] which, on January 16, 1995, ratified a new Hawai'ian
Constitution that contains a fundamental environmental component. The preamble
pledges to "maintain our spiritual relationship with nature and all our
surroundings, in universal harmony, for the rights of humanity, in peace, love
and understanding." The Constitution also enshrines a citizen's right to "a
healthy and sustainable environment" and calls for "a nuclear-free and
independent Pacific."<P>

Pu'uhonua Kanahele, the Nation of Hawai'i's appointed leader, realizes that
"the restoration of peace in paradise" is still a dream, but points proudly to
a September 8, 1994 White House letter in which President Clinton wrote: "I
share your interest in <I>malama pono</I> -- universal balance -- and I want to do what
is right with respect to native Hawai'ians...."<P>

The letter is addressed to "The Honorable Pu'uhonua Kanahele, Head of State of
Hawai'i."<BR>-- GS

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: Exxon vs. Wisconsin's Chippewa</TITLE>

<H1>Exxon vs. Wisconsin's Chippewa</H1>

<H2>By Rose Palmer</H2>

For the last 20 years, Exxon Minerals Company of Texas has dreamed of building
a zinc and copper mine in Wisconsin's North Woods, just a mile from the
Chippewa Mole Lake Reservation. From the beginning, the Sokaogon (pronounced
so-COG-in) Chippewa, Wisconsin's smallest Indian tribe, have resisted Exxon's
plans, arguing that the mine would poison their land and water.<P>

"We're the canary for the rest of the nation," said Chippewa Fred Ackley. "Our
people who eat the fish and deer meat are getting poisoned first. When will I
have to shut down my drinking well and say it's contaminated?"<P>

In 1975, the Chippewa's resistance to Exxon gave birth to the Watershed
Alliance to End Environmental Racism (WATER), a historic Indian-environmental
alliance. As University of Wisconsin professor Al Gedicks noted in his book <B>The
New Resource Wars</B>, this alliance brought a "new level of political organization
and resistance" to the native rights struggle that challenged "the unquestioned
assumptions of global industrialization and the inevitable disappearance of
native subsistence cultures."<P>

The Chippewa's opposition, combined with depressed mineral prices, derailed
plans for the mine until 1993, when Exxon and Rio Algom, a Canadian mining
company, formed the Crandon Mining Company and resumed vigorously pursuing the
project.<P>

On Exxon's side are business leaders and top state politicians led by
Republican Governor Tommy G. Thompson, who contends that the mine would help
the area's economy and would not pollute its streams and rivers.<P>

The Crandon/Mole Lake mine would be one of the largest in North America, with a
surface area of 866 acres and an underground shaft a mile long and a half-mile
deep. Approximately 30 acres of wetlands would be obliterated by the
construction of the mine, roads, a rail spur, mill complex and mining waste
treatment facility.<P>

The Chippewas fear that the mine will destroy the water and land that they
depend on for fishing, hunting and growing wild rice. Environmentalists share
their concern that mining operations could draw down groundwater for miles
around, lowering lake levels and reducing water flow to the streams in the
state and federally protected Wolf River watershed.<P>

According to tribal environmental planner John Griffin, the full impacts of the
proposed mine are difficult to predict since "a lot of data [are] missing.
Exxon could conceivably get a permit by meeting all the state's requirements
without knowing the true impact of the mine."

<H2>Sacred Rice, Troubled Waters</H2>

Wild rice is an integral part of Chippewa culture and economy and the tribe is
a leading producer of the grain. Wild rice, known as <I>Manomin</I> ("gift from the
creator"), forms an important part of the tribal diet and serves a sacred role
in Chippewa religion. If mining contaminates water supplies or depletes Mole
Lake, Chippewa tradition, as well as fish and wild rice, may be lost.<P>

Mine opponents charge that Crandon Mining's tests in the area have already
affected the water levels of Rice Lake. "The rice came up and died," said Fred
Ackley, Sokaogon Chippewa chair of the tribal mining-impact committee. "We had
no rice [last season] -- we were the only [tribe] without it. Loss of our rice
beds is critical to the community."<P>

Dave Blouin, a Madison-based Sierra Club activist, said that even if the cause
of the damage cannot be proved, "it does show how amazingly sensitive the wild
rice is. It doesn't take much to put it out of balance."<P>

Exxon admits that the amount of water flowing into the mine will be significant
-- more than 1000 gallons per minute by some estimates, totaling more than one
million gallons a day. After being treated to remove mine wastes, the water
will be piped 37 miles and dumped into the Wisconsin River. The Chippewa
estimate that 15 trillion tons of fresh water will be lost over the life of the
mine.<P>

An estimated 5500 tons of sulfide ore would be processed over 28 years. A giant
on-site pulverizing mill would process the ore into sand-like concentrates of
zinc and copper that would be shipped by rail for further refining and
smelting. The mine would also generate 60 millions tons of material, enough
waste, as Gedicks notes in <B>The New Resource</B> Wars, to build "12 Great Pyramids
of Egypt."<P>

To handle an estimated 44 million tons of toxic waste known as "tailings,"
Exxon has proposed creating a 340-acre "management" area resembling a municipal
landfill. It would be sealed with a plastic liner, covered with a clay cap and
monitored for leaks.<P>

"How can the mining company guarantee protection from waste rock -- whose
potential for harm can last thousands of years -- when liners are only
guaranteed for 100 years at most?" asked Dave Blouin. "Who will take
responsibility for replacing the liner?"<P>

The permitting process for the mine will take another two years. Meanwhile, the
Sokaogon Chippewa have gone ahead with their own investigations of the mine's
potential impacts. Using federal and private grants, and revenues from its two
casinos at Mole Lake, the tribe has hired experts to evaluate the proposed
mine. They have also built alliances with other northern Wisconsin tribes,
sought help from environmentalists and joined forces with recreationists and
non-native neighbors concerned about pollution.<P>

Ironically, the federal government may be the mine opponents' ace in the hole.
In November 1994, three federal agencies -- the National Park Service, the
Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Fish and Wildlife Service -- expressed strong
reservations about the project. The US government holds certain lands in
"trust" for Native Americans and the government's strict responsibility to
protect tribal resources transcends the state's powers to grant mining permits.

<H1>Ken Saro-Wiwa Final Address to Military-Appointed Tribunal</H1>

Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria -- My lord, we all stand before history. I
am a man of peace, of ideas. Appalled by the denigrating poverty of my people
who live on a richly endowed land; distressed by their political
marginalization and economic strangulation; angered by the devastation of their
land, their ultimate heritage; anxious to preserve their right to life and to a
decent living; and determined to usher to this country as a whole a fair and
just democratic system which protects everyone and every ethnic group, and
gives us all a valid claim to human civilization; I have devoted my
intellectual and material resources, my very life, to a cause in which I have
total belief and from which I cannot be blackmailed or intimidated. I have no
doubt at all about the ultimate success of my cause, no matter the trials and
tribulations which I and those who believe with me may encounter on our
journey. Nor imprisonment nor death can stop our ultimate victory.<P>

I repeat that we all stand before history. I and my colleagues are not the only
ones on trial. Shell is here on trial and it is as well that it is represented
by counsel said to be holding a watching brief. The company has, indeed, ducked
this particular trial, but its day will surely come and the lessons learned
here may prove useful to it, for there is no doubt in my mind that the
ecological war that the company has waged in the [Niger] Delta will be called
to question sooner than later and the crimes of that war [will] be duly
punished. The crime of the company's dirty wars against the Ogoni people will
also be punished.<P>

On trial also is the Nigerian nation, its present rulers and those who assist
them. Any nation which can do to the weak and disadvantaged what the Nigerian
nation has done to the Ogoni loses a claim to independence and to freedom from
outside influence. I am not one of those who shies away from protesting
injustice and oppression, arguing that they are expected in a military regime.
The military do not act alone. They are supported by a gaggle of politicians,
lawyers, judges, academics and businessmen, all of them hiding under the claim
that they are only doing their duty; men and women too afraid to wash their
pants of urine.<P>

We all stand on trial, my lord, for by our actions we have denigrated our
country and jeopardized the future of our children. As we subscribe to the
sub-normal and accept double standards, as we lie and cheat openly, as we
protect injustice and oppression, we empty our classrooms, denigrate our
hospitals, fill our stomachs with hunger and elect to make ourselves the slaves
of those who ascribe to higher standards, pursue the truth, and honor justice,
freedom and hard work. I predict that the scene here will be played and
replayed by generations yet unborn. Some have already cast themselves in the
role of villains, some are tragic victims, some still have a chance to redeem
themselves. The choice is for each individual.<P>

I predict that the denouement of the riddle of the Niger Delta will soon come.
The agenda is being set at this trial. Whether the peaceful ways I have favored
will prevail depends on what the oppressor decides, what signals it sends out
to the waiting public.<P>

In my innocence of the false charges I face here, in my utter conviction, I
call upon the Ogoni people, the peoples of the Niger Delta and the oppressed
ethnic minorities of Nigeria to stand up now and fight fearlessly and
peacefully for their rights. History is on their side. God is on their side.
For the Holy Quran says in Sura 42, verse 41: "All those that fight when
oppressed incur no guilt, but Allah shall punish the oppressor." Come the day.<P>

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: Oil Politics Rule in Nigeria</TITLE>

<H1>Oil Politics Rule in Nigeria</H1>

<H2>by David Bacon</H2>


Challenging oil monopolies is always dangerous business -- especially in
Nigeria. Oil rules Nigeria. Through one military coup after another, through
civil war and unrest, the lifeblood of Nigeria's economy continues to flow up
from under the Earth and onto the huge tankers that carry it to refiners as far
away as New Jersey and California.<P>

More than $12 billion in oil is pumped out every year -- 95 percent of Nigeria's
foreign earnings -- and most of it goes to the US. But instead of lifting living
standards, nearly 30 percent of Nigeria's national income now goes to service a
$30 billion foreign debt, incurred under a structural adjustment program
mandated by the International Monetary Fund. The value of Nigerian currency has
plummeted and unemployment has skyrocketed.<P>

Behind its military rulers, five companies tower over Nigeria: British/Dutch
Shell, Italian AGIP, French Elf-Aquitaine, and US giants Chevron and Mobil.
They operate in partnership with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company
(NNPC), a government-run corporation. Control of the NNPC is rumored to have
made General Sani Abacha, head of the country's military junta, a billionaire
and his military associates millionaires.<P>

But, despite corruption and heavy-handed terror, so long as successive
governments have protected the smooth flow of oil and money, the companies have
been happy. That began to change in 1994, in the wake of Moshood Abiola's
election as  president, which was followed by his imprisonment. Corruption and
incompetence escalated so much that, by the spring of 1994, the NNPC owed its
foreign partners nearly $1 billion in operating fees. The companies began to
shut the oil rigs down to force the government to pay up.<P>

Nigeria's two oil workers' unions, NUPENG and PENGASSAN, mounted a national
strike -- not just to stop the layoffs and get the debt paid, but also to force
the generals to relinquish power to the democratically elected Abiola.<P>

The strike paralyzed Nigerian industry. Government losses in oil revenues were
calculated at $34 million per day. Government workers walked out in support. In
Nigerian cities, troops brutally dispersed students barricading roads. Lacking
oil to fuel electric power plants, cities began to suffer blackouts. Air
traffic ground to a halt as airplanes could not be refueled and air traffic
controllers joined the protest.<P>

The European oil corporations AGIP and Elf-Aquitaine sympathized with the
strikers and cut production to 60 percent of normal. Shell maintained its
regular volume. But California-based Chevron and New York-based Mobil flew in
additional foreign workers to keep oil flowing from their wells and increased
production 120 percent.<P>

Their continued operations saved the life of the Abacha military regime.
According to PENGASSAN leader Milton Dabibi, military troops occupied the
installations at the companies' request. The strike produced windfall profits
when shortages raised the price of light crude oil from $14 to $20 per barrel.<P>

When the generals moved to crush the strike, they arrested NUPENG president
Wariebi Agamene, NUPENG general secretary Frank Kokori and PENGASSAN leaders
Francis A. Addo and Fidelis Aidel-omon. The generals took over control of the
unions. The union leaders have been in prison ever since. No charges have been
formally made against them and no trial has been held. But in the wake of the
execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his associates, human rights activists are
concerned for the safety of the union leaders.<P>

Supporters of the jailed Abiola have appealed to the US government to freeze
the assets of Nigerian generals and companies, and to put US oil payments to
Nigeria in escrow. Their list of targets highlights the Bank of America and
Citibank, which are tied to Chevron and Mobil respectively.<P>

Supporting their demand is the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union, which
represents US oil workers. According to OCAW vice-president Calvin Moore, "the
real question is: whose interests determine US policy -- those of oil companies
or those of the Nigerian people?"<P>

<H1>Why Ken Saro-Wiwa Had to Hang</H1>

<H2>by A. R. M. Babu</H2>

London -- Ken Saro-Wiwa had to die because he committed what is now commonly
known in the Third World as an "economic crime" -- challenging the collusion
between multinational corporations and corrupt Third World political leaders.<P>

The members of Nigeria's military junta are notorious for allocating a large
proportion of oil revenue for their own personal wealth. Anybody who challenges
this well-established practice must be eliminated by fair means or foul.<P>

Most of the oil that fuels these murderous activities comes from Ken
Saro-Wiwa's Ogoniland. Shell Oil company owns 30 percent of the state oil
company. Oil is the source of the massive corruption that dominates Nigerian
life.<P>

Saro-Wiwa never attempted to mobilize support on a nationwide level. He limited
his struggle to the Ogoni campaign, to which most of the rest of the country
was indif-ferent. Nigeria has not yet produced a lead-er of the caliber of
Museveni of Uganda, Zenawi of Ethiopia or Issayis of Eritrea, with the vision
and charisma to arouse millions of Nigerians to overthrow the junta. Thus the
military will continue to rule and multinational oil companies will continue to
maximize their profits.<P>

Only two days after the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and fellow Ogoni activists,
Shell Oil signed a $2.5 billion gas deal with the junta.<P>

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: "Lord Take My Soul... the Struggle Continues"</TITLE>

<H1>"Lord Take My Soul... the Struggle Continues"</H1>

On November 10, Nigerian environmentalist, author and Ogoni tribal activist Ken
Saro-Wiwa was taken from the Port Harcourt army camp where he had been
imprisoned for more than a year and led to the city's civilian prison.
Saro-Wiwa, along with eight other members of the Ogoni tribe, had been
convicted on October 31 of inciting the murder of four Ogoni elders who died in
a riot that erupted at an Ogoni rally. Saro-Wiwa was not even present at the
event; police prevented him from attending.<P>

Despite evidence that they had been framed, the Ogoni activists were found
guilty by a secret military-appointed tribunal. Saro-Wiwa, winner of the 1995
Goldman Environmental Prize for Africa, was the first to mount the hastily
constructed gallows. It took five attempts to hang the inspirational Ogoni
leader, but, after uttering the words, "Lord, take my soul, but the struggle
continues," Saro-Wiwa died.<P>

Saro-Wiwa earned the wrath of Nigeria's military government by speaking out
against oil operations on the Ogoni's 404-square-mile tribal territory in
Nigeria's Rivers State. Royal Dutch/Shell first discovered crude on Ogoniland
in 1956 and has since pumped $30 billion worth of petroleum, while the Ogoni
live in squalor in an environment devastated by the oil companies. Ogoni oil
reserves account for more than 50 percent of Nigeria's petroleum production and
14 percent of Shell's global production.<P>

Shell enjoys the support of Nigeria's military regime, which derives more than
80 percent of its revenue from oil sales. Saro-Wiwa claimed that Shell funded
and directed repeated acts of military violence against Ogoni villages. As
leader and spokesperson for the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People
(MOSOP), Saro-Wiwa galvanized the 550,000 Ogoni and condemned Shell's
"environmental terrorism" against the tribe and its land.<P>

Though his execution shocked the world, it likely came as no surprise to
Saro-Wiwa himself. Twelve days before being arrested in May 1994, the Ogoni
leader said, "This is it... [the military is] going to arrest us all and execute
us. All for Shell."<P>

Immediately after the executions, eight nations, including the US, recalled
their ambassadors from Nigeria, the Commonwealth of Britain suspended Nigeria's
membership and the World Bank canceled a $100 million loan for a natural gas
project in the Niger River Delta. On November 15, South African President
Nelson Mandela announced that he would lead a campaign to boycott Nigerian oil
imports worldwide, and to push for democratic reforms in Nigeria. The Clinton
administration stated that it would not join Mandela's embargo because it would
threaten US economic interests in Nigeria. The US imports roughly 50 percent of
Nigeria's oil.<BR>

<TITLE>Korean Activist Defend an Island</TITLE>

<H1>Korean Activist Defend an Island</H1>

<H2>by David Helvarg</H2>

Choi Yul became an environmental activist the hard way. As a student dissident
during South Korea's military dictator-ships of the '60s and '70s, he was
expelled from school, drafted into the military, arrested and tortured --
ultimately serving more than five years in prison. While in solitary
confinement, Choi asked Amnesty International to send him environmental books
from overseas. Because such texts were not viewed as "political," prison
authorities let him read some 250-300 of them. Released from prison in the
early 80s, he formed the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement (KFEM),
the country's first environmental group.<P>

KFEM's protests against environmental abuses helped mobilize Koreans for the
pro-democracy battles of 1987 and 1988.<P>

These days, South Korea's environmental movement is fighting a two-front war
against air, water and ground pollution produced by the nation's booming
industrial economy (moving forward under the banner of "globalization") and the
government's unwavering commitment to fuel this metastasizing growth through
an ambitious nuclear-power program.<P>

South Korea's ten nuclear power plants produce 40 percent of the nation's
energy and the government plans to build 35 more by 2030. Already a world
leader in steel, autos, shipping and electronics, South Korea hopes to add
nuclear technology to its list of exports. In addition to a US-brokered deal to
build two light-water reactors in North Korea at a cost of $4 billion, the
Seoul government also plans to help build reactors in Turkey, Taiwan and
China.<P>

A turning point for South Korea's environmental movement came in 1990, when
10,000 Anyan Island residents took to the streets to protest a government
project to store nuclear waste there. The plan was canceled. Subsequent
KFEM-led protests resulted in the cancellation of six more planned nuclear
waste sites.<P>

South Korea's nuclear-power boom, which involves spending at least $1 billion a
year on new construction and $2.5 billion a year on joint government/industry
R&D, also has more ominous implications. Despite present nonproliferation
agreements, critics are concerned that South Korea's nuclear power industry
could, given the right circumstances, rapidly convert to a nuclear weapons
industry.<P>

One justification for South Korea's plans to build a plutonium reprocessing
plant and produce its own weapons-grade plutonium is its fear of Japan's
breeder-reactor program, which continues to move forward despite growing
evidence that it is economically unfeasible. This has helped convince the
already suspicious Koreans (both North and South) that their former colonizer's
real intent is to use the program to produce the raw material for a
nuclear-weapons stockpile.<P>

For the average South Korean, however, the problem with nuclear power is not
its potential to produce atomic bombs (they have lived for more than a
generation with US nuclear weapons stationed on their soil) but traditional
NIMBY fears of reactor accidents and atomic waste. Opinion polls have shown
that a solid majority of South Koreans (like their US counterparts) oppose
nuclear power.

<H2>Small Islands, Big Protests</H2>

Last spring, half of the 650 fishers and summer-resort operators on the small
island of Duk-juk, 30 miles off the coast of South Korea, assembled near the
Ministry of Science and Technology building in the thick yellow-white smog of
downtown Seoul to protest plans to site a national nuclear waste dump on
Kul-up, a neighboring island. Kul-up, a tiny, jewel-like 500-acre assemblage of
mossy rocks, white sand beaches and saltwater marsh, is surrounded by
treacherous currents and  earthquake faults. KFEM believes that Kul-up was
chosen because its location and negligible population of seven residents would
mean smaller protests.<P>

Within moments of the protesters' arrival at the ministry, squads of
body-shielded riot police appeared. There was some spirited pushing and shoving
until Choi Yul got on a megaphone to remind everyone that it is now legal to
protest in South Korea. (The country now functions as a nominally democratic
nation since student-led protests in the late 1980s led to national
parliamentary elections in 1992).<P>

The government decision to name Kul-up a national depository for low- and
medium-level nuclear waste, and a temporary storage site for spent fuel rods,
was made without any public hearings or review. After KFEM exposed the secret
decision in December 1994, government representatives visited Kul-up and
Duk-juk and tried to reassure the islanders that they would benefit
economically from the government's $650 million project (the cost includes
stationing 3000 anti-riot troopers in nearby Inchon).<P>

Meanwhile, the mostly elderly Duk-juk island residents fear losing their
traditional livelihood, resort-owners are concerned that summer tourists will
stop coming and fishers complain that people have already stopped buying their
fish out of fear of nuclear contamination.<P>

"Because they haven't listened to the people from the islands and because they
made a secret decision to site the waste there, I'm adamantly against it," said
Choi Yul, whose group has organized the people of the islands to protest. "The
main reason I first got involved in the environmental movement was to help
people without a voice, the victims of pollution."<P>

The only known scientific review of the Kul-up project (a 1991 site survey done
by the government's Korean Resource Research Institute) recommended against the
site because of its high groundwater level, earthquake faults and unsafe
docking facilities. The survey also noted that Kul-up was the island located
farthest from South Korea's nuclear plants.<P>

The Ministry of Science and Technology has argued that the project's
endorsement by the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency is proof that Kul-up
is a safe place to store 50,000 barrels of nuclear waste.<P>

Choi Yul counters that it was the IAEA that assured the safety of a
little-known Ukrainian power-station called Chernobyl three years before its
meltdown.<P>

<TITLE>Greenwash, GOP-Style</TITLE>

<H1>Greenwash, GOP-Style</H1>


The <B>Journal</B>'s Towering Achievement in Cynicism Award goes to the strategist at
the Republican Policy Committee who authored a smarmy tract for House Republicans
called <B>Think Globally, Act Locally: A Pro-Active, Pro-Environment Agenda</B>. The
internal GOP document was leaked to the press (presumably by a
conscience-stricken Republican moderate) shortly after it was released for
in-House circulation last October.<P>

The memo advises Republicans to "build credibility" by getting involved in
"pro-environment projects," such as tree plantings and recycling programs. Such
ploys will "help further insulate [Republicans] from the attacks of the green
extremists." No need to worry if Bruce Babbitt "comes to your district and canoes
down a river as a media stunt," the memo argues, "if reporters have been to your
boss' adopt-a-highway clean-up [or] two of his tree plantings... they'll just laugh
Babbitt back to Washington."<P>

"During the year, there are at least two days when the 'environment' is a major
news story," the document instructs -- Earth Day and Arbor Day. Look for a group
"somewhere in your district" that is sponsoring an event and "plan on releasing a
statement of support." This search for the green-spin is not intended to win over
"the most extreme in the environmental movement;" it is designed to appeal to
"suburban women and young people."<P>

Tree planting "provides [Congressional] members with excellent media
opportunities," the report says, but always remember that "when participating in
tree-planting programs, you should include both children and seniors." And don't
worry about actually paying for these trees, the memo notes, since there are
always "local nurseries who [sic] may donate trees for the cause." This advice is
followed by a precautionary caveat: "(<B>Contact the ethics committee prior to
undertaking this activity.</B>)"<P>

In addition to "adopting" highways, GOPsters are also encouraged to adopt walking
trails and bike paths. But don't forget to "make sure to announce your
participation at the site... and have plenty of supporters on cite [sic] at the
press conference."<P>

Another solid-gold tip is to establish a yearly "Teddy Roosevelt Conservation
Award" for people in your district. The memo observes that Roosevelt was the
GOP's "most famous environmentalist." (The memo fails to note that Teddy was also
famous for creating the national parks system -- a system that would be defunded
and privatized under GOP proposals. Roosevelt abandoned the GOP when he ran for a
second term as President in 1912 as the Progressive Party nominee.)<P>

"If you have an environmental company in your district... arrange for a tour" and
"invite the media to participate." Invite "local environmentalists and sportsmen
[sic]" to join a Conservation Task Force. "Groups to contact include: garden club
members, 4H representatives, Ducks Unlimited members, Audobon [sic] members" and
any other "grassroots organizations that are sympathetic to your common-sense
environmental agenda" -- i.e., "reform[ing] the Endangered Species Act, Superfund,
and Clean Water legislation."<P>

"One of the best ways to show your concern" the agenda proposes, "is to announce...
a recycling program in your office. When announcing this new office policy be
sure to include local environmentalists who will praise your actions."<P>

Offer to become a "guest lecturer" at local schools and address "your commitment
to a clean environment."<P>

Produce public service announcements (PSAs). "Suggested environmental PSAs could
include: proper battery disposal; encouraging recycling at home; proper motor oil
disposal; encouraging respect for nature when camping or hunting; keeping lakes,
rivers and beaches clean by putting garbage in its place." To save money, the
memo suggests taping these politically motivated PSAs at the taxpayer-supported
House Recording Studio.<P>

A campaigning Republican could demonstrate "commitment to the environment" by
"passing out tree saplings with [his or her] door-to-door pamphlet."
Participating in beach or park clean-ups "will provide you with an opportunity to
gain positive media exposure...." And, finally: "Become active in your local zoo."<P>

All of this may well have come across as merely an awkward attempt to co-opt
legitimate environmental concerns. But there is a darker, more troubling side to
the GOP's <B>Think Globally</B> document. In the first sentence of the introduction, the
author confides to his GOP colleagues: "As we all know, the environmentalist
lobby and their extremist friends in the eco-terrorist underworld have been
working overtime to define Republicans and their agenda as anti-environment,
pro-polluter, and hostile to the survival of every cuddly critter roaming God's
green earth."<P>

The memo goes on to warn that "the extremist environmental movement will stop at
nothing to distort the facts, lie about our legislative agenda, and paint you and

Meet the 104th Congress' anti-environmental alliance -- a posse of senators and
representatives supported by the Wise Use movement, corporate polluters, real
estate developers and industries that derive their profits from exploiting
federal lands for oil, timber, minerals and grazing. There are so many of them
that it is hard to track their hyperactivity, but their aim is clear -- they
intend to dismantle 25 years of bipartisan environmental legislation (despite
polls showing that more than 60 percent of Americans think environmental
regulations should remain unchanged or be strengthened). Though they are mostly
white, male, Western Republicans, their actions affect anyone who values clean
air and water, healthy forests, respect for non-human species and the
stewardship of our public lands system. Rating the environmental voting records
of the 435 House members on a scale of 1-100, the League of Conservation Voters
handed out "zeros" to 179 representatives -- 41 percent of the House. The
following short list only recognizes the ringleaders -- the environment's Ten
Least Wanted.<P>

As Chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, <A HREF="mailto:email@murkowski.senate.gov">Frank Murkowski</A>
(R-AK) is the most powerful member of the tribe and he uses his position to
advocate oil exploration in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and increased
timbering in the Tongass National Forest. "The agenda in our state has been to
provide for the economy," said Murkowski, who received $240,000 from energy
companies from 1987-1992.<P>

Fellow Alaska Republican and Chair of the House Interior and Insular Affairs
Committee <B>Don Young</B> echoes Murkowski's resource development stance as he rails
against the "waffle-stomping, Harvard-graduating, intellectual bunch of idiots"
who support strong environmental safeguards. Young's favorite target is the
Endangered Species Act (ESA), which he complains favors "saving crickets over
saving babies."<P>

Young and <B>Richard Pombo</B> (R-CA) co-sponsored the anti-ESA Endangered Species
Conservation and Management Act of 1995, which a coalition of 20 environmental
groups claims would lead to "an end to biological diversity in America." Pombo,
a fourth-generation California rancher, repeatedly lashes out against the ESA's
protection of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox, which inhabits his own
ranchlands and those of many of his constituents. The current ESA prevents
Pombo and his neighbors from destroying kit fox habitat, subdividing their land
and cashing in on development schemes.<P>

Guiding the Senate attack on the ESA is <A HREF="mailto:senator_gorton@gorton.senate.gov">Slade Gorton</A> (R-WA), who accepted
$82,688 from the forest products industry and then recruited timber industry
lobbyists to help him write a proposed revision to the law. Under Gorton's ESA,
the fate of species would be determined not by law, but by a Department of
Interior appointee.<P>

Utah's <B>Jim Hansen</B>, a Republican long reputed to be one of the most hostile
anti-environmentalists in the House, has proposed closing some "problem"
national parks, including Nevada's Great Basin National Park. Hansen advocates
transferring all 272 million acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) holdings
to the states in which they lie. Hansen used his status as chair of the
National Parks, Forests and Lands Subcommittee to push a bill that would open
1.8 million acres of Utah wilderness to industrial development and motorized
recreation.<P>

Joining Hansen's attack on public lands is Senator <A HREF="mailto:senator_domenici@domenici.senate.gov">Pete Domenici (R-NM)</A>, whose
Livestock Grazing Act would mandate that 200 million acres of BLM and Forest
Service range- and grassland be designated exclusively for grazing, stripping
any non-grazing users of their land-use permits. Domenici, who received
$232,000 from the oil and gas industries from 1987-1992, also supports oil
exploration in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.<P>

In a stealth attack against the environment, Rep. <B>Ernest Istook (R-OK)</B>, known
for his opposition to abortion and his support of prayer in school, penned an
amendment that would prevent lobbying by nonprofit organizations that receive
federal grants. The Istook Amendment, commonly known as the "gag rule,"
reflects its author's belief that nonprofit groups should not participate in
"political advocacy." The law would affect many of the 225,000 nonprofits,
including many environmental groups, that receive federal funds.<P>

The most controversial environmental bill to be signed into law by President
Clinton during the 104th Congress was the salvage logging rider, written by
Rep. <A HREF="mailto:chtaylor@hr.house.gov">Charles Taylor</A> (R-NC). The law permits the timber industry to harvest 6.2
billion board feet of "dead and dying" trees from Forest Service and BLM land
without any environmental review. Taylor's "logging without laws" bill was
enacted in July and has spawned widespread protests and a 75-day hunger strike
by Oregon forest activist Tim Ream.<P>

Not all the legislative eco-damage is advocated by Republicans. Rep. <B>Billy
Tauzen (D-LA)</B>, who collected $93,550 from oil companies and energy utilities in
the two years preceding the 1994 election, introduced legislation that would
cripple federal protection of private land. Tauzen's bill targeted the ESA,
Clean Water Act, safeguards for wetlands and laws protecting water flow in the
West. He also wrote a bill that would allow business to undermine existing
health, safety and environmental rules.<P>

Proving that the men in Congress do not hold a monopoly on ecological
ignorance, Idaho's republican Rep. <A HREF="mailto:askhelen@hr.house.gov">Helen Chenoweth</A> earned a spot on our list by
saying, "a species goes out of existence every 20 seconds. Surely a new species
must come into existence every 20 seconds."

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: Get the Hogs Out of the Creek!</TITLE>

<H1>Get the Hogs Out of the Creek!</H1>
<H2>By Jim Hightower</H2>

The most astute political observation I ever heard was made by my Aunt Eula, who
farmed years ago in Northeast Texas: "The water won't ever clear up 'til we get
the hogs out of the creek," she said.<P>

Now that's our problem today, isn't it? The big hogs have hefted their hulks
directly into the middle of the creek, damming it up for themselves and fouling
our country's economic and environmental waters.<P>

We've simply got to get the hogs out of the creek. As Aunt Eula knew, this is
not a chore to undertake in your best trousers, politely pleading: "Here hog,
here hog... pretty please." To get hogs out of the creek, you have to put your
shoulders to them -- and shove.<P>

Yet most national environmental organizations today are indeed dressed in their
Sunday trousers, engaged in the soft-hands work of lawyers and lobbyists in
Washington, sincerely but futily attempting to negotiate the relative position
of hogs with such corrupt louts as Loudspeaker of the House Newt Gingrich.<P>

Surely it is time to concede that we environmentalists will not even deter --
much less defeat -- the spoilers and speculators, big shots and bastards by
focusing so much of our fight inside the Beltway, where the "debate" is
tolerant only of viewpoints ranging from the moderate-right corporatism of Bill
Clinton's White House to the kooky-right extremism of Gingrich's Congress.<P>

Rather, our place for the next several years has to be in the countryside,
putting the bulk of environmentalism's considerable resources (money, brain
power and energy) into grassroots organizing, local legal battles and hands-on
political campaigns going head-to-head in urban neighborhoods, small towns and
rural areas with the polluters, "wise abusers" and other forces of ignorance
and arrogance. Indeed, it would not hurt my feelings one bit if every
environmental group in Washington were to abandon the Capital City, except for
a token sentinel or two, and relocate en masse out where America's
environmental majority actually lives, works and struggles.<P>

Environmental majority? Yes. Not merely the card-carrying organizational
members, but just ordinary folks -- the "pollutees." They mostly don't call
themselves "environmentalists," and they probably know more about the PTA than
the EPA, but they damn sure know pollution when it hits them. After all, you
don't have to be in Who's Who to know What's What.<P>

I'm talking about the family with a $70,000 mortgage on a little home in that
far out housing development up against the cotton fields, noticing that their
roses died after the seventh spraying this summer, and beginning to connect
that to their child's recurring rashes.<P>

I'm talking about workers in the plastics plant who have learned they'll die
ten years earlier than normal because of where they work, at the same time
they've learned the company is cutting back their health benefits.<P>

I'm talking about the Mexican-American mother who finds out her daughter's
bouts with nausea and a neighboring boy's fainting spells might both come from
a gasoline tank farm in their neighborhood that's leaking toxins into the
groundwater.<P>

Our challenge is not to create a mass movement, but simply to get with it. All
over America, there's a rebellion against the poisoning -- not just a rebellion
among the beansprout eaters, but among the snuffdippers as well. You don't find
noxious waste dumps on Nob Hill and the North Shore, and there are no
toxic-spewing factories in River Oaks and Saddle Brook. All such nasties are in
working-class neighborhoods and poor rural areas -- these are the folks who are
spontaneously-combusting into local, mad-as-hell groups called HALT, OUCH,
CRUD, WOW and NOT!<P>

There's our future, that's where our fight is and there is no shortcut to
victory through Washington. Indeed, these folks look to the Capital and see
Gingrich drinking his own bathwater and thinking it's champagne, while Clinton
seeks compromise with Newt and calls it "progress."<P>

The only integrity -- the only victory -- will come from the bloody give-and-take
of the grassroots war. How important is it? Just think in terms of raw
politics, not counting all the substantive fights over waste incinerators,
aquifers, pesticide regulations and so forth. Unbeknownst to most of the big,
national environmental organizations, the term-limits movement has been so
successful at the state level that some 2600 state house and senate seats
(nearly 40 percent of the total) are going to come open in 1998 and 2000.<P>

Are we recruiting candidates, training campaign managers, organizing, raising
money, getting ready? The polluters are. And remember, the legislative class
elected in '98 and 2000 will be the one that reapportions every congressional
district in the country. To ignore this historic battle, which can only be won
in the trenches, is simply to surrender the cause well into the next century.<P>

Besides, we should relish these state legislative fights and jump into them
with both feet for the very good reason that we can win them -- at the local
level, our numbers and energy can overpower their money. And, even more
important than the legislators we can elect, we would genuinely become a
national movement, unifying and solidifying a grassroots majority that really
can shove the hogs out of the creek.<P>

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: We Shall be Killed in Silent Ways</TITLE>

<H1>We Shall be Killed in Silent Ways</H1>

<H2>by Vladimir Chernousenko</H2>

In November, 1993, the War and Peace Foundation arranged for Vladimir
Chernousenko, the Ukrainian nuclear physicist who supervised the "cleanup" of
Chernobyl, to come to the US and reveal the true magnitude of the disaster.
April 25, 1996 marks the tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl accident. A victim
himself of radiation poisoning resulting from the Chernobyl accident,
Chernousenko is now dying of cancer. The following is excerpted from his talks.<P>

<HR>

The Chernobyl reactor exploded on April 25, 1986. With nothing to contain its
temperatures, the reactor overheated and a nuclear blue heat burned for 16
days. Everything that could burn, burned. The smoke went up three-four
kilometers [1.8-2.4 miles]. We could not ascertain the full damage, but still
the government issued reports that everything was in order.<P>

As soon as the explosion happened, troops were placed around the area. The
government put a lid on what had happened, and millions were not evacuated in
time. There was finally an evacuation on the 27th, but this was already too
late.<P>

I was called in by [then-president] Mikhail Gorbachev to evaluate what had
happened. With my colleagues, we flew several times a day over the reactor with
military instruments to measure the intensity of radioactivity. Since [our
instruments] could only go up to 400 rems, we had no way of reporting or
measuring further.<P>

Young recruits, 18-, 19-, 20-year-olds, came to assist in the cleanup. Many
died immediately. They were given no protective clothing. Why? I believe it
was to show the world that it was not a big catastrophe; that it could be
easily cleaned up.<P>

When I concluded my investigation, I sent a three-volume report to Gorbachev.
Immediately it became a secret document. The IAEA (International Atomic Energy
Agency) would not acknowledge the scope of the damage. According to the IAEA,
there were only 31 casualties. There has been no talk of the 7000 who died
immediately.<P>

Kiev, a city of four million people, was heavily dosed, as were a number of
little villages and hamlets. I found that the magnitude of the damage was
enormous. Rather than affecting three percent of the reactor core, as had been
reported, actually 70 percent was affected. As a result, 65 million people in
Russia received a dose.<P>

What followed the tragedy is much worse and will be larger than the aftermath
of World War II. So many people are going to die. With genetic reactions, the
threat will continue for future generations. There are four times more
childhood and animal diseases, and they keep increasing every month. Ninety
million people north of the Ukraine have been contaminated. It is the worst
catastrophe that has ever happened to humankind.<P>

A million and a half people in or around Chernobyl (including the people who
cleaned up the site) received extremely high doses of radiation. [Millions of
others] received internal radiation from food contamination. Prior to the
Chernobyl disaster, Ukraine had been the breadbasket of Europe. Now, 70 percent
of the food is contaminated. There is no way to clean [the soil] up, but since
they must grow food, they use it and the food is irradiated.<P>

Those who consume these irradiated products develop problems of the esophagus
and circulatory system, anemia and other disorders: the blood becomes totally
affected and the immune system completely breaks down. For a child, a small
cold is tragic. A seven-year-old dies of cancer. There is a plethora of
diseases -- some illnesses not even diagnosed yet. To this day, there is no
understanding of how to deal with the thousands who have received radiation.<P>

The international nuclear mafia says of Chernobyl that, "the machine broke
down." We cannot dismiss so simply what has caused so major an ecological
disaster. They say it is fully under control and will not happen again. The
fact remains that they have not resolved the real reasons for this catastrophe.<P>

The Chernobyl disaster had little to do with "accidents" or mistakes of
personnel. People should know that Chernobyl had explosions before. It was a
military reactor and all military reactors were kept secret. There had been 104
prior accidents in Russia, but radioactive material was not emitted, so no
attention was paid.<P>

There was no organization in the former USSR to monitor these reactors. There
have been more than 200 accidents in nuclear installations, with millions of
curies of radiation released. Since 1986, all accidents have been kept secret.
In my country not one inch of area is free of radioactive fallout. People are
losing their hair and blood is coming out of mouths.<P>

Nuclear power stations are dangerous not only because they can blow up; they
are dangerous even when they do not blow up. My assistants and I researched ten
plants, and we consistently found the water polluted and people around the
plants sick. We found 152 lies and cover-ups. Such details are considered
treasonable, but the truth should be found.<P>

Between 1991 and 1993, there were 152 nuclear catastrophes in 14 countries,
including some in the US. There were none like Chernobyl, only because reactors
in Russia are larger and we did not have enough money to correct certain
factors and there was no punishment if we did not. Half occurred because of
errors made by personnel. In 1989 alone, there were 860 stoppages because of
imminent danger due to improper management.<P>

The international nuclear mafia will not accept the necessity to deal with the
problem. But we must talk about the atomic energy situation, because the next
explosion will be larger. There are 65 reactors in Russia and 110 in the US.
With one or two such explosions, it is utterly ridiculous to discuss defense
measures. We shall be killed in silent ways.<P>

It is virtually impossible to make a reactor safe. Still we have not learned
this. There has been no significant change in the US or Russia since the
Chernobyl accident. It has not changed the mindlessness of government. Yeltsin
is continuing with nuclear power and the same thing is likely to happen again.
Further tragedies will cost the lives of more millions.<P>

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: The Cree Decree on Quebec Secession</TITLE>

<H2>The Cree Decree on Quebec Secession</H2>

<H3>By Grand Cheif Matthew Coon-Come, Gran Council of the Crees of Quebec</H3>

In Washington last year, I pointed out that if Canada was divisible, then surely
Quebec was, too. I pointed out that if a province, Quebec, had the right to
determine its future, then certainly the Crees, a people who had lived in the
territory for thousands of years, had no less a right.<P>

Cree Territory was added to Quebec in 1912, and Quebec only began to administer
the territory in 1963. In 1993, the Government of Quebec held a celebration
called "Thirty Years in the North." I spoke at the Quebec National Assembly on
that occasion. I remarked that even a young man such as I had been in the North
longer than the government of Quebec.<P>

On May 2, 1670, King Charles II signed his name to a piece of paper and "gave"
much of what is now Canada to the Hudson's Bay Company. The Crees and Inuit
were not asked or informed about this deed. In 1898 and 1912, "Rupert's Land,"
as it was called, was broken up and annexed to the Canadian provinces of
Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. Again, we were not asked or even told.<P>

In 1971, work began on Hydro-Quebec's "project of the century" and bulldozers
and dambuilders burst into James Bay. Still no one spoke to us. When we
objected and sought relief from the courts, the government of Quebec took the
position that we had no rights to the land -- that we were "squatters." This is
the word that was used, "squatters."<P>

I defend Cree rights; I am not attacking Quebec or the people who live in
Quebec. The Cree people understand and respect the cultural and political
aspirations of Quebecois, at least with respect to lands that are legitimately
theirs. But we cannot accept the denial of our status and rights.<P>

We Crees have lived in the James Bay area since the last Ice Age. We have
always identified ourselves as one people with our own language, laws, beliefs,
and system of land tenure and governance. We Crees gave our lands a name --
<B>Eenou Astchee</B> -- long before there was a Canada or a United States. We hunt,
fish and trap on its valleys, ridges, shores and waters. The land is still the
greatest provider for our needs.<P>

We Crees do not think of borders as sacred. We are part of the land. There is
no other place in the world where everything, every hill, every stream, every
fork in the river is named in Cree. Eenou Astchee is the center of Cree
civilization, and it is inconceivable that we would cease to care for it.<P>

Wherever I go in Quebec, ordinary Quebec people support our rights. Ordinary
people seem to understand that you cannot claim certain rights for yourself and
in the same breath deny those same rights to others.<P>

The separatist leadership also claims that the secret and eventual goal of the
Crees is separation from Canada. Parti Quebecois (PQ) officials now state in
every forum that any recognition of a Cree right-to-consent would create a
dangerous precedent for Aboriginal peoples -- in Canada, the United States,
Mexico, Peru, Australia and everywhere Indigenous peoples are found -- to
declare independence and break up existing states!<P>


We are not separatists. There is no Cree independence movement. We most
certainly have grievances against the government of Canada. Our relationship is
in need of profound reform. Neither Canada nor Quebec has respected and fully
implemented our treaties with them. Our relations are often poor and
unnecessarily adversarial. We are excluded from the decision-making processes
regarding our lands, our waters and our environment. Our lands and resources
are irresponsibly exploited, even destroyed. We enjoy little benefit from the
wealth they produce. Canada has failed to live up to its obligations to provide
adequate housing and much-needed funding for community operations and
maintenance. We are doing everything in our power, legally and politically, to
change this situation. But in spite of all this, we are not separatists.<P>

In the Cree communities and on the Cree traplines, life goes on. Our hunting,
fishing and trapping way of life continues despite unsustainable clearcutting
and the hundreds of dams that divert whole river systems and flood our lands.
We face mercury contamination, open-pit mining, networks of roads, waste dumps
and all of the other things that could permanently end the life we have lived
for thousands of years.<P>

International legal scholars have broadly confirmed our right to
self-determination if Quebec separates from Canada. Even the Parti Quebecois'
own legal scholar, Professor Daniel Turp, has confirmed the validity of our
claims.<P>

I want to be clear: We are not Canada's Indians. We are not Quebec's Indians.
We are our own people -- <B>Eeyouch</B>, the Crees. We cannot simply be traded from
country to country, as though we are livestock in a field.<P>


And as the separatists know better than anyone else: you cannot force a people
to maintain their loyalty. The separatists would be well-advised to risk
recognizing and respecting our rights. Fundamental human rights should
certainly come before the so-called integrity of an entity that is just 30 or
90 years old.<P>

Let me state, however, that we do not oppose Quebec's referendum. What we
dispute is Quebec's right to hold a referendum on the future of Eenou Astchee,
the Cree Territory, and Eeyouch, the Cree people. In the end, the Crees will
make the choice. If the government of Quebec holds a referendum on separation,
we intend to hold our own referendum.<P>

The government of Quebec firmly rejects the right of Canadians outside of
Quebec to play any role in determining the future of the territory it claims.
The Cree position is identical: only the Crees will determine the future of
Eenou Astchee.<P>

The Crees want meaningful inclusion in Canada and Quebec, meaningful
jurisdiction, real benefits from the resources on our lands, genuine political
participation as a nation and a people in Canada. We want to have an effective
say in our own backyard, and to get to work to develop our region, in real
partnership with Quebec [and] with Canada.<P>

In Cree we have a word for human being -- <B>eeniw</B>. I want the Cree people and all
of the Aboriginal peoples to be treated like human beings. But this must be
understood: our conception of our humanity is that we are a people. To treat us
as humans, our status as one of the Aboriginal peoples in Canada -- as stated
in the Canadian constitution -- must be fully recognized and accepted.<P>

Perhaps that time has come now. Our influence will continue to increase.
Nothing will ever happen again in Canada without us. Canada's own character,
and Canada's important decisions, can never be separated from those of the
Aboriginal civilizations who were here so long before anyone else.<P>

<A NAME="McDonald"><H2>McDonald's Cowed by Protest</H2>

USA -- On October 1, animal rights activists saluted "World Farm Animals Day" by
blocking the drive-thru lane at a southern California McDonald's restaurant
with a dead cow. "Technically, this is simply 'yet-to-be-processed food',"
explained Orange County People for Animals (OCPA) spokesperson Jerry Friedman.
OCPA's intention was to "jolt the public out of denial" and force burger-buyers
to "face the triple whammy of meat-eating" -- animal suffering, damage to human
health and destruction of habitat for grazing.

<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<A NAME="Young"><H2>Young, Employed, Bald</H2>

Japan -- The stress of modern living is causing women to lose their hair, and
that is good news for Japan's Yen3.8 billion ($43.7 million) hair tonic industry,
which has seen its profits  double in the last five years. But don't worry:
according to Seiji Kato of the Japan Hair Research Institute, "Worrying is
itself bad for the hair." Kato also claims that US-style fast-foods cause hair
loss by disturbing female hormone balances. The leading women's hair tonic,
distributed by the Tsumura company, is called "Molty."

<A NAME="Nestle"><H2>Nestle Sucks</H2>

USA -- Residents of the small Texas town of Eustace are boiling mad over a Swiss
multinational's plans to bottle their underground water and sell it on the
international market. Ozarka Drinking Water Co., a subsidiary of Perrier (which
is a division of the Swiss-owned Nestle Corporation), plans to tap into
historic Rohr Spring, the town's sole source of water. While Nestle can legally
claim the residents' water under Texas' "Right to Capture" law, the Rohr Spring
Citizen's Committee complains that the would-be water-robber-barons represent a
"foreign invader."

<A NAME="To"><H2>To Dive in Venice</H2>

Italy -- At the start of the 20th century, St. Mark's Square in Venice flooded
seven times a year. Today the famous square is under water more than 40 times a
year. While average sea levels have risen 11 cm (4.3 inches) this century,
draining of underground aquifers has caused Venice to sink 12 cm (4.7 inches).
If this trend continues, reports Rueters, St. Mark's could be submerged
"virtually the entire year."

<A NAME="Here"><H2>Here Come the Bugs</H2>

Geneva -- If climate change pushes tropical weather toward the poles, can
mosquitoes be far behind? The European Commission's Joint Research Center
fears that much of Europe, Australia and North America may be overrun with
disease-carrying insects within the next few decades. Malaria, customarily
confined to the tropics, claims two million lives a year. Not only is
population density greater in the North, but also the North's city dwellers
have not developed any immunity to <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I>, the most virulent of
the malarial parasites. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
predicts that rising temperatures will elicit 50-80 million additional cases of
malaria and 3.5 million new cases of river blindness and help spread tropical
diseases like dengue fever and yellow fever.

<A NAME="Gulp"><H2>"Gulp War" Syndrome</H2>

USA -- A new theory has emerged that may explain the spectrum of illnesses
known as Gulf War Syndrome. During the sweltering months of the Persian Gulf
War, US soldiers consumed enormous quantities of carbonated soft drinks
artificially sweetened with NutraSweet (aspartame), manufactured by Monsanto.
Left in the desert sun, temperatures inside Coke and Pepsi cans may reach
120-150* F. At temperatures above 86*F, aspartame liberates methanol, a severe
metabolic poison. Even at room temperatures, drinking chemically sweetened
sodas can trigger a condition known as phenyl-keta-neuria, which can trigger a
range of symptoms, including memory loss, headaches, chronic fatigue, joint
pain and vision loss.<P>

<A NAME="Does"><H2>Does Growth Cut Pollution?</H2>

USA -- Free-market advocates claimed that treaties like NAFTA would benefit the
environment in countries like Mexico. While pollution might increase with
industrialization, the argument ran, growing incomes and profits would
eventually pay for environmental clean-ups. But a new study by the
Environmental Law Institute (ELI) finds little evidence for this wishful
thinking. While sulfur dioxide and particulates appeared to show a "turning
point," the ELI study found that "municipal solid waste and carbon dioxide
emissions continue to grow with income."


<A NAME="Think"><H2>Think Locally, Expand Globally</H2>

Romania -- The miracle of the post-Communist "free market" left Romania so
impoverished that it could not provide light bulbs for the capital city's
traffic signals. But now capitalism has come to the rescue in the form of Joe
Camel. Tobacco giant R. J. Reynolds agreed to pay for Bucharest's traffic
lights, but there was a catch -- all the lights came emblazoned with the Camel
cigarette logo. "It was really fantastic at night, when only the yellow lights
were on, and you'd just see the camel everywhere, blinking on and off," one ad
agency honcho told the <B>San Francisco Chronicle</B>. (Globalization works both ways.
On October 1, it was announced that BAA, a British firm, would begin running
the Indianapolis International Airport.)

<A NAME="Jobs"><H2>Jobs? Don't Get Lean; Go Green</H2>

USA -- A National Commission for Employment Policy study reports that
Washington's $4 billion investment in environmental programs in 1994 created
70-80,000 jobs. "The numbers show that the jobs/environment dichotomy is a
fallacy," concluded Commission chair Anthony Carnevale. This finding was
corroborated in an Economic Policy Institute study cited in <B>Scientific
American</B>. Economist Eban S. Goodstein, using Labor Department figures from
1987-1990, found that, on average, only 0.1 percent of job-losses had resulted
from environmental regulation. Change of company ownership resulted in 35-times
more lay-offs, Goodstein found.

<A NAME="Zoo"><H2>Zoo-Busters Claim Victory</H2>

Canada -- In an unprecedented "zoo coup," animal rights campaigners have shut
down a municipal zoo in North America. By mid-October, Vancouver's Stanley Park
Zoo was down to its last 21 Humboldt penguins and one 34-year-old polar bear
named Tuk. "There are more and more people questioning whether zoos are good
things," observed Zoocheck Canada director Rob Laidlaw. In 1993, 54 percent of
Vancouver voters called for the zoo's closure. The British-based Born Free
Foundation had touched the hearts of many voters by documenting the prevalence
of "zoochosis" -- a set of destructive behaviors in caged animals, ranging from
neurotic pacing and head-bobbing to gnawing on bars and walls, and
self-mutilation.

<A NAME="Bank"><H2>Bank Bumbles; Schemes to Scam Taxpayers</H2>

World Bank documents leaked to the <B>Financial Times of London</B> reveal that many
Third World borrowers will never be able to repay their loans. (Third World
borrowers have called for debt relief for years, but this marks the first time
that the bank itself has admitted that many of its loans are uncollectable.)
Canada's <B>Probe International</B> [225 Brunswick Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
M5S 2M6; (416) 964-9223, ext. 227] reports that the bank, to protect its
triple-A credit rating, "plans to engineer a disguised taxpayer bailout" by
using the Multilateral Debt Facility (MDF) as a "bailout body" to write off $11
billion in bad loans. In the past, bad loans have been covered up through the
banking ploy of "defensive lending." (One recent example was Mexico's $730
million "repayment" on its $12 billion US loan. Mexico actually borrowed this
money from foreign banks at <B>higher</B> interest rates than those in force on the
original US loan.) To avoid the appearance of "self-entanglement," the document
says, the MDF bailout "would be financed by taxpayer funds from the
industrialized countries...."

<A NAME="Men"><H2>Men of Letters</H2>

The GOP's House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) committed a "technical
violation" of House rules by sending letters written on Congressional
stationery warning corporate executives to stop funding "liberal" nonprofit
charities like the Children's Defense Fund, the American Cancer Society and the
NAACP. Armey, who wants to abolish the minimum wage, complained that "big
business is firmly behind the welfare state." In an attempt to deny political
access to nonprofits receiving federal funds, Rep. David McIntosh (R-IN)
created a bogus letter on Alliance for Justice stationery (a grassroots
coalition promoting equal access to the legal system) to attack the Sierra Club
Legal Defense Fund, the Native American Rights Fund and the Juvenile Law
Center. Alliance founder Nan Aron called the forgery "appalling."

<A NAME="Reaching"><H2>Reaching-for-an-Angle Award</H2>

To Monsanto, which touted the "environmental" benefits of its dioxin-laced
Round-Up pesticide by claiming that it "is used in Kenya, Africa, to keep
grasses from short-circuiting electric fences that protect the endangered black
rhino."<P>

<A HREF="w95-10.html#EPA">EPA's PCB Cover-up</A>



<A NAME="Cars"><H2>Cars for Alarm</H2>

Defying safety and environmental concerns, President Clinton signed the GOP-led
repeal of the national 55 mph speed limit. As a result, oil companies will reap
millions in profits and highway fatalities may soar. Meanwhile, in an attempt
to help US automakers "compete and win in the global marketplace," the Clinton
administration demanded that Japan relax its auto-safety regulations to allow
increased sales of US cars in Japan.

<A NAME="Fueling"><H2>Fueling Suspicions</H2>

In an attempt to stall California's promotion of emission-free transportation,
Big Auto and Big Oil companies jointly hired the Rand Corporation to produce a
critical study of Zero Emission Vehicles. <B>Automotive News</B> reported that the
funds were laundered through the California Manufacturers Association.

<A NAME="Primed"><H2>Primed to Blow</H2>

The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) has named Bulgaria's Kozloduy
nuclear power station the world's most dangerous reactor. The IAEA estimated
that four of the plant's six reactors run a 25 percent risk of suffering a core
meltdown within five years. The IAEA made this prediction in mid-1993.

<A NAME="Corruption"><H2>Corruption Index</H2>

Berlin-based Transparency International has published its first Corruption
Index, rating the influence of bribery in awarding government contracts in 41
industrial and developing countries. The most honest countries: New Zealand,
Denmark and Singapore. The world's most corrupt countries: China and Indonesia.
The US ranked 14th on the corruption scale, slightly ahead of France and Japan.

<A NAME="Sting"><H2>Sting Stung</H2>

With British rock star Sting and wife Trudie expecting their fourth child in
December (Sting also has three children from a previous marriage), Hollywood
gossipmonger Liz Smith was moved to observe: "Geez! This guy is so big on
environmental issues... but hasn't he heard about the problems of overpopulation?
You're a fertile guy, Sting. We're impressed. Now stop it."

<A NAME="Who"><H2>Who Owns the Weather?</H2>

Taxpayers might be surprised to learn that the government's National Weather
Service (NWS) data has been "privatized." <B>San Francisco Chronicle</B> business
reporter Michelle Quinn has disclosed that the NWS "cheaply sells the raw data
to private companies who then resell it, at higher rates" to TV networks,
newspapers and airlines. Private companies like Accuweather Inc. and WSI Corp.
buy the data for $40,000 and reap millions by reselling it to small businesses
and large corporations. Last May, Jan Null, NWS' lead forecaster, tried to
create an Internet site so users could quickly acquire weather data. Two months
later, Null was told to close the World Wide Web site. Why was Null nullified?
The scuttlebutt says that the free service competed with WSI, which sells the
same information to CNN and NBC's <B>Today Show</B> -- at a profit.

<A NAME="Nip"><H2>Mole Nip</H2>

To Earthwatch, a Massachusetts-based research/ecotourism operation, for
subsidizing the man-handling of dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida. Researcher
Randy Wells pursues and restrains dolphins to extract teeth and blood samples.
Ben White of Friends of Animals [1234 Garfield Street, Port Townsend, WA 98368;
(360) 379-5168] has proposed tracking down and capturing Mr. Wells in order to
obtain teeth and blood samples. Humanely, of course.<P>

To California's race-baiting governor and failed presidential candidate Pete
Wilson. Having failed to recycle his political career, Wilson returned from the
campaign trial and immediately repealed California's landmark law requiring the
use of recycled materials in paper products and packaging. Wilson's action
(which was cheered by food giant Kraft and the Weyer-hauser paper company) came
five days after the US Supreme Court dismissed the food and paper industry's
challenge to the law. Wilson claimed his act would ensure "consumer-friendly
parameters." Californians Against Waste says that Wilson's act means that
anything can now be "labeled 'recycled' whether it's recycled or not."<P>

To Camelot-lite John F. Kennedy, Jr., editor of the lavishly illustrated,
ponderously empty <B>George</B> magazine. Explaining his "ET" approach to political
reporting, JFK, Jr. editorialized: "We suspect that Americans want to know more
about the people who seek to govern and less about the correctness of their
politics." Coming soon in <B>George</B>: Pat Buchanan's favorite barbecue recipes and
Newt Gingrich's personal battle to perfect his golf swing.<P>

<A NAME="Kiss"><H2>Mole Kiss</H2>

To Boston radio jock Tom Magliozzi who, with his brother Ray, holds forth on
National Public Radio's popular "Car Talk" broadcast. <B>Auto Free World</B> reports
that Tom's preferred commute vehicle is a bicycle. "Sure, cars give us
freedom," Tom observes, "but as Benjamin Franklin said, 'There is no such thing
as freedom without responsibility.' " The "car guy" advocates limiting the
number of cars on roads.<P>

<A NAME="Clearcut"><H2>A Clearcut Victory at The Times</H2>

USA -- In November, after a two-year blitz of letter-writing and appeals from
subscribers and environmentalists, <B>The New York Times</B> canceled its paper
contract with MacMillan Blodel, the Canadian timber giant responsible for
clearcutting the ancient forests of Clayoquot Sound. The action finally puts
the paper in compliance with its own environmental policies. In Clayoquot
Sound, meanwhile, the clear-cutting continues, despite an agreement to apply
"sustainable" logging practices.

<A NAME="Now"><H2>Now You're Cookin'</H2>

South Africa -- Eastern Transvaal Premier Mathews Phosa has vowed to move solar
energy from the back burner to the forefront of his development agenda. Home
solar water heaters are more than 50 percent more efficient that fossil-fuel
systems and installing photovoltaic arrays on rooftops is cheaper than building
hundreds of miles of transmission lines. According to <B>New Ground</B> magazine,
solar power will "enable needy communities to rise above poverty." Using solar
ovens to cook food will slow deforestation and free women from the
time-consuming hunt for wood.

<A NAME="Save"><H2>Save Trees; Save the Fish</H2>

Japan -- In order to save traditional fisheries from silt washing out to sea 
off eroded hills, Japanese women have been replanting inland forests. "The seas
and the mountains are one," Urakawa Fisheries Cooperative Association director
Masahito Inoue told <B>Look Japan</B>. The Women's Auxiliary of the Hokkaido Fisheries
Association has vowed to keep planting trees for 100 years. In the last 30
years, the women have planted more than a quarter-million trees.

<A NAME="Clearing"><H2>Clearing Chlorine</H2>

USA -- The environmentally damaging element chlorine can be found in paper,
swimming pools and drinking water. In 1994, paper production alone released
more than 1.5 trillion gallons of chlorine-laden wastes into US waters. Where
can you find alternatives? Try the Chlorine Free Products Association, 102
North Hubbard, Algonquin, IL 60102; (708) 658-6104.<P>

<A NAME="Mafia"><H2>A New Kind of Mafia Protection</H2>

Tanzania -- In 1995, the Tanzanian Parliament established the country's first
marine park at Mafia Island, 120 kilometers (74 miles) south of Dar-es-Salaam.
The decision capped a three-year effort by islanders and the Worldwide Fund for
Nature. Mafia Island's seagrass beds, tidal flats and coral reefs had been
threatened by coral collection and overfishing with seine nets and dynamite.
Dynamite fishing is especially harmful, since it kills non-target fish and
blasts gaping holes in the reefs.

<A NAME="Good"><H2>Good News for Crabs</H2>

Australia -- Last September, the province of Victoria enacted a law that, for
the first time, extended prevention-of-cruelty-to-animals protection to fish
and crustaceans. Agriculture Minister Bill McGrath assured Parliament that
penalties would be increased for violations and police would be given greater
powers to enforce the law.

<A NAME="Not"><H2>Not to be Skipped</H2>

USA -- <B>Skipping Stones</B>, a unique quarterly that publishes multilingual stories,
poems and pictures from children around the world, has won the Educational
Press Association of America's 1995 Golden Shoestring Award. Congratulations to
tireless editors Arun N. Toke and Amy E. Brant, and to all the young
contributors. [Skipping Stones, PO Box 3939, Eugene, OR 97403; (503) 342-4956.
Subscriptions: $20/year.]

<A NAME="Don"><H2>Don't Bank on Growth</H2>

USA -- In 1995, Bank of America, the California Resources Agency, the Low Income
Housing Fund and the Greenbelt Alliance produced a study called <B>Beyond Sprawl:
New Patterns of Growth to Fit the New California</B>, warning that the social,
environmental and financial costs of building new suburbs were unsustainable.
The report found that the loss of farms and woodlands to housing developments
had made the state a "less desirable location for business owners and potential
employees" and called for developers to begin paying for the full costs
"associated with new road construction... new water supplies and mitigation of
ecological problems."

<A NAME="60"><H2>60 Minutes Wins One</H2>

USA -- In November, CBS' news magazine <B>60 Minutes</B> was forced to censor a report
on the tobacco industry, because the network's corporate owners did not want to
risk a lawsuit. In 1989, <B>60 Minutes</B> broadcast a report claiming that children
were at risk from eating apples treated with the chemical Alar (daminozide).
Applegrowers sued CBS. In October 1995, a US Court of Appeals dismissed the
suit and confirmed the EPA's finding that exposure to Alar, a probable human
carcinogen, posed an "unacceptable risk" to human health.

<A NAME="Agenda"><H2>Agenda 21 at the City Level</H2>

The Netherlands -- Despite the focus on national governments, two-thirds of the
more than 2000 points covered in Agenda 21 (the program-of-action adopted at
the 1992 Earth Summit) must be implemented at the municipal level.
<B>Environmental News from The Netherlands</B> reports that the Dutch government
provides grants to cities to develop Agenda 21 plans. Amsterdam's plan seeks
"insulated, affordable housing, with enough playgrounds and parks, and many
cultural and recreational facilities" by the year 2015. The city of Oostzaan
has cut municipal wastes by 60 percent. The town of Houten boasts 25 percent
fewer cars than the national average and 72 percent fewer auto accidents.
Motorists trying to enter Houten's residential areas find themselves "caught in
a maze of small streets, difficult bends and junctions where cyclists have

<A NAME="Suds"><H2>Suds-less Scrubbing</H2>

USA -- Envirocloth has been used in European hospitals, hotels, restaurants and
schools for more than ten years to save costs by avoiding the use of caustic
cleansers. Ordinary cloth towels are woven flat, but the tiny Envirocloth
fibers stand up like spikes so they can penetrate surfaces and capture dirt by
mechanical action rather than chemical reaction. No detergents are needed, only
water. Envirocloths can last up to two years and are recyclable. [Environmental
Technologies Co., PO Box 10395, Prescott, AZ 86301; (800) 757-0993.]

<A NAME="Nose"><H2>A Good Nose</H2>
USA -- California's Napa Valley Wine Train has become one of the country's first
locomotives to convert to clean-burning natural gas. Replacing diesel fuel with
less expensive natural gas should cut fuel costs by 25 percent while reducing
nitrogen oxide emissions by as much as 16 percent.

<A NAME="Smog"><H2>Smog on the Roof of the World</H2>

Nepal -- Kathmandu will become one of the most polluted cities in the world
within 10-15 years if vehicle and industrial emissions continue without
regulation, according to a study completed by the Kath-mandu Valley Vehicular
Emission Control Project (KVVECP). The report, funded by the United Nations
Development Program, claims that the emissions from more than 95 percent of the
75,690 vehicles in Nepal's largest city exceed world pollution standards. The
Canadian magazine Alternatives reports that the towering Himalayan peaks
encircling the bowl-shaped Kath-mandu Valley create a wind-block that traps
pollution. The study concludes that owners of Kathmandu's aging buses and
three-wheeled taxis using two-stroke engines must implement emissions control
devices or Nepal's Shangri La could surpass even Mexico City in airborne filth.

<A NAME="Wise"><H2>Wise Use Down Under</H2>

New Zealand -- Forest and Bird, the magazine of the Wellington-based Forest and
Bird Protection Society, charges that a US-owned timber firm called MRGC(NZ)
"is riding cowboy-like over local law and convention in the clearance of native
vegetation for pine plantations." MRGC has cleared more than 200 hectares (494
acres) of native kanuka, manuka and shrublands in the Wairau Valley without
obtaining the proper permits from New Zealand's Conservation Department. The
company also "inadvertently" flattened four hectares (ten acres) of the Mt.
Richmond Forest Park, for which it could suffer an NZ$80,000 ($59,376) fine.
Forest and Bird recommends contacting MRGC's Norm Schaaf [PO Box 2498, Port
Angeles, WA 98362; fax 360-452-6224] to demand that the company recognize the
New Zealand Forest Accord that protects the manuka and kanuka forests.

<A NAME="Butterflies"><H2>Butterflies Aren't Free</H2>

India -- The Environment Ministry has moved to protect Indian butterfly and
moth species under the government's Wildlife Act in an attempt to prevent
smuggling of the winged insects. The CUTS Newsletter reports that the ministry
has provided a detailed identification chart for customs officials to help them
thwart the bug-smugglers. This protective measure came after two German
tourists were caught trying to leave the country with 15,000 preserved
butterflies and moths in their luggage.

<A NAME="Unleaded"><H2>Unleaded, Please</H2>

Canada -- The Canadian government announced in July that it will ban the use of
lead shot and fishing weights in May 1997 in an effort to reduce toxic
pollution in  wetlands and waterways critical to migratory birds. The US banned
lead shot in 1991 and will outlaw lead sinkers this year. BBC Wildlife reports
that the North American example is being followed in Europe, where the British
government has asked hunters to give up toxic shot voluntarily.

<A NAME="Gambling"><H2>Gambling on Debt</H2>

USA -- More than 2000 protesters gathered outside the World Bank's Washington
DC headquarters in October to condemn the bank's structural adjustment
programs, claiming that the policies devastate developing countries. The
protests, which coincided with the World Bank's annual meeting, attracted both
Southern and Northern activists, says Toward Freedom. World Bank programs have
"turned the economies of developing nations into casinos for foreign
investors," said former Mexican Finance Ministry official Carlos Heredia.
"Mexico was the biggest casino of them all."

<A NAME="Nuke"><H2>Nuke Ship Turns Over New Leaf</H2>

Japan -- Japan's first nuclear-powered ship is being retrofitted with a
conventional power plant and put to work researching global climate changes,
according to Revealing Japan. The Mutsu suffered a radiation leak during its
maiden voyage in 1974 and did not sail again until 1991. Japan will spend Yen20
billion ($214 million) to replace the nuclear reactor with a conventional power
plant. In 1997, the Mutsu will begin its new role as the world's largest marine
observation ship by laying 35 recording buoys in the equatorial Pacific to
collect data that will further the study of El Nino and other meteorological
phenomena.

<A NAME="Poland"><H2>Poland's Royal Forest Is Spared</H2>

Poland -- In July, Poland's General Director of National Forests approved an
immediate moratorium on logging trees from the Bialowieza Primeval Forest,
Europe's last lowland old-growth forest, which straddles Poland and Belarussia.
According to Native Forest Network [NFN, PO Box 8251, Missoula, MT 59807] the
logging ban is an important first step toward converting the entire forest into
a national park. The 1400-sq-km (560-sq-mi) forest was formerly the protected
hunting preserve for Polish, Russian and Lithuanian royalty until the
early-1900s, when a budding timber industry started extracting trees.
Belarussia has protected all 800 sq km (320 sq mi) of its forest domain, but
only 47 sq km (18.8 sq mi) on the Polish side has been set aside as a core
reserve. "The logging moratorium gives us a lot of breathing room, but no one
campaigning for the Bialowieza can rest until it is per-manently protected as a
national park," said NFN's Tom Fullum. NFN is urging people to write letters in
support of Bialowieza to Polish Prime Minister Josef Olesky [Urzad Rady,
Ministrow, 00-902 Warsaw, Poland; fax 48-2-628-4222].

<A NAME="Hemp"><H2>Hemp, Hemp, Hurray!</H2>

Canada -- The government has issued a total of nine licenses authorizing
Canadian farmers to grow industrial hemp for paper and clothing production.
Five of the permits went to farmers in Manitoba, where Agriculture Minister
Harry Enns is enthusiastic about the crop's economic potential. The province
funded a $25,000 experimental growing program that produced low-THC hemp on ten
acres of Manitoba farmland. The program was an attempt to learn "what this
plant can do and to see what varieties are commercially viable," said Martin
Moravcik of the Manitoba Hemp Alliance. The Manitoba-based Eco-Journal reports
that the province could become North America's hemp-production center. In
Australia, meanwhile, the state of Victoria has authorized hemp farmers to
plant ten field trials over the next ten years. New Delhi-based Down to Earth
reports that hemp's "amazing potential [for] paper-making, fabrics, food, oil
and herbal remedies -- makes it too precious to be abandoned."<BR>--JS<P>

<A NAME="Bosnia"><H2>Bosnia and the Oil Connection</H2>

Bosnia -- San Francisco Chronicle reporters Frank Viviano and Kenneth Howe have
discovered that "major oil firms conducted field studies in the former Yugoslav
republic before 1992 under the auspices of the World Bank." Coal and oil
deposits reportedly were located beneath a 300-mile geologic zone known as the
Dinarides Thrust -- "the primary battlefront of [last] summer's massive
Croatian Army offensives against rebel Serbs...." AGIP, the Italian state-owned
petroleum company is already drilling for oil in waters off the Croatian
Adriatic, and the Chicago-based Amoco oil company established a Bosnian
subsidiary in 1989. According to Vivano and Howe, the results of the
multinationals' field studies "have since vanished from the Ministry of Energy
in Sarajevo" and are now believed to be in the possession of the Serbs.

<A NAME="US"><H2>US to Resume Nuclear Testing</H2>

USA -- In November, the US Department of Energy announced plans to detonate six
"hydronuclear" blasts at the Nevada Test Site. The first test, code named
"Rebound," is set for June 18, 1996. Hydronuclear tests involve high explosives
and a nuclear component such as plutonium. The US maintains that, because the
tests have no "nuclear yield," they are not nuclear explosions. Anti-nuclear
groups condemned the US decision, contending that it makes a mockery of the
global moratorium on nuclear testing. Such explosions can, in fact, produce a
small fission reaction. Greenpeace New Zealand campaigner Stephanie Mills
warned that such tests "could be a death knell for the compre-hensive test ban
talks" slated for early 1996. Environmentalists are urging President Clinton to
halt the tests and keep his promise to uphold the US moratorium.

<A NAME="Near"><H2>Near Melt-Down Revealed in UK</H2>

UK (Via EcoNet) -- On July 31, 1993, Reactor 1 at the Wylfa nuclear power
station on the island of Anglesey in North Wales came close to a melt-down.
During routine refueling, part of a crane broke and fell into the reactor,
causing a blockage. Nuclear Electric, the plant's operator, initially rated the
problem "zero" on an international scale used for assessing nuclear events (the
top of the scale, a seven, is reserved for disasters like Chernobyl). Two years
after the fact, Nuclear Electric officials admitted that they had waited nearly
ten hours before shutting the reactor down. According to a BBC-TV report last
September report recorded by the Media Monitoring and Transcription Service,
the delay occurred because the managers "put money before safety." A Crown
Court was told that "only luck" prevented a reactor core melt-down. The
government-owned utility ultimately pleaded guilty to four violations of
Britain's Health and Safety Act. The BBC reported that the revelation "comes at
a highly sensitive time for the nuclear industry as it heads towards
privatization."

<A NAME="Sabotaged"><H2>Sabotaged Reporter Wins Suit</H2>

USA -- In 1986, San Francisco reporter J. A. Savage was fired from her job as
West coast correspondent of McGraw-Hill's Energy User News and subsequently
kicked off the nuclear-power beat by her new employers at the
Knight-Ridder-owned Journal of Commerce. Savage discovered that her employment
problems stemmed from phone calls placed by officials at Pacific Gas & Electric
(PG&E), who objected to Savage's past work as an anti-nuclear activist. Savage
sued for damages, charging slander, libel and contract interference. In
November, after an eight-year battle, PG&E agreed to settle out of court. As
San Francisco Bay Guardian publisher and PG&E critic Bruce Brugmann observed,
Savage's victory "established a major First Amendment precedent protecting
reporters and the free press. We are all in her debt."

<A NAME="The"><H2>The Colonel Bombs in Bangalore</H2>

India -- Pepsi Foods Ltd.'s attempt to open the first Kentucky Fried Chicken
outlet in Karnataka state has run afoul of the Ban-galore City Corporation. The
Colonel's "secret recipe" was found to contain impermissibly high levels of
monosodium glutamate. KFC was also condemned by the State Farmers'
Organization, former Indian Environment Minister Maneka Gandhi and Vandana
Shiva, director of the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Natural
Resource Policy. Gandhi and Shiva warned against the health, cultural and
environmental risks of admit-ting "junk food" conglomerates into India.

<A NAME="EPA"><H2>EPA's PCB Cover-up</H2>

USA -- The Missouri-based Times Beach Action Group (TBAG) has charged that at
least one fourth of the dioxin-contaminated soil from a 1972 chemical spill at
Times Beach, Missouri also contains polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in
concentrations up to a thousand times higher than the levels of dioxin.
According to the Compost-Dispatch newsletter [Gateway Green Alliance, PO Box
8094, St. Louis, MO 63156], records uncovered by TBAG suggest that "the EPA has
participated with corporations in a cover-up that spans at least two decades."
Compost-Dispatch reports that one letter confirms that the EPA and Monsanto
scientists shared "lab reports and physical samples" as early as the summer of
1972. The documents reveal that the EPA has been aware of PCB contamination in
the Times Beach soil for more than 20 years and secretly worked with scientists
at Monsanto's research labs to test soil samples for contamination a decade
before the government ordered the evacuation of Times Beach residents.<P>

<A NAME="Canadian"><H2>Canadian Cod-Saver Jailed</H2>

Canada -- On October 10, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society head Paul Watson was
convicted of "simple mischief" and sentenced to serve 30 days in a
maximum-security jail in Newfoundland. Watson was found guilty of firing a
fusillade of stink bombs to prevent a Cuban trawler from fishing in the
spawning grounds of the endangered North Atlantic cod. Watson was cleared of
two charges of criminal mischief and fined $35. The judge admitted that many
Canadians saw Watson as a "patriot," but ordered him  jailed to send the
message that "no Canadian has the right to take the law into their own hands."
One year after Watson's action, the Canadian government began boarding foreign
ships and arresting fishing crews in the Grand Banks. "Instead of going to
jail," author Farley Mowat (Never Cry Wolf) objected, "Paul Watson should be
given the Order of Canada, the highest civilian award."

<A NAME="Free"><H2>Free Trade Buys a Country</H2>

Costa Rica -- "In the last two years," reports InterPress Service, "more than
ten of Costa Rica's largest companies have been sold to transnational
corporations." CPC International, the world's third-largest food company,
bought out Productos Lizano, maker of the country's most popular brand of
tomato sauce. Phillip Morris wrested control of chocolate and jam maker El
Gallito Industrial (which had been owned by the same family since 1909).
Foreign companies have also seized control of the country's largest bakery, ice
cream maker and tuna cannery. Nestle, the multinational food giant, reportedly
is prepared to take over the country's Milk Producers
Cooperative.<BR>		-- GS

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: Light Snacks: Eat 'em or Heat 'em</TITLE>

<H1>Light Snacks: Eat 'em or Heat 'em</H1>

Everyone knows that "food is fuel," but when it comes to some of the most popular
corporate snack foods, the catch-phrase is more than a metaphor. While nacho
chips may be intended to go down the hatch, at the touch of a match, they will
also go up in smoke. The fact is that some tortilla chips can take off like wood
chips.<P>

The <B>Journal</B> recently put some of the most hotly advertised corporate crackers and
chips to a competitive test. The goal was to answer the burning question: "Which
snack offers more combustibility-for-the-buck?" To settle the matter, we
conducted, not a bake-off, but a "flame-off."<P>

Our initial tests -- pitting two popular crackers against two popular chips --
produced the following results.<P>

Under standard, laboratory flame-off conditions, a Triscuit wafer burned for 15
seconds, a Cheez-It flickered for 46 seconds, a Frito-Lay potato chip flared for
1.3 minutes and a Dorito burned with a steady orange flame for an amazing 3.5
minutes. While the crackers were merely singed, the potato and corn chips both
burned vigorously. The Dorito was almost totally consumed.<P>

A six-ounce, 120-chip bag of Frito-Lay potato chips contains 60 grams of fat,
nearly matching theUS recommended 65-gram "daily value" (DV) for fat intake.
While fat comprises more that one-third of every bag of chips, there is no
Surgeon General's warning not to eat an entire bag in a single day. Instead,
Frito-Lay bags sport a cartoon of Bugs Bunny challeng-ing: "Betcha Can't Eat Just
One, (TM) Doc."<P>

Another problem: Dr. Michael F. Jaco-son of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest (CSPI) notes that "the bad trans fat is not included" on nutrition
labels.<P>

A single Dorito is a virtual "fat grenade." A 4.5-ounce, 50-chip bag of Doritos
contains 31 grams of fat, nearly half the DV total. But there is more to a Dorito
than fat. Following the flame-off test, the burn site revealed that the
incinerated chip left behind a long trail of a slick, sticky fluid. The oily
track resembled grease but, because it had not burned, it could not have been
fat. A spokesperson at Dorito headquarters in Texas had no idea what the mystery
residue was.<P>

If Doritos are one-quarter fat while potato chip are one-third fat, why do
Doritos out-flame chips? The spokesperson had an answer: Doritos are "much
thicker than a potato chip" and spuds are "full of water."<P>

Based on <B>EIJ</B>'s "flame-off" tests, campers would be well advised to carry Doritos
along on their next wilderness expedition -- not for food, but for starting
campfires. (Why use woodchips when corn chips will do? It's better for the
forests and it's certainly better for your health.)<P>

And here's a tip for the confirmed urbanite: the next time the power fails, don't
bother fumbling around for candles. Just light a Dorito. 			 -- GS<P>

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: Pesticide Protest Targets Markets</TITLE>

<H1>Pesticide Protest Targets Markets</H1>

Last November, Food & Water, Inc. (FWI), a grassroots food safety organization,
launched a national campaign to convince supermarkets to stop selling foods grown
with toxic and carcinogenic chemicals.<P>

"We're going directly to the supermarket industry to stop toxic pesticides," FWI
explained. The targeted supermarket chains are Albertson's, Safeway, Hy-Vee,
Kroger, Winn-Dixie, Grand Union and Shaw's.<P>

By selling fruits and vegetables grown with dangerous chemicals, supermarket
corporations enable agribusiness to steadily increase its use of dangerous
pesticides. Meanwhile, supermarket corporations have lobbied the  government to
ease pesticide regulations. As a result, federal regulators currently assess risk
without considering real-life factors, such as multiple exposures to different
pesticides and children's increased sensitivity to toxic chemicals.<P>

"Despite what we know about how toxic pesticides are poisoning us and our
environment, federal regulations still protect corporations, not people," said
FWI executive director Michael Colby. "But when the public calls on supermarket
corporations to do something about the pesticide problem, supermarkets will
answer... We're going to do what Washington won't."<P>

Food & Water promoted the campaign last summer and fall with advertisements in
<B>The New York Times</B> and other national publications highlighting the connections
between increased pesticide use and rising cancer rates.<P>

The US cancer rate is approaching one in 2.5. Cancer incidence has increased
almost 50 percent in the last 50 years. At the same time, pesticide use in the US
has grown almost 33 times. In 1993, at least 71 active ingredients in pesticides
used on US food crops were known to cause cancer in humans or animals.<P>

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: Chindogu Awards</TITLE>

<H1>Chindogu Awards</H1>

<I>Chindogu</I> is the Japanese-word for a "completely worthless invention." The
Journal salutes two new Chindogu Award winners.

<H2>Hooked on Petrol</H2>

Worried about your electric vehicle (EV) running out of electrons? Fisher
Electric Motor Technology, Inc. has just what you need. The <B>Fisher Ranger</B>,
an electrical generator that hooks to the back of a car, produces 13.5 kW of
power to recharge your EV as you tool down the road. Some purists might be
bothered by the fact that the Ranger's 20 hp motor is fueled by gasoline.<P>

<H2>Checkout Clerks, Please Check-Out</H2>

Symbol Technologies Inc. believes that its hand-held <B>Portable Personal Shopper</B>
will help "speed shoppers through the checkout line" by allowing them to scan
package prices directly as they pluck items off the shelves. Store managers love
the concept: it should lower overhead costs by helping to speed checkout
personnel to the unemployment line.<P>

<H2>Old Chindogus Never Die</H2>

Last year, Sandia Labs made news (and our last <B>Chindogu</B> list) by
demonstrating a "<B>Goo Gun</B>" designed to immobilize people under streams of
sticky, swelling foam. Were US tax dollars well-spent on this technology? The
question might better be: were tax dollars <B>re</B>-spent on this technology?
The <B>Journal</B> recently uncovered a Sandia Labs document bragging about the
"Taffy Machine," which generates "a sticky foam personnel barrier [that] quickly
fills the protected area, leaving little room for the intruder to maneuver." The
document is dated January 8, 1979. Congrats to Sandia for showing how easy it is
to make big bucks through recycling. (Goo-guns, meanwhile, are slated for use by

<H1>McDonald's in Cyberspace</H1>

USA -- The McDonald's Corporation is now on-line. "McFamily," a "family-friendly
computer community" featuring "information about parenting" leavened with
corporate plugs and a catalog of "McStuff" for sale via an 800-number.
McFamily's "Hey Kids" activity area offers downloadable computer games,
contests and news on upcoming Happy Meals.<P>

David Green, McDonald's senior vice president for marketing, predicted that
McFamily "will provide us with a new way to communicate and build stronger
relationships with our customers." "McFacts About McDonald's" answers
frequently asked questions and puts a positive spin on "McDonald's and the
environment."<P>

A "Share A Thought" feature invites users to "submit their own contributions."
There is little chance of any anti-McDonald's opinions making it into the
corporate chat room. All suggestions "will be reviewed by the McFamily editor
before they are posted."<P>

Meanwhile, in London, the two-year-old "McLibel Trial" of two activists charged
with slandering the multinational food giant (</B A HREF="?">Winter '94-95 EIJ</A>), has now
become the longest trial in the history of the British Empire.

<H1>US Patents Human Beings</H1>

USA -- In 1995, the National Institutes of Health patented the genes of a member
of the Indigenous Hagahai tribe in Papua New Guinea (US patent 5,397,696),
marking the first time that any country has claimed genetic ownership of a
citizen of another country. A Solomon Islands citizen is also subject to a
similar US patent.<P>

The genetic material was obtained by the Human Genome Diversity Project (dubbed
the "Vampire Project"), which seeks to collect blood and tissue samples from
more than 700 Indigenous groups. While UN-ESCO's Bioethics Committee is opposed
to such acts of "bio-colonialism," US Department of Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown has declared that "Under our laws... human cells [are] patentable...." <P>

"The veneer of the HGDP as an acade-mic, non-commercial exercise has been
shattered," the Rural Advancement Foundation International declared. RAFI noted
that a California-based firm has already sold blood drawn from Tristan De Cunha
islanders to Germany's Boeh-ringer Ingelheim medical firm for $70 million.
"This patent is another major step down the road to the commodification of
life," said RAFI's Pat Roy Mooney. RAFI is preparing a World Court challenge to
the patenting of human genetic material.<P>

<H1>The Sun Can Save a Million Lives</H1>

USA -- Two million children die each year because one billion of the Earth's
people lack access to safe drinking water. When a cholera epidemic hit Peru in
1994, health officials ordered residents to boil drinking water for ten
minutes. Unfortunately, doing so would consume nearly one-third of a poor
household's income. In countries lacking utilities, water must be boiled by
burning firewood, coal or coke. Because it takes a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of
wood to boil each liter (1.1 quarts) of water, the result is often rampant
deforestation.<P>

But it is not necessary to boil water to prevent disease. It is now known that
"solar water pasteurization" can kill disease-causing microbes. Temperatures of
149* F (65* C) -- far below the boiling point of 212* F (100* C) -- are
sufficient to kill worms, giardia, E. coli, cholera, polioviruses and the
hepatitis A virus.<P>

While these temperatures can be obtained easily in cheap, simply built solar
box cookers, it is difficult to determine precisely when the device becomes hot
enough to pasteurize the water. It is easy to see when water boils, but
impossible to see when a microbe dies.<P>

<B>Solar Box Journal</B> [7036 18th Avenue, NE, Seattle, WA 98115] recently announced
a breakthrough that should make "solar pasteurization" as simple and safe as
boiling water.<P>

A water pasteurization indicator consisting of a clear plastic tube filled with
solidified soybean fat is placed in the bottom of the water container. When the
water temperature reaches 69* C., the fat melts and the water is safe to drink.
Dr. Bob Metcalf at Solar Cookers International [1324 43rd St., Sacramento, CA
95819] reports that it "takes about four hours to pasteurize a gallon of water
in the summer." Metcalf notes that these cheap temperature tubes will protect
lives and "save much fuel... wasted by excessive heating."

<A NAME="Whales"><H2>No More Whales in 100 Years?</H2>

United Kingdom -- The London-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA)
[1611 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Suite 3B, Washington, DC 20009; (202) 483-6621]
has warned of "a major environmental catastrophe" that could lead to the
extinction of 12 species of great whales and 69 other whale and dolphin
species. Whales are being "starved as global warming destroys aquatic
ecosystems and overfishing decimates their food supply," EIA charged. Toxic
wastes, heavy metals and organochlorines continue to pour into the seas, and
EIA cites new evidence that whales are now being "scorched by UV-B radiation"
coming through the hole in the ozone layer. EIA concluded that the Earth's
"whales, dolphins and porpoises are threatened with absolute extinction within
the next century unless action is taken now."

<A NAME="Sagebrush"><H2>Sagebrush on the Summits?</H2>

USA -- For the last five years, scientists at the University of California at
Berkeley (UCB) have been baking a 9580-foot-high meadow in the Colorado Rockies
under the glare of infrared heat lamps. The lamps are meant to duplicate the
3-8 degree Fahrenheit (1.5 to 4.5*C) temperature rise predicted over the next
50 years due to global warming. "To get an idea of the effect of global warming
could have on mountain meadows," UCB energy and resources professor John Harte
explained, "imagine the opening scenes of <B>The Sound of Music</B> filmed outside
Elko, Nevada." Under the influence of the heat lamps, sagebrush typically found
2000 feet lower on the mountain replaced the meadow's lush carpet of flowers.
Harte notes that since "sagebrush absorbs more sunlight than most forbs
[non-woody flowing plants] it replaces," this could trigger "a positive
feedback, causing more warming."

<A NAME="Weed"><H2>Weed Rather Dye</H2>

India -- In the late 1960s, the pesky Mexican banmara weed (<I>Euphatorium
adenophorum</I>) reached South Asia along with a load of wheat shipped under a US
food-aid program. Banmara took root and flourished, invading woodlands,
pastures and tea gardens, defying all eradication attempts. <B>Himal</B> magazine
reports that Darjeeling environmentalist Umesh Dwivedi has a plan "to turn this
ecological menace into a resource that can be used for the economic benefit of
rural folks, employment generation and eco-friendly industrial development."
The plant has been found to produce a "commercially viable" green dye. Dwivedi
also has managed to process banmara into handmade paper.

<A NAME="Hazed"><H2>Hazed and Confused</H2>

USA -- Scientist Forest M. Mims III has warned that a hazy or cloudy sky can be
more dangerous than a clear sky to sun-sensitive amphibians. "A very hazy sky
can be the source for between 85 and 90 percent of the UV-B striking Earth,
with only between 10 and 15 percent coming directly from the sun," Mims
informed <B>New Scientist</B>. Frog eggs are known to be harmed by exposure to UV-B
and, with hazy air now found over major portions of the US and Europe, Mims
believes that "shade-seeking organisms probably now receive considerably more
UV-B than before the industrial era."

<A NAME="Fertilizing"><H2>Fertilizing Frogs to Death</H2>

United Kingdom -- Every spring, British farmers spread 1.8 million tons of
ammonium nitrate fertilizer granules over their fields -- at just about the time
that frogs begin migrating. After witnessing the "horrific" deaths of frogs
that blundered into fields salted with nitrates, Rob Oldham of Leicester's De
Monttort University established a link between the use of chemical fertilizers
and what <B>BBC Wildlife</B> has called a "massive epidemic of frog deaths in the UK."
Oldham believes that "by being absorbed, the fertilizers affect the balance of
chemicals in [the frogs'] moist skin. They suffer a massive toxic attack." If
true, frogs risk being fertilized to death not only in the UK, but also around
the world.

<A NAME="No"><H2>No More Bull...</H2>

Mexico -- Representatives of more than 350 animal rights groups from 75
countries gathered in Mexico City last October for Latin America's first-ever
Conference to End Bullfighting. Animal activist Bridgitte Bardot called
bullfighting "a cruel, archaic and degrading spectacle." The World Society for
the Protection of Animals [29 Perkins St., PO Box 190, Boston, MA 02130; (617)
522-7000] convened the conference under the slogan "Torture is NOT Culture."
Mexico, the heart of Latin America's bullfighting culture, boasts the world's
largest bullfighting ring and Mexico's bullfighting establishment did not take
kindly to the conference. Three hotels refused to host the conference and the
meeting proceeded under threats of violence.

<A NAME="Do"><H2>Do Released Fish Survive?</H2>

USA -- "Release-fishing is catching on as never before," reports <B>Marlin: the
International Sportfishing Magazine</B> [PO Box 2456, 330 W. Canton Avenue, Winter
Park, FL 32789-3195]. As populations of ocean fish plummet, "a growing number
of anglers are releasing fish voluntarily in order to conserve fish. 'Limiting
their kill,' as they say, instead of 'killing their limit.' " But if those fish
do not survive the trauma of capture, <B>Marlin</B> notes, catch-and-release "becomes
just a 'feel-good' gesture and nothing more." A fish that swims away after
being released may look like a "survivor," but 24 hours later, it could be
dead. To improve the chances of survival, <B>Marlin</B> suggests using high-speed
lures rather than baited, barbed hooks. Hooks containing toxic tin and cadmium
should be avoided, and a fish should not be fought to the point of exhaustion.

<A NAME="Nuclear"><H2>Nuclear Plant's "Quasimodo Fish"</H2>

Taiwan -- Fishing has been banned near the cooling-system outlet of the Taiwan
Power Corporation's Number Two nuclear plant, but Fan Jeng-Tang, of the Taiwan
Environmental Protection Union, decided to see what he could reel in. <B>Nuclear
Report from Taiwan</B> published photos of mutated therapon -- a fish that usually
reaches ten centimeters. Today the fish never grow larger than 5-6 centimeters.
They also are distinguished by twisted bodies and "a disgusting lump resembling
a camel's hump." Local fishermen claim that they regularly find these "Q-fish"
(short for "Quasimodo-fish") floating dead on the waters near the General
Electric-built nuclear plant. The most likely culprits are the excessively high
temperatures produced by cooling water flowing out of the plant. Shellfish and
seaweed also have nearly disappeared from the vicinity.

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: Mexico's Deadlist Predator?</TITLE>

<H1>Mexico's Deadlist Predator?</H1>

Mexico -- Jorge Hank Rhon, the son of former Mexican cabinet minister and
billionaire Carlos Hank Gonzales, loves wildlife -- dead or alive. "Animals are
my only vice," Hank likes to brag. That may be an understatement. According to
<B>Latinamerica Press</B> reporter John Ross, Hank is "one of Mexico's premier
traffickers in rare and endangered species."<P>

Last year, Hank was caught at Mexico City's International Airport with a dozen
suitcases filled with ivory tusks and two ocelot-skin coats. It takes six
ocelots to make a single coat. Despite the fact that ocelots are an endangered
species in Mexico (there are only 300 left in the country), Hank was held only
a few hours.<P>

Mexico boasts the world's greatest number of mammal (448) and reptile (717)
species, but 34 percent of the mammal population now faces extinction due to
the pressures of development, pollution, hunting and animal traffickers like
Hank.<P>

Hank and David Ibarra, the son of a former finance minister, opened Promotora
Beta, an exotic pet emporium that displayed endangered birds and manatees.
Investigators from the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) found that 40 percent of Promotora's exotic
birds were endangered species. In 1989, Promotora Beta served as a way-station
in an international conspiracy to ship endangered birds from Indonesia, through
Singapore, Japan, Spain and Costa Rica. The birds (as many as 500 a month) were
then smuggled into the US aboard private yachts, netting $2 million a month.<P>

Hank has a way of surviving criticism. An inspection into Promotora Beta's sale
of puma cubs ended abruptly when the lead inspector was mysteriously murdered.
In 1988, Hector Felix Miranda, a columnist for the Tijuana weekly Zeta, was
gunned down by two of Hank's security guards after writing too many critical
columns. The guards were sent to prison for 25 years. Hank avoided
investigation.<P>

Hank and Ibarra also hatched plans for a wild animal park called Reino Aventura
and illegally acquired an orca to serve as their star attraction. The park was
sold to Mexico's media conglomerate Tele-visa and the whale, "Keiko," went on
to international fame as the star of the film <A HREF="../immp/keiko.html">Free Willy</A>.<P>

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: Bomb Blasts Turtle Activists</TITLE>

<H1>Bomb Blasts Turtle Activists</H1>

Greece -- Last summer, the Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece [STPS, 35
Solomou Street, GR-106 82 Athens, Greece; tel/fax: 01-3844 146] presented a
petition signed by 51,000 tourists demanding that the Greek government
establish a National Marine Park on the island of Zakynthos, the most important
Mediterranean nesting site for loggerhead turtles. The government, which has
been slow to resist powerful development interests, now risks being taken
before the European Court for failing to demolish a number of illegal buildings
constructed on a nesting beach.<P>

Over the last five years, Zakynthos' turtle defenders have been shot at and
beaten and their offices have been set afire. Verbal harassment and telephone
threats increased over the summer as the Zakynthos prefectural council prepared
to approve a plan to create a marine park at Laganas bay, a critical nesting
beach for the loggerhead turtle (<I>Caretta caretta</I>).<P>

On September 29, five days before the scheduled prefectural council vote, 1.5
kilos (3.3 lbs.) of dynamite were placed on the roof of the STPS and Zakynthos
Ecological Movement (ZOK) office. The terrorist bomb ripped into the building
while 15 ZOK staffers and three children were working on the organization's
newsletter. Most escaped serious injury, but architect Nikos Lykouresis, one of
ZOK's founding members, was wounded.<P>

Local activists reported via EcoNet that environmentalists "have been the
target of an unprecedented defamation campaign led by local politicians closely
tied with interest groups opposed to any regulations on the tourist development
of Zakynthos' coastal areas." Only hours before the attack, the EcoNet dispatch
noted, one pro-development politician called for "throwing all ecologists out
of Zakynthos."<P>

Greenpeace spokesman Elias Efthimio-poulos complained that the local police had
"tolerated" violence against the environmentalists and had "at times, reversed
reality by treating the victims as villains."<P>

Such acts of hostility, however, are not typical. According to the <B>Athens
News</B> "most Zakynthos residents, as well as the local hoteliers' chamber,
support the marine park." The European Union has also promised funding for the
proposed park.<P>

Despite the bombing, park advocates remained optimistic. As the October 4 vote
neared, it was expected that the park plan would be passed. To everyone's
shock, however, the council rejected the Environment Ministry's proposal,
calling instead for more "dialogue." The council's turnaround could doom any
chance of progress on creating the marine park -- GS

<H1>The "Next Clayoquot Sound"</H1>

Canada -- On September 28, three hereditary Nuxalk chiefs were jailed for 23 days
after blocking a logging road under construction in the Fog Creek region of
British Columbia's King Island.<P>

International Forest Products (Interfor) plans to log 2340 forest acres over
the next 30 years. The chiefs claim that the sales are illegal since the
2000-member Nuxalk tribe never signed a treaty with the Canadian government and
never ceded its sovereignty. "We have exhausted all domestic efforts," chief Ed
Moody declared. "Our only recourse is international opinion."<P>

"As hereditary chiefs, it is our obligation to protect this land for our
children and grandchildren," said Chief Charlie Nelson. "At one time, the
wildlife, fish and plants of our land supported 30,000 people," Moody declared.
"Why would we want to embrace the corporate alternative [when the] monetary
option hasn't worked?" Nuxalk elder Lawrence Pootlass pointed out that the
timber sale encompasses a Nuxalk sacred site -- the spot where tribal lore holds
that the first woman descended to Earth from heaven.<P>

Interfor Vice President Fred Lowenberger sees no reason not to log the area.
"The rate of reproduction growth is incredible in this part of the world," he
told the <B>San Francisco Chronicle</B>. "You could pave the forest and it would still
come back."<P>

On December 5, the chiefs and 19 other Nuxalk elders and supporters, including
members of the Forest Action Network, walked out on their Supreme Court trial.<P>

"The court was forcing us into their system and handcuffing our sovereignty,"
chief Moody explained. "The white man's court system cannot define our people.
Our law allows us to protect our land; their law allows destruction."<P>

Supreme Court Justice Smith refused to issue arrest warrants and rescheduled
the trial for January 15.

<H1>Farmers Snub US; Tokyo Retaliates</H1>

Ryukyu -- Although they comprise less than one percent of Japan's territory,
Okinawa's 125 islands host 75 of the 100 US bases and two-thirds of the 45,500
US soldiers in Japan. Much of the islands' best agricultural land now lies
buried beneath US barracks, roads and airfields.<P>

"Toxic wastes and other forms of pollution from military industries have
destroyed much of the islands' environment," reports Antonia Levi, a professor
of history and Asian studies at Whitman College in Washington state. "Noise
from firing ranges is a constant irritant and accidents from unexploded shells
are a fact of life."<P>

The rape of a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl, allegedly by three US soldiers,
has become a symbol of what many Okinawans see as the abuse of their homeland
by the US military. Until it was annexed by Japan in 1869, the region was known
as Ryukyu -- the name still preferred by the native people. After WW II, the US
set up a puppet government and occupied Okinawa as a military staging area. The
US returned Okinawa to Japan's control in 1972.<P>

With the first of the Pentagon's leases on private land in Okinawa set to
expire in March, 2937 farmers and landowners have vowed not to renew their
contracts.<P>

A US military intelligence-gathering site sits on a 200-sq-meter (2200 sq. ft.)
plot of land owned by 47-year-old Shoichi Chibana. Chibana has refused to renew
the lease, the first set to expire. "We don't need any military bases in
Okinawa," Chibana told the Japan Times. The land was given to him by his
father, a pacifist who was forced to lease the land to the US in 1972.<P>

Chibana contends that the US-Japan security treaty "violates [Japan's] pacifist
Constitution," which bans military collaboration with other nations.<P>

In 1972, Okinawan pacifists began selling small strips of land as a means of
thwarting expropriation attempts. Today nearly 3000 people lay claim to 1557
sq. meters (17,127 sq. ft.) inside Kadena air base and another 67 sq. meters
(737 sq. ft.) at Futenma air base.<P>

In November, under increasing US pressure to resolve the dispute, Japanese
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama began steps to force landowners to renew the
leases. When Okinawan Governor Masahide Ota refused to authorize the leases,
Murayama began a legal process to overrule the local government and force the
farmers to comply. Ota has vowed to raise "constitutional questions" about
Murayama's actions.<P>

Many Japanese are questioning the need and the cost of a continued US armed
presence. Japan Times reports that Japan pays 70 percent of the expense of
maintaining US troops on its soil, a sum estimated to top Yen625 billion ($6.7
billion) a year.<P>

"The real threat for all countries is the instability caused by poverty,"
international affairs writer Yoko Kitagawa informed the San Francisco
Chronicle. Kitagawa is among a growing number of Japanese citizens that
believes the money Japan spends on supporting the US military would be better
spent on domestic social welfare programs.<BR>-- GS

<H1>US Radiation Expert Beats Ban</H1>

United Kingdom -- A leading American scientist, who has challenged the medical
and nuclear establishments on the dangers of low-level radiation, is at the
center of a dispute over his latest research.<P>

On the basis of detailed scientific analysis, Dr. John Gofman, Professor
Emeritus of Molecular and Cell Biology in the University of California at
Berkeley, concluded that approximately three-quarters of current cases of
breast cancer in the US are caused by previous exposure to ionizing radiation --
primarily medical X-rays. Cancer cases being diagnosed now, he says, can be
attributed to exposure from as many as 40 years ago.<P>

Gofman says breast cancer is a largely preventable disease. But he stresses
that this does not mean that women should avoid X-rays when needed. The problem
is that many radiology units give patients ten, 20 or even 50 times the dose
needed to obtain a good X-ray image. Because government authorities have set
radiation exposure levels far higher than warranted, Gofman maintains, they do
not accept that these dose levels constitute a serious risk.<P>

Soon after publication of the results in his 1995 book, <B>Preventing Breast
Cancer</B> [Committee for Nuclear Responsibility, PO Box 421993, San Francisco, CA.
1995], Britain's 20-20 Television approached Gofman with plans for a
documentary on his findings, with supporting evidence from research in the US,
Israel and Britain.<P>

A storm broke out when <B>20-20 Television</B> asked Britain's official radiation
watchdog, the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), to take part in
the program. The NRPB refused, saying, "We feel Dr. Gofman's report is so poor
that we do not want to be associated with it." It then released information to
London newspapers designed to undermine the credibility of Gofman and the
proposed documentary.<P>

The NRPB even approached Britain's TV authorities seeking to have the program
banned, but were rebuffed.<P>

The film, <B>The X-Ray Effect</B>, was broadcast nationwide in Britain on August 3. In
it, the associate director of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation in
Hiroshima described Gofman as "a superb analyst [who] has always been at the
cutting edge of medical science, particularly when it comes to protecting
people."<P>

In a point-by-point rebuttal of the agency's criticisms, Gofman stated that
some of the arguments are simply untrue, while others misrepresented his
argument or ignored evidence in order to reach lower risk estimates that give
poorer protection of public health.<P>

"[I] agree that [my] estimates are indeed some ten times higher than those of
the NRPB," Gofman stated. "But no valid scientific analysis of the evidence
could possibly lead to the underestimates of the NRPB."<P>

Why has Britain's radiation watchdog gone to such lengths to stifle debate on
this issue? Gofman himself is clear: "Aside from the general activity of NRPB
in protecting the nuclear and radiology programs in the UK, there is a very
specific reason: they have not done the job they were supposed to be doing."<P>

<H1>Tropical Dams and Global Warming</H1>

"Hydropower plants produce no carbon dioxide... no air emissions at all."<BR>

-- US Department of Energy, 1994<P>

<HR>

In June 1995, Alison Bartle, co-editor of <B>The International Journal on
Hydropower & Dams</B>, told a dam-builders conference: "Each kilowatt-hour produced
from a gas-fired plant is accompanied by 600 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions and for each kWh from a coal-fired plant the figure is as high as
1000 grams. The figure for a unit produced by hydro is, of course, zero."<P>

New research by Philip Fearnside, however, refutes dam industry claims that
hydropower is a zero-greenhouse-gas-emitting technology. Fearnside, of the
Brazilian National Institute for Research in Amazonia, reports in the academic
journal <B>Environmental Conservation</B> that the reservoirs behind tropical dams can
contribute far more to global warming than fossil-fuel-burning powerplants.<P>

Fearnside calculates that, in 1990, emissions of CO2 and methane from
vegetation rotting in the waters in the reservoir behind Brazil's Balbina dam
had 26 times more impact on global warming than the emissions from a coal-fired
power station generating the same amount of electricity.<P>

Emissions from the reservoir behind the Tucurui Dam, also in the Brazilian
Amazon, had only 60 percent as much impact on global warming in 1990 as an
equivalent coal-fired plant -- but 50 percent more impact than a gas-fired power
station. The 4000 megawatt Tucurui Dam is the world's tenth most-powerful hydro
dam. It has less impact on global warming than Balbina, since it floods far
less land per unit of electricity generated.<P>

Although CO2 releases from Balbina will slowly decline over the years as the
flooded trees decay, emissions will always be higher than those from equivalent
fossil-fuel powerplants. Fearnside notes that while only four large reservoirs
have been created in Brazilian Amazonia, another 75 dams are planned.
Fearnside's paper follows research published in 1993 showing that reservoirs in
northern Canada emit substantial amounts of CO2 and methane.<P>

"The social and environmental damage caused by large hydro was once justified
by dam proponents on the grounds that dams provided cheap power," says Patrick
McCully of International Rivers Network [IRN, 1847 Berkeley Way Berkeley, CA
94703 USA Tel: (510) 848-1155 Fax: (510) 848-1008]. Today, however, "private
investors are reluctant to fund large dams, favoring cheaper and less risky
smaller dams and gas-fired plants. In recent years the big-dam lobby has
adopted a new argument -- that hydropower should be supported by aid agencies
and governments because it is 'carbon-free.'<P>

"Dams such as Bakun in Malaysia and Nam Theun II in Laos are being justified on
the grounds that -- although they would uproot thousands of people and destroy
hundreds of square kilometers of forest -- they would provide 'clean' energy.
But the research from Amazonia and Canada shows that hydro-industry lobbyists
will have to think again."

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: Bringing home the Bakun</TITLE>

<H1>Bringing home the Bakun</H1>

Malaysia -- Last September, Sarawak Chief Minister Tan Sri Abdul Taid Mahmud
told a crowd of political supporters that a planned series of dams in the upper
Rajang basin would produce 5000Mw of electricity and make Sarawak the "hydro
powerhouse" of Malaysia. "We will be able to attract investors to set up an
aluminum plant which will bring benefits worth thousands of millions of ringgit
[the national currency]. We will also draw people to set up a pulp and paper
plant. We can build possibly the world's biggest integrated steel mill plant in
Sarawak."<P>

The 2400Mw Bakun, the first and largest of the planned dams, would flood the
homes of 9500 villagers. With the first evictions set for July 1997, the
government has still not explained where it plans to relocate the ousted
villagers.<P>

The crusading Malaysian monthly, <B>Utusan Konsumer</B>, reports that the chief
minister is one of the top 20 shareholders of Ekran Bhd, the single largest
partner in the Bakun dam project. The minister, as chair of the government's
Natural Resources and Environment Board, is also the one who set the conditions
for the dam, approved the environmental impact report and is responsible for
monitoring compliance. His two sons are also among the top 20 shareholders in
Ekran Bhd. The Chief Minister granted the contract to clear 17,750 hectares
(43,861 acres) of forest to Pacific Chemicals, a "sister company of Ekran Bhd."
And who are the major shareholders in Pacific Chemicals? The minister and his
two sons.<P>

On November 24, the government announced that dam construction would begin in
May, 1996, and take six years to complete. Companies  from Brazil, China,
Malaysia, France, Germany, Korea and Sweden have contracted to work on the dam.<P>

Construction will require the cutting of 27 million cubic meters (105 million
cubic feet) of timber. Ekran Bhd hopes to raise roughly $8.3 billion by selling
logging rights to private timber concessions.<P>

Meanwhile, Malaysia's economy is suffering and the state-owned power company
already generates more power than it can sell. The <B>Singapore Business Times</B>
reports that environmentalists fear that Ekran "may just log the huge timber
concession and not build the dam at all."<BR>-- GS

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: The True Cost of Climate Change</TITLE>

<H1>The True Cost of Climate Change</H1>

United Kingdom -- The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was
criticized in Montreal last October for underestimating the financial costs of
climate change. With atmospheric carbon dioxide predicted to double by the year
2050, the IPCC had estimated that 113,000 human deaths, as well as crop and
property loses from increased drought, flooding and storm damage, could claim
1.5-2 percent of the Gross World Product (GWP -- the total value of everything
produced in the world in a year). <P>

This prediction may seem frightening, but, according to the Global Commons
Institute [42 Windsor Road, London NW2 5DS, UK; fax: (081) 830-2366; e-mail:
saveforests@gn.apc.org], the IPCC's report actually <B>minimized</B> the true
costs of climate change by valuing the lives of Third World residents at only
$100,000 apiece -- "a fifteenth of those in the First World" -- and assessing a
hectare (2.47 acres) of land in the South as worth one-tenth as much as a
similar amount of land in the North. <P>

While 80 percent of the world's people live in the non-industrialized South (an
area covering approximately 80 percent of the Earth's surface), the IPCC
calculated that the cash value of climate damage would be twice as high in the
North.<P>

GCI, however, pointed out that 78 percent of added deaths, 75 percent of
drinking water losses and 85 percent of all low-lying lands lost to rising seas
would occur in developing countries. GCI's calculations, by contrast, predicted
annual losses by 2050 that "could amount to between 4.5 percent and 47 percent
of GWP. At the higher end of this range," GCI concluded, "life as we know it
would collapse."<P>

Noting that six of the seven writers of the IPCC report were from the North,
GCI pointed out that the authors relied on an economic cost-benefit analysis
known as the Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) method -- a formula inherently biased
against people who have less money to spend. <P>

GCI proposed using a Willingness-to-Accept (WTA) method to determine how much
money Third World citizens would need "to happily accept higher risks of death
from disease, storms, the drying of their rivers and flooding of their land."
<P>

GCI speculated that the IPCC ignored the WTA approach because "if people say
that there is 'no amount' of monetary compensation that would make them happy,"
it would destroy the premise of cost-benefit analysis and transform the problem
from an economic exercise into a moral issue.<BR>		 -- GS

<A NAME="IPCC"><H2>IPCC Confirms Global Warming</H2>

Spain -- In late November, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
announced at the conclusion of its meeting in Madrid that recent increases in
global temperature can no longer be attributed to natural "climatic
variations." Overcoming lobbying pressure from the "Carbon Club" of
industrialized countries, IPCC scientists declared that global warming is a
fact, it is already happening, and human beings are responsible. The IPCC,
whose work is peer-reviewed by 2500 of the world's leading scientists, warns
that "Climate change is likely to have wide-ranging and mostly adverse effects
on human health, with significant loss of life." Among the "potentially
irreversible" impacts, IPCC listed increased desertification, melting icecaps,
rising seas, widespread forest di-off and catastrophic species extinctions.

<A NAME="Greenhouse"><H2>Greenhouse Goals "Insufficient"</H2>

Japan -- Last October, delegates to the Third Local Government Leaders Summit
on Climate Change in Omiya, Japan, warned that "reductions of greenhouse gas
emissions, even as much as 50 percent, will not be sufficient to prevent global
climate change." The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed by 153
countries at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, called for cutting
greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The Omiya delegates
labeled this goal insufficient and called on industrialized nations to reduce 
emissions by "20 percent from 1990 levels by 2005-2010."

<A NAME="US"><H2>US Solutions at Climate Talks</H2>

Switzerland-- Delegates to the IPCC's October-November climate negotiations in
Geneva heard dire warnings of rising costs from drought, hurricanes, typhoons
and disease. Droughts in China and Russia have cut  global grain harvests to
the lowest levels in 20 years, doubling  prices and driving up the cost of
imports. While the US delegation was criticized for obstructing attempts to
rein in fossil-fuel burning, a "working group" co-chaired by US and Zimbabwean
officials concluded that "significant reductions in net greenhouse gas
emissions are... economically feasible." Energy efficiency gains of 10-30
percent are possible at "no net cost in many parts of the world" and
"efficiency gains of 50-60 percent could be technically feasible" over the next
two-three decades.

<A NAME="Asia"><H2>Asia to Become Greenhouse Threat</H2>

Malaysia -- An eight-country study by the Asian Development Bank reports that
climate change could inundate coastal populations, contaminate fresh water
supplies, diminish food crops and flood Asia with millions of environmental
refugees. <B>Utusan Konsumer</B> magazine reports that Asia and the Pacific region
will soon become "the world's largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions,"
with half of the projected increase coming from industrial development alone.

<A NAME="Could"><H2>Could the Earth's Climate "Flip?"</H2>

Germany -- Researchers at the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of
Kiel have warned that global warming could trigger a sudden climate "flip,"
ushering in a new Ice Age. If this were to occur, the Gulf Stream could reverse
its flow, causing Europe's temperature to drop by as much as five degrees
Celsius (41* Fahrenheit) -- about the same as during the last Ice Age.
Meanwhile, scientists at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge have
reported what appears to be a troubling, and possibly related, decline in the
strength of convection currents in the Greenland Sea.

<A NAME="Greenpeace"><H2>Greenpeace Spurns Ozone Award</H2>

Germany -- On October 24, Greenpeace Germany refused to accept the US
Environmental Protection Agency's Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award.<P>

Greenpeace Germany was offered the award for its role in developing hydrocarbon
refrigeration technology. Thanks to Greenpeace Germany's promotion of the
"Greenfreeze" technology, the German domestic refrigeration industry now uses
absolutely no ozone-depleting substances. US industry relies heavily on HCFCs
and US policy promotes the continued use of these ozone-depleting chemicals.
Some European countries plan to phase out HCFCs as early as 1998, while the US
insists that they are necessary until 2030.<P>

"While it gives us no great joy to decline this award, we felt that we simply
had no other option," said Greenpeace Germany's Wolfgang Lohbeck. "We simply
cannot accept an award for ozone protection from ozone destroyers.... The US
has led the way in promoting policies which will prolong damage to the ozone
layer. If the US modifies its position to the minimum that is necessary, we
will be pleased to accept their award in Vienna."<BR>

<TITLE>Winter 95-96 Journal: Log Pest Lawsuit Filed</TITLE>

<H1>Log Pest Lawsuit Filed</H1>

USA -- In a move to protect US forests from exotic insect pests and plant
diseases, environmentalists filed a lawsuit last November to block importation
of potentially infested logs into the US. The lawsuit, filed against the
Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS),
challenges the adequacy of new regulations that would allow infested logs to
pass through US ports.<P>

The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco Federal Court by the Western Environmental
Law Center (WELC) on behalf of a coalition of environmental groups, claims that
APHIS failed to evaluate the impacts of introduced forest pests on forest
ecosystems, human health or regional economies. The plaintiffs claim that APHIS
was more concerned with international commerce than protection of America's
forests.<P>

APHIS' new regulations, which went into effect in August, allow the importation
of foreign logs and wood products that have not been heat-treated to kill all
pests. These logs can be transported in open trucks through forested regions
and stored for up to two months before being treated.<P>

According to William Denison, professor of botany at Oregon State University,
"We can lose our magnificent Northwest forests if we allow the introduction of
a disease that eliminates Douglas fir in the way that introduced diseases hit
chestnut and elm in the East."<P>

"Not only will many pests from Russia, Chile, and New Zealand thrive in the
temperate climates of the US, but they will be able to spread in the absence of
their natural predators and of resistant tree species," said Joy Belsky, PhD,
staff ecologist at Oregon Natural Resources Council (ONRC). "The timber
industry should stand together with the environmental community in opposing
this threat to America's forests," said Belsky.<P>

APHIS rules state that Russian logs must be heat-treated before shipment but,
as David Gordon, co-director of the Siberian Forests Protection Project at the
Pacific Environment and Resources Center (PERC) warns, "Corruption in the
Russian timber industry and Russian ports is widespread. Expectations of
compliance show an ignorance of the current situation in Russia."

<TITLE>Road Building Alert for Headwaters- February 29</TITLE>

<H1>Road Building Alert for Headwaters</H1>

February 29<BR>

Pacific Lumber/MAXXAM has proposed cutting eight acres of ancient redwoods in
the 3300 Headwaters forest to build a logging road. A hearing is set for March
5. <P>



<H2>Headwaters Debt-for-Nature Swap</H2>



On December 26, 1995, in a move heralded by environmentalists as <B>long</B>
overdue, the Federal Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) filed charges against
MAXXAM Inc., of Houston Texas, MAXXAM Chairman Charles Hurwitz and several
other parties the agency says contributed to the failure of United Savings
association of texas, Houston, in 1988. That failure cost the federal
government's insurance fund in excess of $1.6 billion. One of MAXXAM's prime
assets is the property which contains the Headwaters forest, the 3000 acre plot
of land which is the largest unprotected redwood grove in the world, located
just east of Eureka, California, where numerous protests by environmentalists
and concerned citizens over the scheduled forest destruction have taken place
in recent months. <P>

OTS filed 13 separate claims against the respondents for violations of numerous
federal regulations and for multiple unsafe and unsound practices. The agency
is pursuing an unspecified amount of restitution. In addition, OTS is seeking
$889,000. in civil money penalties, and the prohibition of all six individuals
charged, including Hurwitz. Others named in the action included Barry Munitz
(whose unethical actions were no deterent to Governor Pete Wilson, who
appointed him president of the California State University system), Jonard
Gross, Arthur Berner, Ron Huebach and Michael Crow, all present and former
directors and/or officers of United Savings and its holding company, United
Financial Group. Also charged in the case is Federated Development Co., a New
York business trust. <P>

Veteran North coast environmentalists say they pleased that the US taxpayers
will have an opportunity for financial restitution from those guilty of Savings
and Loan raids in the 1980's. In addition, they are hopful these charges will
add further fuel to the proposed "debt for nature" swap being pursued in order
to preserve the Headwaters forest. They would also be pleased to see the
Department of Justice recognize the various felonies as violation of federal
banking laws and file formal criminal charges and criminal indictments of the
MAXXAM executives. <P>

Hurwitz controls MAXXAM, Federated and United Financial, which in turn,
controlled United States Savings from at least 1985 until its failure. United
Federal is currently in involuntary bankruptcy. United Savings, with assests of
$4.6 billion, failed and was placed in receivership on December 30, 1988. At
that time, United Savings was more than $500 million short of its minimum
regulatory capitol requirement. <P>

OTS charged that United Financial did not live up to a written agreement to
maintain the net worth of United savings at required levels. The agreement had
been a condition for regulatory approval in 1983 of the merger of United
Savings and Houston First American of Texas, another Houston thrift. As a
result of failing to comply with the condition of approval, United Financial
consented on December 13, 1995, as part of a joint settlement with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the OTS, to a cease and desist order
and to pay at least $9.45 million in restitution, subject to approval by
bankruptcy court. <P>

In one of the thirteen charges, OTS accused certain respondents of unsafe and
unsound compensation practices. As United Savings' condition deteriorated, the
respondents caused United Savings and United Financial to initiate lavish
bonuses and severance plans for themselves and others. In April, 1988, at a
time when the repondents knew full well that United Savings was failing to meet
its minimum capitol requirement, United Savings paid $793,115. in bonuses to 42
employees, including Berner, Crow, Munitz and Gross. The thrift also became
obligated to pay an additional $849,000. in future bonuses. Gross also
benefited from a separate bonus plan that relievd him of paying off a $761,250.
note. <P>

OTS also charged that the respondents also had United Financial and United
Savings enter into employment agreements with a number of senior management
directors, including Gross, Munitz, Berner, and Crow. They were to be given two
years' salary plus two times their previous year's bonus if United Savings
failed. In October 1988, the regulator advised United Savings' directors that
the employment contracts violated federal regulations because they provided
excessive compensation and severence payments and were unsafe and unsound
because United Savings was insolvent. The regulator also instructed United
Savings not to pay promised future bonuses. The respondents' severance claims
cost more than $900,000, money that could have been used to help satisfy the
net worth obligation.

<TITLE>IMMP: New Threats to Dolphins</TITLE>

<H1>New Threats to Dolphins</H1>

<H2>Congress Tries to Weaken Dolphin Protection Laws</H2>

<IMG SRC="immp.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT  WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=175 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2>

by Mark J. Palmer and Laura Seligsohn Earth Island Institute<P>

A runaway Congress could reverse years of progress on protecting dolphins on
the high seas, but Earth Island Institute, along with a coalition of over
seventy environmental and animal welfare organizations, Senators Barbara Boxer
(D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DC), and Congressmember George Miller (D-CA), are
fighting back.  Senators Boxer and Biden, the original authors of the
dolphin-safe tuna program, have introduced S. 1460, the Dolphin Protection Act
(H.R. 2856 by Rep.  Miller in the House of Representatives), to continue
preventing dolphins from drowning in tuna nets.<P>

Three legislative efforts to weaken U.S. policy on dolphin protection have been
introduced.  The first of these threats surfaced in September 1995, when U.S.
Representative Randy "Duke" Cunningham (R-CA), joining hands with the so-called
Wise Use Movement, took aim at dolphin protections by introducing H.R. 2179. 
If passed, the bill would repeal the federal definition of "Dolphin Safe" and
allow dolphin-unsafe tuna to flood the U.S. market.  H.R. 2179 would further
allow U.S. tunaboats to once again kill dolphins, setting an international
dolphin kill quota as high as 55,000 or more dolphins annually.  David
Phillips, Director of Earth Island Institute's International Marine Mammal
Project, quickly labeled H.R. 2179 "the Dolphin Extermination and Consumer
Fraud Act."<P>

H.R. 2179 had barely been introduced when Mexico and several
compromise-oriented environmental groups issued the "Panama Declaration" after
a series of secret meetings in Washington, DC.  The declaration represents an
international effort to force Congress to lift the ban on the import and sale
of dolphin-unsafe tuna and to change the federal definition of "dolphin safe"
in a way that hides the truth from consumers.  The current definition of
dolphin safe, under the Boxer-Biden Dolphin Protection & Consumer Information
Act of 1991, sponsored by Earth Island Institute, prohibits all chasing,
capturing, and setting of nets on dolphins.  The Panama Declaration, by
contrast, redefines dolphin safe to mean no observed dolphin mortality, allows
the U.S. tuna fishing fleet and the fleets of countries that want to export
tuna to the U.S. to resume setting purse seine nets on dolphins to catch the
tuna that swim beneath them, and would permit up to 5,000 dolphins to be killed
each year.  The actual number of dolphins observed killed by the fishery last
year was 4,095, so the Panama quota would allow killing of almost 1,000 more
dolphins every year.  The Panama deal also calls for allowing dolphin-unsafe
tuna imports into the U.S.  in the name of free trade, a reversal of the
four-year-old U.S. tuna embargo against countries whose fleets' dolphin safety
practices are not comparable to our own.<P>

Senators Ted Stevens (R-AK) and John Breaux (D-LA), who have long opposed the
dolphin-safe program, introduced S. 1420 in the U.S. Senate in November 1995,
to implement the Panama Declaration.  In December, Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD)
introduced the same bill as H.R. 2823 in the House of Representatives.<P>

Unfortunately, the pro-trade Clinton Administration is currently in support of
the Dolphin Death Act, as are five environmental organizations.  Greenpeace, 
National Wildlife Federation, World Wildlife Fund, Environmental Defense Fund,
and Center for Marine Conservation are inexplicably supporting drastically
weakening dolphin protection.  However, U.S. tuna processors are standing firm
in their commitment to  buy only tuna caught without setting nets on
dolphins.<P>

The proposed changes in U.S. law could have grave consequences for the dolphins
that swim with yellowfin tuna in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.  For 30 years,
dolphin populations have been horrendously depleted by disastrous fishing
practices.  Eastern spinner and northeastern spotted dolphin populations are
currently estimated at only 44% and 23%, respectively, of original numbers. 
Even dolphins that are not killed in nets are subjected to chase by high-speed
powerboats and to entrapment in nets, both of which are extremely stressful for
dolphins.  There is growing evidence that the physiological repercussions of
this trauma may cause mortality never observed by Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission (IATTC) monitors and cumulative long-term effects that may reduce
reproductive success for those dolphins repeatedly chased and encircled. 
Further, dolphins with injuries, such as torn fins or broken jaws, would not be
counted as "observed" dolphin mortalities.  Dr. Naomi Rose of the Humane
Society of the United States explains, "It is not simply a matter of direct
mortality.  The concept of 'take' encompasses more than killing.  This type of
harassment may have serious physical consequences.  Considering how severely
depleted these populations are ... this is not good management."  Proponents of
H.R. 2179, S. 1420, and H.R. 2823 argue that there is nothing to worry about. 
Biologically, however, it is not known what numbers are needed for successful
breeding and regeneration of depleted dolphin herds.<P>

Thanks to the staff of Senators Boxer and Biden, and Representative Miller and
Gerry Studds (D-MA), the bills on the Senate and House floors are being watched
closely to block any back-door deals.  Earth Island Institute is working to
stop passage of S. 1420, H.R. 2179, and H.R. 2823.  By contrast, S. 1460
(Boxer/Biden) and H.R. 2856 (Miller) would keep dolphin protections in place. 
S. 1460 and H.R. 2856 would also help to resolve trade issues by supporting
research and observers, as well as giving further incentives to dolphin-safe
fishermen by allowing their tuna to be imported from countries that are
currently embargoed.<P>

Earth Island Institute has been joined in support of dolphins by the Sierra
Club, Humane Society of the United States, Defenders of Wildlife, Public
Citizen, and dozens of other grassroots environmental groups in support of the
Boxer/Biden/Miller Dolphin Protection Act (S. 1460/H.R. 2856).<P>

We need your support in fighting the efforts to weaken U.S. dolphin
protections.  Free trade at the expense of dolphins is a bad deal.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: The Environmental Impact of US Babies</TITLE>

<H1>The Environmental Impact of US Babies</H1>

<H2>by Charles A. S. Hall, Ph.D., R. Gil Pontius Jr., Lisa Coleman and Jae-Young Ko</H2>

The US National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to
include a detailed statement of likely environmental impacts in proposals for
major actions, such as the creation of new power plants. The initiating force
behind any large project generally is the desire to service or to extract profit
from a human population. Thus, we view the environmental impacts of specific
facilities as the product of the number of consumers and their per-capita
consumption rate.<P>

It follows that, given a nation's level of affluence and
technology, the nation's population size is closely associated with its aggregate
environmental impacts. For example, at the 1990 living standard, a US of 250
million people would cause roughly double the environmental impact of a US of 125
million people. In some sense, then, the ultimate environmental impact occurs
with the birth of each new human being, because a whole suite of production and
consumption activities commence with that birth.<P>

This is a first crude attempt to
develop  an environmental impact statement for the birth of one baby in the 1990s
in the US. We estimate the magnitude of 100 environmental impacts that one
American born today will cause over an expected lifetime and group them under
five headings: waste generation, mineral consumption, energy consumption, food
consumption and ecosystem alteration. We also consider, but do not quantify,
extinctions of both species and <A HREF="../slfp/sacredla.html">Indigenous cultures</A>.<P>

An American born in the
1990s will produce in a lifetime approximately one million kilograms (2.2 million
lbs.) of atmospheric wastes, 10 million kgs (22 million lbs.) of liquid wastes,
and one million kgs (2.2 million lbs.) of solid wastes. An American will consume
700,000 kgs (1.54 million lbs.) of minerals, and 24 billion BTUs of energy --
equivalent to 4000 barrels of oil. In a lifetime, an average American will eat
25,000 kgs (55,000 lbs.) of animal products, provided in part by slaughtering
2000 animals.<P>

The US, Canada, <A HREF="../baikal/baikal.html">Russia</A> and all of Europe will account for only
about five percent of the world's next billion people. Nevertheless, any US
population increase will cause great environmental damage, because the US
per-capita consumption rate is ten to 100 times that of most of the world's
countries.<P>

During the next decade, <A HREF="../strp/strpindi.html">India</A> and <A HREF="women.html">China</A> will each add to the planet
approximately ten times as many people as will the US. Nevertheless, if
per-capita consumption levels stay constant, environmental degradation and
natural resource depletion caused by the US population increase may exceed the
environmental stresses caused by the increase in the populations of India and
China combined.<P>

Compared to Indians, Americans (on a per capita basis) produce 27
times as much carbon dioxide, spend 101 times as much on the military, and own
127 times as many telephones, 116 times as many televisions, and consume 35 times
as much energy.<P>

Thus, although we think that population control is critical in
the developing world (because the developing world needs to balance its resource
demand with its resource availability), population control in the US is as
important in determining the health of the planet.<P>

Curiously, almost all of contemporary US culture is oriented toward increasing consumption of almost all
resources. Some religious sects promote unrestrained procreation. The US media
uses advertisements incessantly to encourage resource-consuming lifestyles and
the identification of personal worth with consumption. Universities teach
consumption insatiability as a basic axiom of introductory economics, which
rarely examines the consequences of personal consumption on the environment.<P>

We wish to protect the quality of life for all humans, present and future, because
we believe that everyone's quality of life is threatened by continued population
growth. Of all the decisions couples will ever make, their decision whether or
not to create a child will have the largest impact on our global environment. The
most effective way an individual can protect the global environment, and hence
protect the well-being of all people, is to abstain from creating another human.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Thousands Rally for Headwaters</TITLE>

<H1>Thousands Rally for Headwaters</H1>

<H2>by John Sterling</H2>

A teenage girl crossed the green borderline, stepped onto Pacific Lumber Company
(PL) property and joined the mass of forest advocates waiting for a Humboldt
County Deputy Sheriff to arrest them for trespassing. The girl turned, waved to a
middle-aged woman on the other side of the line, and said, "'Bye mom! I love
you!"<P>

The girl was one of 264 people, including a half-dozen juveniles, arrested
on September 15 during a protest against PL's plans to conduct salvage <A HREF="../paper/rtp.html">logging</A> in
three of the six old-growth groves of Headwaters Forest, the largest unprotected
ancient redwood forest ecosystem in the world.<P>

"This is the largest forest-defense action in the history of the United States," Earth First! activist
Darryl Cherney told a jubilant crowd of roughly 2000 people. Supporters rallied
for several hours outside PL's Carlotta, California mill before setting off on a
1.5-mile march to the gates of Headwaters, where dozens of police waited to carry
out the arrests. For more than three hours, activists patiently awaited their
turn to pass through the police line and on to a temporary booking station set up
in a nearby field. Absent was the confrontation that has marked Northern
California timber protests in the past.<P>

"Environmental groups met with police for
many hours of planning before this event," said Ingrid Hanson, the Humboldt
County Sheriff's spokesperson. The result was a feel-good atmosphere that kept
the protest focused on timber issues, not on tensions between demonstrators and
police.<P>

<H3>Maxxamized Devastation</H3>

The struggle over Headwaters began in 1985, when Houston-based Maxxam Corporation
completed a hostile takeover of PL, a company known for its ecologically
sensitive logging practices. Maxxam CEO Charles Hurwitz financed the purchase of
PL with a $300 million bank loan and $450 million in high-interest "junk bonds."
He lured investors to the deal by promising to accelerate timber cutting and
terminate PL's $62 million employee pension fund to pay off the debt. Following
the takeover, PL tripled its timber cutting and has repeatedly threatened to log
the 72,000-acre Headwaters Forest, a complex that contains six ancient forest
groves totaling 5400 acres of old-growth redwoods. The forest is also prime
habitat for two endangered birds, the marbled murrelet and northern spotted owl,
while its streams are home to a dwindling population of coho salmon.<P>

Since 1987,
the Garberville-based Environmental Protection Information Center (EPIC) has
filed 14 lawsuits against PL, winning seven of them and helping to expose the
company's questionable forestry practices. In a landmark decision earlier this
year, a federal judge issued a permanent injunction against PL's logging in
Headwaters' Owl Creek Grove after EPIC established that the operation threatened
the habitat of the marbled murrelet and thus violated the federal Endangered
Species Act (ESA).<P>

Though litigation has slowed PL's assault on the redwoods, the
company has already managed to harvest 40,000 acres of old-growth from its
196,000-acre forest empire since the Maxxam takeover. "EPIC lawsuits are only a
temporary and limited reprieve for the ancient forests," said EPIC's Cecilia
Lanman. "Ultimate protection for Headwaters will only come from public support
and political pressure," she said.<P>

<H3>The "Headwaters Swap" Plan</H3>

The September 15 rally was scheduled to coincide with the end of the marbled
murrelet nesting season. Despite EPIC's victory in the marbled murrelet case, the
California Department of Forestry (CDF) subsequently issued a special exemption
permitting PL to log "dead or dying" trees from three of Headwaters' six groves
after September 15, without any public comment or environmental review. Many
foresters criticize such "salvage" logging operations because they ignore the
value of decaying trees to a forest ecosystem (see story on page 22) and note
that, because of their age, most old-growth trees could be considered "dying."<P>

The rally, sponsored by a coalition of more than 30 environmental, Native
American and social justice organizations, convened at noon before a backdrop of
logged trees and milled lumber. Speakers and musicians addressed the crowd,
encouraging ongoing support for forest protection. "Why is it when we destroy
something made by man, it's called vandalism, but when we destroy something made
by nature, it's called progress?" asked actor and environment activist Ed Begley,
Jr.<P>

Speakers pledged support for a proposed "debt-for-nature swap" that would
transfer Headwaters to protected public ownership. In August 1995, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) filed a $250 million lawsuit against
Maxxam's Hurwitz for his alleged role in the 1988 collapse of United Savings
Association of Texas. United Savings, which suffered a $1.6 billion loss, was
bailed out by the FDIC using US taxpayer funds. In 1992, long before the FDIC
suit, Headwaters supporters suggested that the government could "forgive"
Hurwitz' debt to the American people in exchange for Headwaters Forest. Hurwitz
says that he is willing to sell Headwaters for $600 million, which he insists is
"fair market value."<P>

<H3>Bari at the Barricades</H3>

Earth First!er and timber war veteran Judi Bari echoed the debt-for-nature theme.
"Charles Hurwitz says he wants fair market value for Headwaters forest, but the
American taxpayers have already paid for it. We own it, now it's our job to
repossess it. We are the Earth repo team," she said.<P>

Bari explained that she
could not walk the 1.5 miles to the forest gate "thanks to Pacific
Lumber/Maxxam," referring to permanent injuries she sustained when a bomb
exploded in her car during the 1990 Redwood Summer anti-logging protests (the
bomber has still not been identified). But Bari was first in line when the
arrests began and when police led her to the booking area, the crowd responded
with a rousing and respectful cheer.<P>

While many of the marchers were experienced
forest advocates, the crowd was diverse. Among those joining the march was John
Maurer, a cabinetmaker from Carlotta who worked for PL until shortly after the
Maxxam takeover in 1985. Maurer is one of 20 plaintiffs in a lawsuit against PL
that aims to recover benefits from the employee pension fund that Hurwitz
liquidated to help pay off his bond debt.<P>

Over the years, Maurer observed, a
wider range of people has become active on the Headwaters issue. "The local media
tries to paint the protesters as a small group of fringe radicals. But look at
the numbers and look at the diversity," he said. Maurer noted that roughly five
percent of Carlotta's 400 residents attended the rally.

<H3>Battle in the Courts</H3>

As dawn broke on the morning of the protest, EPIC's lawyers were working
feverishly to obtain a temporary restraining order (TRO) to halt PL's plans to
log Headwaters. As evening set in and more than 200 people had been arrested,
EPIC's Laurel Sarachek scrambled onto the bed of a flatbed truck to announce that
US District Court Judge Maxine Chesney had granted a TRO for one week, during
which time EPIC would be allowed to argue its case.<P>

The jubilant crowd roared its
approval. A police officer asked Darryl Cherney if the protesters would now like
to halt the protest. Looking back at the line of people still awaiting arrest,
Cherney said, "Looks like there are still a lot of folks who want to get
arrested." The officer merely shrugged and said, "Whatever you say. We're a
full-service police force."<P>

On September 28, Judge Chesney, citing evidence
"sufficient to show a likelihood of jeopardizing" the endangered birds, issued a
Preliminary Injunction, temporarily halting new PL logging pending a federal
hearing. The ruling offered temporary protection to roughly 40,000 acres.<P>

On the same day, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) strongly appealed to the Clinton
Administration "to explore all options, including a debt-for-nature-swap" to save
"the magnificent ancient forest grove" known as Headwaters.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Reforesting the Wastelands</TITLE>

<H1>Reforesting the Wastelands</H1>

<H2>by Stephanie Mills</H2>

Tamil Nadu, <A HREF="../strp/strpindi.html">INDIA</A> -- Auroville is a 25-year-old, 2500-acre intentional community
in southern India. It aspires to become "a city that the Earth needs." To call
the ground the Aurovilians first confronted "soil" would be a misnomer. It is
laterite, baked terracotta-solid by the tropical sun, although it once was
permeated by rich scrub jungle.<P>

Local farmers were willing to part with the land
that Auroville occupies, land that had been <A HREF="../paper/rtp.html">deforested</A> long ago, then cropped or
grazed beyond its limits.<P>

Even now, with much of the land in some stage of
regeneration and with attractive households, administrative centers and
appropriate technologies the norm, it is not difficult to picture the desolation
that was Auroville in the beginning -- broad stretches of gullied, parched red
earth and not much else. One longtime Aurovilian wrote that in 1969 the land
looked like "a once-living Earth dying back into a moon."<P>

Now, flecking the gullied landscape, one sees the exotic acacias that serve as the beginnings of
the new forest. In some places, grasses have actually begun to take hold. And
looming in the distances are lines of tall, limber palms, their typecast tropical
silhouettes accenting the horizons. In Auroville, afforestation and all the
effort that supports it, effort oriented toward a certain kind of human future, a
future of living in the land, is called Greenwork.<P>

Auroville was begun in 1968
with grants from UNESCO and other world philanthropies and is, at present,
somewhat of a colony, with members of 26 nationalities, mostly Europeans and
Americans. Of the 900 Aurovilians, approximately 250 are Indians. It is very much
a hybrid situation; West come to the East.<P>

<H3>An Alternative Vision</H3>

To secure a living beyond the extremely modest 1200-2000 rupees ($39-65) per
month subsistence support that the community provides its full-fledged members,
Aurovilians may commute back to their mother countries in Europe or the US to
make a little money however they can.<P>

Aurovilians may be said to come from the
ranks of the world's privileged. They live where they do by choice; they have the
luxury of being able to subscribe to the belief that, as Greenworker Ed Giordano
puts it, "pushing Nature to get the maximum for our own existence cannot
continue." Although it is by no means the only such intentional sustainable
community in India, its condition of being a multinational settlement may be
unique.<P>

Auroville's landscape is dotted with scores of windmills, 70 solar
water-heaters and more than 50 biogas plants. More than 50 homes are equipped
with photovoltaic panels, solar-box cookers and other household-level appropriate
technology experiments, like lagoon-pond systems for treating "black" and "gray"
water. "Almost all the energy we use here, we produce here," said Giordano,
indicating his sleek, solar and biogas-powered home. Thanks to a solar
photovoltaic system made of components almost entirely of Indian manufacture, he
says, "we've never had a power crash."<P>

The village of Forecomers was among the
first of Auroville's two dozen or so settlements and it remains one of the main
"Greenwork" centers. Afforestation began as a matter of stark necessity shortly
after the first settlers arrived. "What you see here," said Giordano, indicating
the surrounding Forecomers vegetation, "basically has been placed here."<P>

One entirely understandable impetus to tree planting at Auroville, I instantly
grasped, was the need to provide some shade. Without tree cover, existence in
those lands would be nearly intolerable. In the tropics, however, if things can
grow at all, they will grow rapidly. In those latitudes life really wants to
live. So trees planted and tended by the first Greenworkers had, in a
quarter-century, become almost majestic. Two species of Australian acacias were
planted as "pioneer" trees in the hope that indigenous vegetation might soon come
to grow on the restored earth.<P>

Tineke Smith was among the "Forecomers." She and
another woman lived in a hut and spent their first few years in Auroville
planting trees. To dig pits for the saplings they had grown in their nurseries,
the Greenworkers had to begin by breaking the ground with crowbars. The
transplants were nestled in compost and sprinkled with water that was hand-pumped
and hauled bodily. This hard work has produced good results. Afforestation in
Auroville has already improved the microclimate. There are no more dust storms
and the residents say that the shade provided by the trees keeps the ground
temperature lower. The effect is most noticeable in the evening, when the ground
radiates back less heat after sundown.<P>

In the mornings it was cool -- a sweet,
refreshing moment before the truly astounding heat of the day. Each morning I
awoke to a mounting chorale of bird song, the sound of healing. (The first
Auroville bird survey, done in 1972, documented 40 species. The next, in 1986,
recorded 102.) Loud, brilliant, and varied, this music of regeneration was a
welcome contrast to the entirely human din of the cities -- Benares, Delhi,
Madras and Pondicherry. I was out in the country -- resurrected country -- and
found it amenable.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: America's Trees Are Dying</TITLE>

<H1>America's Trees Are Dying</H1>

<H2>by Charles E. Little</H2>


<I>After 30 years as an environmental-policy analyst, journalist and author Charles
Little spent three years traveling across the US, visiting forests and woodlands
in 13 states. In the process, he interviewed the country's top forest scientists,
met with government and university researchers, and reviewed hundreds of
scientific papers and reports. His discoveries are profoundly disturbing. The
following excerpts have been adapted for the Journal from Little's new book</I>, The
Dying of the Trees: The Pandemic in America's Forests.

<HR>

The trees are dying. Not only in the rainforests of <A
HREF="mclibel.html">Brazil</A> and Southeast Asia, where they are
felled by the chainsaws of international greed, local poverty and ecological
ignorance, but also in Europe and right here in the US.<P>

From the cedars of <A HREF="geni.html">Alaska</A> to the palms of
<A HREF="../map/map.html">Florida</A>, from the maples of Canada and New
England to the pines and incense cedars of the Sierra Nevada, the incidents of
death and decline are increasing at an alarming rate.<P>

Some argue that the
progression of tree death and forest decline in this century, and especially
since World War II, is either coincidence or simply a matter of selective
reporting. Everything is all right; it is just the natural ebb and flow of
nature. But that is not what I have learned from the scores of scientific
scholars I have interviewed, and the mountain of papers I have studied. They say
something else. What these distinguished sources are describing is a pandemic --
an epidemic that is everywhere.<P>

In the US, the trees are dying on the ridges of
the Appalachian mountain chain and in the sugar bush of Vermont. They are dying
in the mid-South border states, in the thick forests of central Michigan, on the
mountainsides of Colorado and California, along the Gulf of Mexico, in the
<A HREF="desert.html">deserts</A> of the Southwest and they are dying in the Northwest -- even before they
are cut.<P>

<H3>In the Beginning</H3>

When we destroy forests, we destroy not only the trees that had occupied the
landscape, but possibly future trees as well. Replacement forests of
second-growth trees are less able to resist drought and cold, adventitious pests,
and diseases, because they grow only in simplified <I>stands</I>, not in the vigorous,
complex forest ecosystems that evolved naturally over eons.<P>

The primitive forests
encountered by the early British, Dutch and French colonists were filled with
trees of mythic proportions and biblical age. White pines reached 200 feet in
height. Great stands of hemlocks, more permanent than Gothic cathedrals, were
common. Black walnut trunks measured five and six feet through the middle.
Chestnuts spread 200 feet from branch tip to branch tip. Graceful arching trunks
of elms sheltered the nurslings with dappled shade. Magnolias, crabapples,
loblolly bays and basswoods perfumed Southern woodlands.<P>

America's primordial forests stretched from the barrier islands on which the first British colonists
landed 400 years ago to the prairies of the Middle West. It was said that a tree
squirrel could travel from the Atlantic shore to the Mississippi River without
once dropping to the ground.<P>

In the northern latitudes, between Maine and
Minnesota, an unbroken coniferous woodland prevailed, giving way to hardwoods in
the lower latitudes in a largely unblemished blanket of green from the Great
Lakes to Louisiana.<P>

<H3>The Death of the Dogwoods</H3>

One such remnant is the Catoctin Woods in Maryland, a profuse Eastern deciduous
forest, with impressively tall oak, hickories, maples and tulip poplars. Even the
most ordinary specimens reach over 100 feet and intermingle their topmost
branches at such a great distance from the ground that the canopy seems almost a
kind of intermediate sky. When one walks in such woods, the scale and sheer
numbers of the big trees are such that their presence merges into a kind of
forest <I>atmosphere</I>.<P>

With its graceful branches and luminous leaves, the Eastern
flowering dogwood, <I>Cornus florida</I>, is perfectly suited to a life under this
overarching canopy. But the showy bracts -- the creamy white leaflike coverings
for the blossoms themselves -- no longer gleam in the deep woods. Now the
dogwoods are mostly dead in the Catoctin mountains, victims of a virulent form of
fungal infection called "anthracnose" that has been killing off <I>C. florida</I> from
southern New England to Alabama. Anthracnose, a combination of the Greek words
for coal (<I>anthra</I>) and disease (<I>nosos</I>), describes the dark brown blotches found on
infected leaves. In 1988, a study by forest scientists Manfred Mielke and Keith
Langdon revealed that 79 percent of the Catoctin's dogwoods were dead and the
rest were dying.<P>

Before the scourge of anthracnose, the dogwoods, with more than
400 medium-to-large trees per acre, gave the woods a human scale. But now a whole
layer of life had been extinguished. Questions arise: What of the plants and
creatures that live below the understory -- the mosses and grasses and lovely
ground covers; the mayapple, ferns and violets? What of the birds, such as the
cedar waxwing and robin, who love the bright fall berries of dogwood -- would
they absent themselves from these woods? What of the big trees themselves -- will
some subtle change in the chemistry of the forest soils make their own survival
more difficult?<P>

<H3>A Plague on Both Coasts</H3>

The first notice taken that something might be amiss with the dogwood occurred
some 3000 miles to the west, when in 1976 Ralph Byther and Roy Davidson, plant
pathologists with the Western Washington Research and Extension Center in
Puyallup, Washington, received a diseased Pacific dogwood branch (similar to the
Eastern flowering dogwood) from a correspondent living near Vancouver,
Washington, across the Columbia River from Portland, Oregon. Anthracnose is the
ordinary term plant pathologists use to describe a set of disease symptoms in a
wide variety of trees -- oaks, sycamores, even citrus -- that are attacked by
fungus. But the coal-dark blotches on the dogwood leaves Byther and Davidson were
investigating was not caused by any ordinary fungus. This fungus, belonging to
the genus <I>Discula</I>, was a species that could not be identified because it had
never been seen before.<P>

A new virulent form of fungus had suddenly and
unaccountably appeared on both coasts at the same time and was wiping out
dogwoods by the thousands, spreading outward in widening circles like a
silvicultural version of the bubonic plague.<P>

Is the lovely dogwood sending us a
sign, a warning, as its last gift before it disappears altogether?<P>

<H3>Forest Death in New England</H3>

Amid the tinkling glasses of tourists in the lounge of the Woodstock Inn,
former-Vermont Forest Commissioner Mollie Beattie (now chief of the US Fish and
Wildlife Service) spoke candidly and earnestly. "If you ask me if there's a
connection between pollution and the maple dieback," she began, "I would say yes.
If you want proof, that's another matter. In the chronology of a forest, a
decline taking 25 years is a sudden eruption, but human consciousness does not
take it in that way. To us the change is so slow as to be unobservable. Nobody
knows what the natural level of mortality is. It's not that there's no science.
It's that science is asking the wrong questions."<P>

Beattie also discussed the fate
of other forest trees in New England; how the ozone-sensitive white pine seemed
to be disappearing; how beech trees had been dying at the rate of ten percent a
year in the Adirondacks of New York State. The largest US fabricator of stairway
parts -- the Visador Corporation -- now finds it can no longer count on beech
wood for lumber and must substitute tulip poplar, a somewhat weaker hardwood.
Beattie fears the butternut might actually become extinct.<P>

<H3>Changing Climate: Dying Trees</H3>

In Alaska, a warming trend has been taking place during most of this century that
coincides with the decline of the Alaska cedar as well as an increase in
atmospheric CO2. In recent years, the protective snow cover has all but
disappeared along the coasts due to the warming trend, causing the cedars to die.<P>

At the opposite corner of the US, sabal palms (<I>Sabal texana</I>) are dying. Francis
E. Putz, a botanist with the University of Florida, has found that the sabal
palms -- 50-foot cousins of the palmetto -- were dying along a 200-mile stretch
of Florida's Gulf Coast.<P>

Putz suspects that rising sea levels have exposed the palms' roots to toxic
levels of salt water. As he told a <I>New York Times</I> reporter, "Areas that
today support salt <A HREF="../map/map.html">marsh</A> vegetation were
forested in the 1940s. Twenty million years ago Florida was a series of
islands. Maybe it is going to be that again." If the global warming scenario
suggested by the National Academy of Sciences is correct, sea levels may rise
as much as two feet by the end of the 21st century, which would submerge not
only the palms, but most of the state of Florida.<P>

Beginning in the late 1940s, even before most of the freeways were built
in the land of the <A HREF="kickcars.html">three-car garage</A>, commuters came home from a workday in Los
Angeles with red eyes, scratchy throats, chest pains and headaches. Particulate
matter collected in their lungs, women's nylons melted on their legs and trees
were dying.<P>

Today, auto-generated <A HREF="methbro.html">ozone</A>, far from being confined to Los Angeles,
is devastating trees in the distant Sierra Nevada, too. Ozone from the Central
Valley travels up the steep canyons of the western flank of the Sierra on a daily
basis.<P>

In the Sierra Nevada, I visited Trent Proctor, an air resources specialist
for the Sierra National Forest. "In the summer," Proctor said, when the inversion
layer of cold air covering the valley lifts, "in the southern Sierra we see
ozone-injury in trees up to about 7000 feet and in the northern Sierra about
5000." Others have found ozone-caused tree injury as high as 9000 feet.<P>

Once the ozone is inside the cellular structure of the tree, it bleaches the chlorophyll
from the needles -- just like Clorox, also an oxidant -- so that they lose their
ability to photosynthesize and then drop prematurely.<P>

At the headquarters of the
Stanislaus National Forest, entomologist John Wenz and plant pathologist John
Pronos reported that years of drought have brought widespread trouble to the
mountains. "Years ago, we did a very large-scale mortality survey in the Sierra
Nevada mixed conifer forest," said Pronos, "and we came up with a normal
mortality of between 0.1 and 0.3 dead trees per acre. Now we are well beyond 1.0
dead trees per acre -- up to a tenfold increase."<P>

Wenz and Pronos also claim that
the shade-loving and relatively ozone-resistant incense cedars are inexplicably
dying throughout the Sierra.<P>

<H3>Learning to Look</H3>

We read of tree death in Europe and in the tropics, and I am telling you it is
happening here in North America. Yet we look out our windows, what do we see?
Trees.<P>

I remember what West Virginia landowner and self-taught naturalist Joe
Aliff told me when we were tramping through the "falling forest" in the
Appalachian hollows. To see what is happening, he said, "All you got to do is
look." By that he meant something more than having one's eyelids in the open
position. And when you <I>look</I>, you see that the trees are dying.<P>

I have since learned to see a world of dying trees -- dying because the trunks have been bored
into and the leaves have been stripped by pests; dying because fungi are girdling
their bases and branches and turning their leaves to black corpses; dying because
their shrunken roots can no longer absorb enough nutrients and water to keep them
alive; dying from the direct effects of too much ozone in the troposphere and not
enough in the stratosphere; dying because neighboring trees have been clearcut,
allowing cold, heat and drying winds into their precincts; dying because of being
bathed too often in the sour gases of industry; dying because the weather
patterns have changed and they cannot adapt quickly enough.<P>

The more trees that die, the more trees that will die. In the forlorn formulation of ecologist George
Woodwell, climate warming from an increasing greenhouse effect could, in
temperate forests especially, increase the respiration rate of trees to the
degree that it may surpass the rate of photosynthesis. The tree would then no
longer be a net producer of oxygen, but a net producer of carbon dioxide.<P>

"The amount of carbon dioxide that could be injected into the atmosphere," wrote
Woodwell and longtime associate Richard Houghton in Scientific American, could
theoretically approach "approximately 750 billion metric tons, or about the same
amount of carbon as there is in the atmosphere currently." Implied by this
analysis is a devastating feedback loop in which trees in the vast northern
hemisphere forests, instead of absorbing carbon, add to the global build-up of
CO2 in a nightmarish cycle, whose finale could be a worldwide policy decision to
cut down trees in order to protect the Earth's oxygen supply!<P>

<H3>Our Forests Are Growing Silent</H3>

The widespread deaths of forest-dwelling species also strongly suggest an extreme
ecosystem imbalance. Increasing levels of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation are
leaking through the thinning stratospheric ozone shield and harming not only
trees. Researchers at Oregon State University have found that the frogs living in
the forest pools and streamsides of the Cascade Mountains are failing to
regenerate because increased UV-B radiation scrambles the cells of frog eggs,
which lay uncover-ed in shallow water. The decline of amphibians of all types has
been noted since the 1970s. <I>Bufo boreas</I>, the common Western toad, is now absent
in more than 80 percent of its original range. The toad is the victim of a
malfunctioning immune system. <I>Bufo periglenes</I>, the golden toad of Costa Rica, has
not been seen since 1988. In Australia, the so-called gastric-brooding frog
disappeared in 1980 and is presumed extinct. In Canada, the population of the
northern leopard frog, <I>Rana pipiens</I>, has crashed, as have the Yosemite toad and
the red-legged frog in California. According to Emily Yoffe, writing in <I>The New
York Times Magazine</I>, nearly one-third of North America's 86 species of frogs and
toads are in trouble and, worldwide, "Researchers estimate that one-quarter to
one-half of the Earth's species could be extinct in the next 30 years."<P>

In Europe's forests (and to a lesser degree in the US) a mass extinction of
mushrooms may be taking place. In Holland, Eef Arnolds has found that the number
of viable mushroom species in test plots declined from 37 to 12 over a 20-year
period. In England, mycologists report that 20 species are in decline. In
general, European researchers believe that the mushroom decline is bound up with
the decline of forests from pollution and related causes.<P>

In the Midwest forests, earthworms are dying. According to ecologist Orie Loucks, studies of soil
invertebrates in parts of Ohio and Indiana subject to air pollution deposition
"show a 50 percent decline in the density of invertebrates and a 97 percent
decline in the density of earthworms." These extraordinary data have led Loucks
and others to describe the mixed mesophytic forest as resembling an ecosystem
with AIDS -- a metaphor that concerns not only trees, but all the myriad species
that make up a forest ecosystem and keep it operating and functioning by
producing oxygen and sequestering carbon.<P>

<H3>Strategies for the Endgame</H3>

Have we crossed the threshold? Are we now dealing with nature in another zone --
the endgame? The question is: what should be done?<P>

Should we plant trees? Yes, of course, plant billions. But can we reforest the Earth in such a way that it will
stay reforested?<P>

Reduce the pollution caused by gluttonous fossil-fuel energy
use? Yes, of course. But not to the level of 1990, as the policymakers suggest
and have legislated. Trees were dying long before that. The mid-50s would be
closer to the mark.<P>

Stop cutting forests? Of course. Zero cut on our national
forests would be a tiny beginning. Stopping the pillage of the rainforest is a
given. But have too many atoms of carbon -- and too many species of virus --
already been released?<P>

End the production of CFCs? Without question. But have the
chlorine atoms that have already risen to the stratosphere entrained an
unstoppable feedback reaction that will cause an increasing ultraviolet
bombardment of trees and forests and frogs and humans no matter what we do?<P>

Control population and consumption? Absolutely. But would even the most
extraordinary efforts in this regard come soon enough?<P>

Environmentalism practices
the language of crisis: to insist that something be done before it is too late.
But what we need now is a language (and the intellectual constructs that go with
it) to deal with a <I>post-crisis</I> environmental condition. And our response to the
dying of the trees is at the heart of the matter.<P>

In the course of my research, I
have learned things I wish I had not learned. I have learned that the trees are
dying. And that the more trees die, the more will die. I have learned that we
have crossed the threshold. And I simply do not know how we can get back safely
to the other side.<P>

Such a conclusion can lead to despair. I think the only
antidote to despair is to stay firm in the belief that, as William Wordsworth put
it in <I>Tintern Abbey</I>, "nature never did betray the heart that loved her."<P>

We must begin to love her as we have never been asked to love before. Even then, it will
take a century or more for environmental repair; for letting nature heal herself.<P>

Thus have we come to the crux of the matter: the trees could save us, if we would
save the trees.

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Forest Death in Coal River Valley</TITLE>

<H1>Forest Death in Coal River Valley</H1>

<H2>by John Flynn</H2>

Montcoal, WV -- Sprawling across parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia,
Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama, the mixed mesophytic forest is the greatest hardwood forest in
the world and the oldest in North America. Nearly as big as New England,  the mixed mesophytic
(<I>meso</I>, mid-range and <I>phytic</I>, plant) forest is the largest relatively unbroken stretch of deciduous
woodland in the US.<P>

In <I>The Dying of the Trees</I>, Charles Little calls the mixed mesophytic "the
'mother forest' of eastern North America -- the forest that has provided the germplasm resources
from which all other forests have subsequently arisen." This summer, the Mother Forest turned
sickly as the verdant greenery of southern West Virginia was abruptly transformed into an eerie
backdrop of browns and yellows.<P>

In the last ten days of July, anthracnose-like browning began to
curl the foliage of yellow poplar, sycamore, red maple and redbud along a 50-mile east-to-west
belt in the Coal River Valley, 40 miles west of Charleston. Blister-like lesions on petioles (leaf
stems) were visible on all species. The damage -- and the sud-denness with which it occurred --
was most easily detected in poplar trees, which are relatively free of insect and disease damage.<P>

Between July 20-25, poplar leaves began rapidly browning and curling. The damage began on leaf
blades and spread rapidly. Within a few days, yards were littered with fallen leaves. Shedding
occurred in leaves of all ages. Foliage on the outer twigs of larger trees in open settings was the
most severely affected. Poplars growing in moister, less-exposed settings were significantly less
affected.<P>

During the first week of August, the foliage on shagbark hickory and three species of oak
-- white, chestnut and chinkapin -- began curling and browning. By August 20, damage was
evident at all elevations.<P>

The shedding was not drought-related, since the combined rainfall for May
and June was more than three inches above the norm. Normal sunlight, while possibly a
contributing factor, does not cause dark, burn-like discoloration on leaves.<P>

With the help of <A HREF="methbro.html">Ozone</A> Action, the Appalachia Forest Action Project (AFAP) obtained satellite readings prepared by
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration physicist Art Neuendorffer. The readings revealed
that the ozone layer was at record or near-record lows in southern West Virginia throughout July.
Neuendorffer concluded that: "It's very likely the trees were getting record amounts of UV-B." In
fact, the damage to broad-leafed species was accompanied by severe needle damage on white pines
-- symptoms associated with UV-B damage.<P>

Upper-level ozone is measured by Dobson units. As
Dobson units go down, UV-B exposure goes up at a rate of approximately two-to-one. During the
past 16 years, southern West Virginia had a July noontime average of approximately 330 Dobson.
The average for July, 1995, however, was 292 for the month and 282 for the last 20 days, with a
low of 278 on July 17. This value is 16 percent below normal, suggesting that UV-B intensity
could have been 30-35 percent higher than normal.<P>

 On August, 14, 1995, AFAP volunteers
observed severe drooping and bending on white pine needles at several locations in Raleigh and
Boone counties. The damage resembled UV-B-damage symptoms that ecologist Orie Loucks of Miami
University in Oxford, Ohio, discovered in white pine in Ohio and Toronto, Canada in 1993 during
the worst ozone-loss readings on record. Loucks observed similar damage in Ohio this summer
when stratospheric ozone levels were again severely depressed.<P>

Specimens of the damaged leaves
were collected by the AFAP and turned over to the US Forest Service (USFS) laboratory in
Morgantown, West Virginia. USFS plant pathologist Martin MacKenzie tentatively ruled out insects,
fungi or chemical pollution as a cause of the damage. "The damage I observed was sun-directed,"
MacKenzie concluded.<P>

If UV-B damage is ultimately confirmed, it would mark the first evidence that
the loss of stratospheric ozone has begun to damage broadleaf trees. Because of the critical need to
be able to "fingerprint UV-B damage," Loucks is calling for immediate action at the federal level.
"As national policy, we simply must have the answer to this question" before next spring, he
maintained.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Women's Summit Report</TITLE>

<H1>Women's Summit Report</H1>

<H2>by Sara Chamberlain</H2>

China <I>via WomensNet</I> -- In the last week of August, 28,000 women converged on Huairou, a
pre-fab "conference town" 40 miles north of Beijing, the controversial site for the NGO Forum on
Women. The August 30-September 8 conference of non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
overlapped the September 4-15 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women (WCW) but,
because communication between the two meetings was limited by distance and transportation
difficulties, NGO delegates felt cut off from the UN proceedings in Beijing and unable to influence
the WCW's Platform for Action.<P>

The isolation of the NGO Forum was compounded by polluted skies,
torrential downpours and 80 percent humidity throughout much of the proceedings. Damp
restaurants, half-finished concrete apartment blocks and neon-lit supermarkets lined the streets
of Huairou. The forum site itself was a maze of tents, school buildings and auditoriums. The layout
was complicated by contradictory "official maps" and numerous security checks.<P>

However, despite weather and logistical problems, the mood of the NGO conference was one of solidarity, strength and
optimism, as women from around the world condemned the degradation of the environment. Their
circumstances, priorities and strategies for action may have differed substantially, but they shared
many similar concerns. Veiled Muslim women from Palestine and Kuwait discussed the negative
environmental impacts of war with Rwandan lawyers in batik turbans. African-American
teenagers sang raps about industrial pollution in their communities while Indian activists in saris
discussed seed patent laws with Japanese delegates in suits.<P>

At the NGO Forum, the Women's
Environment and Development Organization (WEDO) stated that "women's health and the health of
the natural environment are inextricably linked." Northern women from the US, Canada, Europe,
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, brought a diversity of environmental issues to the
conference, but they remained united by their concern for the links between disease and
environmental degradation.<P>

Northern NGOs overwhelmingly attributed environmental problems to
unsustainable production and consumption patterns. Sascha Kranendonk, director of Women in
Europe for a Common Future, emphasized the links between toxic substances and birth defects,
cancers, and other new and resurgent diseases. Kranendonk told delegates that dioxin levels in Dutch
women's breast milk are so high that they are advised not to breast-feed their <A HREF="babies.html">babies</A>. WEDO noted
that "cancer incidence rates have reached epidemic proportions in many Northern countries, with
one in every three people in the United States expected to develop a form of cancer."<P>

Women of color, Indigenous women and poor women throughout the North are also exposed to toxic substances
while working on production lines and in agricultural production. Mily Trevino-Sauceda, director
of Lideres Campesinas en California (the Farm Workers Leadership Project of California),
described how unsustainable agricultural production is affecting the health of women agricultural
workers. She said that migrant workers suffer from a variety of health problems, including
"breathing difficulties, impaired eyesight, a variety of cancers, difficult pregnancies and <A HREF="babies.html">babies</A>
born with birth defects," all of which she attributed to pesticide exposure.<P>

Environmental justice delegations made up of Indigenous women and women of color observed that a disproportionate
amount of environmental degradation is being perpetrated on their lands and in their communities.
Indigenous women spoke out against unsustainable mining, drilling and logging practices that are
contaminating the water, air and lands of Indigenous peoples. African-American Margaret Prescod,
Director of the International Network of Women of Color, described the "toxification of African
American, Latino and Native American communities" as a "life or death situation." Connie Tucker,
Executive Director of the Southern Organizing Committee for Economic and Social Justice, accused
multinational corporations and the US government of treating Indigenous and African-American
communities as if they were "expendable."<P>

<H3>A Platform Without Justice?</H3>

Despite a petition campaign and active lobbying by NGOs at the UN conference, the terms
"environmental racism" and "environmental justice" were not included in the Platform for Action,
the official UN document signed by more than 180 nations.<P>

Members of the NGO environmental
caucus lobbied UN delegates to include the following paragraph in the environmental section of the
document: "Black, Indigenous and other peoples of color, and other sectors of poor people in both the
North and South, are particularly affected by environmental racism and the disproportionate
impact of military pollution, as well as the storage and dumping of toxic materials and drugs, and
the siting of polluting industries and activities on their lands and in their communities." However,
the paragraph was rejected in favor of two brief phrases noting that "Poverty and environmental
degradation are closely related" and "risks to women's health are particularly high in urban areas,
as well as low-income areas."<P>

The links between nuclear pollution, testing and power, uranium
mining, and women's and children's diseases were also a major concern at the NGO conference.
Kathy Sanchez, programs manager of Tewa Women United, a Native American group, told delegates
how her pueblo in New Mexico is being poisoned by the adjacent Los Alamos National Laboratory and
nuclear waste storage facility. She commented that "there are laws to protect endangered species,
but none to protect endangered peoples.... There are only 500 of us [native Tewa] left and now we
are being poisoned by nuclear radiation."<P>

Anna Syomina, the director of MAMA-86, informed
delegates that health problems in Ukraine have escalated since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.
MAMA-86 is named after the mothers who founded the organization after the radiation-related
sicknesses that their children had developed since 1986 were left untreated. According to Syomina,
a shocking 70 percent of Ukrainian children are born with birth defects and, of the 30 percent who
are born healthy, only 20 percent were still healthy by the time they graduated from high school.
She added that "Chernobyl AIDS," an immune-deficiency disease, is now prevalent among Ukrainian
children. Syomina also told NGO delegates that one in six women in Ukraine is infertile and 40
percent cannot carry their pregnancies to term. In addition, thyroid problems, which barely
existed before the Chernobyl disaster, are now widespread.<P>

At the UN conference, anti-nuclear
NGOs supported strong language opposing the transboundary transportation of nuclear waste in the
Platform for Action. However, despite objections by Fiji, Panama, Nigeria and the Marshall
Islands, text calling for the "immediate" prohibition of transboundary toxic waste movement was
watered down to a pledge to "consider taking action."<P>

Language linking nuclear energy and weapons
to environmental degradation that was agreed upon during preparatory sessions in New York was
also omitted in Beijing. Meanwhile, wording calling for an immediate ban on nuclear testing was
radically altered. The US and Canada pushed through an alternative sentence, stating that countries'
nuclear testing programs "should exercise extreme restraint."

<H3>Consuming Desires</H3>

Fortunately, Northern delegates at the NGO conference did more than merely testify to the negative
health impacts of environmental destruction. Earth Island's delegation joined other NGOs to develop
strategies for action that included forming international environmental networks and exchanging
information about initiatives underway to change unsustainable production and consumption
patterns.<P>

Eco-labeling schemes were cited as an exemplary method for educating consumers about
their purchasing choices. Indian eco-feminist and Earth Island Advisory Board member Vandana
Shiva proposed a "Food Miles" labeling system that would indicate the amount of fossil fuels and
natural resources consumed to manufacture and transport food products.<P>

Although Northern delegates focused primarily on the negative impacts of unsustainable production and consumption
patterns in their communities, the impacts of these practices on Southern women were made clear
by sister delegates from the South. Roopa Vajpaie, director of VOICE, a New Delhi-based consumer
association, spoke out on behalf of Southern women whose environments are being destroyed by
Northern pesticides used on export crops; whose natural resources are being sold to the highest
foreign bidder; and "whose only consumer choice is no choice."<P>

Leslie O'Dowd, director of Friends of
the Earth Ireland, concluded that "we [in the North] must radically readjust our consumption and
production patterns if a sustainable future is to be ensured for all." After much lobbying, the UN
Platform for Action did finally include a sentence stating that "the major cause of continued
deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of production and consumption,
particularly in industrialized countries."<P>

<H3>Platform Pluses</H3>

The UN Platform for Action does contain some strong language on environmental issues and endorses
Agenda 21's "precautionary principal" (requiring an immediate response to potential worldwide
catastrophes -- such as global warming -- without waiting for conclusive scientific proof). It also
insists on clean water for all by the year 2000, recognizes gender-differentiated impacts of
environmental problems and policies, and acknowledges women's unique environmental expertise in
the promotion of renewable energy sources.<P>

The document states that "resource depletion, the
degradation of natural systems and the danger of polluting substances... are destroying fragile
ecosystems and displacing communities, especially women, from productive activities and are an
increasing threat to a safe and healthy environment." The Platform for Action also notes that
"poverty and environmental degradation are closely related," and that "environmental risks in the
workplace may have a disproportionate impact on women's health because of women's different
susceptibilities to the toxic effects of various chemicals."<P>

The Platform for Action concludes that
"women have expressed their commitment to create a new development paradigm that integrates
environmental sustainability with gender equality and justice..." which will require "women's
participation and leadership at every level."<P>

Nonetheless, the document's treatment of nuclear,
environmental justice and other critical "green" issues, was a disappointment to environmental
NGOs. "We were in the door, but not at the table," summarized Earth Island Advisory Board member
Claire Greensfelder of Plutonium Free Futures. In contrast, the NGO Forum, which successfully
conducted 6000 workshops in the space of a week, was a tremendous learning and networking
experience that produced concrete strategies for action and forged powerful relationships.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: A Call for a Green GOP</TITLE>

<H1>A Call for a Green GOP</H1>

<H2>by Gordon E. Gurnil</H2>

There is a perceived conflict in an individual being a conservative Republican and, at the same time,
an environmentalist. I do not see the conflict. I am both.<P>

For nearly 40 years, I have developed and practiced my conservative philosophy. I have been an environmentalist for only five years, but
even so, I have become convinced that current environmental policies are putting our children in
harm's way.<P>

Preserving our natural resources should be a conservative tenet. Restoring degraded
natural resources to something close to what they used to be surely should be a conservative goal.
But contemporary environmentalism is much broader; it has to do with the prevention of adverse
health effects, not just preservation or restoration.<P>

I have never met a conservative who prefers
dirty air to clean air, or fouled water to healthy water. Nor have I met conservatives who want to
expose their children and grandchildren to toxic substances. Conservative friends of my age (nearly
60) often reminisce about fishing in streams so clean they could drink from them, or about the
beauty of a clear blue sky in summertime. They would like to see those conditions once again. But
these same friends, and most members of the public for that matter, have not yet faced the
possibility that some of our actions might have adverse effects on future generations of humans. If
they were presented with that evidence to the extent that it is now known, they would act.<P>

I am concerned that one of the largest barriers to achieving environmental protection is the artificial
labeling of those who seek a clean environment as liberals and the labeling of conservatives as
anti-environmentalists. It seems to me that the philosophical debate should take place on how we
solve environmental problems, not on whether they should be solved.<P>

I believe that the segregation of environmental activism from real-life motivations could reduce environmental protection to a
disingenuous concern among policymakers in business and government. I feel that it has already
done so.<P>

Regulation alone will never virtually eliminate anything. Evidence to the contrary is
nonexistent. But as long as our minds are set on trying to ratchet down the amount of poison we are
injecting into the air or the water or the ground, society will never get rid of the stuff that most all
agree must go. But thousands and thousands of people work for government as regulators. They have
spent careers learning how to ratchet down. Will they favor changing their jobs from trying to
manage the unmanageable to taking charge of preventing serious pollutants in the first place?<P>

Had my mother said, "Gordon, stay away from the acid pond or I will have your dad beat you silly when
you get home," it probably would have prevented me from exposing myself to those dangers. Will
governments need to use such language, enforced by law, or will the giants of industry be smart
enough to do it for themselves? If they do, that would provide for a much brighter future for our
economy and our environment than would simply relying on government to cure all of our ills.<P>

Conservatives want lower taxes and smaller government, with fewer regulations and regulators.
Pollution prevention, instead of all the high-cost bureaucratic mandates and regulatory harassment
at the tail-end of the pollution trail, can achieve those conservative purposes.<P>

Conservatives believe in individual rights. But is not the insidious invasion of our bodies by harmful unsolicited
chemicals the most flagrant violation of our individual rights?<P>

We conservatives bemoan the decline in values that has besieged our society. Why then should we not abhor the lack of morality
involved in discharging untested chemicals into the air, ground and water to alter and harm, to
whatever degree, human life and wildlife?<P>

We conservatives believe it unconscionable that
government programs such as welfare are tearing at the fabric of the family. Why then are we not
so concerned with the causes of childhood cancer? Why not go to the local children's hospital and
visit with those brave youngsters with ineffective immune systems trying to fight off the
devastating evils of cancer? Why not add childhood cancer to our concerns about the family, asking
why the emphasis is still on how to cure it instead of how to prevent it?<P>

The symmetry of nature is loaned to us for human use over relatively short periods of time -- 70 or 80 years each if we are
fortunate. Each of us has a moral duty not to disrupt that balance. For centuries humans met that
moral duty, but over the past half century we have become too urbane to worry about such mundane
things.<P>

The quarter-century campaign to halt tobacco use is a good example to follow. The same
stewardship could transform the chemical industry: a reasonable timetable for change, concern
about socioeconomic dislocation, research into safe alternatives.<P>

Unfortunately, the chemical industry is emulating tactics of the tobacco industry by denial and delay, and by diverting attention
elsewhere. But I think businesspeople will see the light. I think they are decent people. I think they
want to do the right thing.<P>

Oh, it might take a reminder from the public now and then or a prod by
an international commission or a poke by government, but we are on the way to achieving serious
pollution prevention. The time for toxic tolerance is past. It is time for us conservatives to sign on.
We can be the leaders who make a major difference for our nation, our continent, our globe.<P>

Tell the local industry that you want proper stewardship of the environment. Make some noise. Kick up
some dust. Be optimistic. Know that your concerns, your words, your actions, do matter.<P>

Don't demand 100 percent proof of harm before acting. Set priorities, make some decisions, then act on
those decisions.<P>

And one last word to my conservative colleagues: we should be leading the parade!

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Looking in a Deeper Lair: A Tribute to Wallace Stegner</TITLE>

<H1>Looking in a Deeper Lair: A Tribute to Wallace Stegner</H1>

<H2>by Barry Lopez</H2>

<HR>

Writer and teacher Wallace Stegner was a passionate voice for bringing human activities into
harmony with nature.  On April 27, five of the American West's most renowned writers, Ivan Doig,
Gretel Ehrlich, William Kittredge, Terry Tempest Williams and Barry Lopez, paid tribute to
Stegner at a benefit for the San Francisco Library's new Wallace Stegner Environmental Center. 
The following is Barry Lopez's presentation from the event.

<HR>

The past few weeks, I have been thinking about a line of Brecht, from <I>Galileo</I> I think: "Unhappy the
land that requires heroes." I've been thinking about it because the tendency with a great person like
Stegner, or Rachel Carson, or Thomas Merton, is to see them as different from us, capable of lives
we couldn't attempt. But that is not true. The complexities of their private lives, which we are not
privy to, made them like us, and they expressed virtues of which we are capable. From a certain
distance, Stegner, and Ms. Carson, and the Trappist monk, were faithful. They did not break faith
with their beliefs, they remained dedicated to something outside the self. As far as we know, they
never became the enemies of their souls or their memories.<P>

Brecht's line can be read against such
people in two ways: a land requiring heroes must be a sorry place, or the emergence of heroes is a
sign of trouble. Let me take the latter position. I believe Stegner saw the country, the American
West in particular, as a troubled place, laid siege to not by greed alone but by venal imaginations
and an insidious tendency to commodify its elements -- its trees, its soil, its water. Giving this
abuse an historical context, protesting its effects, and offering us a practical sort of hope, he was
our great citizen-writer.<P>

I don't know whether Stegner viewed with as much concern as I do an
underlying cause of this trouble, but I would feel I was abandoning the esteem in which I hold him if
I did not speak tonight straight from the heart about it. What alarms and troubles me is woven
tightly into the fabric of our culture, and it is apparent throughout the cultural West, from here to
Buenos Aires and Amsterdam, even to Singapore.<P>

Here's my perspective, and I ask your forbearance
with its simplicity. When we founded our particular democracy, we built into its design a system of
restraints so no traditional seat of tyranny could gain the upper hand. We called it "the balance of
powers" among the judiciary, the executive and legislative branches of government. Similarly, to
guard against political intransigence and the growth of dynasties, we provided for regular elections
and the individual vote. Today, the greater threat to individual freedom and dignity comes not from
tyrannical government but -- and, again, I ask your forbearance with a blunt and unparsed term
-- from capitalism.<P>

Like every other human system, including religions, capitalism carries with
it an intractable darkness. The difference for us is, though the effect of capitalism on our lives is at
least as profound as that of government, we do not elect its officials; and a review of its policies, its
plans for expansion, are, practically speaking, beyond the reach of the citizenry. The suggestion, in
fact, of citizen review to prevent the economic and social (let alone environmental) damage of
which capitalistic enterprise is capable, is considered by many a threat to economic growth.
Corporations, thoroughly integrated into public life but legally constituted as individuals, have a
desire, but no constitutional right, to vote; they do vote, of course, through lobbyists, a pernicious
system for corrupting and undemocratic influence.<P>

Our modern predicament, the general malaise
we share about our social prospects, grows out of the failure to check or balance a force this
powerful. On the scale we practice capitalism, the markets for its products must expand
significantly year by year if it is to survive. This doesn't mean, solely, that product advertising
taps us more and more frequently on the shoulder, calling out to us from every flat surface,
including our clothing; or that fashion now plays as prominent a role in shaping our society as
ethics; or that our national landscape is continually shredded and polluted to produce, on any given
day, another hundred distracting geegaws; or that obsolescence has become as much a part of a
manufactured item as clay or metal once was. These are commonplace philosophical laments.<P>

Something more disturbing, I think, lies in a deeper lair.<P>

In Western societies, which patriotically
support a system of economics promising mindboggling material wealth to a few, competition is no
longer seen as an occasional, useful good, but as a desirable and indispensable constant. Unsettling
questions that ethically astute businesspeople are prone to raise about conducting business are now
often dismissed as a failure of nerve, doubts of the unbelieving. With the failures of Communism, a
system as cruel and appealing, we can see more clearly where the imperative to produce and
acquire is pointing us.<P>

We live in a country in which the rate of consumption must constantly
increase. Our moderate birth rate expands that consumer base too slowly and in but one direction.
The required rate of expansion can be attained only by creating more consumers from the existing
population base, in short, by maintaining the high level of social disintegration we have grown to
accept -- divorce; the subdivision of an individual life into separate spheres of work, play, and
home life; regular changes of address in pursuit of career goals; children living lives between and
apart from their families. It means an inordinate emphasis on private ownership in preference to
sharing and on the autonomy of individuals to do whatever they choose. It means a cynical promotion
of individual thought and preference. And it means manipulating the line between mental health and
mental illness, for example, so that advertising that treats us as unfulfilled or unrewarded people
will seem compassionate and knowledgeable in offering us emollients.<P>

Perhaps the saddest aspect of this imperative to consume in the West is that we're asked to accept a piece of certifiable rubbish:
more satisfaction is ultimately to be found in a product -- a style of trouser, a personally tailored
system of electronic communication, an exercise regimen, a career -- than in another human
being. We will be happier with a young, handsome stranger in Barbados for a week, it is implied,
than in the company of someone we love and who loves us and to whom we feel responsible and
obligated.<P>

To an outsider, we would appear to be a race of people grown inept at human expression
-- making love, fixing dinner for someone, presenting an idea -- without devices or accouterments
to focus and enhance our meaning. To an outsider, it might also appear that, psychologically if not
actually, many of us live in isolation; and that separated from a continuous stream of stimulation
derived from our purchases we become anxious.<P>

What way is there out of this morass? If we read history, we know that on a smaller scale it was ever thus. We know that our measure as a people in
the cultural West is, always, not what we have made but what we have imagined. And we know that
the failure of a technology is as nothing compared with the failure of our imaginations. We know the
way out of this. It is love -- the Christian's agape, tolerance of the Other, the compassion of the
Bodhisattva, simple charity. It is the wisdom to accept rather than solve the intractable paradoxes
of life.<P>

On a practical level, we have to stop making things that sell, and make things that help. We
have to rediscover story -- and music and the theater and dance and painting and photography -- as
sources of renewal, not products, as the wellsprings of our dignity, our awareness. We have to
discover, again, that our fate does not lie with government, or with capitalism, but with each other.<P>

And we must rediscover a sense of humor. Laughter makes our straits no less dire but certainly
more bearable, less tyrannizing. We need to joke that if the smoke-free building is a reality, then
the Muzak-free building and the billboard-free neighborhood are close at hand -- a virtual reality.<P>

In my life I have had the privilege of traveling in several parts of the world with Indigenous people.
One of the lessons that has come from that experience is to understand the past not as a record of
mistakes and imperfection, but as a source of wisdom. We apply this so-called ancient but actually
timeless wisdom repeatedly to the imperfections that dog us as a species -- bad faith,
self-aggrandizement, fundamentalisms. In this way, we differ little from Aranda people in the
Northern Territory, or Araucanians in Chile, Inuit on Ellesmere Island, or Kamba living in Nairobi.
The repository of wisdom, in an oral culture or a literate culture like ours in the West, lies in
story; that is to say, in what we tell each other that lasts. It is these stories, not the storytellers,
that are indispensable. And if there are heroes among us, it is the readers, I think, not the writers,
who are heroic. If a writer should crystallize in a few stories, in a book, in public testimony, a way
of seeing, a way of belief to which he or she tries to be faithful, its value lies not with the celebrity
of the individual but with what the story or the book causes, with what the reader does.<P>

I believe what we say in tribute to Stegner is thank you. Thank you for reminding us. Thank you for your
faith. Thank you for historical perspective. Thank you for giving us to believe, as you did, that we
have reason to hope because our fate does not lie with one man or one woman, with a few heroes, but
with ourselves. And, day to day, one event to another, we are a determined, brave and imaginative
people.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Wilderness: The Geography of Hope</TITLE>

<H1>Wilderness: The Geography of Hope</H1>

<H2>by Wallace Stegner</H2>

<I>See also: <A HREF="stegner.html">Looking in a Deeper Lair: A Tribute to Wallace Stegner</A> by Barry Lopez<P></I>

Something will have gone out of us as a people if we ever let the remaining wilderness be destroyed;
if we permit the last virgin forests to be turned into comic books and plastic cigarette cases; if we
drive the few remaining members of the wild species into zoos or to extinction; if we pollute the
last clear air and dirty the last clean streams and push our paved roads through the last of the
silence, so that never again will Americans be free in their own country from the noise, the
exhausts, the stinks of human and automotive waste. And so that never again can we have the chance
to see ourselves single, separate, vertical and individual in the world, part of the environment of
trees and rocks and soil, brother to the other animals, part of the natural world and competent to
belong in it. Without any remaining wilderness we are committed wholly, without chance for even
momentary reflection and rest, to a headlong drive into our technological termite-life, the Brave
New World of a completely man-controlled environment. We need wilderness preserved -- as much
of it as is still left, and as many kinds -- because it was the challenge against which our character
as a people was formed. The reminder and the reassurance that it is still there is good for our
spiritual health even if we never once in ten years set foot in it. It is good for us when we are
young, because of the incomparable sanity it can bring briefly, as vacation and rest, into our insane
lives. It is important to us when we are old simply because it is there -- important, that is, simply
as idea.<P>

 We are a wild species, as Darwin pointed out. Nobody ever tamed or domesticated or
scientifically bred us. But for at least three millennia we have been engaged in a cumulative and
ambitious race to modify and gain control of our environment, and in the process we have come
close to domesticating ourselves. Not many people are likely, anymore, to look upon what we call
"progress" as an unmixed blessing. Just as surely as it has brought us increased comfort and more
material goods, it has brought us spiritual losses, and it threatens now to become the Frankenstein
that will destroy us. One means of sanity is to retain a hold on the natural world, to remain, insofar
as we can, good animals. Americans still have that chance, more than many peoples; for while we
were demonstrating ourselves the most efficient and ruthless environment-busters in history, and
slashing and burning and cutting our way through a wilderness continent, the wilderness was
working on us. It remains in us as surely as Indian names remain on the land. If the abstract dream
of human liberty and human dignity became, in America, something more than an abstract dream,
mark it down at least partially to the fact that we were in subtle ways subdued by what we
conquered.... <P>

...We simply need that wild country available to us, even if we never do more than
drive to its edge and look in. For it can be a means of reassuring ourselves of our sanity as
creatures, a part of the geography of hope.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Global Weather Grows More Severe</TITLE>

<H1>Global Weather Grows More Severe</H1>

<H2>by Rhys Roth</H2>

A National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) study shows that weather has been growing more extreme.
It scrutinized US records for the last 80 years to track summer droughts, drenching rainstorms,
wet winters and other types of unusual weather events that are expected to increase in a
greenhouse-heated world. <P>

The NCDC discovered that since the late 1970s, the climate has been stuck in a greenhouse-type mode, in which extreme weather occurs more often. Statistical analyses
showed only a five percent probability that the "latest surge toward the greenhouse side is just
another fluctuation of an otherwise stable climate," according to Science writer Richard A. Kerr.<P>

Most of the extra heat added to the climate by greenhouse gases is absorbed by the oceans, which
cover 70 percent of the Earth. At 63.8 million square miles, the Pacific Ocean is roughly the same
size as all the Earth's land masses. <P>

In the past 20 years, Bernice Wuethrich reported in the
February 4, 1995 <I>New Scientist</I>, the surface of the central Pacific has warmed by 0.5 degrees
Celsius and "a giant pool of unusually warm water has settled down in the middle of the Pacific and
is showing no signs of moving."<P>

Nicholas E. Graham of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography
claims that not only has the temperature of Pacific Ocean surface waters been climbing since the
mid-1970s, but evaporation, air moisture and rainfall over tropical waters have increased as
well.<P>

Graham warns that while the changes since the 1970s could be natural, "there is disquieting
similarity" with the early climate changes predicted from an increase of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere.<P>

<H3>Clear the Air (Cook the Planet?)</H3>

The impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on the Earth's climate has been underestimated
because of the cooling effect of sulfur dioxide (SO2), another form of fossil fuel pollution. Like
CO2, SO2 releases from fossil fuel burning are also affecting the Earth's atmosphere.<P>

It is easier to measure the impact of SO2 than CO2 on climate because, instead of trapping heat like CO2, particles
of SO2 suspended in the atmosphere reflect sunlight away from the Earth, cooling the climate
beneath. Sulfur dioxide does  not travel far because it is washed out of the atmosphere within a
couple of weeks. This means that SO2 veils the regions around the biggest polluters -- eastern
North America, Europe and eastern Asia. In contrast, greenhouse gases like CO2 survive for decades
in the atmosphere, long enough to spread evenly around the globe and affect climate for several
generations.<P>

NCDC research has demonstrated that in regions where SO2 emissions are highest,
temperatures are cooler compared to unveiled parts of the globe. The greatest cooling was found to
occur during summer days, when there is more solar energy for SO2 to reflect. After the Clean Air
Act began limiting SO2 emissions beginning in 1970, the cooling trend in the US ended.<P>

These observations offer compelling evidence that humans are changing the climate, and according to
NCDC's Thomas R. Karl, "the reduction of temperature is large enough to have an impact on global
temperatures." Over the last 140 years, the Earth's temperature has risen by 0.6 degrees Celsius.
Karl estimates that, had it not been for the cooling effect of SO2 em-issions, the planet would have
warmed more than one degree Celsius by now.

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Blowing Holes in the Montreal Protocol</TITLE>

<H1>Blowing Holes in the Montreal Protocol</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

"This is a crucial year for the Montreal Protocol," noted United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP) spokesperson Tore Brevik, referring to the UN agreement that commits 150 signatory
countries to phase out ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) production by the year 2000.<P>

Under the Montreal Protocol, Brevik noted, "production and consumption of ... [CFCs have] been
dramatically cut by nearly 70 percent... [and] industrialized countries are expected to virtually
eliminate the consumption of [ozone-depleting substances] by the end of 1995." EPA spokesperson
Mary Nichols repeated this point when she told the press that "December 31, 1995 is the last day
on which CFCs can be legally manufactured...." <P>

However, according to a September 14 Ozone Action report [1621 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20009; (202) 265-6738], the
December 31 deadline is  a "myth." Ozone Action's report, "Deadly Complacency," reveals that
"loopholes in US law and international regulations" will leave large chemical companies free to
"produce more than 200,000 tons of new CFCs in 1996, more than 100,000 tons a year from
1997 to 1999 and more than 50,000 tons per year from 2000 to 2005." The waiver grants
extended CFC-production rights for both "essential use" within the US and for export to developing
countries. <P>

The four corporations that will continue to manufacture "outlawed" CFCs in the US are
DuPont, LaRoche, Allied Signal and Elf Atochem. "This production will, most likely, be consolidated
and handled by one or two of these companies," the report states.<P>

 Ozone Action contends that "Operation Cool Breeze," the industry-backed joint-EPA/FBI/CIA/Interpol crack-down on illegal 
CFC production, is actually "a strategic effort by Western corporations and governments to protect
and enhance their market-share of global CFC production. This bid for control over the
ozone-destroying refrigerant market represents a 'New Cold War,' with the battle lines once again
drawn between East and West."<P>

This view is shared by India's Environment Ministry, which
recently criticized Western governments for "eliminating competition from [developing] countries
and handing over the developing countries' market for ozone-depleting substances on a platter to
multinational companies of developed countries."<P>

Under the Montreal Protocol, Western corporations can produce almost 2.19 million tons of CFCs between now and 2005. US companies
are expected to account for 629,000 tons of the total. Operation Cool Breeze's assault on "illegal"
CFCs could drive the US share of the global CFC market from its current 24 percent to 31 percent
by 1997.<P>

The Ozone Action report also revealed that the 500 tons of CFCs already confiscated by the
Feds will not be destroyed. The government plans "to either sell them or have the US military use
them."

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Toxic Tampons Pose Health Risks</TITLE>

<H1>Toxic Tampons Pose Health Risks</H1>

<H2>by Sara Chamberlain</H2>

An American woman uses as many as 11,000 tampons in her lifetime. Most tampons sold by
companies such as Tampax, OB, Playtex and Kotex are made of rayon or rayon-cotton blends. Rayon,
a woodpulp derivative commonly bleached with chlorine, contains dioxin, an organochlorine formed
during the bleaching process.<P>

Mounting evidence suggests that low levels of dioxin may be linked to
cancer (especially breast cancer), immune system suppression and low sperm counts. A February
7 <I>Village Voice</I> article estimated that 73 million US women regularly risk dioxin exposure when
they put bleached sanitary products in contact with highly absorbent mucous membranes. <P>

In 1992, a congressional subcommittee discovered a March 1989 memo stating that Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) scientists had detected trace levels of dioxin in tampons.<P>

The memo warned that "the risk of dioxin in tampons can be quite high," and that "the most effective risk-management
strategy would be to assure that tampons contain no dioxin." Subcommittee chair Ted Weiss accused
the FDA of purposely ignoring the dioxin danger in tampons. A New York University School of
Medicine study, published in the July 1994 issue of <I>Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and
Gynecology</I>, suggested that rayon also produces <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> bacteria, which cause toxic
shock syndrome (TSS). When researchers tested 20 varieties of tampons for their ability to induce
TSS toxins, the bacteria were detected in all US brands.<P>

Despite the deaths of 38 women in 1980 from tampon-related TSS, the tampon industry continues to deny that there is a connection between
TSS and rayon. A class- action lawsuit has been filed against Tambrands Inc., the makers of Tampax,
and Playtex Family Product Corp. by Jeannie Harding and Sandra Hayes, two Kansas women who
allege that they contracted TSS from the company's tampons. According to a May 31, 1994 <I>Wall
Street Journal</I> article, the lawsuit "seeks to require manufacturers to adequately notify women of
the alleged dangers of their products and to pay restitution, as well as establish a fund for
long-term monitoring and treatment of the illness."<P>

Fortunately, dioxin-free, 100-percent cotton tampons have been available to American women since September, 1993. Natracare, a British
company, offers a full line of sanitary products, including panty-liners that contain woodpulp
bleached with hydrogen peroxide (which has no negative impacts on human health or the
environment).<P>

In January, the California Assembly will consider a bill (A1963) to require the
state Department of Health Services to determine if sanitary products contain dioxin residue. The
bill would also require warning labels on all sanitary products found to contain dioxin residue.
Tampon companies are currently not required to list the contents of their products on their
packaging.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: McDonald's To Abandon UK Court Fight?</TITLE>

<H1>McDonald's To Abandon UK Court Fight?</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

UK -- The longest civil lawsuit in British history resumed in September as the
McDonald's Corporation renewed its campaign against two unemployed activists
charged with libel for distributing a leaflet criticizing the fast-food giant
[Winter '94-95, <I>EIJ</I>]. Over the last year, the $26 billion burger chain has spent
$1.5 million on the trial, called 56 witnesses, produced 40,000 documents and
hired one of England's best libel lawyers, Richard Rampton, at a rate of #2000
($3140) a day. The two defendants, Helen Steel, 29, and David Morris, 41, cannot
afford expensive legal counsel and are representing themselves.<P>

In mid-July, McDonald's lawyers announced that they would no longer provide photocopies of
their daily trial transcripts to the defendants unless they were paid #350 ($550)
a day -- a fee well beyond the defendants' means. Declaring that this action left
him feeling "uncomfortable," the presiding judge announced that he would spurn
the corporation's costly transcripts and, like the defendants, rely on tedious,
incomplete manual note-taking.<P>

The trial has proved highly embarrassing to McDonald's. In a confidential memo leaked to the defense,   McDonald's Australian
branch  begged the parent company to "minimize any further negative publicity"
and "contain it as a UK issue."<P>

With the trial expected to last another six
months, McDonald's is quietly attempting to settle with the defendants out of
court. Members of the corporation's US Board of Directors flew to Britain twice
for discussions with Steel and Morris.<P>

The "McLibel Two" have set clear
preconditions for allowing McDonald's to withdraw from the case: an agreement to
never again sue any individuals or groups for making similar criticisms of
McDonald's; a promise to apologize to everyone McDonald's has sued in the past;
and, payment of a "substantial sum to a mutually agreeable third party in lieu of
compensation to us."<P>

In a joint statement, Morris and Steel declared that it is
"a duty to criticize the practices of multinational corporations which dominate
our lives, our environment and the world's economy."<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: "Food Slander" Is Now a Crime</TITLE>

<H1>"Food Slander" Is Now a Crime</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

On August 17, a group of activists dumped a mixture of Diet Coke, NutraSweet
(aspartame) and rBGH-enhanced milk (produced from cows injected with genetically
engineered hormones) onto the pavement at Atlanta's Cheshire Bridge Shopping
Center.<P>

The demonstration, sponsored by the Pure Foods Campaign (PFC), took its
inspiration from the Boston Tea Party. But while dumping tea was considered a
patriotic act in Boston Harbor, dumping soda, sweetener and milk is considered a
crime in Georgia.<P>

"Food slander" laws, in force in Georgia and at least ten other
states, make it a civil crime to denigrate or criticize food products without a
"scientific basis," explained PFC coordinator Ronnie Cummings. "Industry
lobbyists admit that these laws are probably unconstitutional... their real
purpose is to intimidate activists and concerned consumers."<P>

Emory Law School professor David Bederman joined the PFC protest and explained to reporters how
"food disparagement" laws were ultimately intended to scare not only citizens,
but the media as well.<P>

In Georgia, South Dakota, Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Texas,
Arizona, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Colorado and Louisiana it is now against the law
to publicly criticize corporate food products under so-called "food
disparagement" laws promoted by agriculture, chemical and biotechnology industry
lobbyists. Similar laws are under consideration in Ohio and Illinois. "These laws
are intended to curtail the right to free speech, to make it illegal to hand out
leaflets or to dump rBGH milk in the gutter," Cummings charged.<P>

PFC claims that Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler "lied to Congress" when
he assured legislators that bovine somatrotropin (BST), the genetically
engineered growth hormone, was destroyed by pasteurization. Kessler's assurance,
which spared Monsanto (BST's manufacturer) the expense of any further research,
was based on a scientific paper written by Paul Groenewegen, a graduate student
from Guelph, Canada. According to PFC, Groenewegen was "outraged" to learn that
the FDA had misrepresented his research. Far from destroying BST, Groenewegen's
research showed that subjecting BST to pasteurization temperatures 120 times
normal only destroyed 19 percent of the BST in milk. PFC also charges that the
FDA will not release research that "proves that lab animals got cancer from BST,"
despite numerous Freedom of Information Act requests.<P>

Monsanto's claim that BST is "identical" to natural hormones is also fraudulent, PFC contends, since BST
replaces the naturally occurring amino acid lysine with epsilon-N-acetyl-lysine.
While this may not sound significant, it is known that the alteration of a single
amino acid can trigger sickle cell anemia or predispose some people to
Alzheimer's disease.<P>

While rBGH is banned in Europe and Canada, and has been
boycotted by 95 percent of US dairy farmers, the FDA, Environmental Protection
Agency and Department of Agriculture continue to license the drug (and other new
genetically engineered foods) without pre-market safety tests. Thanks to industry
pressure, genetically engineered foods are not required to carry identifying
labels.<P>

"Instead of giving us affordable, healthy, natural, clean food --
safety-tested and clearly labeled to enable consumers to exercise free choice --
the powers-that-be seem intent upon taking away our right to know what's been
done to our food," Cummings stated. "Government and corporation hacks use 'risk
assessment' and 'cost accounting' to tell us it's 'too expensive' to clean up
food-industry practices, even as the Centers for Disease Control admit that 20-80
million people a year get food poisoning."<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: France Resumes Nuclear Tests</TITLE>

<H1>France Resumes Nuclear Tests</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

Following France's detonation of a 20-kiloton nuclear bomb on September 5,
outraged citizens around the world stepped up protests against President Jacques
Chirac's decision to resume nuclear tests in the South Pacific. Facing a global
boycott of the $7 billion French wine-export industry, the French Defense
Ministry declared haughtily: "The nuclear deterrent guarantees... the ultimate
protection of our vital interests." This argument failed to sway the residents of
French Polynesia, who condemned the tests, set fire to cars and buildings in the
capital of Tahiti and demanded independence from France.<P>

Since 1988, France has conducted more than 130 underground nuclear blasts at Moruroa atoll (the exact
figure remains a state secret). The tests have left Moruroa's lagoon polluted
with as much as 20 kg (44 lbs) of plutonium and the atoll fractured to a depth of
200 meters (656 feet). One disastrous bomb test sheared off a large undersea
section of the atoll, triggering a tidal wave and causing parts of the island to
sink beneath sea level. Cesium-134 and tritium have leaked into the surrounding
ocean and plutonium-239 has been detected in plankton.<P>

Because of the accumulated damage to Moruroa, larger nuclear tests (which could reach 150 kilotons) may have
to be relocated to the nearby atoll of Fangataufa, an unpopulated island that is
now a sanctuary for seabirds.<P>

"Instead of rehabilitating and decontaminating the
nuclear test site," stated Gabriel Tetiarahi, leader of the Polynesian Indigenous
rights organization, Hiti Tau, "Mr. Chirac has decided to increase the volume of
radioactive materials stocked in the womb of Moruroa and Fangataufa. This is the
stinking heritage France has given to our children and to Maohi generations of
the future -- a heritage of pollution by radioactive materials for several
thousand years. This is simply a crime against humanity.... It is nuclear
racism."<P>

Recently, it was learned that Major General Jean-Claude Lesquer has been
made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor. Lesquer led the team of secret
agents that bombed and sank the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in New Zealand in
1985. The Warrior had been protesting French nuclear testing when it was
attacked. This act of state-sponsored terrorism claimed the life of a Greenpeace
photographer.<P>

testing to: President Jacques Chirac, Palais de L'Elysee, 55-57 rue de Faubourg

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Green-Scare Down Under</TITLE>

<H1>Green-Scare Down Under</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

Australia -- "Sabotage, eco-terrorism and monkey-wrenching are often used to
discredit environmental campaigns" reports Australia's <I>Chain Reaction</I>
magazine [Friends of the Earth Australia, PO Box 45, O'Connor, ACT, 2601
Australia; (06) 248-0289]. But as CR reporter Bob Burton discovered, the evidence
behind most incidents of "eco-terrorism" appears to point not to greens, but to
police agents.<P>

In 1991, an explosion and fire at the Coode Island chemical terminal in
Melbourne, caused A$20 million ($14.8 million) in damages. The Victoria police
subsequently informed the press that they had "conclusive" forensic proof that
the fire was caused by saboteurs using an oxy-acetylene torch to cut the plant's
pipes.<P>

Eight months later, however, it was revealed that the pipes had burst due to
metal fatigue (a conclusion that the Department of Labor and Industry had quietly
reached from the start).<P>

In January 1993, Victoria police Sergeant Terry Walsh jetted off to address
Tasmanian police and the Victorian Association of Forest Industries on the threat
of "eco-terrorism." Walsh made a point of citing the US-based environmental group
Earth First! and, soon after Walsh's briefing, a joint industry-police press
conference was called to raise the specter of "eco-terrorism." Up to that time
there had never been any instance of eco-terrorism in Tasmania. But that was soon
to change.<P>

Two days before Tasmania's 1993 federal elections, a dummy bomb was discovered on
a local railroad line. Attached to the bomb was a banner bearing the name "Earth
First!" As citizens walked to their ballot boxes, they passed news racks carrying
headlines boldly accusing environmentalists of using terror tactics. The
Tasmanian Green Party candidate for the Senate failed to win a seat by one
percent of the vote.<P>

Months later, police admitted that there was no link between the bomb and any
environmental group. The perpetrators of the hoax were never identified.<P>

In 1994, Tasmania was swept by a string of mysterious "tree spiking" hoaxes. One
tree-spiking letter, replete with "environmentalist" phrases, was released to
coincide with the publication of the Tasmanian Green's three-year study of the
impacts of the Forestry Commission's herbicide spraying programs.<P>

Later that year, six-inch-long galvanized nails appeared in the trees of southern
forests on the very morning government minister Ian McLachlan arrived for a
visit. Soon, these nails were showing up in logs arriving at timber mills.<P>

In October, 1994, Sgt. Walsh was back before the microphones, this time in
Canberra at a Parliament House press conference. "The acts of individuals engaged
in eco-tage is [<I>sic</I>] no less than those of an environmental terrorist,"
Walsh raged. "What they are doing is against the law and the acts could
eventually result in serious injury or loss of life."<P>

The press, recalling the embarrassing reversals on the Coode Island fire and the
"Earth First!" railroad bomb, challenged Sgt. Walsh to cite a single instance in
which environmentalists had engaged in a violent act. Walsh declined to
answer.<P>

"It is widely known in police circles that there have been many violent attacks
on environmentalists," CR's Burton noted, but Sergeant Walsh chose to ignore this
fact. "Indeed, the only people charged and convicted of violence in the forest
debate in the last decade have been from the forest industry," Burton stated.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Greenpeace Halts UK Nukes; British Police Raid Greenpeace</TITLE>

<H1>Greenpeace Halts UK Nukes; British Police Raid Greenpeace</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

United Kingdom -- On April 17, while discussions opened in New York on extending
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), nearly 300 Greenpeace (GP) activists
staged pre-dawn invasions at two major nuclear facilities in the UK.<P>

At Sellafield, 20 anti-nuclear campaigners blocked the main road leading to the
British Nuclear Fuels Laboratory and 250 activists entered the plant to try and
halt plutonium production at the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing facility. Meanwhile,
a Greenpeace ship hovered near a discharge pipe that GP claimed was spilling
radioactive waste into the Irish Sea.<P>

Meanwhile, at the Aldermaston nuclear
weapons factory 40 miles southwest of London, three protesters attempted to
parachute into the top-secret site. The chutists missed their target, but a team
of 15 activists on the ground managed to infiltrate the plant and shut down the
facility's main discharge pipe, which GP claimed was pouring radioactive waste
into the River Thames.<P>

The UK Ministry of Defense (MoD) gruffly informed the
press that Greenpeace had not penetrated security at Aldermaston, had not sealed
any pipes and had not impeded weapons production. When a television crew produced
footage contradicting the MoD and showing that the pipe had indeed been blocked,
the government seized the videotapes.<P>

To the chagrin of security officials, news reports soon appeared with photos showing how GP had not only closed
Aldermaston's 12-mile-long pipe, but poured six tons of quick-hardening concrete
down an access hole to finish the job.<P>

As GP nuclear campaigner Janet Convery
told the press, the officials entrusted with the security of "the most sensitive
military installations in the UK" had been "outwitted by a handful of dedicated
Greenpeace volunteers."<P>

"Instead of getting rid of nuclear weapons, Aldermaston
is increasing production of warheads for the new Trident submarines," Greenpeace
charged.<P>

GP predicted that blocking the pipe would halt weapons work for two
days. In fact, production was interrupted for almost two weeks.<P>

The MoD waited until the close of the NPT negotiations before striking back. On May 17, 50 MoD
police descended on GP's London headquarters [Canonbury Villas, London, N1 2PN,
UK; (0171) 354-5100] to search for evidence of a "conspiracy to cause criminal
damage." Five GP activists were charged with causing #15,000 ($23,550) of damage
at Aldermaston, an offense that carries a ten-year maximum prison sentence. But
there was another reason for the MoD's wrath.<P>

BBC Wildlife revealed that the
"heavy-handed raid, which included a massive confiscation of Greenpeace's files
and computer disks"  was  "a direct result of [GP's] success at exposing the
illegal  ties between the US and UK nuclear programs."<P>

The same day that NPT negotiations opened in New York, GP released a report accusing the US of
"breaking the spirit of the [NPT]" by storing approximately 520 nuclear weapons
(mostly 175-kiloton B-61 tactical bombs) at 15 bases in Italy, Germany, Belgium,
Greece, Turkey, the Netherlands and the UK. GP also revealed how a little-known
"executive agreement" -- the 1958 US/UK Mutual Defense Agreement (which is set to
run until December 31, 2004) -- violates the NPT by allowing the US to provide
nuclear technology, materials and components to the UK.<P>

"Although [the agreement] has served as the cornerstone of US/UK nuclear cooperation and British nuclear
weapons development for over 30 years," GP charged, "as an 'executive agreement'
it has avoided scrutiny by the US Congress... [and the British] Parliament...."<P>

The Mutual Defense Agreement sanctions the transfer (by sale, loan or barter) of
such items as: up to 500 kg (1100 lbs.) of uranium; 100 kgs (220 lbs.) of
thorium; beryllium, boron and high explosives; nuclear weapons switches and
relays; and "nuclear weapons test debris samples." The report concluded that,
"the UK's nuclear weapons arsenal and its delivery systems... [were] highly or
entirely dependent on US assistance."<P>

The issues raised by the GP report were
subsequently broached at the NPT meeting. Much to the discomfort of the US and
UK, a conference committee concluded that "such acts run counter to the spirit
and letter of the Treaty, in particular Articles I and II, and give rise to
proliferation of nuclear weapons...."<P>

The GP report also unmasked the corporate
beneficiaries of nuclear proliferation. There are two other "nuclear cooperation"
agreements, GP discovered -- the Polaris and Trident sales agreements. "Both
these agreements allow for the UK to purchase missiles and equipment on the same
or more favorable terms as the US government and thus provide significant
advantages to the UK."<P>

Under these agreements, the MoD was able to deposit
billions of British pounds into the corporate bank accounts of two major US
nuclear weapons makers, General Dynamics' Electric Boat division and Lockheed
(now the newly merged $28 billion Lockheed-Marten Corp.).<P>

<I>BBC Wildlife</I> noted that the seizure of GP files, membership lists, financial records and campaign
strategies "has sinister implications... for the whole environmental movement."
Given the nature of past UK/US cooperation, the magazine observed, there is
nothing to stop the MoD from sharing this information "by way of a favor, [with]
any other government interested in suppressing environmental protest."

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Atomic Audit Tallies the Toll</TITLE>

<H1><I>Atomic Audit</I> Tallies the Toll</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

The US nuclear weapons program has been more costly than Washington has ever
admitted, consuming "between one quarter and one third of all defense spending
since WW II," according to the US Nuclear Weapons Cost Study Project [NWCSP, 1775
Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036; (202) 797-6030]. The full report
will be available in book form in early 1996.<P>

In <I>Atomic Audit: What the US Nuclear Arsenal Really Cost</I>, a preliminary study released on July 11, NWCSP
tagged the cost of the weapons program at "nearly $4 trillion, not including an
additional $500 billion to $1 trillion for numerous essential, but
often-overlooked, programs." (Not surprisingly, NWCSP found Defense and Energy
Department officials were "reluctant to retrieve, declassify and release relevant
historical budgetary information....")<P>

Even though the US has reduced its number
of nuclear weapons from 21,000 to 14,000 over the past five years, NWCSP found
that the nation still spends "at least $33 billion a year on nuclear weapons" and
related activities -- about 13 percent of all military spending. Disassembling
weapons and cleaning up nuclear pollution cost $8 billion a year.<P>

In September
1994, the Pentagon's <I>Nuclear Posture Review</I> claimed that nuclear weapons spending
had dropped from about $53 billion in 1964 to some $12 billion in 1994. NWCSP
charges that these figures are misleading since "they do not include the billions
of dollars spent annually... to develop, test, produce, maintain and eventually
dismantle every bomb in the stockpile." Pentagon figures also omit the cost of
the Navy's nuclear-powered ships and submarines, and exclude most of the global
nuclear infrastructure needed "to support and control the arsenal."<P>

<I>Atomic Audit</I> also uncovered a host of poorly conceived dead-end projects that were begun and
abandoned. These ranged from plans for nuclear-powered airplanes and rockets to
such ill-fated programs as the MX missile, the Strategic Defense Initiative and
the Navajo cruise missile. While these "budgetary bombs" never delivered a
finished product, they did funnel more than $75 billion worth of taxpayers'
dollars into the hands of a powerful clique of defense contractors.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: "Why We Need Nuclear Weapons"</TITLE>

<H2>The US' Secret World Court Plea</H2>

<H1>"Why We Need Nuclear Weapons"</H1>

 <H2>by David Orr</H2>
 
Fifty years after the bombing of Hiroshima, the "nuclear option" is alive and
well in the Oval Office. President Clinton set the tone in July 1993, by
threatening North Korea with atomic attack. In 1995, Clinton refused to apologize
for America's use of nuclear weapons against civilian populations in Japan and
proceeded to approve a Nuclear Policy Review that calls for expansion of the
nation's nuclear arsenal.<P>

Even the president's call for the unconditional
extension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is not what it seems.
According to <I>Peacework</I> magazine [American Friends Service Committee, 2161
Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02140; (617) 661-6130] extending the NPT only
serves to "preserve the terrorizing monopoly of the present nuclear weapons
states."<P>

Earlier this year, <I>Peacework</I> obtained a leaked copy of the Clinton
administration's June 1994 submission to the United Nations' International Court
of Justice in The Hague (aka the "World Court"). The  court is considering a
complaint by the World Health Organization (a UN agency) that contends that the
possession of nuclear weapons of mass destruction threatens human life and
thereby constitutes a violation of international law.<P>

In its May issue, <I>Peacework</I>
quoted extensively from the leaked document. Let's listen in as the government's
best legal minds make the case for preserving America's nuclear arsenal.<P>

"There is no general prohibition in conventional or customary international law on the
use of nuclear weapons..." the government's lawyers insisted. "[N]othing in the
body of international humanitarian law of armed conflict indicates that nuclear
weapons are prohibited per se...." [<I>The "Not specifically stated" argument --
ed.</I>]<P>

"It is well known that the permanent members of the Security Council (and
perhaps other states) possess nuclear weapons and have developed and deployed
their systems for their use in armed conflict. These states would not have borne
the expense and effort of acquiring and maintaining these weapons and delivery
systems if they believed that the use of nuclear weapons was generally
prohibited." [<I>The "We had no idea" defense backed by the "We're heavily invested"
corollary.</I>]<P>

"[T]he possible use of these weapons is an important factor in the
structure of [the nuclear states'] military establishments, the development of
their military doctrines and strategy, and their efforts to prevent aggression
and provide an essential element of the exercise of their right of
self-defense...." [<I>The "Generals know best" rationale.</I>]<P>

"Subject to the right of
reprisal... it is unlawful to make civilians or civilian objects the object of
attack as such. This rule would not be violated by the use of nuclear weapons to
attack targets that constitute legitimate military objectives." [<I>The "If a
nuclear weapon kills a civilian, we'll just call it 'reprisal' " ploy.</I>]<P>

"With respect to the use of nuclear weapons, customary law could not be created over
the objections of the nuclear-weapons states, which are the states whose
interests are most specially affected...." [<I>The "Don't tell us what to do; we
have the Bomb" stratagem.</I>]<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Ozone Loss Reported Worse Than Ever</TITLE>

<H1>Ozone Loss Reported Worse Than Ever</H1>

In August, <I>The New York Times</I> reported that ozone loss over Antarctica "has reached about the most
severe levels possible." Meteorologist Jonathan Shanklin told the <I>Times</I> that, despite praise for the
Montreal Protocol (the global treaty designed to reduce emissions of ozone-destroying gases),
"we've not seen any slowdown at all. If anything, there's an acceleration of the depletion."<P>

Shanklin, one of three British Antarctic Survey scientists who reported discovery of the ozone hole in 1985,
noted that the Antarctic's ozone depletion, which initially ran from August through October, now
extends from August through February of the next year. Even if ozone-destroying chemical
pollution peaks in the late 1990s, Shanklin warned, "it still will be perhaps 50 years before the
ozone hole disappears."<P>

On a typical summer day (July 23), the EPA's index of ultraviolet-B
radiation revealed that only one of 60 US cities monitored (Anchorage) registered "low" UV-B
exposure (UV-B causes skin cancer, cataracts and immune-system disorders).<P>

Forty-eight cities were exposed to "high" levels of exposure to UV-B. Of these, 11 cities (Albuquerque, Charleston,
Dallas,  Honolulu, Jackson, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Mobile, New Orleans and Phoenix) were
sizzling under "very high" levels.<P>

Unlike Australia and Canada, the EPA's UV Index officially lists only "estimates" for each coming day's UV levels. The EPA does subsequently record the actual
readings at its monitoring sites but, according to Ozone Action's John Passacantando, "They don't
make [those figures] public." <P>

Given the continuing severity of ozone depletion, the budget for the
EPA's UV Index should be increased to improve the quality and number of monitoring stations, as
well as to assure that the information is made widely available to the public in a timely fashion.
With newspaper, television and radio announcements of daily UV-B levels, Canada provides an
excellent model.<P>

Unfortunately, it is likely that the EPA's short-changed, short-lived and
under-publicized UV-B Index will soon be nothing but a memory, because the program is not
expected to survive the <A HREF="greengop.html">GOP</A>'s budgetary clearcutting. Even if the index escapes a direct assault by
the Republican's Contract On America, the budget axes whacking away at the EPA and National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will likely extinguish any hopes that such a low-profile
public service will survive into the next fiscal year.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Earth Islanders Spark McDonald's Protest in China</TITLE>

<H1>Earth Islanders Spark McDonald's Protest in China</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>


The last person EII Beijing delegates Emily Miggins and Sara Chamberlain expected to meet in China
was Ronald McDonald. To their horror, they found a McDonald's franchise selling burgers and fries
at the NGO conference site. (McDonald's has 33 shops in Beijing and plans to open two more.)<P>

Acting spontaneously, Emily and Sara painted protest signs and went into action. To the dismay of
Chinese security guards, the world press heard the ruckus and came running.  As cameras whirred 
and pencils scratched, the two-woman demonstration turned into an international event.<P>

A group of Indian women joined the protest, complaining that fast-food chains had seized India's
potato market, robbing their families of a basic food item. Women from Africa condemned the rise
of imported fast foods and called for support for traditional meals.<P>

The women ripped a Ronald McDonald statue from a bench and, led by EII Advisory Board member
Vandana Shiva, carried it off on their shoulders and dumped it in a sewage pond.<P>

The incident was reported around the world. While numerous reporters from the US witnessed the
event, the "anti-Mac" demo went virtually unreported in the US media.

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Dolphins and MMPA Under Attack by GOP Bill</TITLE>

<H1>Dolphins and MMPA Under Attack by GOP Bill</H1>

<H2>by Nathan LaBudde</H2>

<I>See also: <A HREF="greengop.html">A Call for a Green GOP</A> by Gordon E. Gurnil<P></I>

Before the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) was reauthorized in 1992, more than 100 US
and foreign fishing fleets roamed the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) in search of yellowfin tuna.
Exploiting the peculiar tendency of large schools of yellowfin to swim beneath schools of dolphins,
the tuna industry began setting nets around dolphins as a means of catching tuna.<P>

By the 1970s, this brutal technology had become the dominant fishing method in the ETP. When a tunaboat crew spotted
a dolphin school, it dispatched chase boats to traumatize and corral the dolphins, often using small
explosives to slow down the fleeing school. Helicopters often coordinated the entire process from
overhead via two-way radio. In the time it took to exhaust the frightened, sensory-shocked
dolphins, the mothership had already begun encircling them with huge purse-shaped nets. Scores of
battered dolphins routinely died in a chaos of tuna, tangled nets and blood. Those that escaped were
often injured and vulnerable to shark predation.<P>

<H3>Hidden Slaughter Exposed</H3>

For years, the slaughter of dolphins in tuna nets went unnoticed. Then, in 1988, Earth Island's
International Marine Mammal Project (IMMP) dropped a media bombshell: the first undercover
video footage of a deadly tuna "set." This video allowed millions to witness helpless dolphins trapped
in nets, suffocating or crushed in net winches. The soundtrack was a chorus of loud clicks and
whistles produced by nature's most social mammals as they were slowly and painfully put to death
en masse. <P>

The public was outraged. Consumers boycotted tuna, schoolchildren wrote letters to
elected officials and corporate executives, and the environmental community united to demand
legislative action. The force of public opinion and environmental activism finally prompted
corporate action. The world's largest tuna companies stopped selling tuna caught by setting nets on
dolphins. <P>

Under the provisions of the MMPA, dolphin-deadly fishing practices used by US boats
were to be phased out and dolphin-unsafe tuna was banned from sale in the US. It was one of the
greatest environmental victories of the decade. IMMP went on to create an international monitoring
program to ensure strict dolphin-safe fishing standards in foreign canneries producing tuna for the
US market. Domestic tuna companies supported this program and committed to implementing
dolphin-safe standards. By 1994, dolphin mortality worldwide had dropped more than 96 percent,
from a 1986 high of 130,000 to approximately 4000.<P>

<H3>Return to the Dark Ages</H3>

Just when it appeared that the tuna/dolphin issue was finally being resolved, a new threat surfaced.
In August, 1995, a group of four House Republicans introduced HR2179, a bill that would amend
the MMPA and repeal laws currently protecting dolphins from needless slaughter. <P>

Authored by Representative Randy "Duke" Cunningham (R-CA), the bill calls for the lifting of all tuna import
embargos against Mexico, Venezuela and other countries that have not complied with the
dolphin-protection standards of the MMPA. Once again, tuna caught using techniques resulting in
dolphin deaths could be sold in the US. HR2179 would also repeal the MMPA provision requiring
proper labeling of dolphin-safe tuna and would allow US fishing fleets to again catch tuna by
encircling schools of dolphins.<P>

IMMP Director David Phillips said, "This bill ought to be named the Dolphin Extermination and Consumer Fraud Act. It is an outrageous plan to gut the Marine Mammal
Protection Act and sacrifice thousands of dolphins. Under his bill, even tuna caught by killing
thousands of dolphins could be labeled as 'dolphin-safe.' In our view, this is consumer fraud and a
tragic death sentence for dolphins."<P>

Rep. Cunningham claims that dolphin-safe tuna fishing methods cost American jobs and that the current law is "too stringent." However, he has not produced any
evidence to demonstrate how a return to killing dolphins will generate new US jobs.<P>

Congressman Gerry Studds (D-MA), who co-authored the 1990 dolphin-safe labeling law, observed that
Cunningham's bill would allow cheap tuna from Mexico, Venezuela and other countries to flood the
American market. "The point of this proposal isn't to protect dolphins or to help US fishermen, as
its proponents claim," said Studds. "Dolphins are already protected under US law, and American
fishermen are fishing safely and profitably under an arrangement with the island nations of the
Western Pacific."<P>

<H3>A Call to Action</H3>

Starkist, Chicken of the Sea and Bumble Bee, the world's three largest tuna companies, have all
affirmed their commitments to market only dolphin-safe tuna. But, they also recognize the dire
economic consequences if foreign producers are allowed to "dump" cheap, dolphin-unsafe tuna onto
the US market.<P>

Since the dolphin-safe laws have been enacted, the tuna industry has shown it can catch ample supplies of tuna without killing dolphins. Most of the US fleet that once fished
dolphin-unsafe in the ETP now fishes dolphin-safe, primarily for skipjack, in the Western
Tropical Pacific. These fleets enjoy some of the highest catches anywhere in the world.<P>

Representative George Miller (D-CA) criticized the Cunningham bill as an environmental sellout to
free-trade interests. "This is exactly what we warned about when we fought NAFTA and GATT, and
this is exactly what we were told would not happen. We warned that American environmental laws
would be subject to challenge by foreign governments that don't want to meet standards set by the
American government and supported by American industry and the American people," he observed.<P>

"This bill continues a string of offenses. First, we were asked to jeopardize American workers by
passing trade bills to benefit Mexico. Then we were asked to put at risk billions of US dollars to
bolster the peso. Now we are being told by the Republicans in Congress that we should sanction the
slaughter of tens of thousands of dolphins and undo a mammal protection program that has worked
efficiently and that is supported by American industry," said Miller.<P>

Despite widespread popular support for strong laws to protect dolphins, House Republicans are proceeding with consideration of
the bill. Earth Island urges its members and supporters to oppose HR2179, whose co-sponsors
include Rep. Brian Bitbray (R-CA), Duncan Hunter (R-CA) and Ron Packard (R-CA).<P>

<HR>

<H2>What You Can Do:</H2>

Write, phone, fax and/or e-mail your representatives and senators, urging
them to oppose HR2179. Tell them to resist any increase in the level of dolphin mortality and to
maintain the prohibition on the sale of dolphin-unsafe tuna. House of Representatives:
202-224-3121.

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Direct Action Halts Shark-Shoot</TITLE>

<H1>Direct Action Halts Shark-Shoot</H1>

<H2>by Nathan LaBudde</H2>

Fifty years ago, when the Elkhorn Slough oyster fishery off Moss Landing, California, was facing
collapse due to the commercial overharvesting of oysters, local fishers created a contest to rid the
waters of oyster-eating sharks and rays. Once the sharks and rays were eradicated, they reasoned,
the vanishing shellfish populations would rebound and even higher levels of oyster-harvesting
would result.<P>

The first shark and ray hunt took place in the spring of 1946 and the public responded enthusiastically to the invitation to help "liberate" the fishery. Hundreds of harmless
leopard sharks and bat rays were killed by citizens armed with pitchforks, shotguns and dynamite.
Although the shark and ray populations were greatly reduced in the aftermath of the hunts, the
oyster fishery nonetheless collapsed shortly afterward.<P>

Local anglers, however, were left with an indelible taste for killing. Each spring they returned to the hunt, taking advantage of the sharks' and
rays' seasonal preoccupation with mating and birthing. Over the decades, two distinct sporting
groups have emerged. One group of local anglers holds an annual "rod-and-reel" event in which
captured sharks are tagged and released. The other group, the "Archers," are primarily interested
in killing sharks with hunting arrows and crossbows. The annual Archer event has attracted more
than 100 participants.<P>

In 1991, the Pelagic Shark Research Foundation [PSRF, 333 Lake Ave., Ste. H, Maritime Center, Santa Cruz, CA 95062], led by Sean Van Sommeran, suggested that the hunt be
reconsidered in light of marine biologists' new understanding of the vital roll that sharks play in
the ocean ecosystem. The Archers, however, did not agree to a review.<P>

In 1993, PSRF disrupted the shark "derby," an action that forced the Archers to negotiate. PSRF won a number of concessions,
including agreements that: no more than one shark could be taken per archer (the state's legal limit
is three), no more than 30 archers could participate, all sharks killed were to be eaten and all
future Archer's derbies were to be monitored by PSRF. In addition, the event's timing was pushed
back, from early July to early August, to avoid the main portion of the sharks' breeding cycle.<P>

In 1994, however, the agreement was violated when some Archers made it a point to torture and
brutalize their catches in front of PSRF observers.<P>

This year, Van Sommeran organized a coalition of groups in support of permanently halting the event. A total of 50 representatives from Earth
Island Institute, Surfers Environmental Alliance, Earth First!, Sea Defense Alliance (SEDNA), Sea
Shepherd, Greenpeace and others, staged a protest at the Archers' 1995 derby. The event was
delayed for hours with a "lockdown" of the boat launching area after three protesters (Lynnelle
Wing and Jennifer Kortright of Earth First! and Jonathon Poaul of SDA) chained themselves to boats
and boat trailers using  Kryptonite locks. The rest of the action consisted of thwarting would-be
hunters and archers throughout the day with a small armada of kayaks, skiffs and inflatables.
Heckling by protesters was answered by archers who spat coffee, swore and made threats of bodily
harm. By day's end, only four sharks had been killed. Earth First!'s Kortright was arrested and
charged with disturbing the peace, but the charge was later dropped.<P>

In the aftermath of the 1995 derby, the Moss Landing Harbor District has announced that it will not issue an event permit for
1996 and the derby's longtime sponsors -- Centro Valley Archers and the California Bowman
Hunter's Association -- have permanently withdrawn their support. While individual archers will
continue to spear sharks in the Elkhorn slough, the end of the destructive event will help restore
shark populations and the ecological balance of the shark fishery.

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Democratizing Transportation</TITLE>

<H1>Democratizing Transportation</H1>

<H2>by Cameron Yee</H2>

The costs and benefits of our country's transportation system are not always equally shared.
Different people are affected differently by the way we implement transportation policy.<P>

"Equity analysis" is a planning technique that looks at the distribution of the cost-and-benefit effects of
transportation on different socio-economic groups. Typical divisions include income, neighborhood
and ethnicity. But how do these studies assess the effects of public policy on low-income groups and
people of color?<P>

National, regional and local transportation policies usually focus on reducing automobile use or increasing the efficiency of traffic-clogged freeways. Congestion on freeways
typically occurs during peak-travel periods, but these periods do not include many low-income
people. Because congestion is usually defined in terms of level of service (e.g., the average traffic
speed or the degree of vehicle delay), this leads to analyses that are narrow in scope, since they
focus on the equity impacts affecting the mobility of cars and not the mobility of the region's people.<P>

One common method of defining costs in equity analyses is by valuing people's time. The cost of
congestion to a person is thus measured in terms of time lost due to traffic delays. The dollar
amount of this lost time can be measured in terms of a person's wages or income. As a result,
poorer people's time is undervalued because their wages are lower and they tend to travel less in
private cars. Using this analysis, the value of busses and other forms of mass transit also tends to
be undervalued.<P>

As the realization grows that building more roads to accommodate single-passenger vehicles does not solve congestion problems, market-based transportation policies such as
"congestion-pricing" are being considered. Congestion-pricing essentially charges a fee to drivers
who use roads during the most congested periods. Congestion-pricing promises to make freeways
less congested by penalizing drivers who use the freeways at the most-congested time. Like most
other policies, this type of program focuses on improving freeway access for auto users.<P>

In November 1992, the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) solicited proposals to fund up to five
congestion-pricing pilot programs across the US. The FHA accepted only one plan, the Bay Bridge
Congestion Pricing Demonstration Program (BBCPDP), developed by the San Francisco Bay Area's
Metropolitan Transportation Commission. The BBCPDP proposes to raise the toll of the
Oakland-to-San Francisco Bay Bridge from $1 to $3 during the 6-to-9 am and 3-to-6 pm
commutes, when congestion is worst.<P>

In the process of developing this pricing scheme, the BBCPDP team acknowledged that there were concerns regarding the "equity" impacts of the increased toll on
low-income drivers. It addressed the problem in two ways:<P>

<UL>

<LI>Revenues from the project will be used to expand affordable alternatives to driving in the Bay Bridge corridor; and<P>

<LI>A "lifeline" toll rate of $1 will be offered to low-income drivers who can prove that their household income is at or
below 150 percent of the federal poverty level.<P>

</UL>

 While the program designers put a great deal of effort into trying to address the impacts of transit policy on low-income drivers, many questions
remain before congestion-pricing and other market-based programs can be fairly implemented:<P>

<UL>

<LI>How will the revenues be used? While the proposed use of BBCPDP revenues is to mostly improve
mass transit alternatives in the Bay Bridge corridor, there is no guarantee that the revenues will
actually be used in this manner. Such revenues must be used to improve the overall mobility
alternatives for the entire transportation system, not just for automobile users.<P>

<LI>What potential spillover effects could congestion pricing have on other freeways and corridors? Harmful health
and air-quality impacts could be transferred to other freeways and interchanges. Also likely to be
affected by changing land-use patterns are the Bay Area's "flatland" communities, where many
people of color and low-income residents live.<P>

<LI>Will congestion pricing encourage or discourage sprawl? Will the transportation and land-use link be better addressed? Higher-income drivers
may find that improved travel time will allow them to live in neighborhoods further from their
place of employment. Urban areas could become more impoverished while new suburbs chew up
more farmland and open space.<P>

</UL>

While addressing these issues is a difficult task, it is an important one in terms of building a socially just transportation system that provides equal mobility
alternatives for all people. It is imperative that the goals of the transportation system should be
appropriately defined before any analysis takes place. Policymakers must realize whose lives and
health are at risk before making decisions that can affect human and community health.<P>

Earth Island's Urban Habitat Program is currently developing a framework and methodology to address
the impacts of market-based transportation-control measures and transportation policies.

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 95: Mapping the Pathways to Survival</TITLE>

<H1>Mapping the Pathways to Survival</H1>

<H2>by Joe Lamb and Martha Belcher</H2>

In August, nine members of Earth Island's Borneo Project (BBP) returned from a
two-week visit to the village of Uma Bawang Keluan, a longhouse community of Kayan Indigenous
people in the rainforest of Borneo that has been at the forefront of Indonesia's Indigenous rights and
rainforest preservation movement for almost a decade.<P>

In 1987 a logging company illegally bulldozed a road through the village's orchard and so angered a majority of the people that they
blockaded the logging road and formed the Uma Bawang Residents' Association (UBRA) to oppose the
logging. When more than 40 of the villagers were arrested in logging blockades, their actions
caught the attention of a small group of environmental activists in Berkeley, California. In 1991
UBRA and the city of Berkeley joined together as "Sister Communities" to foster cultural and
educational exchanges and to lend each other support in their common quest for an ecologically
sustainable future.<P>

The BBP had four reasons for its most recent trip to Uma Bawang: to honor Berkeley's sister community for its vision and courage; to chronicle UBRA's ongoing efforts to
return control of the rainforest to its Indigenous inhabitants; to assess the potential for
micro-hydro and/or solar electrification of the village; and to teach the Indigenous peoples of
Borneo's Sarawak state how to map their ancestral lands. <P>

In the past 20 years, enormous tracts of the Sarawak rainforest have been severely damaged by overlogging. Now the native people face the
very real threat that their land will be converted into oil-palm plantations. Mapping skills may
prove critical to Indigenous peoples as they struggle to regain control of their lands. The Sarawak
Constitution recognizes Indigenous land claims according to traditional means of marking territory,
including the location of ancestral orchards, ancient swidden fields and graves of ancestors. Maps
made by native peoples may soon appear in court as Indigenous peoples attempt to document their
territorial rights and sue for damages done to their forests and farms.<P>

Mapping may also help to prevent environmental damage. Community maps may be able to stop the logging of forests that have
been customarily set aside as habitat preserves for game and community nurseries for rattan and
other essential plants. Maps can also mark places of value to the community and thereby preserve
the knowledge of their significance. Knowledge of the land is an essential part of any Indigenous
culture -- when that knowledge dies, part of culture dies with it.<P>

Leading the mapping workshop were BBP's Judith Mayer, Daniel Scollon, and Mark Talley, with support from Anushka Drescher,
Richard Hayman, Didi Sugandi, Martha Belcher and John Paisley. A majority of the people from
Uma Bawang, from very young to very old, attended the workshop. They were joined by two
representatives from Friends of the Earth-Malaysia, and by delegates from three other
communities.<P>

Judith, Dan and Mark introduced the basics of mapping by having small groups sketch from memory a rough map of their community. For these "sketch maps," scale and exact locations
were not considered important. The purpose was for the mappers to record features of their
community and in so doing to discover what parts of the material world are important to them. The
participants all threw themselves into the task with enthusiasm, cooperation and good humor.<P>

An elderly man, one of the chief warriors of the village, drew a picture of a wild boar to indicate where
hunting is the best; a young boy drew the soccer field; a woman put down choice places to collect
fern shoots. The participants worked on the sketch maps late into the night, carefully drawing fruit
trees and arguing about the exact locations of trails and rivers. The final sketch maps bulged with
information and were impressive in their creativity and artistry.<P>

When the workshop turned to the more challenging technical phase, participants remained interested and engaged as they learned how
to survey their land using a compass and tape measure. They were also shown how to use two Global
Positioning Systems (GPS) to measure precise locations on the Earth's surface by bouncing radio
signals off Department of Defense satellites. The GPS units (which cost $3800) were donated by the
Magellan Systems Corporation [960 Overlook Court, San Dimas, CA 91733; (909) 344-5000;
fax: (909) 344-7050].<P>

Leaving the longhouse to put theory to practice, workshop participants and BBP members scrambled through dramatically beautiful and very rugged rainforest terrain to
survey UBRA's project boundaries. They complete a survey of the village's agroforestry project, an
area that has been set aside for growing fruit trees, rattan and meranti, a tree that is currently
endangered by the blades of Borneo's timber companies. They also surveyed the communal forest
preserve, an area to be maintained as "tended wilderness" -- i.e., a community-owned forest for
hunting and gathering.<P>

For the final phase of the workshop, the participants took the data they had collected and drafted a scaled map. In an open-air pavilion, women tattooed from wrist to elbow
chewed betel nut while plotting the GPS coordinates they had gathered the previous day.
Neon-colored butterflies the size of bats flitted through the pavilion. Children tossed inflated globes
back and forth while their parents checked and cross-checked the data. The air was sometimes thick
with excitement. Loud communal "aaahhhs" escaped when sections of the map were finished and
pinned up for display. It was a magical experience.<P>

The workshop was a great success. Villagers finished their map and, after our return to Berkeley, we received word that UBRA had been invited
to teach mapping to several other nearby communities.<P>

Regardless of the outcome of future legal struggles, the mapping was significant: it honored the knowledge and aspirations of the villagers, it
united generations in common work, it reinforced links with the land and with ancestral caring for
the land.

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: McLibel Trial Revelations:  McDonalds' Appetite for Trees</TITLE>

<H1>McLibel Trial Revelations:<BR>
 McDonalds' Appetite for Trees</H1>
 
 <H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

United Kingdom (via EcoNet) -- Claiming that it had been defamed by a six-page leaflet criticizing
its operations, the McDonalds' fast-food chain brought a libel action in the UK against two London
activists, Dave Morris and Helen Steel (Winter  '94-95 EIJ). Denied their right to a jury trial at
McDonalds' request, Morris and Steel are conducting their own defense against McDonalds' team of
top libel lawyers. Some 180 British and international witnesses are set to testify. Now expected to
run until at least December, the McLibel case has become the longest libel trial in British history.
The following highlights were drawn from e-mail reports for February (weeks 20-24 of the
trial).

<H3>McAttack on Forests</H3>

Theo Hopkins, an independent researcher on the degradation and destruction of temperate and boreal
forests, testified for the defense on the damaging effects of modern industrial forestry and
McDonald's use of hundreds of thousands of tons of paper packaging in Europe and the US.<P>

 Hopkins outlined the troubled state of the forests in countries that provided the source for McDonald's
packaging -- North America, the Czech Republic, Finland, Sweden and the UK. In Britain, Hopkins
noted, more than 40 percent of the country's surviving ancient woodland had been felled since
WWII, largely replaced by conifer plantations. Hopkins testified that the scale of world paper pulp
production has "increased by five times over the last 40 years" to become the major <A HREF="../paper/woodfact.html">use of timber</A>.
To protect forests, Hopkins stated, the first priority is to reduce paper consumption, especially in
rich countries. Hopkins also told the court that <A HREF="../paper/rtp.html">alternative plant sources of paper fiber</A> (e.g., <A HREF="../paper/kenaf.html">kenaf</A>,
hemp, bagasse, cotton waste) offered better quality paper than wood pulp.<P>

 David Walker, chairman and owner of McKey Foods (a former McDonald's subsidiary that has been the sole supplier of UK
hamburgers since 1978), admitted that he had personally organized the direct import of five
consignments of Brazilian beef for McDonald's UK stores in 1983-4.<P>

 A letter from Walker written in May, 1983 and introduced in court revealed that the imports were a matter of great controversy.
In the letter, Walker recalled an occasion when Prince Philip, President of the World Wildlife
Fund, had confronted the president of McDonald's Canada and had said (quoting from Walker's
letter): "So you are the people who are tearing down the Brazilian rainforests and breeding cattle!"
Following this encounter, Fred Turner, the chairman of McDonald's Corporation, issued a
worldwide edict that no McDonald's plant was to use Brazilian beef.<P>

But, according to the Walker letter, the then-managing director of McDonald's UK gave Walker permission to continue using
Brazilian beef imports. The imports were kept secret from Prince Philip, the World Wildlife Fund,
the BBC and environmental groups. The issue only came to light when McDonald's lawyers
mistakenly included the handwritten letter in a bundle of other documents released to the McLibel
defendants last year.<P>

<H3>McDonald's Defended by Stump</H3>

Stacy Stump, the manager of a trouble-plagued McDonald's in Chelsea, UK, admitted under oath that
there had been many complaints about the store's trash and litter, but claimed that "trash walks" to
pick up litter were conducted "approximately every 30 minutes."<P>

Stump testified that his store generated "something like 10,500 potential items of litter" (bags, straws, cups and napkins)
every day. Stump admitted that the litter ended up far from the store -- in local residents'
basements, under cars and in bushes. <P>

He said the company made cleanliness a high priority. However, the defendants pointed out that the company's "observation checklists" for employees'
work habits assigns higher marks for "crew person smiles... as often as possible" than for
neighborhood litter patrols. <P>

In response, McDonald's called Professor Graham Ashworth, Director-General of the Tidy Britain Group (TBG), to the stand. Lawyers for the McLibel Two,
however, got Ashworth to admit that TBG was sponsored by McDonald's to the tune of #200,000
($316,000) per annum and also accepted corporate funding from Coca-Cola, whose cans, Ashworth
agreed, appeared to be "the most numerous on the streets of Britain." Ashworth was also forced to
admit that TBG accepted funding from <A HREF="ogoni.html">Shell Oil</A>, which has been repeatedly convicted and fined for
pollution incidents.<P>

 Ashworth conceded that McDonald's was in the "top one or two percent" of all companies whose products end up as litter and acknowledged that packaging, including polystyrene,
"has been mistaken as food and swallowed by animals," causing the wildlife to starve to death, while
other litter ended up being blown into rivers and the sea.<P>

<H2>Polluted Burgers To-Go</H2>

During the McLibel trial, meat supplier David Walker explained how all raw beef supplies were
microbiologically tested and labeled "satisfactory," "passable" and "unsatisfactory."
("Unsatisfactory" describes meat with a total colony of more than 10 million bacteria per gram).
Walker then admitted that consignments designated as " unsatisfactory" were, in fact, not rejected
and were used for McDonald's hamburgers.<P>

John Atherton, McDonald's Head of Training, admitted that McDonald's receives between 1500-2750 customer complaints of food poisoning a year.
McDonald's also receives an estimated 800 reports of "foreign bodies" in burgers, mostly bits of
plastic. -- EcoNet

<H2>Worldwide Anti-Mac Day</H2>

On April 15, activists marked the 40th anniversary of McDonald's with hundreds of demonstrations
at McDonald's outlets in New Zealand, Spain, Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland, Ireland, Poland,
Denmark, Australia, <A HREF="../immp/immp3.html">Norway</A>, The Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Croatia, the Czech Republic, UK
and US. In Chicago, Helen Steel and David Morris (the "McLibel Two") held a press conference at the
site of the first McDonald's restaurant. Morris and Steel smashed a birthday cake to protest "40
years of junk food, junk jobs, and discarded mountains of just plain junk." In the UK, McDonald's
customers  received a shock when 200 bicyclists participating in a "Critical Mass" pro-bike
demonstration staged a "bike through"  at the restaurant.              -- EcoNet

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Golf Endangers Hawai'ian Ecology and Culture</TITLE>

<H1>Golf Endangers Hawai'ian Ecology and Culture</H1>

<H2>by Sara Chamberlain</H2>

Hawai'i -- South Kona district, on the west coast of Hawai'i Island, is an historic treasure trove,
with more than 800 traditional Hawai'ian archeological sites, including temples, stone carvings,
dwellings and burial mounds. Direct descendants of the buried dead still live in South Kona's
small-scale farming and fishing communities. The preservation of the region's rural environment
is crucial for the survival of traditional Hawai'ian culture. Protecting South Kona's coastal
environs is also critical for the <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">dolphins</A> in the national Marine Life Sanctuary at Kealakekua Bay.<P>

However, the tranquillity of South Kona is about to be irrevocably disrupted by the construction of
a resort complex and three nine-hole golf courses only three kilometers (1.86 miles) from the
marine sanctuary. In 1990, Japan Air Lines (JAL) bought 1540 acres of agricultural land in South
Kona and established a company, Oceanside 1250, to develop a resort called "The Village at
Hokukano," consisting of 1440 luxury home sites, a private members' lodge of 100 units and the
golf courses. JAL owns   75 percent of the $41 million development.<P>

 Local residents, Native Hawai'ians and environmentalists are united in their opposition to the plan. According to the
Malaysia-based Global Anti-Golf Movement (GAG'M), golf courses "destroy natural ecosystems,
contaminate the environment and threaten human health." At South Kona, more than 175 sacred  
sites and numerous <A HREF="../tibet/tibet.html">indigenous plant species still used for medicinal purposes</A> would be destroyed by
bulldozers.<P>

 "Invaluable biological diversity will be replaced with a package of imported grass, fertilizers and a wide range of chemicals, including pesticides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers,
fungicides, soil improving agents, 'understrata hardening agents,' coagulants and artificial coloring
agents," wrote Chee Yoke Ling of GAG'M in a letter to JAL's president, Matsuo Toshimitsu.<P>

According to a New York State Department of Law report, "Toxic Fairways: Risking Groundwater
Contamination from Pesticides on Long Island Golf Courses," a typical 18-hole golf course annually
uses 50,000 pounds of dry and liquid chemicals (containing approximately 1000 pounds of active
ingredients) -- about 18 pounds per treated acre (seven times the amount used by large-scale
agriculture).<P>

In South Kona, the introduction of thousands of pounds of chemicals would pose a risk to the health of local residents, while chemical runoff could threaten marine life. A recent study by
the Golf Superintendents Association of America noted an alarmingly high rate of cancer deaths
among former members and recommended that current members reduce exposure to pesticides.
Meanwhile, the US Ladies Pro Golf Association offers free mammograms to its members because of a
marked increase in breast cancer among women professional golfers.<P>

With golf courses consuming 500,000-800,000 gallons of water per day, The Village at Hokukano would intensify South Kona's
water shortage, possibly forcing local Kona coffee and macadamia-nut farmers off their lands. <P>

"This huge urban project does not belong in this small rural community," said Nancy Pisicchio, president
of Plan to Protect South Kona.<P>

 Kekuni Blaisdell, coordinator of Ka Pakaukau-Indigenous Hawai'ian Coalition, added that most jobs created by the resort complex would be menial, which would
"contribute to the further subordination of our local residents, who are determined to preserve a
rural, agricultural and subsistence fishing lifestyle in the tradition of our ancestors."<P>

 Charles Villa, vice-president of Plan to Protect South Kona, has collected 1300 signatures against the
project, representing one-quarter of South Kona's local population. Villa and a coalition of groups,
including GAG'M, have filed a lawsuit against the county of Hawai'i, alleging that JAL arranged to
have the property's zoning illegally changed to accommodate the development. Despite local and
international opposition, JAL plans to begin construction in early 1996.<P>

<HR>

<H2>If You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em</H2>

Each year, 350 new golf courses are built worldwide -- an average of nearly one new course per
day. In 1987, the New York Audubon Society (NYAS), an independent state Audubon Society, created
the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary System and the Signature Cooperative Sanctuary Program to
"encourage builders to go above and beyond government requirements" for golf construction and
management.<P>

Both programs offer environmental education, "guidance" and certification to participating projects. However, once registered, golf courses do not have to adhere to specific
environmental standards. A developer simply pays the $4500 membership fee and adopts the NYAS'
"principles for sustainable resource management" as a "guidance document." One principle declares
that "recreational opportunities should not detract from or destroy natural areas." Because they are
obviously unable to uphold this principle, the 1500-member courses probably registered for
advertising purposes.<P>

Although NYAS' attempt to educate golf course developers is praiseworthy, it does give them an opportunity for greenwashing. For instance, the Colliers Reserve course in
Florida, which has been awarded "signature status," uses chemical pesticides, herbicides and
fertilizers that contain 500 pounds of active ingredients. Native grasses and recycled plastic chairs
cannot offset the negative impacts of a golf course.<P>

The National Audubon Society has stated that it has nothing to do with  NYAS's certification programs.

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: The Genesis of GENI</TITLE>

<H2>A Plan for a Fuller Future?</H2>

<H1>The Genesis of GENI</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

USA -- On September 22, 1994, ex-Alaska Governor Walter Hickel addressed 1000 delegates at
the United Nations in New York and proposed that the solution to world peace was to stop spending
trillions of dollars on war and, instead, spend trillions of dollars on "big projects." Hickel even had
a particular big project in mind -- the Global Energy Network International. <P>

GENI [<I>PO Box 81565, San Diego, CA 92138</I>] is a nonprofit organization that advocates installing giant electrical
transmission lines across continents and through oceans. GENI claims that its mission is "For all
people to have access to ecologically sustainable energy."<P>

 "War puts people to work and gives them a purpose," Hickel told the UN delegates, "But why war? Why not big projects? After all, war is just
a big project." Hickel admitted the concept was not new: "It's as old as the pyramids and the
aqueducts of Rome."<P>

Powerlines have a major environmental impact since, on average, building each mile of a GENI-sized transmission line requires clearing nearly five acres of land. By 1992,
27,000 acres of Canadian land had been cleared to make room for one 550-mile-stretch of
GENI-linked powerline.<P>

GENI's stylish quarterly newsletter is salted with quotes from Margaret Mead and Dwight D. Eisenhower, and photos of luminaries like UN Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali. GENI also notes that the concept of an intercontinental power grid has been endorsed
by Noel Brown, the recently retired head of the UN Development Program and by Vice President Al
Gore in his book, <CITE>Earth in the Balance</CITE>.<P>

The newsletter promotes the idea that GENI is simply advancing the goals of Buckminster Fuller, the visionary engineer who first proposed linking all
continents to a global electricity grid. Fuller's portrait is featured prominently on GENI literature,
while an insert announces a July 14-16 Buckminster Fuller 100th Centennial Symposium &
Celebration in San Diego (cosponsored by GENI).<P>

GENI's proponents argue that "there is a direct tie-in between energy and poverty." At the UN population conference in Cairo last year, GENI's
backers decorated their display booth with a series of impressive charts designed to demonstrate
that increased electrical consumption reduces population growth, lowers infant mortality,
increases life expectancy, boosts literacy levels and improves water quality.<P>

<H3>GENI's Corporate Beneficiaries</H3>

But global mega-projects (even well-meaning ones) are not financed or built by visionaries. As
documents uncovered by the <CITE>Journal</CITE> disclosed in 1992, "GENI's participants include the World
Bank, Westinghouse, PG&E, Mitsubishi, General Electric and Siemens." <P>

World-energy use mirrors other prevailing North-South inequities. Sixty percent of the world population uses less than 1000
kilowatt-hours/capita/year (kwh). Approximately 20 percent of the population (in the
industrialized countries of Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East) consume
1000-2000 kwh per year.<P>

 Only 20 percent of the world population (1.1 billion people) enjoys access to more than 2000 kwh per year. <P>
 
World electric-energy use in 1990 was estimated at 12,000 terrawatt-hours (a terrawatt is 1000 gigawatts; a gigawatt is 1000 megawatts) per year.
There is an estimated 13,000 twh of <A HREF="hydroque.html">hydroelectric</A> potential in Earth's free-flowing rivers, only
about 15 percent of which has been tapped. But who really stands to benefit from electrifying the
planet?<P>

While GENI proclaims that a global grid would benefit underdeveloped countries, the globalization of electricity would also unleash a new race to control, develop and exploit Third
World resources.<P>

In August, 1994, M. Maher Abaza, Egypt's Minister of Electricity and Energy, gave the keynote speech to the International Conference on Large High-Voltage Electric Systems
(CIGRE), spelling out a plan to build an electrical grid connecting Africa and Europe. Abaza claimed
that building hydroelectric dams and long-distance transmission lines was "the aim of
environmentalists as well as hope for the peoples of developing countries."<P>

Hydropower would be cleaner than fossil-fueled power and the "revenues from export... would contribute to the sustained
development of the producing countries," he rationalized.<P>

According to Abaza, an "Egypt-Zaire Interconnection" would harness the Zaire River's powerful flow with hydroelectric dams and send
the power north to Europe to supply "clean hydroelectric energy to replace <A HREF="codsquad.html">fossil fuel-burning
power plants</A>." Successive steps would move to tap "the exploitable hydroelectric potentials in
Northern Africa," estimated at approximately 1000 twh/year. Beyond that, Abaza claimed, lie the
untamed rivers of "Africa, Latin America and Asia, where hydro potentials are available and could
be exported to the industrialized countries...."<P>

Fostering a "power pool of Mediterranean Sea countries" would be the "first step" toward "increasing imports of clean electricity from Africa."
In the meantime, CIGRE will be working to assure the "integration of power systems with and

In its determination to interconnect its campaign with Fuller's legend, GENI has produced a version of Fuller's Dymaxion(TM) Map with a Global Energy Grid stamped
prominently on top of it (available for a $15 donation). There are also videos, T-shirts, brochures
and even a GENI key ring.<P>

The most Bucky-boggling promotion of all, however, is GENI's "A Buck-a-Day for Bucky." Alongside a portrait of Fuller, GENI's literature "invites you to commit a
minimum of just one dollar a day... in support of GENI's work this year -- in honor of
Bucky."<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: A Visionary Proposal for the Desert West</TITLE>

<H1>A Visionary Proposal for the Desert West</H1>

<H2>by John Sterling</H2>

Infamous desert denizen Edward Abbey lamented in his book <CITE>Desert Solitaire</CITE> that too many people
were visiting the deserts of southern Utah where he worked as a park ranger in the 1960s.
Tourists arrived in droves, surveyed the desert from their car seats, then left. Few who visited
truly understood the desert or respected its unique beauty. This, said Abbey, was a terrible fate.
Today's deserts should be so lucky.<P>

American deserts, most of which are public lands, are victims of some of the most destructive human activities imaginable. Ranchers graze cattle on desert lands,
trampling the delicate ecosystem; mining companies extract millions-of-dollars worth of minerals
from the desert by stripmining and cyanide heap-leach mining; the federal government uses the
Nevada desert for underground nuclear bomb testing; the Air Force nearly built a bombing range in
the scenic Idaho desert; and, recreationally, the deserts of the West are a favorite playground for
off-road vehicle users.<P>

These sparsely populated and, for the most part, rarely visited lands have recently become the battleground for some of the most important environmental conflicts of the
'90s. The Wise Use movement considers the arid regions of the West to be only as valuable as the
resources they contain. This "use-it-or-lose-it" mentality has inspired conservationists to form
local desert-protection movements throughout the Western states, most notably in California,
where vigorous efforts won the 1994 passage of the California Desert Protection Act, designed to
protect eight million acres of southern California desert -- the largest wilderness area in the
continental US. But in the same year as this milestone victory, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
led losing efforts to strengthen the laws that regulate mining and grazing on federal lands, much of
which occurs in desert areas. Many desert advocates think it is time to protect the arid West not
state-by-state, but as a single, vast bioregion.<P>

In July, 1994, leading desert activists met at the Sierra Club lodge on California's Donner Summit to discuss the Great American Desert Protection
Act (GADPA), a visionary proposal, still in its infancy, to unite the many state desert wildlands
proposals under a comprehensive, national legislative act. GADPA would create a 30-40
million-acre desert wilderness out of non-wilderness Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in
the arid regions of Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, California, Utah, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona,
Colorado, Washington and Wyoming. "It's going to take a long, long time and lots of work, but we
take it very seriously," said Marge Sill, a Sierra Club activist in Nevada.<P>

GADPA is the brainchild of Bill Marlett, director of the Oregon Natural Desert Association, who dreams of a unified Western
desert coalition. Marlett has been fighting for several years to protect Oregon's deserts from
grazing, but has been foiled by what he calls "parochial state politics." Marlett thinks that GADPA
would benefit from a national debate. "Western senators are still in the back pockets of the
cowboys," said Marlett. "But if we elevate the debate to the national level, I think we have a better
chance. These are national-interest lands and their fate deserves a national discussion."<P>

<H3>Gazing Rights vs. Grazing Rites</H3>

The Federal Land Policy Act of 1976 mandated that the BLM inventory its lands to determine which
should be protected as wilderness areas. As a result of this inventory, the agency recommended that
roughly eight million acres of desert be converted to wilderness status, guarding it from oil, gas
and mining development. GADPA supporters have taken the BLM recommendations and added
millions of additional acres to comprise their proposed wilderness.<P>

"The BLM recommendations would protect the cream of the crop of the bureau's desert lands," said Marlett, noting that GADPA
would safeguard five times more land than the BLM. "GADPA would achieve a more holistic,
ecological approach to wilderness. It aims to protect biodiversity, not just scenery."<P>

Before mounting an aggressive national campaign, GADPA advocates must first agree on the level of land
protection they hope to attain, a contentious issue that comes down to a single factor -- cattle.
Ranching is the only industry the BLM permits in its wilderness areas, but ironically, grazing has
caused far more damage to desert lands than any other activity.<P>

Whether to allow grazing on public lands represents a struggle between principles and politics for GADPA supporters. "Most people
believe that cows and public lands are anathema, but the political returns for taking on the cowboys
are so small that most environmental groups don't do it," said GADPA supporter John Horning,
director of watershed protection for Forest Guardians, a New Mexico-based group that focuses on
Southwest public land issues.<P>

The GADPA coalition unanimously opposes desert grazing, but some think that, to be realistic, the proposal should not prohibit grazing. Marlett insists that "the
question is not whether cows in wilderness are OK, but how and when to remove them. It is not a
question of ecology, but strategy."<P>

Once the grazing issue is resolved, GADPA still faces an uphill battle. Raising the GADPA debate to the national level may be the only way to win a grand desert
wilderness, but it will likely trigger vicious opposition from the growing number of people in the
West who think that public lands belong not to all Americans, but to the states in which they lie.
This perplexing notion is no less radical than GADPA, but it appeals more to the miners, ranchers
and loggers who seem to fear everything about the federal government, except the subsidies that
they receive to exploit public lands.<P>

Though still in its planning stages, GADPA may join the Wildlands Project and the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act (NREPA) on the list of
visionary wilderness proposals that at first may be criticized for being politically unrealistic, but
eventually gain recognition because they make good ecological sense.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Beyond Clayoquot Sound</TITLE>

<H1>Beyond Clayoquot Sound</H1>

<H2>by Christopher Genovali</H2>

As the struggle to prevent industrial logging from destroying the ancient rainforests of Vancouver
Island's Clayoquot Sound is being played out under the spotlight of international scrutiny, the
temperate rainforests of Canada's British Columbia coast are being ravaged almost unnoticed by
rampant clearcutting.<P>

An estimated 56 percent of the world's ancient temperate rainforests, located primarily in Chile and British Columbia, has been destroyed. Only 10 percent of the original
forests of New Zealand and the conterminous US still remain. BC contains the majority of the
planet's extant intact acreage.<P>

The remote and rugged rainforest wilderness of the BC mainland coast remains largely unknown. It is an enormous region comprising approximately 30,000 square
miles. Though its Pacific Coast is dominated by scrub forests and muskeg-like lowlands, the
landscape becomes more dramatic toward the interior, with huge granite buttresses, deep-water
fjords and sedge-filled estuaries leading to steep, narrow river valleys carpeted with western
hemlock, Sitka spruce, Pacific silver fir, yellow cedar and western red cedar.<P>

The river valleys are the biological core of the mainland coast, providing critical habitat for wild salmon, grizzly
bears, bald eagles, wolves and a host of other wildlife. The <A HREF="../paper/woodfact.html">timber industry</A> principally covets this
wildlife habitat in the river valleys for its productive lowland forests.<P>

<H3>Unsustainable Logging</H3>

According to Vancouver-based Sierra Legal Defense, the BC Ministry of Forests purposely sets the
rate of logging in BC at unsustainable levels in order to quickly cut valuable old-growth trees and
then implement plantation forestry. Last year, approximately 120,000 acres of temperate BC
rainforest were clearcut (roughly 24 percent of all old-growth forest cut in the province).<P>

Despite government and logging industry propaganda (embodied in such empty sloganeering as "forest
renewal," "world-class logging" and "getting greener all the time"), shade-dependent coastal
rainforest species cannot adequately develop in sunny clearcuts. The trees never fully mature and
are appropriate only for pulping.<P>

A mere ten companies control nearly 60 percent of the timber-harvesting rights on BC's public lands. These monopolies secure non-competitive access to
huge volumes of rare and valuable timber by making meager "stumpage payments" that return a
fraction of the wood's value to the province.<P>

The lax regulatory climate and expanding corporate control does not bode well for BC's mainland coast. Due to the remoteness and inaccessibility of the
region, the destruction is taking place almost in a vacuum. The Raincoast Conservation Society
(RCS), a grassroots BC environmental organization, has taken the initiative to lift the "clearcut
curtain."<P>

RCS founder and long-time BC forest activist Peter McAllister has spent the last four years exploring the mainland coast by schooner, zodiac, kayak, canoe, plane and foot. McAllister has
documented the wilderness areas at risk and has compiled an extensive inventory of the
salmon-producing rivers and streams that have been destroyed by clearcutting and those that are
threatened by continued logging.<P>

"We are staggered by the probable extinction of wild salmon populations," said McAllister. "Most of the rivers we have reviewed show a remarkable consistency
of decline." Wild coho and sockeye have been acutely impacted as a result of habitat degradation
caused by clearcutting.<P>

Grizzly bears on the mainland coast require large stretches of intact wilderness to survive. However, much of the ecologically rich ancient forest wilderness has already
been liquidated in the big river valleys, causing widespread fragmentation of grizzly habitat and
populations.<P>

According to McAllister, the BC Ministry of Forests plans to allow approximately 95 percent of the productive rainforests on the mainland coast to be clearcut. The federal government
said in a 1991 "State of the Environment" report that most of BC's coastal temperate rainforest
will be cut by 2008. Mc-Allister warns that this will practically guarantee the extinction of one of
the densest grizzly populations left on Earth. The Raincoast Conservation Society has called for a
public investigation into the grizzly habitat destruction on the mainland coast. McAllister calls it
"one of the most serious wildlife scandals in North America."

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Hydro Quebec is Back</TITLE>

<H1>Hydro Quebec is Back</H1>

<H2>by Alexis Lathem</H2>

For the last 50 years, Hydro Quebec (HQ) has led an assault on one of North America's last great
wildernesses -- the sub-Arctic region of vast boreal forests, fragile tundra, and networks of
freshwater rivers and lakes. HQ's industrial invasion began with the damming of the wild rivers of
eastern Quebec and Labrador, a region called <I>Nitassinan</I> by its aboriginal people, the Innu.<P>

The James Bay project, a four-phase hydroelectric scheme involving dozens of pristine rivers in
Quebec, brought HQ's hydroelectric projects into the international spotlight. The Cree people of the
region have been challenging this project since the 1970s, gaining widespread international
support. Much of Phase I has been completed, but construction continues. Phase II would divert the
Great Whale River and three of its tributaries, reducing flow by 85 percent and flooding 1090
square kilometers (436 square miles) of land. In Quebec's current political climate, it is unlikely
that Phases III and IV will go forward, but building plans are complete.<P>

In November, 1994, after New York state canceled the second of two $19 billion contracts for James Bay electricity, Quebec
Premier Jacques Parizeau announced that he was postponing Phase II, known as the Great Whale
project.<P>

The jubilant mood that surrounded the announcement was quickly dampened when Great Whale's opponents learned that Parizeau refused to instruct the state-owned utility to pull out of
the environmental permitting process. Many believed that the announcement was only a political
gesture intended to silence Quebec's international critics prior to a 1995 referendum on Quebec's
independence from Canada.<P>

With the spotlight on Great Whale, HQ continued to build access roads for the Sainte Marguerite 3 (SM3) project on Quebec's North Shore. Meanwhile, the Innu opposing
SM3 fought the project in isolation from the international support networks that brought the plight
of the James Bay Cree to the world's attention.<P>

SM3 is an HQ proposal to build a new dam and restore two abandoned dams on the Ste. Marguerite River, which flows through Innu territory in
Quebec. In comparison to Great Whale, the SM3 project would be small, but its consequences would
be equally devastating to Innu culture. SM3 would join a collection of 14 existing dams erected on
the St. Lawrence River's tributaries that have already flooded an area comparable to the reservoirs
created by Phase I of the James Bay project.<P>

Nitassinan territory follows the North Shore of the St. Lawrence from Quebec City to Labrador. In this region, HQ has dammed the Bestiamites,
Manicougan, Outards and Ste. Marguerite rivers, flooding seven percent of the rich river basins
that the Innu have inhabited for thousands of years.<P>

The SM3 proposal also calls for diverting two of the Moisie River's tributaries -- the Pekan and Carheil -- into the Ste. Marguerite to increase
SM3's power-generating capacity. The Atlantic Salmon Federation has called the Moisie one of the
world's three most important salmon rivers, and the most important Atlantic salmon river in
North America. The Innu consider it their "Great River." For the Innu community of Mani-Utenam,
descendants of the Moisie band, it remains their most important tie to traditional life. For all these
reasons, HQ's proposal to divert the Pekan and Carheil rivers faced serious opposition.<P>

<H3>SM3 Construction Begins</H3>

Widespread opposition prohibited the Quebec government from authorizing the diversions of the
Moisie's tributaries, so HQ divided the SM3 project into two phases and agreed to conduct a
two-year study on the project's potential impacts on the Moisie salmon's seven-year life cycle. HQ
was thus able to proceed with the project without obtaining the necessary permits.<P>

Despite a non-binding recommendation from Quebec's environmental review board that the entire project be
rejected (because HQ could not prove that there was sufficient need for the energy to justify the
enormous economic, environmental and social costs), phase one of SM3 was authorized and
construction began in April, 1994.<P>

Innu traditionalists from Mani-Utenam initially opposed the construction through a series of referendums. When those efforts failed, they started a nonviolent
campaign that has lead to the jailing of more than 15 percent of their community.<P>

In mid-February, 1995, HQ proposed redesigning SM3 so that diverting the Pekan and Carheil rivers
would not be necessary, thus sparing the Moisie River. But when an HQ spokesperson was
subsequently asked if HQ had abandoned its plan to divert the rivers, he replied: "If there is a
demand at a later time, it could be an option." <P>

Though eliminating the immediate threat to the Moisie and its tributaries is cause for celebration, the remnants of the SM3 project would still have
significant impacts. The areas that would be flooded are fertile and biologically rich. The dam would
be built on the Grand Portage waterfalls, an Innu sacred site. Roads to the dam site would open up
inaccessible forests to clearcutting and further industrial development.<P>

The impacts of the SM3's initial construction have already been deeply felt in Innu communities. The four-year battle to
defend their land from SM3 has burdened the Mani-Utenam people with two 30-year court
injunctions. The first denies their constitutional right to public demonstrations in their own
community; the second prohibits them access to the dam site, thus denying the people access to their
federally sanctioned hunting grounds, to their ancestral burial grounds and to the Grand Portage.<P>

Twenty-three Innu face prison terms for blocking construction of an access road during a 17-day
protest in June, 1994 that was supported by an international coalition assembled by the Native
Forest Network.<P>

HQ claims that even though the territory in question is the subject of pending land claims, the utility has the right to proceed with its project. The Innu claim that to begin
construction on SM3 before the question of their land rights has been settled is a breach of those
rights. "What will it mean," asks Yvette Michel, spokesperson for the Innu traditionalists, "to have
a right to our land, if the land itself has been destroyed?"<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: A Fate Worse Than War</TITLE>

<H1>A Fate Worse Than War</H1>

<H2>by Andrew Lam</H2>

Danang -- From where Vietnam's most celebrated woman poet, Huyen Thanh Quang,
once stood overlooking the Hai Van pass, there are now burned patches of forest.
Where rocks, clouds, leaves, flowers and trees once filled the poet's eyes, today
rickety American-made <A HREF="bigmil.html">army</A> trucks, loaded with freshly cut <A HREF="../paper/woodfact.html">timber</A>, head toward
the port of Danang.<P>

Signs posted along the fringe of Vietnam's dwindling jungles and woodlands
threaten jail sentences and fines for any act of deforestation. But the
Vietnamese Communist regime, long weakened by regionalism and corruption, can
barely control the relentless destruction of the country's forests, which are
home to some of the most spectacular wild species in Asia, including the Java
rhinoceros, dagger-horned goat, as well as newly discovered animals previously
unknown to Western science.<P>

Since the country's reunification 20 years ago, Vietnam's population has nearly
doubled to 72 million and is expected to reach 82 million by the end of this
century. One out of three Vietnamese depends on forestry and <A HREF="../paper/rtp.html">forest products</A> for
a livelihood. Each year, an estimated 500,000 acres of forest are destroyed. At
this rate, Vietnam will have no forest left by the early part of the 21st
century.<P>

"Economic survival overwhelms any long-term views of environmental preservation,"
said Le Doan of the Ministry of Construction. "Besides, environmentalism (moi
truong) is not a household word in Vietnam."<P>

"In the last two decades, Vietnam's forest has shrunk from 51 million acres to 22
million acres," said Michel Gautier, a United Nations Development Program
official in Hanoi.  Less than one million acres were destroyed during the war
with America, while 13 million have been destroyed as a result of population
pressures.<P>

"If people continue to cut down more forest... it will be a catastrophe for this
country," said Francis Rinville of the UN Food and Agricultural Organization. As
Vietnam's forests shrink, he warned, soil erosion, dwindling <A HREF="../map/map.html">mangrove forests</A>,
mudslides and weakening harvests, combined with heavy monsoons, will prove an
ecological disaster worse than the war.<P>

Nonetheless, the government has a laissez-faire attitude toward environmental
protection. In 1993, city officials in Ho Chi Minh City transformed a woodland
area near the city into a resort development with a 300-room luxury hotel and two
18-hole <A HREF="golf.html">golf courses</A>.<P>

Occasionally loggers are severely beaten and sent to re-education camps for "crimes against the state," but, as Dang Nguyen, a Danang
taxi driver argued, "They should arrest government officials who sell tons of
wood to the Japanese, Taiwanese and Thais, not the people who collect wood to
build their beds and cook their rice."<P>

French businessman Michon Christian fears the social contract between the state and its people has broken down in Vietnam.
"Unless Vietnam's economy develops with the welfare of the people in mind," he
warned, "any effort to protect environmental resources won't work in the long
run."<P>

"People no longer listen to the government," Nguyen said, explaining the failure of the state's population-control plan. "For the poor, having children is
the only luxury we will ever have."<P>

Along the once tree-lined road leading from the mountain city of Dalat, Nga Le, a widowed mother of three, collects firewood
to sell."We never waste anything," she said."My children collect paper, plastic,
metal and glass to recycle -- but we are still committing crimes against the
state."<P>

Le must walk further now to collect wood, although she recalls a time when the hills were beautiful instead of "bald and muddy." "I remember when I was
young," Le said wistfully,"there were lots of trees and tigers. Now there's just
a lot of people in there, talking and cutting down trees."<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Mekong River Plan</TITLE>

<H1>Mekong River Plan: A Disaster in the Making</H1>

<H2>by Andrew Lam</H2>

Chiang Rai, <A HREF="../gsc/thai.html">Thailand</A> -- On April 5, the governments of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand
and Vietnam signed the UN Development Program-facilitated "Agreement on the
Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin."<P>

"Despite its environmentally friendly sounding title, the agreement could hasten the
impoverishment of human communities and the destruction of the biological
diversity of the Mekong River Basin," said Patrick McCully, Campaigns Director
for International Rivers Network [<I>IRN, 1847 Berkeley Way, Berkeley, CA 94703;
(510) 848-1155; fax: (510) 848-1008</I>].<P>

The agreement envisions construction of a six-dam cascade on the Mekong that would displace at least 60,000 people and have
extensive and irreparable effects on the rich and diverse fisheries, ecosystems
and farmlands of the lower Mekong Basin.<P>

According to IRN, the proposal (written by Canadian and French dam engineering firms) is based on flawed methodology and
incomplete technical and economic analyses. Behind the talk of "sustainable
development," McCully charged, "the world's leading hydropower firms from
Scandinavian, Australia, Canada, France and the US are lining up to grab some
'aid' money and turn the findings of this flawed report into concrete."<P>

The proposal gives the impression that these are "small" dams when, in fact, what is
proposed is a staircase of 30-to-60-meter-high (99-200-foot) dams flooding more
than 1000 kilometers (620 miles). The impacts on the Mekong River, one of the
world's most productive and diverse fisheries, would probably be severe. Mekong
fish are the main source of protein for millions of people in the river basin and
the delta's rice fields play a vital role in Vietnam's economy.

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: A New Land War Rages in Vietnam</TITLE>

<H2>Rice or Riches</H2>

<H1>A New Land War Rages in Vietnam</H1>

<H2>by Patricia J. Cummings</H2>

Can Tho Province -- The landscape of Asia is sculpted by rice, from flat paddies
in floodplains to rising terraces etched into mountainsides. Rice has been
harvested in Asia for more than 7000 years and is deeply embedded in both the
land and cultures of the region.<P>

About half of the world's people live in Asia, and in rural areas, most of them are engaged in producing, transporting or
trading rice. Rice is the staple food of the poor throughout the world.<P>

Worldwide, most rice is consumed in farm households or sold locally in domestic
markets. Of the 530 million metric tons of rice grown annually, only 15 million
metric tons are sold in international trade. The rice trade is a potent political
and economic issue, especially for the largest exporters: <A HREF="../gsc/thai.html">Thailand</A>, the US and
Vietnam. Thailand is the largest exporter, but the US is the strongest player in
world markets and in setting prices and trade policy.<P>

The Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture (MAFI) is spending millions of dollars on a new farm-diversification
program to protect the country from unpredictable domestic food shortages. MAFI
wants to encourage farmers to be less dependent on rice, to try new "high-yield"
varieties of grains and fruit trees, and to grow crops for export, like coffee
and tea.<P>

Money will be spent on educating farmers about new products and buying new animal varieties, including dairy cows. Presumably, this broader agricultural
base will act as a buffer against losses from natural disasters.<P>

Not only are small farmers suffering from the encroachment of industrial agriculture, they are
also being forced off the land by rampant uncontrolled development. Vietnam's
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet recently called for a halt to projects that take land
out of rice production. Throughout Vietnam, hotels, houses and office buildings
are eradicating farmland. The construction boom in urban areas has already
contributed to rice shortages and a drastic rise in rice prices in the north.<P>

Ricelands are not the only targets coveted by developers. The Vancouver
investment firm, Mekong Holdings Ltd. (MHL), wants to develop Phu Quoc, a sleepy
island off Vietnam's southern coast, into an "Asian Bermuda," featuring a blend
of tourism and unregulated offshore banking.<P>

Phu Quoc Island consists of approximately 600 square-kilometers (240 square-miles) of quiet villages that are
home to 60,000 people who make their living by farming and fishing. There are no
paved roads, only unreliable power and less than ten cars on the island.<P>

MHL plans to spend $500 million on a master plan for banks, hotels, an airport, an
export processing zone and a port intended to lure investment. None of the
expensive studies commissioned to justify the project mention anything about the
environmental impacts of such development  or its consequences for the local
people.<P>

On April 30, a bright Sunday morning in Ho Chi Minh City, as I watched
the 20th-anniversary celebration of the reunification of Vietnam, the large
Soviet-style posters lining the parade route were clearly celebrating
Western-style economic progress rather than the Vietnamese military victory.
Tanks have been replaced by shiny new Mercedes Benz' (costing $200,000, if
purchased legally). Mansions are springing up and international flights are
crowded with Vietnamese wearing designer clothes and businessmen sporting
diamond-studded Rolex watches.<P>

The cabinet ministers and political leaders I have met show few signs of adopting the trappings of Western capitalism themselves,
but they seem in danger of being made rapidly irrelevant by the enormous greed
and avarice that has been let loose in this country. Newspapers reported in May,
for example, that when a few local police tried to stop the transportation of
stolen <A HREF="../paper/woodfact.html">timber</A>, the loggers simply hired some young men to beat up the police and
then left with their booty.<P>

More than 51 percent of Vietnam's population lives below the world poverty standard (earning less than $370 per year in 1990
dollars). The true test of social and economic progress will be who ultimately
gains and who loses. After being here for a year, it seems to me that the poor
are not the ones responsible for laying waste to the land and the workers are not
the ones benefiting from the bribes. The marketplace forces now rampant in
Vietnam may overcome any resistance put up by social planners or the poor.<P>

There are few watchdog groups to hold the government accountable to international
standards of environmental protection. The World Wide Fund for Nature, one of the
few environmental groups in Vietnam, is working with the Ministry of Forestry to
train local groups in conservation and wildlife-protection practices.<P>

Vietnam's development is taking place in an atmosphere of unmitigated marketeering, which
is widening the gap between a few rich and powerful people and a great many poor.
There are absolutely no consumer rights, no provisions for a right-to-know, no
accountability for transnational businesses and no citizen enforcement of weak
legal protections. It is economic change in a political landscape that the
current Republican-dominated 104th Congress could only dream about.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: The World's Biggest Militias</TITLE>

<H2>Weapons Incorporated</H2>

<H1>The World's Biggest Militias</H1>

<H2>by William Thompson</H2>

War-making is the world's biggest business. The US military is itself a major
multinational corporation with assets equal to half of all US manufacturing
companies combined. Nearly 40 percent of US industrial plants and equipment are
devoted to military manufacturing. In 1989, approximately 30 percent of all US
industrial output was purchased by the Pentagon. In the US, seven out of every
ten dollars urgently required for environmental and social redress are devoted to
military research and development.<P>

In terms of employment, capital investment and pollution, the world's military is already a much bigger business than
mega-corporations, such as Time-Warner, Sony or General Motors. In every country
except <A HREF="../gsc/costa.html">Costa Rica</A>, the military dwarfs secondary sectors, such as public health,
education or environmental protection, whose funding, expertise and attention are
preempted by its national-security priorities.<P>

The transnationals that serve military clients have become virtually a law unto themselves. The close
cooperation between buyers, wielders and makers of weapons has largely usurped
the democratic process in high-level decision-making.<P>

From Washington, DC to Guatemala, the question no longer concerns the military's allegiance to their
respective governments, but its allegiance to the transnational corporations that
make and market its arms.<P>

The US Chamber of Commerce reports that, by the turn of the century, a few hundred multinational corporations will likely control more
than half of the production assets of the entire planet. Six multinationals now
control one-quarter of all US defense contracts. War as a primary instrument of
national policy is one of the most bankrupt ideas of old-paradigm thinking. The
spiritual and moral failure of this 5000-year-old experiment in male dominance
has also resulted in financial bankruptcy. High-stakes players are running out of
chips and high-deficit bluffs are being called. But, despite cutbacks,
war-related concerns still account for most government expenditures.<P>

<H3>An Appetite for War</H3>

Preparing to destroy large areas of the planet is a major enterprise. The world's
militaries consume more aluminum, copper, nickel and platinum than all the
developing nations combined. Nine percent of all iron and steel used on Earth is
consumed by the military.<P>

During the Vietnam War, a single B-52 Stratofortress guzzled 3612 gallons of fuel per hour, while carriers like the USS Independence
consumed 100,000 gallons of fuel in a single day. At its peak, the Vietnam War
consumed more than one million barrels of oil a day. The costs of converting
natural resources and precious metals into bombs and bombers helped push the US
economy into a deficit-driven recession from which it never fully recovered. One
big difference between the US military and multinational corporations is that the
taxpayer-supported military is not concerned with profitability or even
cost-effectiveness.<P>

As Kristen Ostling and Joanna Miller point out in <CITE>Taking Stock: The Impact of Militarism on the Environment</CITE>, the US military is not only
the biggest single source of environmental pollution in the country, it is also
the biggest environmental outlaw. Of 383 EPA citations issued to federal
facilities in 1989, nearly three-quarters went to military installations.<P>

<H3>War Is a Dirty Business</H3>

According to environmental analyst Ruth Leger Sivard: "The world's armed forces
are the single largest polluter on Earth." A <CITE>Canadian Peace Report</CITE> study found
that today's armed forces are responsible for ten-30 percent of global
environmental damage, six-ten percent of worldwide air pollution, and 20 percent
of all <A HREF="../x/atmosph.html">ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbon</A> use.<P>

The Government Accounting Office (GAO) reports that the US Department of Defense currently generates 500,000 tons
of toxic waste annually -- more than the top five chemical companies combined.
Even under the strictest regulations, the production, testing, maintenance and
deployment of conventional, chemical, biological, electromagnetic and nuclear
arms would generate enormous quantities of toxic and radioactive waste.<P>

Every step of war preparation involves significant ecological damage. Excavating the
Earth to extract uranium and rare metals for weapons production poisons large
tracts of land and precious groundwater. Multinationals' stripmines also strip
rights and customs from the Indigenous peoples whose sacred lands are often
expropriated by war-makers.<P>

The world's armed forces control between 750,000 and 1.5 million square kilometers (300,000-600,000 square miles) of land. The US
Department of Defense and the nuclear weapons complexes own or lease roughly
100,000 square kilometers (40,000 square miles) of land. As much as half the US
airspace is restricted for military use. Outside its own borders, the US military
controls another 8100 square kilometers (3240 square miles) of territory.<P>


According to the World Watch Institute, the Pentagon is the single largest energy
user domestically -- and very likely worldwide. In 12 months, it uses enough
energy to run the entire US urban mass transit system for 22 years. World Watch
adds that these energy figures would be substantially higher if the power
expended to manufacture weapons were included.<P>

<H3>War's Real Casualties</H3>

World War II killed 50 million people, most of whom were civilians. The 40-year
Cold War claimed the lives of 25 million people who died in more than 125 wars
fought on the periphery of the industrialized North. By the 1980s, civilian
deaths accounted for 85 percent of the world's war casualties.<P>

Besides its gruesome toll in human lives, the mass insanity unleashed by World War II also
destroyed farmland and forests, while consuming natural resources at incredible
rates.<P>

In addition to two Japanese cities obliterated by atomic weapons, scores of pristine Pacific atolls were blasted, burned and pulverized under intensive
air and naval bombardments. More than 450,000 acres of Libyan farmland were sown
with five million mines. Nazi troops flooded 17 percent of Dutch farmlands --
200,000 hectares (494,000 acres) -- with seawater. European bison were
slaughtered to near extinction to supply the mess kitchens of German and Soviet
troops in eastern Poland.<P>

During the Korean "police action," the most punishing US air attacks were directed against North Korea's major irrigation dams.
Ironically, after the Korean war, the 151-mile-long by 2.5-mile-wide
Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) became an abundant oasis in a ravaged landscape.<P>

Heavily patrolled against human incursions, the DMZ grew into a lush habitat of marshes,
meadows, and great forests of oaks, pines and maples. Lynx now prowl through what
wildlife researchers Richard and Joyce Wolkomir call one of the world's "great
wildlife paradises." Birds endangered by South Korea's post-war industrial boom
also found sanctuary in the DMZ. About ten percent of the world's 1200-1500
red-crowned cranes winter in this former killing ground.<P>

<H3>Ecocide in Vietnam</H3>

The US war against Vietnam marked the first time that military technology was
employed to destroy the environment of an entire country.<P>

Carrying 20 tons of bombs into the stratosphere, a B-52 could strike from 30,000 feet without
warning, turning entire villages into sudden eruptions of flaming sticks, human
limbs and thatch.<P>

A formation of B-52s could obliterate a "box" approximately five-eighths-of-a-mile wide by about two-miles long. These behemoths dropped 13
million tons of bombs on North and South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos -- triple the
total tonnage dropped in World War II. Their ferocious carpet-bombing left at
least 25 million craters  -- each averaging 50 square meters (60 square yards) --
in a country the size of Washington state.<P>

When the tropical rainforest canopy -- up to 50 feet thick -- resisted the onslaught of bombs, shells and bullets, US
forces developed the 15,000-pound Daisycutter bomb, which exploded with a
shock-wave that killed earthworms 100 meters (330 feet) from the impact crater.
The aerial and ground bombardment detonated the equivalent of an eight-kiloton
bomb over Vietnam every 24 hours.<P>

Heavy bombing and herbicide spraying contributed to the precipitous decline of the red-shanked duoc langur -- one of
11 mammals found only in Southeast Asia. Air-dropped poisons and high explosives
also prodded the lemur, the pileated gibbon, Ouston's civet and the wild forest
ox to the brink of extinction. South Vietnam's lobster industry was wrecked by
over-production to satisfy American soldiers. The tiger population was similarly
decimated for the souvenir trade. Elephants and water buffalo used by the Viet
Cong to move supplies were attacked and slaughtered by US pilots and ground
troops just as the Romans had targeted Hannibal's elephants centuries before.<P>

<H3>Poison Rain and Jungle-Eaters</H3>

Encouraged by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's fixation on technological
solutions, President Kennedy ordered chemical spraying to commence in the early
1960s. By 1966, specially modified C-130 aircraft had destroyed nearly 340,000
hectares (850,000 acres) of rainforest and crops by spraying them with
herbicides.<P>

All told, 72.4 million liters (18.8 million gallons) of pesticides were sprayed over 20 percent of the forests of South Vietnam. In approximately
one decade, 990,000 acres of prime agricultural lands were poisoned.<P>

Agent Orange, the most commonly employed defoliant in Vietnam, spread DNA-damaging
mutagens throughout Vietnam's war-torn biological web, as the rate of
miscarriages and birth defects began to increase among Vietnamese women.<P>

Precious ancient tropical forests were splintered by the blades of giant bulldozers
weighing two-and-a-half tons. Dubbed "Rome" plows by their historically minded
operators, these earth-wrecking "jungle eaters" plowed under the entire village
of Ben Suc and scraped clean 1400 acres of fertile rice paddies tilled by the
community's 3000 inhabitants.<P>

South of Saigon, in the Plain of Reeds, the five-foot-tall eastern sarus crane came under attack as US forces dug hundreds of
drainage ditches across 39,000 acres of sedge marshes. Once the coastal <A HREF="../map/map.html">mangroves</A>
were dry, the soldiers sprayed the shrubbery with flame-throwers. By war's end,
more than half of the mangrove swamps in South Vietnam had been destroyed by
chemical poisoning and napalm. When the smoke cleared, an estimated two million
hectares (5 million acres) of inland tropical forests had been heavily damaged by
bombs, shells, bulldozers and toxic defoliants.<P>

The displacement resulting from this environmental holocaust brought suffering to entire populations of animals
and humans. An ecological domino effect took place when starving hill tribes were
forced to turn from contaminated rice fields to the forests for survival. Logging
for cash and land clearing accelerated, as did subsistence hunting. In Ba Be
National Park, threatened leaf monkeys were shot by villagers to provide meat for
their families.<P>

Before the US entered the fray, southern Vietnam had been predominantly rural, with 85 percent of its population living simple lives in the
lush countryside. By the war's end, three million of Vietnam's 17 million
inhabitants had become refugees living in cities.<P>

Deforestation, erosion, drying water sources and flooding have increased drastically since the shooting stopped.
The primary cause of this water-related havoc is the decrease in Vietnam's forest
cover from 44 percent of the total land area in 1943 to only 24 percent 40 years
later. Between 100,000 and 200,000 tons of topsoil per hectare are washing down
swollen rivers to the sea each year.<P>

Deforestation is continuing in post-war Vietnam as surviving forests are felled to rebuild ten million homes, schools,
hospitals, roads and irrigation systems.<P>

This inexorable pressure is shrinking the forests the country needs for long-term sustainability at a rate of 200,000
hectares (494,000 acres) a year.<P>

With more than two-fifths of southern Vietnam's once-verdant countryside a post-war wasteland, unusable for either agriculture or
forestry, a report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and
Natural Resources calculates that "much of this ecological damage can never be
repaired." Even more ominous is a report by Asia-Pacific's Environment Network of
Malaysia, which concluded that Vietnam is a country facing "gradual extinction."<P>

For this unlucky country, the war is not over.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Green Plans: The Netherlands Leads the Way</TITLE>

<H1>Green Plans: The Netherlands Leads the Way</H1>

<H2>by Huey D. Johnson</H2>

The Netherlands' 400-page National Environmental Policy Plan (NEPP),is the best
job of technical environmental planning done by any nation to date. Not only does
the NEPP "Green Plan" successfully weave together complex systems, such as water,
<A HREF="../x/atmosph.html">air</A>, soil and energy; it also meshes them with human factors of economics, health
and carrying capacity. It is a comprehensive, long-term, well-thought-out plan,
and the Dutch are putting billions of guilders into implementing it.<P>

The Dutch chose 25 years, or one generation, as a framework for achieving environmental
recovery. They use the phrase "each generation cleans up" to express this
principle as a clear, easily understandable goal that every citizen can support.<P>

There are many good reasons why the Netherlands became the first nation to adopt
a comprehensive national environmental strategy. It has always been a country of
limited natural resources, with many complex problems packed into a very small,
heavily populated area.<P>

Situated at the mouth of the Rhine, one of Europe's most polluted rivers, the Netherlands is heavily dependent on polluting industries,
such as commodity chemicals, metals and agriculture. Since 1970, the number of
cattle in the Netherlands has doubled, putting even more pressure on land and
water resources.<P>

The NEPP is now so deeply rooted in the Dutch political system that it is no longer controversial. Public support has been evident ever since
the first parliamentary vote on the plan.

<H3>The Philosophical Basis</H3>

Like most Western countries, the Dutch first began passing environmental
legislation in the early 1970s. This first wave of environmental law was devoted
to single issues -- regulating toxics, cleaning up wastes and so on. While the US
(and most of the world) has continued to use this single-issue approach, in the
1980s the Netherlands began to realize that it was not working.<P>

One of the tools the Dutch used to develop their integrated approach was a century-old law called
the Nuisance Act, which was originally designed to deal with disturbances like
unwelcome noise or odors.<P>

In the late 1980s, the Dutch began to transform that act into the centerpiece of their integrated environmental strategy. In its new
form, the act says that a facility should be considered in terms of its total
impact on the environment -- including clean air, water, soil and so on -- before
a permit is drafted.<P>

When the NEPP was presented to the parliament in 1989, it contained 223 policy changes aimed at reducing pollution and establishing
economic sustainability.<P>

The government now requires each of the 12 Dutch provinces to write a green plan and to provide an update every four years. The
provinces are mostly responsible for the implementation and enforcement of
environmental policies. The Netherlands' plan outlines three important mechanisms
for achieving sustainability: integrated lifecycle management, energy
conservation and improved product quality.<P>

<UL>

<LI>Integrated lifecycle management goes beyond simple recycling or reuse programs. It attempts to close economic and
resource-use cycles by doubling the lifespan of products and reducing the
quantity of materials used by industry.<P>

<LI>While most developed nations are using energy at a rate that will exhaust current supplies within a few
generations, the Dutch have set aside roughly $385 million per year for energy
conservation over the next four years. The national energy policy requires an
energy-efficiency improvement of at least two percent per year, installation of
1000 megawatts of wind turbine power by the year 2000, and stabilizing energy use
by the same year.<P>

<LI>Improved product quality assures that products last longer and are easier to recycle or dispose of. For example, the Dutch government now
requires auto manufacturers to figure out what can be done at the drawing-board
stage to ensure that it is easier to dispose of an old car.<P>

</UL>

The Dutch government has also established a program for developing sustainable technology through a
technique called "backcasting," which assesses what needs to be done over the
next 40-50 years to create a sustainable economy and technology by the year 2040.
Backcasting determines where the government should spend money, what sorts of new
materials it should develop, and what kind of alternative energy to adopt to
achieve sustainability.

<H3>Guiding Principles</H3>

There are a number of fundamental principles the Dutch have incorporated in the
NEPP in order to achieve sustainability. These include:<P>

<UL>

<LI>The "stand-still" principle (environmental quality may not deteriorate).<P>

<LI>Abatement at the source (remove causes rather than ameliorate effects).<P>

<LI>The "polluter pays" principle (the user of a resource pays for the negative effects of that use).<P>

<LI>Prevention of unnecessary pollution.<P>

<LI>The application of the "best practicable means" (following the development of abatement technology).<P>

<LI>Carefully controlled waste disposal.<P>

<LI>Internalization of environmental concerns (motivating people to behave responsibly).<P>

</UL>

The Dutch have taken principle six, "carefully controlled waste disposal," and mandated that no waste
will be exported: whatever is produced in the Netherlands must be taken care of
there. This is a renunciation of some countries' practice of shipping trash to
poor nations and dumping it for a fee.<P>

With 27 percent of its countryside below sea level and almost 50 percent less than one meter above sea level, the
Netherlands would be greatly affected by rising seas caused by <A HREF="../x/atmosph.html">global warming</A>. If
other nations do not follow its example, the Netherlands is doomed. That is why
the Dutch are so involved in environmental education and negotiation about
climate change at the diplomatic level.<P>

The NEPP set a goal of stabilizing the Netherlands' carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 (this
has since been advanced to 1995). In addition, the size of the wastestream is to
be reduced 70-90 percent.<P>

The target groups for these reforms are: agriculture, traffic and transport, industry, the energy sector, the building trade, consumers
and the retail trade, water suppliers, the waste sector, research and education,
and public organizations. The government's ability to secure business'
cooperation is a remarkable accomplishment and an essential part of the NEPP. So
far, the government knows of no business that has left Holland or gone bankrupt
because of environmental policies.<P>

To provide more information to the consumer, the government has adopted eco-labeling of environmentally friendly products and
logos that identify how to dispose of certain products. The Environmental
Advertising Code, enacted in 1991, forbids misleading claims about the
"environmental friendliness" of products.

<H3>Victories and Setbacks</H3>

One of the NEPP's management strengths is its built-in mechanisms that carefully
monitor progress and setbacks. The thoroughness and honesty of the Netherlands'
monitoring and reporting are remarkable.<P>

During the period from 1980 to 1990, emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile organic
compounds were reduced by 30 percent, while phosphorus and nitrogen emissions
from wastewater and agricultural runoff decreased by five percent. As of 1992,
pesticide use had been reduced by 20 percent from 1988 levels and
chlorofluorocarbon use has been virtually eliminated in the Netherlands. By the
end of 1995, discharges of industrial wastewater into the Rhine are expected to
be 50-70 percent less than in 1985. Although not all the NEPP goals will be met,
the upward trend for most emissions has been reversed.<P>

One innovation that has caught the world's attention is the flooding of a part  of the Dutch lowlands,
drained a century ago. Previously known for building dikes rather than breaching
them, the Dutch expect to restore roughly 600,000 acres of wetlands, with the
dual goal of returning the land to the wildlife that once lived there and halting
the fall of the water table.<P>

The Dutch also have an ambitious plan to expand wildlife habitat by almost 50,000 acres and to plant almost 99,000 acres of
forest. The energy distribution target group's action plan achieved 90 percent of
its CO2 reduction target in its first year. Such large-scale projects would be
next-to-impossible without a comprehensive and integrated plan, because they
involve several ministries.<P>

The Dutch have also encountered setbacks. They were not able to reach their initial goals for CO2 reductions because the greatly
reduced price of gasoline in recent years encouraged the number of
fuel-inefficient cars to increase at a greater rate than anticipated. The Dutch
are considering imposing a carbon tax on fuels, but prefer to do so in
conjunction with other members of the European Union.<P>

An additional setback was the Netherlands' sudden rise in population, due to immigration from developing
countries and from Eastern Europe.<P>

Despite these difficulties, the latest reports the government has received show that NEPP implementation is on schedule and that
most targets will be met.<P>

In Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum there is one painting that looms above all. It is Rembrandt's "The Night Watch." Rembrandt startled the
world with that painting, so much so that it changed our ideas of art forever.<P>

I believe that the Dutch NEPP will similarly change the way people see themselves
and their actions in relation to the environment. The individuals who produced
the Netherlands' plan should be remembered as having created a work at least as
important as Rembrandt's.

<H3>Green Plans in the US</H3>

In 1980, the Carter administration issued <CITE>The Global 2000 Report to the
President</CITE>, a comprehensive assessment of global environmental and resource issues
projected over the following 20 years.<P>

Ironically, Global 2000 had its most significant impact abroad. In conversations with environmental officials from New
Zealand, I have been told that it was probably the most important inspiration for
that country's push toward a comprehensive environmental policy. The writings of
thoughtful US activists, such as David <A HREF="../brower/browerbr.html">Brower</A>, Barry Commoner, Aldo Leopold,
Rachel Carson and others have also had a greater impact on the rest of the world
than they have had in the US.<P>

The days of "unlimited" resources are largely over. The US is moving from a nation that exploited resources without thought for the
future to one that must shift to sustainability if it is to maintain the quality
of life for present and future generations.<P>

If a green plan were proposed in this country, would it survive the political process? I believe the answer is yes, for
a number of reasons. Several  states -- including New Jersey, Washington and
California -- are already positioned to adopt green plans within the next few
years.<P>

Washington has implemented a master plan called "Environment 2010" and has enacted air-quality laws, water- and energy-conservation strategies,
environmental education programs, oil-spill prevention policies and
managed-growth laws.<P>

New Jersey, one of the most environmentally pressured states, is also one of the most environmentally progressive, with some of the
country's strictest environmental standards. The state's planning commission has
developed a comprehensive environmental and land-use strategy and has established
an ongoing environmental monitoring and evaluation program.<P>

Vermont has created a state environmental board and district commissions with the power to establish
comprehensive development and land-use plans.<P>

Florida's Environmental Strategic Plan will provide long-term strategic planning, budget development, and
environmental program evaluation.<P>

"Benchmarks," Oregon's 1989 risk-assessment-based strategic planning effort, set five-, ten-, 15-, and
20-year goals in three categories: people, economy and quality of life. The
quality-of-life category includes approximately 35 benchmarks dealing with
environmental issues, among them CO2 emissions, wetlands and forest preservation,
erosion control, transportation and water quality.<P>

Minnesota has began a process called "Minnesota Milestones" to create a sustainable development plan for the
state. One goal is to reduce average annual energy use per person 22 percent by
2020.<P>

Most green-plan activity will take place at the state level, but the states will need both financial help and guidance from the federal government. Such
programs could easily be set up, starting with the creation of a federal
commission on green plans staffed by appointed members of the House and Senate,
the president's cabinet and the Department of Justice, among others. This
commission would distribute funds to the states for green-plan development. Each
state would create a green-plan commission to receive the seed money, define the
state's environmental problems and outline priorities.<P>

When green planning is taken up by leaders around the world, it will be immensely successful. The idea
is gaining momentum and, as it does, it will find leaders to champion it.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: The High Cost of Dominion</TITLE>

<H1>The High Cost of Dominion</H1>

<H2>by Jim Mason</H2>

In March 1992, Vaclav Havel, president of the  Czech Republic, wrote in <CITE>The New
York Times</CITE> about social turmoil in the modern era and of impending environmental
disaster. "Man's attitude to the world must be radically changed," wrote Havel.
He also urged that "human uniqueness, human action and the human spirit must be
rehabilitated."<P>

While I respect Havel's views, I think he should have said: "The notion of human uniqueness is a big part of our problems. The human spirit must
be reconstructed, and then humane action can move us in better directions."<P>

Our idea of human uniqueness is biologically bogus. Every species is unique -- by
definition. The idea of "uniqueness" gives a false basis for our place in the
universe, which feeds all of our environmental and spiritual problems. To solve
them, we need to come to terms with nature.<P>

Psychologist Paul Chance explored this obsession with human uniqueness in a 1988 essay for <CITE>Psychology Today</CITE>. We
seem to be driven to find something, he wrote, that "sets us apart from the
beasts of the field, the slimy things that swim in the seas and the creepy things
that hide under rocks."<P>

The obsession has a long history. It began with the ancient Greeks, who said that reason separated us from brute beasts. Then,
approximately 100 years ago, psychologists found that some animals, notably
chimpanzees, can perform simple reasoning, too.<P>

So the human community switched horses and said that creativity separated us from beasts. Then, in the '60s,
psychologists found that <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">porpoises</A> (and many other animals) are inventive,
especially in their play behavior.<P>

So we switched again, claiming tool-making as the great separator. But Jane Goodall and others found that primates and other
animals make and use simple tools.<P>

Backs to the wall, human chauvinists said that language makes us unique, whereupon science soon found that primates can also
learn to use sign language. In an eyeblink, language experts redefined language
in such a way that only human beings can have it.<P>

True, we have unique qualities, but so does every other organism. Humans have the ability to understand the inner
workings of the atom, yet many kinds of <A HREF="../strp/strpindx.html">animals</A> can find their home territory
from hundreds of miles away without the aid of maps or instruments. We can build
supersonic airplanes, yet birds can fly and cheetahs can run 50 miles an hour. We
can play the violin, yet elephants can either pick flowers or pull up trees with
their noses. If we are going to claim some kind of uniqueness, then we ought to
admit that it is, in the grand scheme of things, pretty relative.<P>

<H3>Unnatural Separation</H3>

Why are we so driven to separate ourselves from nature? Paul Chance hit the nail
on the head: we want to feel superior to animals and nature. We want something,
he wrote, that "proves that we are, somehow, not really animals at all." This is
how we try to prove our humanhood. However, the approach is infantile and
insecure.<P>

Evolutionary kinship is the biological reality here on Earth, yet we deny it and idealize a strict separation from all other animals. Something in our
culture compels us to denigrate our biological kin and to keep ourselves wholly
apart from them. We want to be sure we are in a class by ourselves -- high over
"lower" nature. This puts us all alone -- <I>over</I> the living world, never <I>in</I> it,
never <I>of</I> it. Propped up on high, we cannot come to a sense of belonging, to a
feeling of ease, here on Earth. No wonder we destroy the living world and sink
into a spiritual malaise.<P>

If there is a creeping, mass insanity, it is in our failure to grasp the very deep cultural roots of our current social and
environmental problems. A growing number of philosophers believes that the seeds
of the modern malaise were sown millennia ago when our distant ancestors took up
farming, which broke our primal bonds with the living world and put human beings
above all other life. As we took "dominion" over the living world, we left behind
feelings of kinship and belonging. Nature became an adversary, a thing beneath
us, something to be conquered and kept at bay. Nature-conquest -- so long
glorified in art, literature and song -- has become second nature to us.<P>

We are creatures of nature, yet our "dominionist" culture makes us very uncomfortable
with this fact. It makes people want to be greater than nature -- next to God.
Dominionists are prone to look down on all "others," whom they see as closer to
nature than themselves. The others can be female, people of color, people who are
different and people of other lands and cultures. Dominionists tend to see these
others as inferior, bestial beings and they regard them with much the same hatred
and contempt that they have for nature in general. They treat others as they do
nature: they try to control them and keep them apart.<P>

We see nature in ourselves, too -- in our bodies, our bodily functions and cycles, our sexuality and the
other physical aspects of life -- and it makes us uncomfortable. Because our
dominionist culture gives us mostly negative views about animals and nature, we
tend to have negative views about any traces of animal nature in humanity and in
ourselves. And we treat this beast within as we do the rest of nature: we try to
control it and repress it.<P>

If we want a better sense of humanity, then, we need to reconsider dominionist views of animals and nature. We could start with a
discussion of what animals have meant to human beings during our evolution. We
grew up as a species in the presence of animals, and our budding human mind was
fascinated and informed by them. Animals were nature's most outstanding members
-- lively, noisy and relatively ordered. In a world that was chaotic and
mysterious, animals were the beings most like us -- they were familiar. They
stirred in us a sense of awe for the world and a sense of kinship with it.
Animals have impressed the human mind and shaped culture everywhere. They are the
first beings in tribal peoples' creation stories the world over. They are the
main figures in the earliest art, in fables and myths, and in language. Until we
made them our slaves and marginalized them, animals were very much on our minds.<P>

Humanity has had a long, evolutionary run with animals and it once gave us a
familial bond with nature. If we want to come to terms with nature, we will have
to come to terms with animals.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: The Goldman Environmental Prize Winners for 1995</TITLE>

<H1>The Goldman Environmental Prize Winners for 1995</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

On April 17, environmental heroes from each of the six continents were honored at
the sixth annual Goldman Environmental Prize awards ceremony in San Francisco.
Each winner received a $75,000 "no-strings-attached" award from the Goldman
Environmental Foundation.<P>

The winners for 1995 are:<P>

<UL> 

<LI>From North America, <B>Aurora Castillo</B>, an octogenarian activist from the barrios of East Los Angeles.
In 1984, Castillo co-founded the Mothers of East Los Angeles , which has
successfully opposed the siting of waste dumps and incinerators, freeway
expansions and prisons in the largely Latino community.<P>

<LI>From Asia, <B>Yul Choi</B>, secretary-general of the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement. As a
student leader, Choi was arrested in the 1970s for opposing South Korea's rapid
industrialization. In the 1980s, Choi was placed under house arrest after he
launched the Korean Anti-Pollution Movement's (KAPMA) educational campaign
against the dangers of nuclear power. In 1990, 20,000 KAPMA demonstrators halted
plans for a nuclear waste site on Anmyon Island.<P>

<LI>From South/Central America, <B>Ricardo Navarro</B>, founder of El Salvador's Center for Appropriate Technology.
Navarro trains rural and urban residents to create local technologies to serve
local needs. Navarro is also working with youth to plant 75,000 trees as a
"forest of reconciliation" on land scarred during El Salvador's civil war.<P>

<LI>From the Island Nations, <B>Noah Idechong</B>, chief of the Division of Marine
Resources for the country of Palau. Ide-chong revived ancient consevation
principles to protect local reefs from overuse and overfishing. Idechong is now
director of the Palau Conservation Society.<P>

</UL>

Goldman European winner <A HREF="kickcars.html"><B>Emma Must</B></A> and Africa winner <A HREF="ogoni.html"><B>Ken Saro-Wiwa</B></A> are profiled in the following articles.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: "We Have Begun to Kick Our Car Habit"</TITLE>

<H1>"We Have Begun to Kick Our Car Habit"</H1>

<H2>by Emma Must</H2>

<HR>

In 1989, the British government announced that it would spend #23 billion ($36.34
billion) on the "largest road-building project since the Roman Empire." The
subsequent construction brought devastation to the British countryside and drove
people from their homes (Summer '93 <CITE>EIJ</CITE>). One morning while walking to her job as
a children's librarian in the south of England, Emma Must came across a
road-building site and was appalled by what she saw. Must joined the muddied
bands of protesters facing beatings and arrests at the hands of police and helped
draw world attention to the "road wars" in rural England. She now heads ALARM, a
road-fighting organization involved in 200 local anti-road campaigns. In November
1994, the British government finally heard the ALARM and canceled one-third of
its road-construction plans.

--Gar Smith

<HR>

Emma Must:<P>

British road-building plans promoted in the '80s would have meant a wholesale
reshaping of the country -- from the white cliffs of Dover, through hills of
Arthurian legend, to the tenements of Glasgow and the suburban streets of
Manchester.<P>

These landscapes and communities have been defended from the road-builders by the old, the young, farmers, nannies, bank managers; by
everybody from New Age travelers with beaded hair to the Tory ladies of the Home
Counties. There has been a tremendous collective effort.<P>

In Britain, ordinary people have succeeded in putting the roads program into reverse. The
"supertanker" of transportation policy is slowly turning 'round. What we now have
is an increasingly clear table on which to place our ideas for alternatives --
improved public transport, cycling, walking and traffic-demand-management
measures. Being awarded the Goldman prize will enable us to develop these
alternatives. Receiving this prize places the battle against car culture firmly
on the international agenda.<P>

Not only is <A HREF="ogoni.html">Ken Saro-Wiwa</A> currently in jail in Nigeria, in fear for his life for opposing the destruction of his homeland by
Shell Oil, which produces the gas that we daily put into our cars, but the roads
lobby is increasingly turning to the developing world in search of new markets.<P>

When you realize that there are currently more cars in Los Angeles than in the
whole of China, India and Sub-Saharan Africa put together, it's not hard to see
why the developing world appeals to [the lobby].<P>

Were the whole world to achieve the level of car ownership that the Department of Transport forecasts for
Britain, there would be an 11-fold increase in the number of cars in the world,
plus all the associated pollution, asthma, landscape destruction and <A HREF="../x/atmosph.html">climate
change</A>.<P>

If we can't stomach this, then we in the West have got to stop holding up our model of motorized mobility as an ideal to the developing world. We have to
begin to kick our car habit. Otherwise, we are simply peddling global inequality.<P>

I really do think that the buck stops here.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: "Stand by Me and the Ogoni People..."</TITLE>

<H1>"Stand by Me and the Ogoni People..."</H1>

<H2>by Ken Saro-Wiwa</H2>

<HR>

Since 1958, when Royal Dutch Shell first struck oil on Ogoni lands in
southeastern Nigeria, an estimated $30 billion-worth of oil has been extracted.
The 500,000 Ogoni farmers and fishers received little except a ravaged
environment. Once-fertile farmland has been laid waste by oil spills and acid
rain. The landscape is dotted with puddles of ooze the size of football fields.
Between 1976-91, 2976 oil spills blackened the Niger Delta, an average of four a
week. Virtually all fish and wildlife in Ogoniland are vanishing.<P>

Nigerian author and television producer Ken Saro-Wiwa founded the Movement for
the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) to nonviolently defend the environmental and
human rights of the Ogoni, one of 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria. In January 1993,
300,000 Ogoni marched peacefully to demand a share of oil revenues, political
autonomy, compensation for past damages and a clean-up by the multinational oil
companies responsible for the spills [Summer '93 <CITE>EIJ</CITE>].<P>

Last May, the Nigerian military occupied Ogoniland, subjecting the residents to
summary execution, mass arrests, rape, and the burning and looting of villages.
On May 22, 1994, Saro-Wiwa, who has been briefly imprisoned numerous times, was
abducted from his home by Nigeria's military government and charged with the
murder of four Ogoni leaders. Amnesty International believes that these
accusations are unfounded and that Saro-Wiwa's detention "is solely because of
his campaign against environmental damage and inadequate compensation by oil
companies operating in Ogoniland." Amnesty has adopted Saro-Wiwa as a prisoner of
conscience, calling for his immediate release.<P>

In February 1995, Saro-Wiwa went on trial for his life before a three-person
"special tribunal" appointed by the Nigerian military. On May 9, he was moved to
a military hospital for treatment of a chronic heart condition. On March 10,
Saro-Wiwa smuggled the following message to Richard and Rhoda Goldman from his
prison cell. It was read at the award ceremonies by his son, Ken Saro-Wiwa,
Jr.<P>

--Gar Smith

<HR>

Ken Saro-Wiwa:<P>

As far back as 1968, I have publicly protested Shell's spoliation of our Ogoni
lands to satisfy the company's needs, and when, in 1990, I founded the Movement
for the Survival of the Ogoni People it was to mobilize the entire 500,000 Ogoni
to campaign against Shell's insensitive devastation of their environment. The
massive and unstinting support that the campaign received from Ogoni youth, the
sacrifice that they made in defense of their patrimony, compel me to dedicate the
prize to the Ogoni youth.<P>

Only recently, 27 years and more after my initial protest, did Shell finally
agree that it has polluted the Ogoni environment, among others. The company has
now launched what it calls a "major environmental survey" of the Niger Delta, of
which the Ogoni strip is part. In launching the survey, Shell condemned "recent
politicized and emotive campaigning" in defense of the region.<P>

I submit that we have every reason to be emotional in our struggle for the
sanctity of our environment. The environment is man's first right. Without a safe
environment, man cannot exist to claim other rights, be they political, social or
economic.<P>

I believe that Shell knows this much and accepts it for the developed world.
Unfortunately, in Africa, Shell and many a Western multinational company have
failed to apply the environmental principle of "best practice" in their
entrepreneurial activities. Using their financial muscle and the political power
they exercise over African governments, they are wont to blackmail, terrorize and
silence those who have the temerity to question their environmental records. This
is not acceptable.<P>

As I write, I stand trial for my life before a special military tribunal against
whose decisions there is no appeal. The tribunal has been set up by Nigeria's
military dictatorship with the full support of Shell, which is represented [by]
counsel. My real crime? Challenging Shell's ecological war on my beloved Ogoni
homeland. I and the Ogoni people draw comfort from the recognition that the
Goldman Environmental Prize has conferred on our struggle. And we feel emboldened
to continue that struggle, come life or death.<P>

I appeal to the international community and environmentalists throughout the
world to stand by me and the Ogoni people as we battle to save our devastated
environment and for our survival as a people with sustainable development. I
thank those who kindly nominated me for the prize and the Goldman Environmental
Foundation for accepting the nomination.<P>

And, if I may adapt William Blake's famous words, I promise that:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I will not cease from mental fight<BR> Nor shall my pen sleep in my
hand<BR> Till we have built a new Ogoni<BR> In Niger Delta's wealthy
land.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

I hope to prove deserving of this prize.

<H2>Report From the IWC</H2>

<H1>A Bad Week for Whalers</H1>

by <A HREF="../immp/oasf9501.html">David Phillips</A><P>

Commercial whalers will not fondly remember this year's annual meeting of the
International Whaling Commission (IWC) in Dublin, Ireland, May 29-June 2, because
both Norway and Japan were severely criticized for their <A HREF="../immp/immp3.html">outlaw whaling</A>.<P>

Norway has openly defied the IWC commercial-whaling ban for the past three years. The
<A HREF="../immp/whlclaim.html">Norwegian government claimed</A> that there were more than 86,700 minke whales in the
northeastern Atlantic Ocean and that a kill of 301 minke whales annually  was in
line with "sound science." At this year's meetings, however, the IWC's Scientific
Committee stripped away any scientific rationale for Norway's continued whaling
when it rejected the population model and data used by the Norwegians, whose own
scientists admitted that gross errors had been made.<P>

The Scientific Committee determined that there was no valid estimate for the minke population number and
that no level of kill was scientifically justifiable. On the committee's
recommendation, the full commission then demanded that Norway halt its whaling.<P>

Despite this condemnation, the Norwegian government has refused to call in its
whaling fleet. Norwegian whalers are at sea right now and 82 minke have been
killed so far this year.<P>

Domestic support for Norway's whaling also continues to wane. The <CITE>Oslo Arbeiderbladet</CITE>, the newspaper of Norwegian Prime Minister Gro
Harlem Brundtland's Labor Party,  blasted the continuation of Norway's whaling:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The Norwegian battle to gain international acceptance for whaling is already
lost. The sooner we realize this, the better... . Norway has now started with a
kind of politics where we demand that other countries preserve their rainforests,
or their threatened species, but we are not willing to do so ourselves.
Environmental work costs. If Norway wants to be taken seriously, and especially
Gro Harlem Brundtland as the "environmental minister" of the world, we cannot
continue to act as if there are special rules for Norway in the 'game' of the
environment."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Twenty-one IWC member nations, including the US, joined in the condemnation of Norway's whaling. The Norwegian's outlaw whaling has provided
ample justification for the Clinton Administration to impose economic sanctions.
Under US law, the president can embargo products from countries violating
international conservation agreements. Such sanctions could cost Norway up to
$100 million per year in lost revenues, far exceeding the value of the whale meat
taken by hunters. By imposing trade sanctions, the US would send a strong signal
that countries must honor their obligations to international agreements.
Conversely, if Norway is permitted to violate the commercial whaling ban and base
its whaling on wildly inaccurate whale-population data, there will be little to
prevent Japan, Iceland and a host of other countries from doing the same.<P>

Last year, President Clinton refrained from imposing sanctions, because the US
accepted Norway's scientific estimates. Now there is no longer any credible
rationale for failing to use economic leverage to convince Norway to end the
whale slaughter.<P>

<H3>Japan Violates Sanctuary</H3>

Japan also came under intense pressure at the IWC meeting for its failure to
honor the newly created Antarctic Sanctuary. Japan sent out its whaling fleets
and took 330 minke whales in the Southern Ocean earlier this year, most from
within the sanctuary boundaries. Japan conducted this whaling under self-granted
"scientific permits." This year, the IWC again called for Japan to abandon its
"research" whaling, citing the lack of any viable scientific rationale.<P>

Japan was further embarrassed by several new investigative reports uncovering widespread
trade in illegal whale meat entering Japan from Taiwan, South Korea and Russia.
EarthTrust and the Endangered Species Project conducted DNA analyses proving that
protected whale species, such as humpback, fin and Bryde's whales, can be found
for sale in Japanese markets.<P>

The IWC responded by passing a resolution to improve mechanisms to prevent illegal trade in whale meat. The resolution calls
on Japan, Norway and any other country with stockpiles of whale meat to generate
annual reports for the IWC on the volume of their stocks and to report on
enforcement actions taken to control sales of illegal whale meat. The resolution
further encourages the use of DNA testing to identify <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">whale</A> meat from endangered
species and calls for the disposal of this meat in the near future.<P>

<HR>

<H2>What You Can Do:</H2>

Write to Vice President Al Gore [c/o The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20500] and urge that, in light of
Norway's violation of the IWC and "sound science," that the US impose sanctions
on Norwegian products. Write to Gro Harlem Brundtland [c/o Prime Minister of
<A HREF="../immp/immp3.html">Norway</A>, Norwegian Embassy, 2720 34th St. NW, Washington, DC 20008] and demand
that Norway recall its whaling fleets immediately.

<TITLE>Ocean Alert Fall 1995: A Message from David Phillips</TITLE>

<H1>A Message from David Phillips</H1>

<IMG SRC="immp14-2.gif" ALIGN=Left 
VSPACE=10
HSPACE=10>

One thing is clear in this line of work -- our victories are never permanent. The political 
climate in Washington, DC these days has put a number of our hard-fought 
environmental-protection laws at risk.
<P>

Under the guise of "deregulation," bills have been introduced to gut the Endangered 
Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The impact on 
the dolphins and whales you and I have fought so hard for -- and on endangered rhinos, 
tigers, and other species; on the air we breathe; the water we depend on for life; and the 
health of the entire Earth -- can't yet be measured.
<P>

Countries like Japan and Norway are watching with keen interest to see whether US 
leadership on wildlife protection can be undermined. They are poised to resume extensive 
commercial whaling if they can get away with it.
<P>

Foreign governments, such as Mexico and Venezuela, and even some former US tunaboat 
owners, are taking aim at dolphins again. They are trying to allow dolphin-unsafe tuna back 
on supermarket shelves and to permit a return to the bad old days when US tuna vessels 
killed tens of thousands of dolphins every year. Congressional hearings are taking place on 
proposals to dismantle the entire US dolphin-safe policy.
<P>

We've come too far to let this happen now. Dolphin mortality in the Eastern Tropical Pacific 
Ocean has been reduced by more than 96 percent as a result of the dolphin-safe campaign. 
Consumers support it, the tuna companies support it -- it is a major success story, but we 
must remain ever vigilant to keep the oceans safe for dolphins.
<P>

In the coming months, we will need your help to block those who would destroy our 
environmental protection laws. It won't be easy, but together we must hold on to the 
progress we've made and continue our push to make the oceans safe for all species.
<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: DNA Testing Exposes Whale Trade</TITLE>

<H1>DNA Testing Exposes Whale Trade</H1>

<H2>by Don White</H2>

DNA, one of the principal building blocks of life, is an incredible storehouse of
information. While scientists will probably never be able to resurrect extinct
species like those in <CITE>Jurassic Park</CITE>, they can use forensic DNA techniques to help
keep other giants from following the dinosaurs into extinction.<P>

These behemoths -- the great <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">whales</A> -- have benefited from the "protection" of the <A HREF="../immp/immp3.html">International
Whaling Commission (IWC)</A> for many years. Right whales were protected in 1946;
humpbacks in 1966; and there has been an international moratorium on commercial
whaling since 1986. Last year, a huge Southern-Ocean sanctuary was designated to
safeguard most of the surviving whales in their southern feeding grounds near
Antarctica.<P>

The problem with IWC "protection" is that it has historically been passive and frequently unenforced. Whalers have been on the honor system to kill
only IWC-approved numbers and species of whales, mainly for <A HREF="../immp/whlclaim.html">"research" purposes</A>.
With the price of whale meat often exceeding $200 per pound, however, Japan has
become the end-market for the illegal global commerce in smuggled whale meat.
This trade was exposed in 1994 and again in 1995 when EarthTrust used
DNA-sampling techniques to prove that fresh humpback whale steak was being sold
in a major Hiroshima supermarket.<P>

EarthTrust's investigation revealed that Japan has effectively kept "two sets of books" on the number and kinds of whales it has
hunted. Officially, Japan has complied with the IWC's kill limits. In reality,
however, Japan's whaling industry has shamelessly traded in protected and
endangered whale flesh. (Revelations from the former USSR detailed complicity
with Japan from the '50s to the '70s. The Soviets killed more than 48,000
humpback whales -- the majority of the species -- in that period, and Japan
consumed them.)<P>

For years, EarthTrust had hoped to do a DNA analysis of Japan's whale-meat market and by 1993 the testing technology was available. However,
Japan can stall any scientific tissue-export requests under CITES, the
international treaty that protects endangered species.<P>

EarthTrust devised a strategy to use a portable DNA-testing lab in a Tokyo hotel room to do the
analysis. C. Scott Baker, a leading molecular ecologist, traveled to Japan with a
donated MJ Research "minicycler" and amplified the DNA of whale meat samples
collected by an EarthTrust advance team. Once "cloned," the synthetic DNA was
legal for export without permits.<P>

The analysis showed not only humpback, but many fin whale samples, one North Atlantic minke, and a number of ill-fated dolphins
sold as whale (at whale prices). Japan's whalers condemned the study, which
appeared in the prestigious journal <CITE>Science</CITE> in September, 1994. But there are few
areas of science as well-established as DNA testing. A 1995 study of Korea's
whale-meat markets (by Endangered Species Project and EarthTrust) has validated
the original study and put whale smugglers on notice.<P>

DNA can be used as a tool to <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">end illegal whaling</A>, destroy the rationale for "research" whaling and
indefinitely delay "commercial" whaling while illegal commerce is brought under
control. From now on, even after it has been harpooned, flensed, filleted and
marinated, a whale can tell its story.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Dolphin Defender Threatened</TITLE>

<H1>Dolphin Defender Threatened</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

In February, 1993, Venezuelan biologist Aldemaro Romero, PhD., and Prof. Ignacio
Agudo videotaped a group of fishermen harpooning and butchering a female <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">dolphin</A>
for shark bait -- a common practice along the Venezuelan coast. The biologists
brought the tape and reams of documentation to the attention of government
officials, but their pleas for action to halt the killings went unheeded.<P>

Romero, the author of hundreds of scientific papers, was formerly the executive director
of the Venezuelan Foundation for the Conservation of Biological Diversity and is
a past president of the Hemispheric Conference on Economics and the Environment.
Agudo is the president of Venezuela's Fudacetacea (The Whale Fund).<P>

In November 1993, CNN obtained a copy of the biologists' videotape. When the dolphin killing
was televised in the US, the Venezuelan Consulate in Miami received 20,000
outraged protest letters.<P>

The publicity spurred Venezuelan officials to take action: they charged Romero and Agudo with killing the dolphin. "The government
announced [it was] going to try both of us for 'treason to the motherland',"
Romero stated. "Our telephones were tapped. The fishermen who killed the dolphins
were arrested seven times in five days... and made to sign a confession in which
they claimed we had tricked them."<P>

The Venezuelan government, already smarting from a 1991 US trade embargo because of its <A HREF="../immp/hr2179.html">dolphin-unsafe</A> tuna-fishing
practices, declared that Romero and Agudo were paid provocateurs working for <A HREF="../immp/immp6.html">US
tuna companies</A>. Venezuela accused HJ Heinz Co. (producers of Starkist-brand tuna)
of paying the biologists $10,000 and claimed that the payoff had been laundered
through Earth Island Institute.<P>

In April 1994, a judge issued a warrant for the arrest of Romero and Agudo, and vowed on television that, once arrested, the
scientists "would never be released from jail." Ramon Martinez, the governor of
Sucre state, where the incident occurred, was even more blunt. "If it were up to
me," he told <CITE>The Wall Street Journal</CITE>, "I'd have them shot." When Romero began
receiving death threats from people who pointedly recited his daughter's school
schedule, he and his family fled to the US.<P>

"Professor Agudo is still hiding in Venezuela and I am very concerned about his situation," Romero told the animal
rights newspaper, <CITE>Animal People</CITE>. Amnesty International and the US State
Department have both faulted Venezuela in the past for its abysmal human rights
record.<P>

Even in the US, Romero is not safe. On November 30, 1994, he was invited to meet Eduardo Vetencourt, who identified himself as the Venezuelan vice-consul
in Miami. During a two-hour meeting at a local Burger King, Vetencourt informed
Romero that he was armed and that his "real job" involved "security." He said
that a military plane was waiting to fly Romero to Venezuela for a "fair trial."<P>

Vetencourt told him that Venezuelan authorities had "temporarily" abandoned the
idea of kidnapping him because of fears of bad publicity.<P>

In January, the Venezuelan press reported that the government was considering a request to
extradite Romero. The US State Department, however, has indicated that such a
request will not be honored.<P>

On March 1,  Romero was invited to be "interviewed" by Ricardo Zurita, reporter for Venezuela's <CITE>El Nacional</CITE>. A check of Venezuelan
and US news agencies failed to locate any reporter by that name. Fearing a
kidnapping attempt, Romero called the FBI.<P>

"Given the level of <A HREF="activrisk.html">political [persecution]</A> that I have been subjected to in Venezuela," Romero informed the
FBI, "I believe that once the extradition is not granted, the Venezuelan
authorities will take illegal forceful action to take me back to Venezuela." In
an interview in the March 10 issue of <CITE>Science</CITE>, Romero declared, "I feel like I'm
in a Hitchcock movie. I'm afraid for my life."

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Appropriate Technology in Central America</TITLE>

<H1>Appropriate Technology in Central America</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

AT Work is an all-volunteer Earth Island project that assists grassroots
development projects by providing skilled volunteers; educational resources,
technical and material resources; and funding and publicity assistance. AT Work
strives to break the cycle of poverty and environmental degradation by empowering
poor communities in the US and Latin America to develop ecologically sustainable
and socially just living conditions.<P>

AT Work's Alternative Development Exchange (ADE) program helps impoverished communities by connecting them with skilled
volunteers. Volunteers can review AT Work's database of eligible communities and
find projects that meet their specific skills, abilities and interests. AT Work
also provides books, tools and computers to recipient communities and projects.
Recent donations have included a computer for a non-violence training center in
Nicaragua and seeds for Indigenous farming projects in the US and Central
America.<P>

In 1995, AT Work is supporting two new projects in Central America -- the Organic Agriculture Project in Chiapas, Mexico, and the Monteverde
Conservation League in <A HREF="../gsc/costa.html">Costa Rica</A>.<P>

Chiapas is the poorest state in Mexico, and half its population is Indigenous. Since the 1994 rise of the Zapatista movement,
a rebel group fighting for freedom, democracy and human rights, Chiapas has been
subjected to military occupation, bombings, kidnappings and violence.<P>

The Organic Agriculture Project has been a bright light in this troubled region. Neusa
Hidalgo Monroy, a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley,
has put AT Work in touch with small, organic coffeegrowers in the highlands and
on the coast of Chiapas. These growers have formed a farming cooperative to
improve living and economic conditions by teaching organic farming methods and
marketing skills. In addition to growing coffee for commercial use, the farmers
raise corn, beans, squash and potatoes. In the highlands, they also herd cattle
and sheep. Coop members are developing new projects in sustainable forestry,
building construction and the use of alternative energy resources.<P>

The project still needs volunteers skilled in animal husbandry, bio-intensive farming,
economics and integrated pest management. The broader goal of the Chiapas project
is to help grassroots organizations throughout Mexico get the necessary skills to
run similar agricultural enterprises.<P>

The Monteverde Conservation League (MCL) is located in the Tilaran Mountains of Costa Rica. MCL's aim is to preserve,
conserve and rehabilitate tropical ecosystems and to safeguard biodiversity in
Monteverde National Park. There are some long-term research positions being
offered by MCL, but the majority of workers needed are manual laborers, education
specialists, cartographers and biologists.

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: AT Work Supports the Mixtecs of Oaxaca</TITLE>

<H1>AT Work Supports the Mixtecs of Oaxaca</H1>

<H2>by Tracey Silberman</H2>

In April, AT Work members gathered in Oakland, California, to meet with Rufino
Dominguez, the lead organizer for Frente Indigena Oaxaqueno Binacional (FIOB).
Dominguez, who maintains an FIOB office at his home in Livingston, California, is
the main conduit for the exchange of information between Mixtecs living in
California and their family members in Oaxaca.<P>

Dominguez reported some promising developments for the Mixtecs and other Indigenous groups living south of the
border. After years of demands from FIOB, the Mexican federal and Oaxacan state
governments have agreed to begin a revolving loan institution for the
organization. Just how much money will be loaned initially and how it will be
dispersed is still to be arranged, but this is seen as a great success for the
Oaxacans.<P>

Dominguez said that the money will be used to begin small agricultural projects in the villages. The project will grow food for the villagers, but the
majority of the produce will be exported, providing a steady income for Mixtecs
so that they do not have to migrate hundreds of miles to the US to find work. In
California, he noted, finding employment often means living in squalor, suffering
exposure to pesticides and being subjected to discrimination.<P>

There is still much assistance that AT Work can provide in Oaxaca. The FIOB needs volunteers to help
organize its business. Because of deforestation and erosion in Oaxaca, research
must be done to determine which crops will thrive in the depleted soil before
planting can begin. Soil surveyors, organic agriculture experts and organizers
are needed. Marketing and management talents are also needed to help Oaxacan
farmers determine which crops are the most profitable, and which markets they
should pursue.<P>

Dominguez confided that, just by listening and being supportive, AT Work had already helped FIOB. In addition, AT Work's material support has
included the donation of several computers and assistance in setting up an e-mail
communication system for FIOB.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Mescalero Dump Blocked... and Reborn</TITLE>

<H1>Mescalero Dump Blocked... and Reborn</H1>

<H2>by John Sterling</H2>

On June 26, a coalition of 23 nuclear utilities and the Mescalero Apache tribal
council announced plans to build a $2.3 billion "temporary" nuclear-waste storage
facility on the Mescalero reservation in New Mexico, despite intense opposition
from tribal members, state officials and other concerned citizens.<P>

When the project was first conceived, its advocates claimed that, to be financially
viable, the site would need to store 80 percent of the spent fuel rods produced
at 33 nuclear power plants. The proposal hit an obstacle on January 31 when
tribal members voted 490 to 362 against building the dump. "On that day, the
commercial nuclear industry was beaten by the Apache spirit," said Rufina Laws,
founder of Humans Against Nuclear-waste Dumps [HANDs, POB 2659, Ruidoso, NM
88354; fax (505)257-2882] and a member of the Mescalero Apache tribe.<P>

But, after a vigorous and controversial petition drive headed by Fred Kaydahzinne, the
reservation's housing director, the tribal council held a second ballot on March
9 in which the tribe voted 593 to 372 in favor of the facility. Because
Kaydahzinne's office provides housing to 60 percent of the tribe's members, many
opposed to the project claim that residents may have felt intimidated into
signing the petition.<P>

After the second vote, the tribal council announced that construction of the storage site would proceed if only 12 of the original 33
plants continued to support the project. Though ten utilities dropped out of the
plan, the remaining 23 will fund upcoming planning, engineering, design and
licensing for the site. Construction could begin as early as 1997 and the
facility could accept its first shipment of spent fuel rods in 2002.<P>

Opponents remain hopeful that the project can be halted. "We believe  the site can be
stopped during the long licensing process," said Lila Bird of the Water
Information Network [WIN, PO Box 4524, Albuquerque, NM 87106; 505-255-4072]. Bird
explained that the utilities' support appears to be non-binding and that each
company is vulnerable to public pressure. One week prior to the nuclear
consortium's announcement that the project would continue, actor Steven Seagal
addressed more than 1000 people on the Mescalero reservation, urging them to
oppose the site.<P>

Northern States Power is the utility leading the push to build the Mescalero plant. HANDs and WIN are encouraging people to pressure Northern
States [414 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, MN 55401; (612) 282-1234, fax (612)
639-4575] to abandon the plan and promise never to store waste on Native American
land.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: The Cod Squad vs.the God Squad</TITLE>

<H1>The Cod Squad vs.the God Squad</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

In 1991, former Bush Administration Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, Jr.,
designated a special committee, chaired by Vice President Dan Quayle, that had
the power to overrule the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This so-called "God
Squad" had the power to decree which threatened species should be denied ESA
protection to accommodate regional and national economic interests. It could, for
example, approve the commercial logging of old-growth forests, even if it meant
the extinction of the northern spotted owl.<P>

The God Squad concept originated in1978 as a compromise amendment to the
Endangered Species Act. The committee included the secretaries of Agriculture,
Defense and Interior, the heads of the EPA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, and the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors.<P>

As the Republican Contract With America threatens the wholesale demolition of the
ESA, the <CITE>Journal</CITE> believes that it is time to counter the pro-growth
notion of the "God Squad" with a pro-species concept -- the "Cod Squad."<P>

Where the God Squad assumed the power to decide which species should become
extinct to protect industry, the Cod Squad  (named in honor of the North Atlantic
Ocean's depleted cod) would identify the <B>industries</B> that must become
extinct to assure the survival of life on Earth.

<H2>The Cod Squad List of Lethal Industries</H2>

<UL><LI><A HREF="../immp/immp.html">Driftnet Fishing</A> -- and all over-fishing technologies that "stripmine the
seas," removing cod and other creatures from the world's oceans.<P>

<LI>Nuclear Technology -- which still has not learned basic table manners -- i.e.,
"Clean up your leftovers before leaving the table."<P>

<LI>Gas-powered Vehicles -- making oil-burning autos "more efficient" makes about as
much sense as trying to design a more-efficient plague virus. More
miles-per-gallon means more people can drive further, spreading pollution and
suburban sprawl.<P>

<LI>Fossil-fuel-burning Power Plants -- smoke clouds and acid rain make each of these
technological dinosaurs a site-for-sore-eyes.<P>

<LI>Petroleum -- the life-blood of the "Combustion Economy." Oil burned heats the
planet. Oil spilled defaces the planet.<P>

<LI><A HREF="../paper/woodfact.html">Non-sustainable Logging</A> -- the timber industry has grown rich from cutting down
irreplaceable, complex forest systems and substituting tree plantations. This
kind of forestry has the same sort of impact on native wildlife that urban
renewal has on the inner-city poor.<P>

<LI>Chemically Intensive Agriculture -- formulating molecules into herbicides,
pesticides and insecticides employs biocide against the environment -- for
profit.<P>

<LI><A HREF="../paper/rtp.html">Pulp Mills</A>-- while paper makers are busy turning pine trees into toilet paper,

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Who Wants to Kill the Endangered Species Act?</TITLE>

<H1>Who Wants to Kill the Endangered Species Act?</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

On April 13, Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA) uncorked a noxious piece of legislation
designed to clearcut, bulldoze and blast the Endangered Species Act onto the
scrap heap of US environmental history. <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reporter
Timothy Egan observed that Gorton could not take full credit, however, since his
bill "was written largely by the industries that will be most affected by its
outcome" -- timber, mining, ranching and utility interests.<P>

Unveiling his handiwork before an enthusiastic crowd of timber executives at a river resort in
Washington state, Gorton explained that, under his plan, the fate of <A HREF="../strp/strpindx.html">endangered animals</A>
and plants would be determined not by law, but by a political appointee
in the Department of the Interior. (Curiously, an identical plan has surfaced in
New Zealand. See "Around the World" in this issue.)<P>

The Gorton bill was drafted with the legal assistance of the National Endangered Species Act Reform Coalition
(NESARC), an industry lobby representing 185 members, including electric-power
companies, scores of state water districts, Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp.,
Chevron USA and Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey.<P>

When Egan asked if NESARC's role constituted a conflict of interest, Gorton admitted that this was not "how
good public policy should be made," but insisted that he was "perfectly willing
to get the free services of good lawyers in drafting my views." (NESARC also
poured $34,000 into Gorton's 1994 senatorial campaign.) "The task of rewriting
our nation's most important environmental laws is being done by major corporate
interests, whose practices created much of the problem in the first place,"
Environmental Defense Fund official Michael Bean told the <CITE>Times</CITE>.

<HR>

<H2>Meet the National Endangered Species Act Reform Coalition</H2>

The NESARC membership list (as of September 1994) included the following
organizations:

American Farm Bureau Federation; American Public Power Assn.; Boise Cascade
Corp.; California Assn. of Winegrape Growers; California Grain and Feed Assn.;
Coalition of Counties/Stable Economic Growth; Coalition of Oil & Gas Industry
Associations; Farm Credit Bank of Texas; Greater Westside California Women for
Agriculture; Interstate Natural Gas Assn. of America; International Council of
Shopping Centers; Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp.; National Assn. of Home
Builders; National Assn. of State Depts. of Agriculture; National Rural Electric
Coop. Assn.; National Stone Assn.; San Joaquin County Citizens Land Alliance
(CA); South Central Nebraska Bankers Assn.; Texas Aggregate & Concrete Assn.;
Texas Farm Bureau; Western States Petroleum Assn.<P>

The membership roll also includes 53 electric-power companies (mostly in the Midwest), 46 irrigation
districts (predominately in California), nine large farms and cattle operations,
and nine county governments (in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington
and Wyoming).

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Canada Resumes Seal Clubbing</TITLE>

<H1>Canada Resumes Seal Clubbing</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

St. John's-- This spring, the Canadian government became the official sponsor of
North America's bloodiest seal kill, offering Newfoundland's unemployed cod
fishers a bounty of 20 cents for every baby harp seal that they could kill.<P>

As photographers snapped pictures, sealers killed the big-eyed pups by bashing their
heads or stomping on their throats. Some hunters picked up and hugged the
trusting animals before throwing nooses around their heads and hanging them. One
sealer was filmed confronting a barking mother seal and beating her back with the
body of her screaming pup.<P>

The motive for this harrowing display of macho behavior is neither pelts nor meat. The real money is being made by supplying
50,000 seal penises as "aphrodisiacs" to the TerraNova and Shanghai Fisheries
companies of China.<P> 

While a pelt can fetch $15, a powdered seal penis sells for $130 in Asia, where some men will pay big bucks to try  to boost their virility.

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Easterbrook's Optimism Flagging</TITLE>

<H1>A Moment for Reflection: Easterbrook's Optimism Flagging</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

Greg Easterbrook's  744-page book, <CITE>A Moment on the Earth</CITE>, has drawn
fire for arguing that most environmental problems have been solved -- the ozone
layer is not vanishing; air pollution is under control; drinking water is cleaner
than ever.<P>

Vermont author Michael Perlman caustically characterized Easterbrook's book as "a
rousing call to inaction."<P>

It seems even Easterbrook is having second thoughts. Appearing on National Public
Radio's "Talk of the Nation" on May 5, he explained that he delivered the
manuscript to his publishers before the Republican victory in the November
elections.  The <A HREF="greengop.html">GOP</A>, Easterbrook now warned, "would repeal large sections of the
Clean Air Act. The Republicans couldn't get away with it if the public knew how
spectacularly successful these laws have been." Easterbrook said that the GOP's
Contract With America was designed to create legislative "gridlock" that could
"eviscerate" environmental laws.<P>

In the interview, Easterbrook admitted to three significant "errors of fact. And
for these," he added, "I apologize."<P>

In fairness, Easterbrook was not the first "ecorealist" to appear on the media
horizon. The <CITE>Columbia Journalism Review</CITE> gives this honor to <CITE>New York Times</CITE>
reporter Keith Schneider who, in 1991, suggested that exposure to dioxin was "no
more risky than spending a week sunbathing" and argued that regulating hazardous
chemicals placed a needless drain on US productivity.<P>

<H2>What You Can Do:</H2> 

A 52-page, point-by-point factual analysis of Easterbrook's claims about endangered species, the spotted owl, ozone depletion and climate
change in <CITE>A Moment on the Earth</CITE> has been prepared by the Environmental Defense
Fund. The report consists of corrections to Easterbrook's information drawn from
the scientific literature. The paper is available from Environmental Defense
Fund, Public Information, 257 Park Avenue  South, New York, NY 10010; (212)
505-2100.

<H1>Progress on National Sustainability</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

<HR>

<H2>Can the US Become Sustainable?:</H2> 

According to the founders of The Sustainability Project (TSP), "America is entering an extraordinary time of uncertainty and
challenge.... Our democratic institutions are failing in multiple ways to ensure
our own security, our children's future and the future of the planet itself."<P>

Countering the rising tide of anti-government rhetoric, TSP President Stan Euston
sees a "sustainability ethic" as the antidote to "current efforts to dismantle
government in the name of narrow individualism."<P>

Instead of the specter of paranoid paramilitary militias, TSP offers a vision of "a citizen-led redirection
of public life toward a political economy that supports community health,
environmental stewardship and social justice." [To get involved, request a free
copy of Gathering Hope: A Citizens' Call to a Sustainable Ethic for Guiding
Public Life, from TSP, 4 Gavilan Road, Santa Fe, NM 87505; phone/fax (505)
466-2052.]

<H2>Sustainable Ashland:</H2> 

On March 21, 1995, the Ashland, Oregon city council passed Resolution No. 95-08, a historic document that calls on the federal government to
establish a National Optimum Population Commission (NOPC) "to analyze and debate
the question: 'What is our optimum population?' " After three-to-five years of
study, the NOPC would "propose non-coercive educational, legislative and
public-policy initiatives to place the United States on the path -- during a
transition period lasting from 100 to 125 years -- toward achieving an optimum
sustainable population." [Contact: City Councillor Brent Thompson, City Hall,
Ashland, OR 97520; (503) 488-0407.]

<H2>The Greening of <CITE>Newsweek</CITE>:</H2>

Covertly cloaked behind the headline, "Bye-Bye, Suburban Dream," the cover story in the May 15 issue of <CITE>Newsweek</CITE> could have read:
"Hello, Eco-Cities!" A rousing paean to the work of the "new urbanists" who are
"going back to the future to take the edge off edge cities," <CITE>Newsweek</CITE> lamented
how the tranquillity of small-town communities has been destroyed by over-paving,
overpopulation and predatory development. Instead of six-lane highways and strip
malls, <CITE>Newsweek</CITE> offered a list of "15 Ways to Fix the Suburbs" that included
"give up big lawns," "bring back the corner store," "make the streets skinny,"
"mix housing types," "plant trees," "plan for mass transit," "link work to home,"
"make a town center," "shrink parking lots," "turn down the lights" and, finally,
"think green."

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: A Call to Cut Wood Use</TITLE>

<H1>A Call to Cut Wood Use</H1>

<H2>by Peter Bahouth, Director, Turner Foundation<P></H2>

Only ten percent of the inhabited Earth -- regions occupied by forest dwellers, nomads and
land-based native communities -- remains in a roadless condition. The other 90 percent is cut up
into segments of less than 8000 acres by roads. In the US alone, there are more than 350,000
miles of logging roads on public lands -- nine times the length of the entire interstate highway
system. This figure is startling considering that we have not yet reached the 100th anniversary of
the automobile.<P>

The US is the world's leading consumer of <A HREF="../paper/woodfact.html">wood products</A>: with five percent of the population, the US
consumes more than 17 percent of the world's wood. <P>

Current forest industry projections call for a 50-percent increase in US timber demand by the
year 2040. We are cutting down more and more forests that have never been cut before. Whenever
conservationists save a forest, the industry simply moves its logging elsewhere. We must have an
alternative plan.<P>

It is obvious that saving the forests means reducing the amount of wood used in our society. In
October, 1994, at the invitation of the Rainforest Action Network (RAN), 36 environmentalists and
policymakers met in Tomales Bay, California to map out a strategy for saving the world's remaining
forests. They issued the following Tomales Bay Declaration: "We call for a 75-percent reduction of
wood and wood-based <A HREF="../paper/rtp.html">paper</A> use in the US within ten years, with the expressed purpose of
increasing meaningful employment, creating a healthy society and restoring natural habitats." <P>

The campaign's ten-point plan recommends the following actions: buy certified, sustainably
harvested lumber; use wood efficiently; shift from timber- to earth-based architecture; use
salvaged lumber and used furniture; use building materials made from recycled wood or
agricultural fibers; use less paper; choose products with the least packaging; shun disposable
products; buy maximum-content recycled and chlorine-free paper; buy <A HREF="../paper/ecosources.html">tree-free paper products</A> made from <A HREF="../paper/kenaf.html">kenaf</A>, hemp, straw or
agricultural wastes. This unprecedented plan is about changing how things are made. It is a
practical plan as well as an idealistic one. The actions of millions of people took the lead out of
paint, <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">whale</A> oil out of machines and horses out of glue. Now it is time
to see the forest for the trees.

<HR>

<H2>What You Can Do:</H2>

RAN, with support from the Turner Foundation, has published a 72-page action guide, <CITE>Cut
Waste, Not Trees: How to Use Less Wood, Cut Pollution & Create Jobs</CITE>. The book, published
entirely on tree-free, kenaf-plant paper, is available for $10 from RAN, 450 Sansome Street,
Suite 700, San Francisco, CA 94111.

 Gap International recently published its French-English in-house newsletter on tree-free kenaf, Apple Computers Inc. printed a widely circulated
promotional brochure on the paper and <CITE>Understory</CITE>, the journal of the Woodworkers Alliance for
Rainforest Protection, was also printed entirely on tree-free sheets.<P>

 Kenaf has a cost-competitive, tree-saving, landfill-waste-reducing competitor on the horizon. Arbokem of Canada is now
producing beautiful 100-percent tree-free paper made from 45 percent agricultural waste (wheat
straw), 40 percent recycled corrugated cardboard and 15 percent calcium carbonate filler.
Patagonia Corp. has used forest-friendly Arbokem paper in printing its company newsletter.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: How Right-Wing Militias Target Environmentalists</TITLE>

<H1>How Right-Wing Militias Target Environmentalists</H1>

<H2>by David Helvarg</H2>

On November 14, 1994, Ellen Gray, an organizer with the Pilchuck Audubon Society in Everett,
Washington, testified at a county council hearing in favor of a land-use ordinance to protect local
streams and wetlands. As she finished speaking, a man with a noose stood up and said, "This is for
you." Another man told her, "We have a militia of 10,000, and if we can't beat you at the ballot box,
we'll beat you with a bullet."<P>

 Although they do not agree on everything, militant members of the Wise Use movement, property rights advocates and members of armed militias are increasingly
staking out common ground. In the West, the militias are using the existing Wise Use network as
one of their primary recruiting bases, arguing for military resistance to the government and its
"preservationist" backers. As of late winter, 1994, local environmental activists in Washington
state, New Mexico, Texas and Montana reported receiving death threats from militia members. <P>

The hotbed for militia organizing within the Wise Use movement is the Counties Movement, which
insists that county sheriffs have the right to arrest federal land managers who fail to respect the
"customs and culture" of logging, mining and grazing on public lands.<P>

"They think ecosystem management is part of the New World Order," that will overrun the US, says Jere Payton, an
environmentalist in eastern Washington. Among some right-wing activists in the West, the guiding
belief is that land-use planning is a form of socialism. This assumption has resulted in the
targeting of unarmed environmentalists, land-use planners and federal employees of natural
resource agencies. The majority of militia-related incidents has involved people who, one way or
another, are associated with the environment.<P>

In Montana, where land-use planning has become the target of anti-environmental Wise Use activists, an opponent of a building-permit program told a
militia meeting, "When the hour strikes, there will be public officials dead in the street." <P>

In March, the US Forest Service office in Catron County, New Mexico, was painted with hammers and
sickles and the forest service office in Carson City was pipe-bombed. Seventeen months earlier, the
BLM offices in Reno were bombed during the Senate debate over grazing on public lands.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: The Media Militia: Behind the PR Curtain</TITLE>

<H1>The Media Militia: Behind the PR Curtain</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

The Earth Day edition of <CITE>PR Watch</CITE> [<I>Center for Media and Democracy, 3318 Gregory St., Madison,
WI 53711; (608) 233-3346</I>], which regularly features public-interest reporting on the public
relations industry, served up some tasty excerpts from the February 1995 edition of <CITE>O'Dwyer's PR
Services</CITE>, an influential industry newsletter.<P>

 "Relief is on the way for PR clients on the environmental front...." <CITE>O'Dwyer's</CITE> opined. "Green PR people are advised to ride the
Republican-fueled anti-environmental backlash wave as far as possible. But they should not be
greedy, because overreaching may come back to haunt them once the sun sets on the pro-business
Republicans and greenies are again on the rise." <P>

Michael Kehs, PR firm Burson-Marsteller's "environmental" chief, told <CITE>O'Dwyer's</CITE>: "[Following the Republican victory in the last election] the
business community enjoys the upper hand.... There is a new contract on the street. And although
the word 'environment' is never mentioned, many observers believe it's less a contract with
America than a 'contract on environmental busybodies'...." <CITE>O'Dwyer's</CITE> also echoed Kehs' caveat:
"Don't get your hopes up and don't appear greedy by complaining how much compliance with green
laws costs.... That could jeopardize years of good works and careful corporate positioning."<P>

According to <CITE>PR Watch</CITE>, market researchers have found that 75-95 percent of US citizens consider
themselves to be "green" and more than 20 million green Americans contribute time and money to
environmental organizations. However, when one leading PR firm asked business leaders to respond
to the statement "Overall, the quality of the environment in your country is improving," 99.9
percent of them agreed.<P>

In 1990 alone, US businesses spent an estimated $500 million on anti-environmental PR professionals and on "greenwashing" their corporate images. <CITE>O'Dwyers</CITE>
termed the environmental struggle "the life-and-death PR battle of the 1990s." <P>

According to <CITE>PR Watch</CITE>, the top ten corporate public-relations "greenwashers" are Burson-Marsteller (heading the
list with $17.9 million in income for 1993), Ketchum PR, Hill & Knowlton, Fleishman-Hillard,
Shandwick, E. Bruce Harrison Co., Edelman PR Worldwide, The Rowland Company, Pacific/West
Communications and Ruder Finn.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Activists at Risk in US and Abroad</TITLE>

<H1>Activists at Risk in US and Abroad</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

<H3>"If the troubles from environmentalists cannot be solved in the jury box or at the ballot box, perhaps the cartridge box should be used."<BR>
--Former Reagan Administration Interior Secretary James Watt (currently under federal indictment on corruption charges)</H3>

Twenty years after the mysterious murder of anti-nuclear whistleblower Karen Silkwood, attacks
on US environmentalists are on the rise. In addition to physical assaults, phone harassment and
death threats, eco-activists have also been shot at, raped, knifed and fire-bombed.<P>

 In his book, <CITE>The War Against the Greens</CITE> (Sierra Club Books, 1994), David Helvarg assembled a chilling list of
attacks on grassroots victims. Helvarg believes that anti-green violence "is much more serious in
the '90s than ever before," owing to the growing desperation of American workers who are losing
jobs and the promise of secure futures.<P>

 Helvarg's book records instances of drive-by shootings, firebombings and pet poisonings. Greens have been attacked by speeding autos, chainsaws, pistols
and, in the case of redwood defender Judi Bari, a car bomb that nearly killed her. <P>

Last September, Oregon Natural Resources Council executive director Andy Kerr and Hells Canyon Preservation
Council executive director Ric Bailey were hung in effigy in Joseph, Oregon. A sign attach-ed to the
tarred-and-feathered figures declared: "Enviros can learn a lot from a couple of dummies." The
public "hanging" was staged the day before a conference hosted by Wise Use movement co-founder
Ron Arnold. <P>

And it is no longer just green activists who are at risk. On May 9, Rep. George Miller (D-CA) accused Republican members of Congress of encouraging acts of violence against US Forest
Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) employees who are paid to "enforce laws
against resource abuse." Miller cited both House Speaker Newt Gingrich's claim that many people
have a "genuine fear" of government and Rep. Barbara Vuvanovich's (R-NV) warning to federal
officials: "This is Nevada -- people are armed."<P>

 "Offices of the BLM have been bombed, guns have been drawn on park rangers and agents of the Fish and Wildlife Ser-vice (FWS), and there have
been multiple direct threats of bloodshed against other public officials," Rep. Miller charged.<P>

 In response to Sen. Larry Craig's (R-ID) call to disarm federal enforcement officials, Miller pointed
out that these were the employees who were most at risk.<P>

 In October, 1994, Miller reported, a bomb exploded at the BLM office in Reno, Nevada, and in March, 1995, another bomb exploded at
the Carson City, Nevada forest service office. The manager of the Mal-heur National Wildlife Refuge
was threatened with death and his family harassed by anti-federal activists. In June 1994, bomb
threats and drawn guns halted a groundwater-assessment program on federal land in New Mexico.
An FWS employee in Reserve, New Mexico, was told his head "would be blown off" if he kept doing
his job. Road-building crews in the Toiyabe National Forest have ceased work because of threats
against their lives.<P>

 In Nevada, Richard Carver, a Nye County commissioner opposed to the regulation of grazing, mining and logging on public lands, personally bulldozed an illegal road
through public lands, as forest service personnel were held at bay by an armed posse of Carver's
supporters. <P>

Jeff DeBonis, a former forest ranger and founder of the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility says "one top forest service official recently told me he thought there
was a 50 percent chance of a forest service employee getting murdered this summer in either Idaho
or Nevada."<P>

 The situation for environmental workers outside the US serves as a warning of the direction this trend could take.<P>
 
 <UL>
 
 <LI>In Honduras, Jeannette Kawas' campaign against illegal logging in the Punta Sal National Park was cut short when she was murdered. Her killer remains at
large.
 
 <P><LI>In<A HREF="../gsc/costa.html"> Costa Rica</A>, ecologists Jaime Bustamante, Maria del Mar Cordero and Oscar Fallas-Baldi tried to stop construction of an industrial complex in the Golfo Dulce. They died when
their home went up in flames.

 <P><LI>In Cambodia, military police warned reporter Chan Dara to halt his investigations into the military's involvement in the timber trade. Two days later he was
found dead. 

<P><LI>In Nigeria, Ogoni land-rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, appearing physically battered, was transferred from prison to a military hospital to await a secret court hearing that
could hand down a death sentence (see story page 35.

<P><LI>In Mexico, dozens of Tarahumara Indians have been murdered by loggers and drug barons. Environmentalists helping the Tarahumara

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Millions Spent to Gas Rats, Dogs, Horses</TITLE>

<H1>Millions Spent to Gas Rats, Dogs, Horses</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

USA -- On April 20, a group of New Mexico environmentalists released a 14-page report,
<CITE>Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute: Hazardous to Your Health</CITE>, criticizing animal experiments
conducted at the ITRI facility at Kirtland Air Force Base near Albuquerque. <P>

"Millions of tax dollars are squandered at ITRI every year on gruesome experiments that take the lives of thousands of
animals," charged Pat Wolff, author of the Coalition for Research Ethics and Accountability's report
[<I>CREA, PO Box 11395, Albuquerque, NM 87192; (505) 281-0032</I>]. Wolff claimed that
"radioactive and toxic byproducts of those experiments have contaminated the air and water"
surrounding Albuquerque and have exposed workers to "hazardous substances and dangerous
working conditions."<P>

 Since 1951, ITRI has received $300 million for experiments that forced animals to inhale radioactive particles in a search for guidelines on human exposure risks. But,
according to veterinarian Stephen R. Kaufman, co-chair of the Medical Research Modernization
Committee [<I>MRMC, PO Box 2751, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163-2751</I>], "Studying
relatively high-dose radiation exposure on laboratory-bound, non-human animals cannot address
issues related to human radiation exposure." If the government were interested in determining the
impact of radiation on human health, Kaufman suggested, research funds should be spent to study
the "millions of people [who] have received (and continue to receive) low-level radiation exposure
from diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices. What we need," Kaufman stated, "is good public
health research, not ill-conceived animal 'model' studies."<P>

 CREA noted that ITRI subjected 10,000 dogs, guinea pigs, rats and primates to "inhalation" experiments in 1993 and received a $17
million government subsidy for continued research in fiscal year 1994. Citing "conflicts of
interest," CREA's investigations concluded that "certain individuals involved in directing and
funding work done at the Lovelace/ITRI facility may have a financial interest in industries that
produce or promote the toxic and radioactive materials being tested at ITRI."<P>

CREA has called for a Congressional investigation into the alleged conflicts of interest, as well as health and safety issues.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Trees Cut to Fund Military</TITLE>

<H1>Trees Cut to Fund Military</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

Between the first Earth Day in 1970 and the event's 25th anniversary, timber companies turned
20 million acres of pristine forests into timber and woodpulp.<P>

 Less than 30 million acres of the USA's original 1.04 billion forested acres survive today -- more than 97 percent of the forests
have been lost to human expansion.<P>

 Save America's Forests [<I>4 Liberty Court, SW, Washington, DC 20003; (202) 544-9219</I>] notes that more than 60 percent of the US Forest Service's annual
budget is used to liquidate national forests -- at the rate of 800,000 acres a year. At that rate of
timber-cutting, all remaining US forests would be gone in 38 years.<P>

 The one branch of the government that was successfully putting more trees into the ground was lopped off by the
Republican budget axe. The Office of Natural Resources Sales Assistance, with a budget of only $15
million a year and a team consisting of a half-dozen part-time employees in the Small Business
Administration, has managed to plant more than 23 million trees during the past several years.<P>

According to the Washington Post, the $15 million saved "will go to the Pentagon "for military
readiness."

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Militarizing the US Budget</TITLE>

<H1>Militarizing the US Budget</H1>

<H2>by Gar Smith</H2>

USA -- The NRA and the militia movement may get hot-collared and hysterical at the mere mention
of "gun control," but that is nothing compared to the heat the Pentagon can bring to bear on
politicians who want to control military spending.<P>

 "They want to take away our weapons!" is a rallying cry shared by the Pentagon, the NRA and the militias. However, according to the Campaign
for New Priorities [<I>CNP, 1601 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20015</I>], if the defense
budget were cut in half over the next five years, the US could still "sustain a military larger than
the armies of Britain, Germany, Japan and France combined... and maintain the most lethal nuclear
force in the world."In 1992, the combined military budgets of all the nations on the Pentagon's list
of "potential adversaries" (Russia, Iraq, China, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Cuba and Panama) was
$77.8 billion. The Pentagon's budget for 1992 totaled $270.9 billion. <P>

Last December, when President Clinton requested an additional $27.6 billion boost to the military budget to assure the
Pentagon's "readiness," the retired military officers at the Center for Defense Information [<I>1500
Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20005</I>] asked incredulously, "Ready for what?" CDI
director Vice Admiral Jack Shanahan (USN-ret.) has warned that "US military spending is out of
control." According to Shanahan, Washington is spending $5 billion a week on military expenses at
a time when "there are no real military threats to America's safety." <P>

While budgets for nutrition, health care, education and environmental protection are being savaged, CDI notes, "President
Clinton and the Congress have declared the military budget to be exempt from any cuts." CDI's
analysts have responded with a plan to maintain "a strong and adequate" US defense with a military
budget of $175 billion -- an annual savings of almost $96 billion.<P>

 The Pentagon's case was not helped by the revelation in late May that the Department of Defense was unable to explain an
"accounting gap" of $28.8 billion.<P>

<H2>Write Your own Budget</H2>

If you were president, what kind of a budget would you propose? Thanks to the Center for
Defense Information, anyone can now play Chief Executive. CDI has produced a two-page version of
the federal budget with the president's proposed spending, actual budget amounts for 1994, and a
blank column to be filled in by citizens. Clinton's proposed budget, devotes $264 billion to the
Pentagon $54 billion to education and $7 billion to pollution control. After filling out your budget,
CDI suggests that you mail copies to the House, Senate and the Oval Office.

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 95: Campaign Against Methyl Bromide</TITLE>

<H2>Campaign Against Methyl Bromide</H2>

<H1>Ozone-Killing Pesticide Opposed</H1>

Methyl bromide is a pesticide that is at least 50 times more destructive to the ozone layer, atom for
atom, than chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). In 1992, the United Nations estimated that the bromine
atoms released into the upper atmosphere by methyl bromide are responsible for five-to-ten
percent of global ozone depletion, a share that is expected to increase to 15 percent by the year
2000.<P>

 In 1994, the UN listed elimination of methyl bromide (MB) as the most significant remaining approach (after phase-out of CFCs and halons) to reducing ozone depletion. While CFCs
and halons can continue destroying ozone for decades, bromine atoms remain in the atmosphere for
less than two years. UN scientists conclude that eliminating MB emissions from agricultural,
structural and industrial activities by the year 2001 would achieve a 13 percent reduction in
ozone-depleting chemicals reaching the stratosphere over the next 50 years.<P>

 MB is extremely toxic and can cause acute and chronic health effects. Farmworkers, pesticide applicators and people living
or working  where MB is used can suffer poisoning, neurological damage and reproductive harm.
The chemical is so toxic to humans and animals that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
classifies it as a Category I acute toxin, the most deadly group of substances.<P>

 For 60 years, MB has been used to kill pests in soils and buildings, and on agricultural products. In 1991, the US
accounted for nearly 40 percent of the pesticide's worldwide use. Soil fumigation to sterilize soil
before planting crops is by far the largest use of MB in the US.<P>

 Worldwide, most MB is used for luxury and export crops, like tomatoes, strawberries, peppers, tobacco and nursery crops.<P>

<H3>Health Effects of Exposure</H3>

MB affects the central nervous system and damages lungs, kidneys, eyes and skin. Recovery from
the more severe symptoms of MB toxicity, such as pneumonia, severe weakness, paralysis and
heart problems, can take days to several months. Studies show that MB concentrations can drift
several miles from a site of fumigation, posing a threat to residents and workers who may be
exposed to the gas. But unlike some other pesticides, MB is believed to leave little or no residue on
most foods.<P>

Under the Clean Air Act the EPA has mandated a halt to MB production in and import to the US in 2001, but manufacturers and agricultural users have mounted a formidable campaign to
delay the ban. Because no gradual phaseout is required, methyl bromide can be used without major
restrictions until 2001. Since the act does not prohibit the use of existing stocks after 2001,
application of the pesticide can continue as long as stockpiled supplies last.<P>

 An MB tax -- like that imposed on other ozone-depleting chemicals -- should be required to pressure users and producers
to reduce their dependence on the compound and to stimulate the  shift to available alternatives
before the phaseout date. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that an MB tax could generate
nearly $1 billion over five years.<P>

 The Montreal Protocol, the principal international treaty on ozone-depleting substances, officially recognized MB as an ozone-depleting chemical in 1992, but
will not decide on an international phaseout until December, 1995. Resistance stems primarily
from countries with large MB producers and users, including the US, Israel, Japan and France.<P>

<H3>Methyl Bromide Alternatives</H3>

Numerous alternatives to MB exist, including organic soil additives, soil solarization, crop rotation
and biological pest control in farming. Controlled atmosphere techniques (using pest-suppressing
levels of nitrogen and CO2) and heat/cold treatments are proven alternatives on harvested crops
and in structures. In 1992, the US Defense Logistics Agency saved $2.8 million by using controlled
atmosphere to ship produce to troops.<P>

Several of the key pesticides proposed as MB replacements by the chemical industry pose known health risks. The soil fumigant 1,3-D (Telone) is considered a
probable human carcinogen by the EPA, while metam-sodium has been found to cause birth defects
in laboratory animals.<P>

 The Methyl Bromide Global Coalition (MBGC) -- a group of eight international MB users and producers -- has launched a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign to
keep the product on the market. In early 1994, members of the MBGC, along with the agribusiness
and chemical industries, sued EPA to stop the MB phaseout.<P>

 While some nations are actively fighting a phaseout, other countries have already banned or vigorously regulated MB. In 1992, the
Netherlands eliminated all soil fumigation using MB, and other countries, including Denmark,
Germany and Switzerland, are planning similar actions.<P>

 The Methyl Bromide Alternatives Network (MBAN), formed in 1993, is a coalition of 17 US environmental, agricultural and labor
organizations working to phase out and replace MB with affordable, environmentally sound
alternatives. MBAN is asking food manufacturers to switch to alternatives that do not deplete the
ozone layer, pressing the EPA to accelerate the MB phaseout and demanding that the Department of
Agriculture work to develop and promote alternatives. MBAN is also urging delegates to the
Montreal Protocol to sign a global MB phaseout agreement in December. <P>

<H2>Bromicidal Maniacs</H2>

A leaked document from the US chemical industry's Methyl Bromide Working Group (including
Ethyl Corp. and Great Lakes Chemical Corp., the country's major MB producers) has
environmentalists steamed. Unfazed by reports of record ozone depletion and the appearance of an
ozone hole over the North Pole, the MBWG's letter states: "If we continue to work together, we stand
an increasingly good chance of being able to use methyl bromide well beyond the year 2001." To do
so would violate the Clean Air Act. With MB bans likely in industrialized countries, there is intense
pressure to expand MB sales in Third World nations. <P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 94: The World According to Disney</TITLE>
<H1>The World According to Disney <I>by John Sterling</I></H1>
<H2><I>Trading in Fantasies</I></H2>
<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Summer 94<BR> Vol. 9 Issue 3<BR> p32+ <HR>

Few people would equate "Disney theme 
park" with "environmental threat." Most 
support Disney's wholesome brand of family 
entertainment because it offers people a 
respite from the stress of daily life. But 
Disney's friendly image has been under fire 
lately due to the financial woes of its Euro 
Disney park in France and over its current 
plans to build "Disney's America," an American 
history theme park, in rural Virginia. <P>

A careful look at Euro Disney and 
Disney's America reveals that the entertainment 
company is a surprising environmental 
enemy that covers open space with 
pavement, shopping malls, golf courses and 
hotels; creates traffic problems that increase 
air pollution; and encourages a psychological 
detachment from the natural world. Despite 
its environmental transgressions, 
Disney has received billions of dollars in 
bank loans and government subsidies to 
support its recent theme park projects.<P>

Kansas State University architecture professor 
Gary Coates is one of a growing number 
of professionals who have identified 
theme parks as inherent agents of environmental 
decline. "When we are in Disney 
World... we are inside someone else's story;
we cannot tell what is reality and what is 
not," said Coates in Jerry Mander's book, <I>In 
the Absence of the Sacred</I>. Coates argues that 
theme parks create a preprogrammed fantasy 
world that excludes nature's randomness 
and unpredictability. As such, these parks lead 
visitors to believe that an environment can 
be sustained within a vacuum controlled by 
technicians and engineers. 

<H2>Euro Disney's Failure</H2>

Walt Disney Co. is expanding its empire. 
Inspired by its successful Tokyo Disneyland, 
Disney borrowed $3.7 billion from 63 different 
banks, kicked in a paltry $220 million of 
its own cash, and built Euro Disney, a theme
park and hotel complex 20 miles east of 
Paris. Many French citizens protested the 
mere idea of Disney schlock on Gallic soil, 
but Euro Disney opened in April 1992-- 
and has been losing money ever since.<P>

Euro Disney is far more than rollercoasters 
and snack bars. Built on almost 5000 acres of 
sunflower and beet farmland, the complex 
includes a theme park, six hotels with a total 
of 5200 rooms, a convention center, swimming 
pools, tennis courts and an 18-hole 
golf course. Such a colossal operation requires 
an equally colossal attendance to remain 
afloat. With 11 million visitors a year, Euro 
Disney is now Europe's largest tourist attraction, 
but the park 
has consistently suffered 
a 45 percent 
hotel vacancy rate 
and per-visitor 
spending is 25 percent 
lower than expected, 
due in part 
to the ongoing recession. 
In addition, 
while warm sunshine 
graces its sibling 
parks in California 
and Florida, 
cold, rainy weather 
plagues Euro Disney. 
In its first fiscal year, Euro Disney lost $928 
million and it has surrendered $90 million in 
each quarter thereafter. <P>

In January 1994, 18 months after opening, 
Disney appealed to its creditors to rescue 
the project by the end of March, saying it 
might close the park, handing huge losses
to both the banks and the holders of 170
million shares of Euro Disney stock. The 
creditiors had little choice.<P>

After four months of negotiations, the 
banks and Disney agreed to pump another 
$1.05 billion into the ailing park. In addition, 
the banks agreed to waive 18 months 
of interest payments, worth $280 million, 
and to defer debt payments for three years. 
If a developing country defaulted on 
such a loan from the World Bank, that 
country would be cut off from any further 
foreign aid, claims Christina Cobourn, coordinator 
of the Campaign on Debt and Development 
Alternatives. But, with Euro Disney 
on the brink of bankruptcy, banks and shareholders, 
not Disney, had the most to lose. 
After the bailout, Euro Disney's stock plummeted 
to $5.60 a share, an 80 percent decline 
since its opening day high of $27.20. <P>

<H2>Disney's America</H2>

Unfazed by its European failure, Disney 
now plans to build "Disney's America", a 
theme park interpretation of American 
history, on 3000 acres of land near Virginia's 
Blue Ridge Mountains. Like Euro Disney, 
Disney's America would be built in a rural 
area within 30 miles of a major city (Washington 
DC). It would be a multi-purpose 
complex with a theme park, a 144-room 
hotel, a 27-hole golf course, 2500 private 
homes and two million square feet of office 
and retail space. Like Euro Disney, the setting 
is cold and wet for almost half the year. 
And, tempted by Disney's promise of 12,400 
new jobs, the Virginia legislature has committed 
$132 million to subsidize highway 
improvements that will principally benefit 
the park, not local citizens. The state will 
spend another $31 million to finance a joint 
Disney-Virginia advertising campaign, 
build a state visitor center on the park site 
and fund a community college program to 
train residents in the tourism industry.<P>


When Disney first announced its plans for 
Disney's America, opponents quickly objected, 
saying that an amusement park 
could not accurately depict American history. 
According to Disney's designers, the 
park would be divided into seven theme 
areas, each recreating a major historical 
event with a Disney twist. "'Native America' 
explores the life of America's first inhabitants 
and offers an exciting white-water river 
raft expedition," said a November 1993 
Disney press release. The company did not 
say whether "Native America" would also 
reenact the Trail of Tears or Custer's slaughter 
of the Plains Indians. Other themes include 
a Civil War fort in which the battle of 
the Monitor and the Merrimac will be recreated; 
a replica of Ellis Island intended to 
illustrate the immigrant experience; and 
"Enterprise, a factory town [that] highlights 
American ingenuity and features a high 
speed thrill attraction called the 'Industrial 
Revolution,'" said the press release.<P>

If charges of historical inaccuracy do not halt 
Disney's America, the park's potential environmental 
impact might. Bob Leuthy, a 
board member of Protect, a citizens' group 
based in Haymarket, VA, claims that 
Disney's America threatens the overall quality 
of life in Prince William County."Quality 
of life is an environmental issue. If 
Disney's America is built, bungee jumping, 
go-carts, shopping malls and every conceivable 
variety of commercial garbage will be 
clamoring to get in," said Leuthy. <P>

Environmentalists claim that increased 
automobile traffic would be the principal 
problem posed by Disney's America. Disney 
estimates that the park would generate 77,000 
new vehicle trips per day in Prince William 
County, doubling the average daily 
traffic on Interstate 66, the road linking 
the site to Washington DC. Congestion 
would be even worse during the peak 
hour when I-66 traffic would jump from 
1260 to 5753 vehicles, according to a study 
conducted by traffic expert Robert Morris. <P>

A coalition of eight groups, headed by 
the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), 
has urged that road improvements for 
Disney's America be stopped, because the 
increased traffic would make it impossible 
for the Washington region to comply with 
new federal clean air laws. "This kind of 
auto-dependent sprawl will pull development 
away from already developed areas," 
said Michael Replogle, co-director of EDF's 
transportation project. "It's a foolish 
location for a major new edge city."<P>

The Clean Air Act of 1990 prohibits 
a region from building new roads 
if the increased traffic would push 
air pollution levels beyond established 
limits. The Washington region, 
which includes northern Virginia, 
is already unable to comply 
with air-pollution regulations and 
is seeking ways to reduce vehicle 
emissions. With over two million 
new vehicle trips created by the 
Disney project each month, region-wide 
pollution levels could only rise. 
The Federal Highway Administration, 
which must authorize the 
Disney-related road improvements already 
approved by the Virginia legislature, has 
the power to require an environmental review 
of the construction. <P>

In April, after winning legislative 
approval for road improvements, Disney 
floated the idea of building a power plant 
on the park site. Disney, which built 
its own plant at Disney World in Florida, 
needs an estimated 12 megawatts per day 
to supply Disney's America with power. 
Though company officials did not offer 
details on the idea, Stan Feuerberg, 
president of the Northern Virginia Electrical 
Cooperative, said a Disney generator 
would probably run on natural gas, adding 
another clean-air threat to the park's plans. <P>

A 12-megawatt plant could release 180 
tons of nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide 
into the air each year, estimated Rod 
Villanueva, an engineer with Pacific Gas 
and Electric. Building a power plant would 
likely fuel the tensions between Disney and 
the residents of Northern Virginia. "When 
it comes to air pollution at the expense of 
everyone else, [Disney] shouldn't be allowed 
to do it," said Ellen Penar, spokesperson 
for the Coalition of Gainesville District 
Residents (CGDR), a community group. <P>

<H2>"Betther Than  New" Wetlands</H2>

Environmental groups are also concerned 
about Disney's impact on the region's 
aquatic ecosystems. Included in the 
Disney's America proposal is a controversial 
plan to build a 28-acre artificial wetland 
on the park site. 

Called a "wetland mitigation bank" (one 
of about 100 nationwide), would 
require the approval of the Army Corps of 
Engineers and the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA). According to a Corps 
spokesperson, such mitigation measures 
give their owners "wetland credits" that 
they may draw on to build on natural wetlands 
elsewhere. Protect attorney Robert 
Elliott filed a lawsuit in March to prevent 
the Corps and the EPA from approving the 
artificial wetland until Disney releases more 
specific building plans that may reveal 
natural wetland destruction elsewhere 
on the Disney site. The suit was settled in 
May after Disney agreed to detail its plans. 
"Any large development will impact natural 
wetlands," said engineer Mike Rolband, 
Disney's wetland consultant. Rolband 
claims that the artificial wetland will be an 
improvement on the site's natural wetlands, 
which have already been degraded 
by decades of grazing and farming.<P>

In a separate lawsuit, Protect claims that 
Disney connived to undermine a tough state 
conservation law to ease building restrictions 
on the proposed artificial wetland 
area. Before releasing its development 
plans, Disney asked the US Geological Survey 
(USGS) to downgrade the protected 
status of a stream on the site because it did 
not flow year round. Such streams are not 
protected by the Chesapeake Bay Preservation 
Act, which prohibits land development 
within 100 feet of streams. Protect's 
Elliott argues that the USGS approved the 
downgrade without adequate information 
about what was planned for the site.<P>

<H2>Disney's Magic: New Jobs?</H2>

As it did in Europe, Disney has successfully 
pushed Disney's America by promising a 
flood of new jobs and tax revenues. Virginia 
Governor George Allen, tempted by 
Disney's estimate of 12,000 additional jobs 
and $40 million in annual tax revenues, predicted 
that Disney's America "will be the envy of 
the entire nation." But CGDR's Penar 
warned that, after the park is built, the 
majority of Disney jobs would be low-paying 
and seasonal. Disney has said that it 
would pay roughly 30 percent above minimum 
wage, or $5.27 per hour, according to 
Penar. She added that because Prince William 
County has one of the lowest unemployment 
rates in the country (only 
three percent), Disney would have 
to import workers to fill openings. 
Penar is concerned that, if the park 
closes for the winter, the flood of 
low-income workers would likely 
collect unemployment during the 
off season. "These are not jobs to 
build an economy on," said 
Protect's Bob Leuthy. <P>

Disney's opponents in Virginia 
have learned that it is hard to fight 
a major corporation with a gleaming 
public image. "Who in the hell 
is going to challenge Goofy, Mickey
and Snow White?" said Leuthy. 
Disney has used this clean image to 
win support for risky commercial 
developments worldwide. In the wake of 
the Euro Disney fiasco, Disney is now asking 
rural Virginians to subsidize a venture 
that could harm the region's environment 
and permanently lower the residents' quality 
of life. 

<I>Washington Post</I> columnist Rudolph Pyatt 
called the Virginia legislature's decision to 
offer the project $163 million in improvements 
a "corporate welfare plan for Disney." 
Environmentalists agree, and hope to stop 
Disney's America by revealing the absurdity 
of offering millions of dollars to a 
wealthy corporation to help it build an environmentally 
destructive project that offers 
only speculative benefits.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 94: Natural resources and an optimum human population.</TITLE>

<H1>Natural resources and an optimum human population.<P> <I>By Pimentel, David, et al.</I></H1>

<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Summer 94<BR> Vol. 9 Issue 3<BR> p26+ <HR>

According to the Washington, DC-based 
Population Crisis Committee, the world's 
human population, currently more than 
5.5 billion, is projected to reach nearly 8.4 
billion by the year 2025 and may reach a 
disastrous 15 billion by 2100. There are now 
1.2-2 billion people living in poverty -- 
malnourished, diseased and experiencing 
short life spans.<P>

The Population Reference Bureau estimates 
that the average American consumes 
about 23 times more goods and 
services than the average world citizen. 
Americans also bum 10,000 liters (2600 gallons) 
of oil-equivalents per year -- seven 
times the world average. Clearly, achieving 
a US standard of living is impossible 
for the rest of the world, based both on 
projections of future resource availability 
and on population growth. 
The affluent standard of living now enjoyed 
by Americans (made possible by our 
abundant supplies of fertile cropland, water 
and fossil energy) is projected to decline 
if the US population doubles during the 
next 63 years.<P>

If the US were to move quickly to a renewable 
energy economy, with sustainable 
use of energy, land, water and biodiversity, 
and a relatively high standard of living, our 
research indicates that the optimum US 
population would be about 200 million, 
significantly less than the current population 
of 256 million.<P>

<H2>Math for a Small Planet</H2>

Approximately 0.5 hectares (1.25 acres) of 
cropland is needed to provide one person 
with a diverse, nutritious diet of plant and 
animal products. The US supply of crop-land 
is at this level now, but the world 
average is only 0.28hectares (.69 acres). 
Each year, more than ten million hectares 
(24.7 million acres) of once-productive land 
are degraded and abandoned. Simultaneously, 
an additional 5 million hectares 
(12.3 million acres) of new land must be put 
into production to feed the 92 million humans 
added yearly to the world population. 
Most of this 15 million hectares 
needed for expansion comes from the destruction 
of the world's forests. The urgent 
need for agricultural land accounts for 80 
percent of the deforestation now occurring 
worldwide.<P>

Humans do not have any technologies 
that can substitute for the services provided 
by wild biota. In the US, there are 
approximately 500,000 species of plants, 
animals and microbes that provide essential 
functions (pollinating crops, recycling 
manure, purifying water and soil) and 
serve as a vital reservoir of genetic material. 
Yet the world is losing roughly 150 
species per day from such human activities 
as deforestation, pollution, pesticide 
application and urbanization. In his 
book, <I>Fundamentals of Ecology</I>, E. P. Odum 
reports that, if sufficient natural biological 
diversity is to be maintained to ensure a 
quality environment, about one-third 
of the terrestrial ecosystem should be 
preserved as natural vegetation.<P>

<H2>Limits to Solar Energy Growth</H2>

The United Nations Environment Program 
estimates that the US accounts for approximately 
25 percent of the world's annual 
consumption of fossil fuels. All other developed 
nations combined use another 55 percent 
and developing nations, with approximately 
75 percent of the world's population, 
consume only 20 percent.<P>

In 1991, US Department of Energy estimates 
of national oil reserves plummeted. 
Instead of the 35-year supply forecasted in 
1987, reserve predictions were lowered to 
10-13 years at 1991 pumping rates.<P>

In 1850, when its population was only 23 
million, the US was dependent on wood 
biomass (a form of solar energy) for 91 
percent of its energy. Today, we depend on 
fossil fuels for 93 percent of our energy 
needs. With the imminent decline in fossil-fuel 
supplies, a transition should be made 
to renewable energy sources.<P>

In the US, the annual amount of solar 
energy captured by vegetation -- agricultural 
crops, forests, lawns, gardens and wild 
growth -- is 54 quads (one quad equals one 
quadrillion British Thermal Units). Americans 
currently use 40 percent more fossil 
energy than the total amount of solar energy 
captured by plants.<P>

Although the conversion of biomass 
crops, like corn, into fuel energy appears 
promising at first glance, 72 percent more 
energy is used in the production of ethanol 
than the energy it provides. Furthermore, 
the land area needed to provide the raw 
material is enormous; about six hectares 
(15 acres) of corn grain is needed to provide 
the ethanol fuel for one US car for one year.<P>

Providing one billion kwh of solar 
power to a city of 100,000 for a year would 
require 2700 hectares (6669 acres). Only 
ten percent of the needed area could be 
supplied by mounting photovoltaic units 
on the roofs of buildings.<P>

If the current level of seven quads of 
solar energy collected and used annually 
in the US could be increased five-fold 
without adversely affecting agriculture, 
forestry or the environment, these 35 
quads would still represent only about 40 
percent of the current US energy consumption. 
Producing this 35 quads would require 
90 million hectares (222 million acres) 
or nearly ten percent of US land area.<P>

Worldwide, if 500-600 million hectares 
(1235-1482 million acres) were devoted to 
solar energy production, approximately 200 
quads of energy might be available each 
year, while maintaining agricultural and 
forestry production. This is roughly two-thirds 
of the total annual world use of 
solar and fossil fuels combined -- 369 quads.<P>

Combined with active conservation efforts, 
a satisfactory standard of living would 
be possible for everyone, but only if the 
human population were much smaller than 
the present 5.5 billion.<P>

Assuming that 0.5 hectare per capita is 
necessary for an adequate food supply, and 
assuming that soil conservation programs 
were implemented to counteract erosion, 
it would be possible to sustain a global 
population of approximately 3 billion.<P>
 
Alternatively, with a self-sustaining renewable 
energy system producing 200 
quads of energy per year and providing 
each person with 5000 liters (1300 gallons) 
of oil-equivalents per year (half the current 
US consumption, but an increase for most 
people in the world), a population of 1-2 
billion could be supported in relative prosperity. 
This adjustment could be made over
 a century or more.<P>

Granted, such a drastic demographic adjustment 
will cause serious social, economic 
and political problems, but to continue rapid 
population growth will result in more severe 
social, economic and political conflicts, 
plus catastrophic public-health and environmental 
problems.<P>

Does human society want 10-15 billion 
humans living in poverty or 1-2 billion living 
with abundant resources? Dealing with 
the imbalance of the population-resource 
equation before it reaches a crisis level is the 
only way to avert a real tragedy for our 
children's children. Citizens of the US and 
the world must support their leaders in 
making these critical decisions for the future. 
To do nothing to control population is 
to condemn future humans to a lifetime of 
absolute poverty, suffering, starvation, disease 
and violence.<P>

Based on past experience, we expect that 
leaders will continue to postpone decisions 
on the human carrying capacity of the 
world until the situation becomes intolerable 
or, worse, irreversible. Nature will 
impose the ultimate control on the human 
population.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 94: The dilemma of Indian forestry.</TITLE>

<H1>The dilemma of Indian forestry.<I>By Winona LaDuke.</I></H1>

<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Summer 94<BR> Vol. 9 Issue 3<BR> p26+ <HR>

Leroy Jackson, a Dine (Navajo) man from 
Arizona who had dedicated much of his 
life to protecting the Chuska Mountain 
forests on the Navajo reservation, died 
mysteriously last fall. His body was found 
in his van after he disappeared during a 
business trip to northern New Mexico.<P>

In 1991, Jackson began a crusade to protect 
Navajo forests from overcutting, 
spearheading the efforts of Dine Citizens 
Against Ruining our Environment (Dine 
CARE). The group attempted to negotiate 
with the Dine Nation's tribal-owned logging 
enterprise, Navajo Forest Products 
Industry (NFPI), to manage the Chuska 
Mountain forests, home to many old-growth 
trees, more responsibly. Dine CARE 
was particularly opposed to logging in 
Navajo <A HREF="../slfp/sacredla.html">sacred</A> and cultural areas like the 
Chuska Mountains, which represent the 
male deityof the Dine religion.<P>

When negotiations failed between Dine CARE 
and the Dine Nation, Jackson reluctantly 
undertook a legal challenge to compel 
the tribe to comply with national 
environmental-forestry standards. When he 
died, Jackson was three days away from 
flying to Washington, DC to meet with 
the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to argue 
against a proposed policy that would have 
exempted the Dine Nation from logging 
prohibitions designed to protect the Mexican 
spotted owl, a species that was 
listed as threatened under the Endangered 
Species Act (ESA) in 1993. At the 
time of Jackson's death, Dine CARE was 
preparing to propose an integrated forestry 
management plan, based on 
sustainable and culturally sensitive harvesting 
practices, and on reforestation, to replace 
the Dine Tribal Council's plan.<P>

He never made it to Washington, 
prompting some of his supporters to speculate 
that he might have fallen victim 
to foul play in the often divisive debate 
over reservation logging.<P>

Neither the police investigation nor a 
private detective hired by Jackson supporters 
has been able to substantiate suspicions 
of murder, however. The coroner's report 
attributed his death to an accidental overdose 
of methadone, although Jackson's 
friends and family say that he never used 
illegal drugs.<P>

<H2>Managing Indian Forests</H2>

If successful, the struggle that Jackson left 
behind could reform the entire US government 
policy regulating logging on Indian 
land. The Navajo tribal dispute highlights 
the conflicts in Indian forestry, particularly 
the internal battle on many reservations 
between economic pressures and 
traditional cultural practices and values. 
On the Dine reservation, as elsewhere in 
North America, these struggles will play 
out with increasing intensity as the value 
of Indian timber in a shrinking market 
adds new pressures to the ecology and 
cultural fabric of Indian Country.<P>

Much of North America's remaining forests 
are found on Native land, all of which 
appear to be up for grabs. Last summer, the 
Clinton administration announced a plan 
to provide "federal assistance to bring to 
market backlogged timber sales from Indian 
reservations." Some Native activists 
have called this the Clinton administration's 
"equal-opportunity logging 
policy." Terry Virdon, Assistant Director of 
BIA Forestry, has remarked that 
"the Clinton administration and federal 
government have always looked to tribal 
timber as 'their reserves.' They basically 
say, 'We'll carry on business as usual and 
have those [trees] for later....'" According to 
the BIA, US Indian reservations contain an 
estimated 56 billion board feet of timber on 
some 15 million acres of Native forests 
and woodlands.<P>

Make no mistake: this is a battle about 
deforestation and cultural transformation. 
Throughout Indian country, lines will be 
drawn and ecosystems maybe transformed. 
Tribal sovereignty issues are surfacing in 
the conflict as tribes decide whether to 
exercise their rights to cut their old-growth 
forests, even if it circumvents the ESA 
protection for northern and Mexican species 
of spotted owls (a proposal forwarded 
by both Northwestern and Southwestern 
tribes). On the other hand, Native nations 
could decide to use their tribal sovereignty 
to build sustainable forestry programs based 
on cultural and ecosystem management. 
Both scenarios are possible and are currently 
being played out on US reservations.<P>

<H2>Dine forests</H2>

The Navajo Forest Products Industry 
(NFPI) was formed in 1958 on the advice of 
BIA consultants. By 1963, NFPI was operating 
the largest lumber mill in the Southwest. 
Over the years, NFPI borrowed 
heavily to re-tool its plant for smaller trees, 
since so much of the reservation's old 
growth had been cut, even though the lumber 
market was diminishing. By the early 
1980s, NFPI had become mired in debt. By 
the end of 1993, NFPI was almost $8 million 
in debt to the tribe.<P>

The environmental impact of logging on 
the Dine reservation has been significant. 
The tribe did no replanting from 1880 to 
1975. In 1981, the tribe's forestry department 
estimated that it would take 160 years 
of concerted regeneration to return the 
forests to a condition capable of supporting 
sustainable-yield harvests. After reviewing 
tribal records, Jackson concluded 
that NFPI had greatly overcut the Chuska 
Mountain forests and badly mismanaged 
its finances.<P>

Disturbed by NFPI's perceived mismanagement, 
Dine CARE demanded a reduction 
in logging, an independent audit of 
the operation and an environmental impact 
statement (EIS) on the tribe's Chuska 
Mountain logging plan -- all of which the 
Tribal Council refused.<P>

In the process of defending Navajo forests, 
Dine CARE and Jackson made some 
enemies. The group's activism had forced 
NFPI to reduce its harvests by more than 
half. Last summer, angry Dine loggers 
hanged Jackson in effigy, blaming him 
and his organization for layoffs at NFPI. 
However, George Arthur, a member of the 
tribe's economic development board, admitted 
that was "mismanagement rather 
than environmentalists" that led to a portion 
of the layoffs from 1991.<P>

The BIA plays a significant role in the 
management of Indian forests. All reservation 
timber-harvest plans must be approved 
by the agency, which is also responsible for 
monitoring the cuts. The BIA considers Indian 
lands exempt from such national environmental 
laws as the ESA, because reservations 
are technically sovereign nations. 
In fact, the agency seems intent on increasing 
reservation logging and has never required 
an EIS for timber harvests. Dine 
CARE argued that BIA forestry practices 
are based on "industrial models" that do 
not reflect traditional culture and represent 
only pro-development segments of 
the Navajo community.<P>

Building on its earlier success in proposing 
the circumvention of the ESA on the 
Navajo and some other Southwestern reservations 
(the Mescalero, White Mountain, 
and San Carlos Apache; and the Hualapai), 
the BIA is seeking to follow suit on the 
Quinalt and Coquille Indian reservations 
in the Northwest to secure exemptions 
from the ESA's protection of northern 
spotted owl habitat.<P>

 It is a tribute to Jackson's life that since his 
 death Dine CARE has accomplished much 
 of what he was trying to achieve. The Navajo 
 Tribal Council has decided to conduct 
 an audit of NFPI and has agreed to an EIS 
 on its logging plan -- a first for an Indian 
 reservation. The US Fish and Wildlife Service 
 has also ruled that the Navajos cannot 
 ignore regulations protecting the Mexican 
 spotted owl.<P>

<H2>Seventh-Generation Forestry</H2>

Successful stewardship models for native 
forestry do exist. The only Indian forest 
certified as sustainable in the US is on the 
Menominee Indian reservation in a largely 
clearcut region of northeastern Wisconsin. 
The Menominee forestry program is verified 
by Scientific Certification Systems, an 
independent environmental certification 
company. Early timber records indicate 
that approximately 1.5 billion board feet 
stood on the Menominee reservation in 1865. 
Since that first estimate, roughly two billion 
board feet have been cut. Even so, according 
to a 1980 tribal inventory, there were 
still 1.5 billion board feet of timber suitable 
for logging -- the same volume of trees 
after more than a century of harvesting the 
same land.<P>

The tribal corporation, Menominee Tribal 
Enterprises, has carefully crafted a management 
plan based on the sustainable and 
intensive management of its forests. The 
system involves computerized assessments 
and inventories for some 109 different logging 
areas on the reservation. With an eye 
to the cultural and spiritual needs of the 
MenOminee, more than 220,000 acres are 
currently under sustainable management, 
serving as the resource base for the 
Menominee Tribal Enterprises sawmill 
and employing one-third of all those 
working on the reservation. Sustainable 
timber management on the Menominee 
reservation has survived for more than a 
century and is viewed as a model for the 
seventh generation.<P>

The Grand Portage Ojibwe (Anishinabe) 
reservation, nestled at the tip of Lake Superior, 
has a similar story. All 56,000 acres of 
the reservation are wooded and support a 
chipping mill and a pallet mill, allowing the 
tribe to capture added value for its timber.<P>

"In 1985," tribal forester Rick Novinsky 
recalls, "the BIA wanted to upgrade the 
forest management plan and... came up 
with its forest management planning staff 
from the central office.... When they got 
here, we wanted to do something completely 
different [from] what they wanted 
to do. We wanted to look at things in a 
holistic way -- timber, recreation, aquatic 
life, wildlife, resources -- and manage each 
one with the others in mind. We ended up 
[using] that plan and it turned out to be 
the first integrated forest resource management 
plan approved by the BIA."<P>

The Ojibwe forestry program sets aside 
land into distinct designations -- recreation, 
wildlife and forestry -- and designs 
a management program based on the reality 
that there are more moose than people 
in the county. When approached by timber 
interests to expand its mill capacity and 
double its shifts, the Grand Portage Tribal 
Council pointed out that the reservation 
already had almost full employment and 
that upping the capacity of the mill would 
only require it to import a non-Indian 
labor force.<P>

There is much to be learned from native 
forest management experience. There are 
also larger discussions in which Native 
people need to be heard. For instance, a 
good portion of North American wood 
leaves the continent as raw product. Neither 
Indians nor any other timber-dependent 
communities capture many "value-added" 
benefits of milling, woodworking 
or other income-generating activities -- 
the profits and the supplementary jobs go 
elsewhere.<P>

For over 100 years, native people have 
fought to protect their 
forests, their medicinal plants, animal relations and the 
knowledge of generations of ancestors. 
There are many who will argue that Indians 
<I>are</I> those forests. Now they need to 
face those challenges in their communities 
with the honesty and courage that their 
ancestors had. Perhaps a Costa Rican Indigenous 
leader summarized it best, saying, 
"The difference between a white man and 
an Indian is this: a White man wants to 
leave money to his children. An Indian 
wants to leave forests...." Leroy Jackson 
would probably agree.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 94: GATT threatens US environment.</TITLE>

<H1>GATT threatens US environment.</H1>

<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Summer 94<BR> Vol. 9 Issue 3<BR> p26+ <HR>

<H2><I>Congress Considers Critical Vote</I></H2>

The foremost test of any proposed international 
agreement should be whether it 
damages democracy or unduly limits legitimate 
sovereignty. The World Trade Organization 
(WTO), established during the 
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations, 
fails these two tests. The WTO is an international 
autocratic regime that subordinates 
non-commercial standards and policies 
such as health, safety and workplace conditions 
to the dictates of international trade 
priorities.<P>

This transnational agenda suits global 
corporations because it transfers power 
away from accountable democratic constituencies
 and procedures. To corporations acting 
 on the global level, citizens acting at the 
 local, state and national levels have become 
 too much of a hindrance. The WTO would 
 greatly reduce citizen involvement in matters 
 of commerce. Large corporations can 
 deeply influence the WTO, its tribunals 
 and committees; citizens cannot.<P>

In the US, citizen advocacy to protect public 
health, safety and the environment 
has made considerable progress in recent 
decades despite the opposition of multinational 
companies. This achievement has 
been possible due to a number of democratic 
tools, such as the right to information, the 
right to petition, the right to appeal rulings 
and to elect or defeat lawmakers.<P>

The WTO hurls autocracy against this 
democracy. If this trade agreement is approved, 
the WTO's bureaucrats would have 
the power to force the US Congress, 
and state or local governments, to change laws 
or else to face economic sanctions.<P>

Laws at risk because of the finalization of 
GATT include such vital consumer and environmental 
provisions as state recycling 
programs, the US asbestos ban, the US 
Delaney clause prohibiting cancer-causing 
additives in food, US efforts to restrict the 
export of raw logs, US fuel-economy standards 
for cars, food-labeling rules, US laws 
designed to protect <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">dolphins</A>, and state bans 
on the controversial bovine growth hormone 
(BGH) used on dairy cows. Workplace 
safety standards would also be at risk.<P>

Under the WTO's rules, these protective 
measures could be defined as "non-tariff 
trade barriers." The rationale is that anything 
that interferes with a corporation's 
ability to sell products -- even dangerous 
products -- to consumers in nations with 
strong health, safety and environmental laws 
could be considered a barrier to trade.<P>

<H2>How the WTO Would Work</H2>

Proposition 65 is a California law passed in 
1986 by popular referendum that mandates 
the labeling of consumer products containing 
cancer-causing chemicals. As a result of 
GATT, any nation wanting to export products 
containing these dangerous chemicals 
to California without such labeling could 
appeal to the WTO.<P>

An official from the US Trade Representative's 
Office in Washington, DC, would 
then have to travel to Geneva to defend the 
state's law before a tribunal of three unelected 
trade specialists. These tribunal judges 
would be nominated by the 119 GATT signatory 
nations, but chosen by the WTO. The 
judges would likely be from other nations 
and would need no knowledge of California 
law or food safety to be appointed to the 
case. The WTO's tribunal has no conflict-of-interest 
provisions, so panelists could have 
an interest in the cases that they review.<P>

The tribunal would hear cases in secret. 
No one from the press, public or state government 
would be allowed to hear the 
tribunal's proceedings or to participate -- 
even as a friend of the court. Records from 
the tribunal would not be made public. US 
citizens would never know what the trade 
representative said to this court, or the 
questions raised by the judges. Thus, US 
officials and those of other countries would 
remain publicly unaccountable.<P>

If the WTO decided against a state's law, 
the US federal government would then be 
required to do everything in its authority -- 
including, for example, cutting off highway 
funds -- to force the state to comply. If a 
state did not change its law, the US would 
have to pay perpetual economic sanctions to 
the WTO. There would be no appeal to any 
outside body or higher court.<P>

Under the WTO, new international food-safety 
and agricultural standards would be 
set by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, 
a Rome-based subgroup of the United Nations 
Food and Agriculture Organization 
that is heavily influenced by the food and 
agribusiness industries. A recent study of 
the National Food Alliance in the United 
Kingdom found that 660 industry representatives 
participated on Codex committees, 
compared to 26 representatives of the public-interest 
community. Many Codex standards 
are weaker than those of the US. A 
1992 study by the US Government Accounting 
Office found that Codex standards for 
cancer-causing residues in foods were 
weaker than US standards in more than 50 
percent of the instances.<P>

The WTO also demands that all food 
safety, environmental, workplace and consumer 
standards be the "least trade restrictive." 
This would inherently threaten 
bans on dangerous products because any 
ban is automatically "trade restrictive."<P>

<H2>The World According to GATT</H2>

In its first 40 years, GATT concerned itself 
primarily with trade tariffs and related 
matters. In 1986, when the so-called "Uruguay 
Round" of GATT negotiations began, 
the scope of the agreement changed.<P>

During the "Uruguay Round," multinational 
corporations asserted their goal of 
investing anywhere in the world without 
restrictions. Environmental and safety 
standards were "harmonized" to facilitate 
international trade. Monopoly rights governing 
global ownership of intellectual 
property (patents, copyrights and trademarks) 
became entrenched. Transnational 
and government representatives also asked 
that food, agriculture and services (banking, 
insurance, shipping, etc.) be included 
under GATT. Finally, they created the WTO 
to enhance GATT's power over each participating 
country.<P>

While citizens were excluded during the 
past several years of GATT negotiations, 
corporate lobbyists cruising the halls outside 
the negotiating rooms in Geneva were 
able to exert tremendous influence over the 
negotiations. Citizen groups, lacking the 
resources or contacts to post lobbyists in Geneva, 
have not been able to play a parallel role.<P>

In a March 1994 speech in New York 
City, then-Director General of GATT, 
Irishman Peter Sutherland, declared that 
"Governments should interfere in the conduct 
of trade as little as possible" -- a sentiment 
shared by officials of the largest multinational 
corporations.<P>

Unfortunately for Americans, the "conduct 
of trade" issue includes concerns like:<P>

<UL>

<LI> Can the US ban asbestos? <BR>(Foreign asbestos 
exporters see such a ban as a "trade barrier.")<P>

<LI> Can the US maintain fuel-economy standards 
for cars sold in this country? <BR>(Makers 
of some European gas-guzzlers, like Mercedes 
Benz and BMW, call this an "unfair trade barrier.")<P>

<LI> Can the US defend the part of the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act that protects dolphins ? <BR>(Foreign tuna producers whose fishing 
methods kill large numbers of dolphins 
claim the US <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">"dolphin-safe" conservation</A> laws discriminate 
against their imports.)

</UL>

The WTO would create a regulatory climate 
that would inhibit future progress in 
environmental and consumer protection. 
Under the WTO, such protections would be 
diminished towards an internationally lower 
common denominator. Domestic standards 
deemed "too strong" could be challenged 
as trade restrictions. Standards deemed "too 
low," however, could not be challenged.<P>

Consumer groups already have enough 
problems dealing with wealthy corporate 
lobbyists and their politicians in Washington 
without being told that decisions are 
increasingly going to be made by other countries, 
other officials and other lobbies that 
have no accountability or disclosure requirements 
in the US. The WTO would establish 
an international autocratic structure over 
the US federal and constitutional systems 
that could make a mockery out of self-determination 
and legitimate sovereignty.<P>

If Congress approves the GATT, people in 
Los Angeles or Chicago who want to push 
for safer food, pollution controls and safer 
cars will hear from their Washington representatives 
and from corporate lobbyists, 
"Sorry, but the Japanese won't stand for it. 
The French won't stand for it."<P>

Both the US House of Representatives 
and the Senate must approve the Uruguay 
Round of GATT before it takes effect. The 
vote could come as early as this summer. 
Congress can only vote it up or down -- no 
amendments are permitted under the trade 
agreement procedures. Fortunately, Congress 
can still decide to keep the US out of 
the proposed WTO. The power to move 
Congress to reject this harmful trade agreement 
is in the hands of citizens. With most 
Fortune 500 companies poised to spend 
millions of dollars to lobby for passage of 
this agreement, citizens need to flood congressional 
offices by phone, fax, mail and 
telegram. Congress must know that we will 
not give up our right to set our own laws, 
nor will we tolerate having to pay a ransom 
to keep our laws.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 94: The constitution's 'green' secret.</TITLE>

<H1>The constitution's 'green' secret.<I>By Michael Diamond.</I></H1>

<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Summer 94<BR> Vol. 9 Issue 3<BR> p26+ <HR>

At the Constitutional Convention held in
Philadelphia during the summer of 1787,
 few delegates disagreed with Alexander
  Hamilton's assessment that' "men were
   ambitious, vindictive and rapacious." Del
egates considered domestic dangers to be
 "more alarming than the arms and arts of
  foreign nations." In the intervening centu
 ries, environmental shortsightedness and
  misplaced self-interest have joined to cre
  ate unprecedented threats of harm to the human species.<P>

The framers of the Constitution not only
 foresaw the root cause of our problem, but
  also provided an effective means for its
   cure: Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitu
   tion, which states: <I>"The United States shall
 guarantee to every State in this Union a Repub
 lican form of government, and shall protect each
  of them against invasion; and on application of
   the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the
    Legislature cannot be convened), against do
    mestic violence."</I><P>

The harm that we have done and are
 doing to ourselves by carelessness and in
 difference to the environment has brought
  about a condition of "domestic violence."<P>

Environmental contamination has poi
soned air, water, soil and food supplies in
ways that are analogous to acts of sabotage
or war. These incidents have resulted in
loss of long-term resources (e.g., aquifers 
and  forest ecosystems) and damage to private property. People have died as a result
of exposure to toxic and carcinogenic com
pounds in their environments. Individual
health, well-being, human potential and
even intellectual capacity have been put at
risk by those exposures. (The US Supreme Court
has deemed the phrase "each of them"
in Section 4 to include citizens of the various
states.)<P>

The framers clearly intended the term
 "domestic violence" to refer generally to
the infliction of harm or injury to persons
or property on a broad-enough scale to
threaten survival. On August 30, 1787, a motion 
was made to strike out "domestic
violence" and insert in its place the term
"insurrections." That motion was defeated.
"Violence" was clearly intended to mean
more than just rebellions or forms of physical 
challenge to government.<P>

<H2>"...To Assure Survival..."</H2>

Our danger is both extreme and immediate. 
Assuring survival has always
been the first duty of government. It was for that
purpose that we formed governments and
gave up great measures of personal sovereignty.<P>

Can the federal government afford to
spend $10 trillion to begin dealing with the
widespread health effects of pollution, 
accomplish the clean-ups and eliminate the
discharge of toxins? The question has little
to do with economics and everything to do
with the definition of national security. We
spent more than that sum on a <I>perceived</I>
military threat. Can we spend less on an
actual, physical one?<P>

At the Constitutional Convention, James
Madison observed that "A standing military 
force with an overgrown executive will
not long be safe companions to liberty. The
means of defense against foreign danger,
have been always the instruments of tyranny 
at home."<P>

The domestic violence clause is the 
necessary constitutional counterweight that can 
accomplish a rapid changeover from supporting 
a standing army to spending for 
survival.<P>

Because the threat to human survival is 
no less real from environmental domestic 
violence, the same federal mobilization that 
was occasioned by World War II ought to
take place under the "domestic violence" 
clause of the Constitution.<P>

When survival is at stake, the federal government 
must push lesser endeavors aside, 
curtail competing interests both public and 
private, gather the money and the talent 
necessary to solve the problem, and keep at 
the task long enough to assure survival. 
Isn't that why we have governments?<P>

Large-scale social changes occur rapidly 
when they are simultaneously embraced by 
a number of differing constituencies. 
The domestic violence solution can appeal 
equally to businesses, environmentalists, 
public health professionals, insurance companies, 
banks and religious organizations. 
This solution could be in place and working 
in a matter of just a few years. There would 
finally be enough meaningful jobs for everyone -- 
doing stewardship work and getting 
paid for it.<P>

Because invoking the "domestic violence" 
clause places so much power in the 
hands of the federal government, only full, 
public discussions leading to consensus can 
put that step on a firm footing.<P>

Only a constitutional mandate, understood 
by the people, can bring all of that about. 
That mandate exists at present in Article 
IV, Section 4. The clause is nothing less than 
a road map in a time capsule left for us by 
the founding fathers who, in their wisdom, 
knew that we would, in the end, be the 
authors of our own demise.<P>

If the "guarantee" portion of Section 4 is 
-- as Sen. Charles Sumner put it in 1867 -- 
the "sleeping giant in the Constitution," the 
domestic violence clause of Section 4 is 
even more momentous. In short, the framers 
harnessed a colossus for our use.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 94: Randy Borman: Cofan Chief</TITLE>

<H1>Randy Borman: Cofan Chief<I> by Mike Tidwell</I></H1>


<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Summer 94<BR> Vol. 9 Issue 3<BR> p26+ <HR>


Ecuador's multi-billion dollar Amazon petroleum 
industry has been dominated for 
more than 20 years by such US companies 
as Texaco, Arco, Maxus, Occidental and 
Oryx. After years of sloppy operations, the 
industry is being characterized by American 
and Ecuadorian environmentalists as a 
direct threat to the well-being, and perhaps 
survival, of Ecuador's</A> rainforest</A> and its 
peoples.<P>

Last November, Randy Borman, the 38-year-old 
son of American missionaries and 
chief of a community of Cofan Indians, 
slipped into his Indian tunic and applied 
streaks of red ceremonial paint to his face. 
He then led his band of 35 Cofan followers 
on an armed visit to an oil well illegally 
constructed on their land deep inside 
Ecuador's Amazon rainforest.<P>

With spears and shotguns, the Cofan encircled 
the well and its crew of startled 
workers. Thirty-six hours later, following a 
tense standoff and extensive negotiations, 
Borman had what he wanted: the promise 
of an environmental impact study (EIS) for 
the area and a compensatory batch of 60 
solar panels to go atop the Cofan's thatch-roof 
village huts.<P>

Born and raised among the Cofan, 
Borman could use a blowgun at age four 
and spear an Amazon pig at age ten. When 
his Bible-translating parents retired from 
the forest 13 years ago, he stayed behind, 
marrying a Cofan wife and eventually rising 
to power as an elected Cofan chief. 
Now, in a campaign that has captured international 
attention, Borman and the Cofan 
have become the vanguard of a battle to 
preserve Ecuador's</A> 32-million-acre Amazon 
rainforest</A> from ongoing oil exploitation.<P>

<H2>Defending Native Territory</H2>

"We were forced into this action by direct 
threats to our survival," said Borman of the 
November 1, 1993 shutdown at the oil well 
belonging to Petroecuador, the national oil 
comp any. "Unless we take direct action like 
this, we know our forest and way of life will 
be destroyed by oil companies. It has happened 
elsewhere and it will happen here."<P>

Borman and the Cofan, fearing 
the destruction of 
their still-pristine 
expanse of forest 
in eastern-most 
Ecuador by Petroecuador and multinational 
oil companies, have been prompted to take 
matters into their own hands. Last September, 
after numerous protest letters went 
unanswered by Petroecuador, Borman led 
the Indians in setting fire to another of the 
company's drilling platforms, built without 
permission on Cofan land, and destroyed 
the unmanned rig. Two years earlier, 
the Cofan kidnapped for 24 hours and 
then expelled from their land a 23-man 
crew of trespassing seismic-testing oil technicians.<P>

All of these events took place on or near 
Cofan territory and within Ecuador's</A> 
Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve, some of the 
most biologically diverse rainforest in the 
world. The Cofan's protest efforts have 
helped galvanize an unusual coalition of 
environmentalists, tourism companies and 
other Indigenous tribes determined to protect 
Cuyabeno from the oil spills and large-scale 
deforestation that have followed the 
activities of oil companies elsewhere in Ecuador.<P>

Borman wryly defends the Cofan's actions 
with his so-called "three-point explanation."<P>

"One," he said, "all the acts were unavoidable. 
Two, we pursued every possible 
alternative means before acting. Three, all 
the acts were unavoidable." Borman 
stressed that the Cofan policy is to never 
shoot first, but to defend themselves if fired 
upon during any armed visit to a well site.<P>

To date, none of the Cofan attacks have 
resulted in physical violence or government 
retaliation. Most Ecuadorian conservationists, 
in fact, defend the acts as measures 
of self defense. Jose Delgado, a leading 
rainforest</A> preservationist within 
Ecuador's</A> Ministry of Agriculture, described 
the Cofan's activism as nothing 
short of "historic."<P>

"For the first time, thanks largely to the 
Cofan, oil companies in Ecuador are being 
forced to admit that the rainforest is not a 
vacant land where they can do whatever 
they want," said Delgado. "People live there 
with rights</A> and aspirations just as valid as 
any company wanting a profit."<P>

In the past, with government complicity, 
oil companies have routinely entered and 
significantly degraded Ecuadorian rain-forest 
areas without consulting or compensating 
Indigenous peoples. But with 
Petroecuador's agreement to an EIS, environmentalists 
in Ecuador and the US increasingly 
point to the country as a place 
where the fear of "green castigation" has oil 
companies behaving more cautiously.<P>

<H2>A Multinational Malefactor</H2>

"No one wants to be the next Texaco," said 
Yolanda Kakabadse, former president of 
Fundacion Natura, Ecuador's</A> largest 
environmental organization. Last year, lawyers 
representing Amazon farmers and several 
tribes, including the Cofan, filed a record 
$1.5 billion class-action suit in New York 
and Texas against Texaco for allegedly "negligent, 
reckless, intentional and outrageous 
acts" of environmental damage connected 
to its extensive rainforest</A> drilling operations 
between 1964 and 1992. The Cofan
 contend that Texaco dumped drilling wastes 
 and oil into the region's rivers, contaminating 
 the water, jeopardizing the health of 
 native peoples, and killing plants and animals. 
 Over Texaco's objections, the New 
 York court has agreed to decide whether 
 the case should be tried in the US.<P>

While Texaco strongly denies any pattern 
of environmental wrongdoing in its 
past Ecuador operations, a March, 1994 
study of several drinking-water sources scattered 
across the company's old Amazon 
concession area in northeastern Ecuador 
shows signs of widespread contamination, 
according to Sarah Zaidi, coordinator of the 
study. Commissioned by the New York-based
 Center for Economic and Social 
 Rights, the investigation found substances 
 associated with the presence of oil in areas 
 adjacent to former Texaco facilities at 2-500 
 times the maximum level accepted by the 
 US Environmental Protection Agency.<P>

Government records show that spills 
from the trans-Ecuadorian pipeline, 
which Texaco built in 1972, totaled 500,000 
barrels (16.8 million gallons) of crude oil 
over 17 years, 50 percent more oil than was 
spilled by the <I>Exxon Valdez</I>.<P>

However, Ecuador has no plans to slow 
the pace of oil production, now running at 
approximately 360,000 barrels a day. Oil 
exports account for 14 percent of the 
country's gross national product and 50 
percent of foreign-export earnings. But the 
nation's Ministry of Energy and Mines reports 
that this year the government will 
begin requiring oil companies with major 
concessions in Ecuador to carry $1 billion-worth 
of environmental "clean-up insurance" 
to cover any spills or other contamination.<P>

Meanwhile, the Cofan have demanded 
and received assurances from the government 
that extensive environmental impact 
studies will be conducted in areas targeted 
for exploratory drilling on or near Cofan 
territory. The Cofan will also receive a list of 
chemicals and machinery slated for use in 
oil exploration before such materials are 
used, thus giving the Indians the theoretical 
right to veto some aspects of oil activities. 
Indian-rights</A> proponents now vow to 
press for similar rights for other Indigenous 
Ecuadorian groups affected by oil 
development, amplifying the Cofan gains.<P>

Officially, the Cofan say they are not 
opposed to oil exploitation on their land, as 
long as environmental precautions are 
strictly adhered to. But privately, conservation 
activists working with the Cofan admit 
that the strategy is to entangle Petroecuador 
in environmental studies and potential lawsuits 
until the company abandons the 
Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve entirely. Environmentalists 
fear that even if exploratory 
wells are made safer, any oil discovery necessarily 
will require the construction of 
roads and pipelines through the reserve.<P>

During two decades of oil production, 
hundreds of miles of roads have brought 
thousands of settlers into the region from 
the land-scarce Andean highlands. Already 
more than 2.5 million acres of jungle 
have been deforested as a consequence of 
oil operations, according to attorney Judith 
Kimmerling, author of the report, <I>Amazon 
Crude</I>.<P>

Most observers in Ecuador agree that, 
despite the recent successes of the Cofan 
and the growing clout of environmental 
groups, the Ecuadorian Indigenous and 
ecology movements face a stiff uphill battle 
against a national government firmly committed 
to continued exploitation of its oil 
reserves, almost all of which lie in the 
country's Amazon forest region.<P>

In January, the Ecuadorian government 
announced its plans to lease five million 
acres of Amazonian rainforest</A> to multinational 
companies for oil exploration, which 
will require the construction of a new oil 
pipeline and hundreds of miles of new 
roads. The area covers 85 percent of Indigenous 
land in Ecuador (although no Cofan 
territory), according to Rainforest Action 
Network, as well as national parks and 
protected wetlands, where subsurface rights</A> 
are not protected by the government.<P>

In response, environmental and Indigenous 
groups are petitioning the Ecuadorian 
government, and appealing to the US 
Congress, for a 15-year moratorium on new 
oil development in the Amazon in order to 
provide time to fully assess environmental 
damage and implement ecological and cultural 
safeguards.<P>

<H2>The Promise of Ecotourism</H2>

Environmentalists contend that revenues 
earned from tourism in the Amazon 
rainforest</A> could eventually outstrip oil 
earnings. The number of visitors to the 
Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve, for example, 
has doubled to 10,000 people in the past five 
years alone, according to park officials.<P>

"Unlike oil, tourism is sustainable," said 
Pedro Proano, president of Transturri, S.A., 
Ecuador's</A> largest ecotourism company, 
with operations centered in the Cuyabeno 
reserve. "If the oil companies have their 
way, in 20 years [when Ecuador's oil reserves 
are expected to run out] there won't 
be any oil <I>or</I> a rainforest. But tourism is 
forever. It preserves the forest and brings 
money into the country year after year."<P>

Indeed, the Cofan Indians themselves in 
recent years have begun offering guided 
tours to backpackers and scientists wanting 
to see the splendor of the Cuyabeno forest. 
The extra income has helped finance the 
group's protest efforts within the park, as 
well as trips to Quito to testify before various 
government oversight agencies. Chief 
Borman, meanwhile, has said he may visit 
Washington later this year to testify before 
Congress on the Cofan's situation.<P>

Ecuadorian land laws are ambiguous and 
contradictory in this region of the country, 
though they appear more favorable to the 
Cofan than the oil companies in terms of 
rainforest</A> use. For this reason, Petroecuador 
has avoided requesting that the government 
provide military intervention as a response 
to the Cofan protest actions.<P>
 "We all want the same thing anyway," 
 said Fabiola Gomez, spokesperson for 
 Petroecuador. "Our company wants to reach 
 an agreement that's good for the forest just 
 as much as Borman and the Cofan do."<P>

Borman and the Cofan are wary, however, 
watching the oil companies that are 
rapidly approaching their settlement area 
near the Peruvian border as the companies 
move progressively through the forest. The 
Indians' backs are against the border. Escape 
is impossible. So chief Borman, with 
his silver-blond hair and blue eyes, has 
taken to streaking his cheeks with red paint. 
He has decided to resist the oil companies.<P>

"We will never accept all the oil spills 
and environmental calamity that have come 
with oil elsewhere," he said. "The only way 
that will happen here is if the companies or 
the government remove us. And I have no 
intention of leaving," he said, pausing, then 
adding, "not willingly, at least."<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 94: Dreamland Exposed</TITLE>

<H1>"Dreamland" Exposed <P></H1>
<H2>"Secret" Nevada Air Base Plots a 2-Million-acre Land Grab</H2>

<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Summer 94<BR> Vol. 9 Issue 3<BR> p23 <HR><P>




<B>Carson City, Nevada</B> -- For two decades, 
"UFOologists" have claimed that the notorious 
"Area 51" at the Nellis Air Force Base
 (AFB) Range was the abode of space aliens 
and flying saucers, but Nevada environmentalists 
know better. For 40 years, Area 
51 (also known as "Dreamland", "The 
Ranch", "The Box" and the "Watertown 
Strip") has long been a covert Department of
Defense (DoD) testing ground for top-secret 
hypersonic aircraft, including F-117A 
Stealth fighters, prototype B-2 bombers, 
$15 billion, Mach 8 Aurora, and the 
mysterious Black Manta (which is flown 
mainly at night reportedly at speeds of 
over 6000 mph).<P>

	The secret activities conducted at the Nellis 
AFB Range (which includes parts of the 
Nevada Test Site, the Tonopah Test Range, 
Groom Range and Area 51) have been estimated 
to cost taxpayers between $93-$115 million 
a month. The nonpartisan, Washington, 
DC-based Defense Budget Project estimates 
that $14.3 billion of the Pentagon's 
annual budget for research, development 
and procurement -- an amount equal to 
NASA's entire budget -- is being funneled 
into secret "Black Project" activities.)<P>

<I>The Las Vegas Review Journal</I> has reported 
that Area 51 is a high-rollers' heaven, complete 
with pool halls, heated indoor pools, 
tennis and racquetball courts, saunas and 
posh nightclubs. "Sam's Bar," a taxpayer-funded 
hang-out named after a CIA official, 
specializes in showing pornographic 
movies. If someone at Dreamland wants 
iceboxes full of shrimp and lobster, the <I>Review 
Journal</I> reported, a giant C-130 Hercules 
transport plane is dispatched to get 
it. Because of the threat of contaminated 
groundwater from the site's toxic spills, 
$50,000 worth of purified bottled water is 
also brought in annually. <P>

Over the years, the US Air Force (USAF) 
has compiled a long record of abuse against 
the land of the Southwest. USAF planes 
deliberately torched 21,800 acres inside the 
Meadow Valley and Mormon Range wilderness 
study areas; attacks have been 
staged against the Desert Game Range in 
Nye County, Nevada; and USAF bombers 
have "accidentally" bombed the Stillwater 
National Wildlife Refuge and Desert Game 
Range. <P>

Since 1974, Nevada Outdoor Recreation 
Association (NORA) has warned that 
the DoD was trying to deploy the "Continental 
Operations Range" (COR), a huge 
electronic warfare system, despite it having 
been banned by Congress. The COR, which 
encompasses Area 51, would require the 
annexation of millions of acres of Bureau of 
Land Managment (BLM) lands.<P>

	In 1984, in a controversial move that 
alarmed environmentalists, the DoD seized 
89,000 acres of public land in the Groom 
Range. Last year, NORA and the Rural 
Alliance for Military Accountability received 
tips that the USAF was planning a 
two-million-acre annexation of land north 
of the Groom Range and the Tonopah Test 
Range. <P>

According to Michael DiGregorio, a 
Los Angeles-based investigative journalist 
the boundaries of the USAF's mammoth 
expansion plans would engulf seven 
Wilderness Study Areas, a prime Area 
of Critical Environmental Concern candidate 
at Lunar Crater, two wilderness areas 
in Humboldt National Forest and four Nevada 
Division of Wildlife refuges.<P>

Confronted with leaks and disclosures 
that could no longer be stonewalled, the 
USAF finally admitted that it was seeking 
BLM lands at a "substantially larger acreage" 
than admitted by the DoD. <P>

	The USAF has also requested title to a 
3972-acre slice of BLM land adjacent to 
the Groom Grange, contending that public 
access compromises the secret aircraft testing 
inside Area 51. <P>

	The <I> Review Journal </I> has reported that Area 
51's toxic wastes have been burned in open 
pits in ditches near Papoose Mountain in 
the Groom Range by a DoD hauling outfit 
called "NDB" (which stands for "None of 
your Damn Business"). The 55-gallon 
drums burned in these trenches reportedly 
contained dioxin, flammable liquids and 
toxic wastes from Stealth aircraft coatings. <P>

In July, George Washington University 
professor Jonathan Turley of the Environmental 
Crimes Project filed suit against 
the USAF for violations of environmental 
laws, charging that at least one death has 
resulted from exposure to toxic fumes from 
the open burn pits.  The lawsuit, which has 
been joined by the Project on Government 
Oversight, lists 39 former Area 51 workers 
who are prepared to testify.

Representative James Bilbray (D-Las Vegas) -- 
who, as a congressmember, cannot 
even admit that Area 51 exists -- stated on 
March 20 that he has asked the USAF for a 
"full, detailed briefing" on any toxic activities 
at Nellis AFB Range. <P>

<P>
<H2>What You Can Do</H2> <P>
Challenge the secret government's "Black Budget" operations. Call on Congressman Ron Dellums (D-CA), chair of the House Armed Services Committee to conduct a complete investigation of the Pentagon's secret air base.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 94: Multinationals Prepare to Invade Vietnam</TITLE>

<H1>Multinationals Prepare to Invade Vietnam<P></H1>

<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Summer 94<BR> Vol. 9 Issue 3<BR> p25 <HR><P>

<P>

On May 19-20, the World Economic Development 
Congress (WEDC) convened the 
first "post-embargo conference" on "Business 
and Investment Opportunities in Vietnam" 
at Washington DC's Barcelo Hotel. 
The gathering was attended by a delegation 
of high-level Vietnamese trade, banking 
and industry ministers who had promised 
to unravel "the complexities of Asia's 
next tiger," a reference to the reigning economic 
tigers of the region -- Taiwan, Singapore, 
Hong Kong and South Korea.<P>

	"Since 1988, foreign investors from Taiwan, 
Hong Kong and Australia have signed 
contracts worth $7.5 billion," WEDC organizers 
noted. Obviously Vietnam, a nation 
of 70 million people with an economy 
growing at ten percent a year, represents a 
potential goldmine for foreign companies 
interested in "profiting from this exploding 
market!" WEDC cited some added attractions 
of Vietnam -- a rapidly growing 
middle class with a "pent-up demand for 
Western consumer goods," an abundance 
of natural resources and the "most liberal 
foreign-investment laws in Asia."<P>

	A US-ASEAN Council report published 
on February 3 (the day the US lifted its 
embargo against Vietnam) predicted that 
US businesses would reap $2.6 billion in 
trade in the first two years. Vietnam's Asian 
neighbors are also looking toward Vietnam. 
"The country has a number of international 
ports and the easiest access to Laos' 
extensive timber reserves," notes Josh 
Newell of Friends of the Earth (FOE)/Japan. 
According to Newell, the former US 
naval base at Danang "is positioning itself 
to be the import/export center for Cambodia 
and Laos."<P>

	The World Bank, the Asian Development 
Bank and the Japanese Overseas Development 
Agency are already preparing to fund 
a major project in Vietnam -- a 3200 kilometer 
(1964-mile) highway running from 
Hanoi in the north to Ho Chi Minh City 
and Ca Mau in the south. The World Bank 
estimates that 21 million people will be 
effected by the proposed Highway 1. 
FOE/Japan quotes an anonymous finance 
specialist as warning that "it's still unclear 
how they are going to relocate people from 
the area directly affected by some of the 
planned projects."<P>

	The World Bank has dedicated $158 million 
to pave the road from Hanoi to Vinh, 
while the Asian Development Bank is set to 
finance the southern portion from Nha 
Trang to Ho Chi Minh City for more than 
$120 million. Construction on these initial 
stretches of Hwy 1 is set to commence 
in the first quarter of 1995. <P>

	FOE/Japan has suggested that the World 
Bank should really be funding the construction 
of a less-expensive, energy-efficient, high-speed 
rail system<P>

	The World Bank has also targeted the 
Mekong River for a new round of large-scale 
hydroelectric dams modeled on 
projects that have caused environmental 
devastation and human misery at other 
World Bank-funded sites around the world. <P>

<H2> Pepsi, Coke and Chrysler</H2>

Within hours of the lifting of the US trade-embargo, 
a "Cola War" erupted in Vietnam 
with Pepsi Cola and Coca Cola both passing 
out free samples in Ho Chi Minh City. 
According to the <I> Viet Nam Ngat Nay</I> business 
newsletter, Coke "can cost up to four 
times the price of locally made colas."<P>

	After the embargo was lifted, General 
Motors revealed that it had signed a "memorandum 
of understanding" on future auto 
production with Vietnam Motors Corp. The 
agreement was made -- secretly -- in May, 
1993. Chrysler Corp. is also investigating 
production opportunities in Vietnam.<P>

	Environmental activist and University of 
Hanoi Professor Vo Quy [Winter 1989 <I>EIJ</I>], 
however, warns that Vietnam's existing base 
of small industry has already caused "water, 
air and soil pollution... sometimes to a 
critical extent" and insists that it is necessary 
to develop "a strategy for sustainable 
development." <P>

	Vietnam's forests, heavily damaged by 
US bombs and chemical defoliants during 
the war, have declined another 20-28 percent 
since the war's end. "Almost 40 percent 
of the country is now classified as 
unproductive wasteland," Vo Quy claims. 
He has called for "a great planting program 
to reclaim our war-scarred land and to correct 
our mistake of rapid development." 
Citing forest loss as "the single most serious 
long-term threat to the country's renewable 
natural resources," Vo Quy has set an 
important goal: "to reforest 40-50 percent of 
the countryside by the 21st century."<P>

	Unfortunately, foreign multinationals 
remain more interested in tapping Vietnam's 
for offshore oil and transforming its people 
into the latest "investment opportunity" for 
consumption-based economics. -- GS<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Summer 94: Development Plans Endanger Vietnam's Forests</TITLE>
<H1>Development Plans Endanger Vietnam's Forests<I>by Chris R. Lang</I></H1>

<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Summer 94<BR> Vol. 9 Issue 3<BR> p25 <HR><P>

United Kingdom (Via EcoNet) -- A major threat to Vietnam's forests is the
international paper and pulp 
industry. Vietnam's one large paper and pulp mill at Bai Bang was built with
Swedish aid in the 1970s.
 Pulp production led to encroachment into natural forests, while widespread
planting of eucalyptus 
exacerbated soil erosion. Since 1990, the development of the market economy has
created a climate 
that has let to an uncontrolled cutting of bamboo and trees. In ten years, more
than 80,000 hectares 
(197,000 acres) of mostly natural forest lands were cleared to supply Bai Bang.
<P>

	Another threat to forests, both directly and indirectly, is dam building.
The Hoa Binh dam in northern 
Vietnam is the largest dam in southeast Asia. Built in the 1980s with Russian
aid, it displaced 58,000 
people and flooded 11,000 hectares (27,170 acres) of productive agricultural
land.<P>

	The proposed Ta Bu project would place a 150-meter (495-foot) dam at the
end of the Hoa Bihn 
reservoir, displacing another 150,000 people and inundating much of the
remaining wet riceland in Son La and Lai 
Chau provinces. The impact on an already seriously deforested region would be
disastrous.<P>

	The Yali Falls dam in the Central Highlands, part of a six-dam scheme for
the Se San river, would 
effect an area already under pressure from deforestation due to logging,
chemical defoliation and 
migration pressures. A labor force of 10-20,000 would work for four-to-six
years on a construction process that will 
require a large amount of timber. Roads will lead to further deforestation.
Elephants and tigers are among ten endangered mammals in this watershed.<P>

	The World Bank/United Nations' Tropical Forest Action Plan process in Vietnam
was a shambles. 
Consultants flew into Vietnam, produced their reports, took their fees and left
hundreds of reports sitting 
in the Ministry of Forestry in Hanoi. Meanwhile, the failure to address the
real issues of deforestation -- 
logging, commercial plantations, resorts, dams and the migration of displaced
farmers -- remain.<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 94: Project HAARP: The Military's Plan to Alter the
Ionosphere</TITLE>

<H1>Fall 1994- Project HAARP: The Military's Plan to Alter the Ionosphere<P><I>by Clare Zickuhr and Gar Smith</I></H1>


Clare Zickuhr, a former ARCO employee and ham radio operator based in Anchorage, is a founder of the NO HAARP campaign. Gar Smith is editor of the editor of Earth Island <A HREF="journal.html">Journal</A>.<P>

The Pentagon's mysterious HAARP project, now under construction at an isolated Air Force facility near Gakona, Alaska, marks the first step toward creating the world's most powerful "ionospheric heater." Scientists, environmentalists and native peoples are concerned that HAARP's electronic transmitters -- capable of beaming "in excess of 1 gigawatts" (one billion watts) of radiated power into the Earth's ionosphere -- could harm people, endanger wildlife and trigger unforeseen environmental impacts.<P>

The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project (HAARP), a joint effort of the Air Force and the Navy, is the latest in a series of a little-known Department of Defense (DoD) "active ionospheric experiments" with code-names like EXCEDE, RED AIR and CHARGE IV. <P>

"From a DoD point of view," internal HAARP documents state, "the most exciting and challenging" part of the experiment is "its potential to <I>control</I> ionospheric processes" for military objectives [emphasis in the original]. According to these documents, the scientists pulling HAARP's strings envision using the system's powerful 2.8-10 megahertz (MHz) beam to burn "holes" in the ionosphere and "create an artificial lens" in the sky that could focus large bursts of electromagnetic energy "to higher altitudes... than is presently possible." The minimum area to be heated would be 50 km (31 miles) in diameter. <P>

The initial $26 million, 320 kW HAARP project will employ 360 72-foot-tall antennas spread over four acres to direct an intense beam of focused electromagnetic energy upwards to strike the ionosphere. The Earth's ionosphere is composed of a layer of negatively and positively charged particles (electrons and ions) lying between 35 and 500 miles above the planet's surface. The next stage of the project would expand HAARP's power to 1.7 gigawatts (1.7 billion watts), making it the most powerful such transmitter on Earth. While the project's acronym implies experimentation with the Earth's aurora, HAARP's public documents make no mention of this aspect. For a project whose backers hail it as a major scientific feat, HAARP has remained extremely low-profile -- almost unknown to most Alaskans, and the rest of the country.<P>

A November 1993 "HAARP Fact Sheet" released to the public by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) stated that the Department of Defense (DoD)-backed project would "enhance present civilian capabilities" in communications and "provide significant scientific advancements." However, while previous DoD experiments with smaller high frequency (HF) heaters in Puerto Rico, <A HREF="../immp/immp3.html">Norway</A> and Alaska were conducted to "gain [a] better understanding" of the ionosphere, internal HAARP documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) reveal that the project's goal is to "perturb" the ionosphere with extremely powerful beams of energy and study "how it responds to the disturbance and how it ultimately recovers...." <P>

The public fact sheet describes HAARP as "purely a scientific research facility which represents no threat to potential adversaries and would therefore have no value as a military target." However, while ionospheric experiments at the government's Puerto Rico transmitter site are managed by the civilian National Science Foundation, the <A HREF="journal.html">Journal</A> has learned that proposals for experiments on HAARP are to be routed through the Pentagon's Office of Naval Research.<P>

A February 1990 Air Force-Navy document acquired by the <A HREF="journal.html">Journal</A> lists only military experiments for the HAARP project, including: "Generation of ionospheric lenses to focus large amounts of HF energy at high altitudes... providing a means for triggering ionospheric processes that potentially could be exploited for DoD purposes...; Generation of ionization layers below 90 km [56 miles] to provide radio wave reflectors ("mirrors") which can be exploited for long range, over-the-horizon, HF/VHF/UHF surveillance purposes, including the detection of cruise missiles and other low observables." The document concluded that "the potential for significantly altering regions of the ionosphere at relatively great distances (1000 km or more ) [621 miles] from a heater is very desirable" from a military perspective. <P>

One of HAARP's less-publicized goals is to find ways to disrupt the global communications capabilities of adversaries while preserving US defense communications. The Pentagon also wants to know if HAARP could bounce signals to deeply submerged nuclear subs by heating the ionosphere to trigger bursts of Extremely Long Frequency (ELF) radio waves.<P>

Patents held by ARCO Power Technologies, Inc. (APTI), the ARCO subsidiary that was contracted to build HAARP, describe a similar ionospheric heater invented by Bernard Eastlund that claimed the ability to disrupt global communications, destroy enemy missiles and change weather (see sidebar). One of ARCO's patents identifies Alaska as a perfect site for a transmitter because "magnetic field lines... which extend to desirable altitudes for this invention, intersect the Earth in Alaska." <P>

While HAARP officials deny any link to Eastlund's inventions, Eastlund has told National Public Radio that a secret military project was begun in the late-1980s to study and implement his work and, in the May/June 1994 issue of <I>Microwave News</I>, Eastlund claimed that "The HAARP project obviously looks a lot like the first step" toward his vision of surrounding the entire planet with a "full, global shield" of charged particles that could explode incoming enemy missiles. <P>

The military implications of HAARP were further underscored in June, when ARCO sold APTI to E-Systems, a defense contractor noted for its work in counter-surveillance.<P>

<H2>Electromagnetic Guinea Pigs</H2>

HAARP surfaced publicly in Alaska in the spring of 1993, when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began advising commercial pilots on how to avoid the large amounts of intentional (and some unintentional) electromagnetic radiation that HAARP would generate. Despite the protests of FAA engineers and Alaska bush pilots (for whom reliable communications can be a matter of life or death) the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) gave HAARP the green light. Ironically, the FEIS also concluded that the project's radio interference would be too intense to allow HAARP to be located near any military facilities.<P>

On November 11, 1993, Inupiat tribal advisor Charles Etok Edwarden, Jr., wrote to the White House on behalf of the Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope and the Kasigluk Elders Conference. "Many of us are not happy with the prospect of ARCO altering the Earth's neutral atmospheric properties," Edwardsen wrote. "We do not wish to be anyone's testing grounds, as the Bikini Islanders have been...." referring to Pacific Islanders subjected to radiation exposure from US atomic bomb testing. Edwardsen has appealed to President Clinton to deny further funding to HAARP.<P>

In the past, the EPA has accused the USAF of "sidestepping" the nonthermal hazards of electromagnetic pollution from powerful radar transmitters. Over the past three decades, numerous US and European studies have linked electromagnetic exposure to a range of health problems including fatigue, irritability, sleepiness, memory loss, cataracts, leukemia, birth defects and cancer. Electromagnetic radiation can also alter blood sugar and cholesterol levels, heart-rate and blood pressure, brain waves and brain chemistry.<P>

Wildlife advocates also have cause to be concerned. The HAARP site lies 140 miles north of the town of Cordova on Prince William Sound, on the northwest tip of Alaska's Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. Since ordinary radar is known to be deadly to low-flying birds, HAARP's powerful radiation beam could pose a problem for migratory birds because the transmitter stands in the path of the critical Pacific Flyway. In addition, HAARP's ability to generate strong magnetic fields could conceivably interfere with the migration of birds, marine life and Arctic animals that are now known to rely on the Earth's magnetic fields to navigate over long distances.<P>

The HAARP fact sheet states that "most of the energy of the high-power beam would be emitted upward rather than toward the horizon." Later on, however, the fact sheet notes that care will have to be taken "to reduce the percentage of time large signal levels would be transmitted toward large cities." The closest large cities are Fairbanks and Anchorage.<P>

Even if HAARP's beam were to be directed primarily at the ionosphere, people on the ground would still have reason to be concerned. According to DoD consultant Robert Windsor, clear damp nights, downdrafts and temperature inversions can cause "ducting" and "super-refracting" that can send energy beams streaming back to Earth with "a significant -- up to tenfold -- increase in field intensity." <P>

In addition to their main beams, all electromagnetic transmitters produce large swaths of "sidelobe" radiation along their flanks. US-based PAVE PAWS over-the-horizon radars, for example, use approximately one megawatt of power to send a 420-430-megahertz (MHz) beam on a 3000-mile-long sweep. At the same time, the "incidental" sidelobe radiation from these Pentagon radars can disable TVs, radios, radar altimeters and satellite communications over a 250-mile range. PAVE PAWS radiation can also disrupt cardiac pacemakers seven miles away and cause the "inadvertent detonation" of electrically triggered flares and bombs in passing aircraft. At peak power, the energy driving HAARP could be more than a thousand times stronger than the most powerful PAVE PAWS transmitter.<P>

<H2>HAARP's High-Level Hazards</H2>

HAARP project manager John Heckscher, a scientist at the Department of the Air Force's Phillips Laboratory, has called concerns about the transmitter's impact "unfounded." "It's not unreasonable to expect that something three times more powerful than anything that's previously been built might have unforeseen effects," Heckscher told <I>Microwave News</I>. "But that's why we do environmental impact statements." <P>

The July 1993 EIS does, in fact, admit that HAARP is expected to cause "measurable changes in the ionosphere's electron density, temperature and structure," but argues that these disruptions are insignificant "when compared to changes induced by naturally occurring processes."<P>

Subjecting the ionosphere to HF bombardment can ionize the neutral particles in the upper atmosphere. The HAARP Fact Sheet notes that "ionospheric disturbances at high altitudes also can act to induce large currents in electric power grids" on the ground, causing massive power blackouts. According to the 1990 Air Force-Navy document, power levels of one gigawatt and above "can drastically alter [the ionosphere's] thermal, refractive, scattering and emission character." While the ionosphere over the government's smaller HF transmitter in Puerto Rico is relatively "stable," the document notes that the ionosphere above Alaska is "a dynamic entity" where added bursts of electromagnetic energy could trigger exaggerated effects. <P>

Writing in <I>Physics and Society</I> (the quarterly newsletter of the American Physical Society), Dr. Richard Williams, a consultant to Princeton University's David Sarnoff Laboratory, denounced ionospheric heating tests as irresponsible and potentially dangerous.<P>

"Trace [chemical] constituents in the upper atmosphere can have a profound effect" on the formation of ozone molecules, Williams stated. It is known that altering the temperature of the ionosphere can affect the chemical reactions that produce ozone. Referring to the Montreal Protocol (the international agreement to protect the ozone layer from ozone-depleting chemicals), Williams warned that activating HAARP's ionospheric heater "might undo all that we have accomplished with this treaty." <P>

"Look at the power levels that will be used -- 10**9 to 10**11 watts!" Williams told the <A HREF="journal.html">Journal</A> in a recent interview. "This is equivalent to the output of ten to 100 large power-generating stations. A ten-billion-watt generator, running continuously for one hour, would deliver a quantity of energy equal to that of a Hiroshima-sized atomic bomb."<P>

"Of course," Williams added, "they will operate in a pulsed mode [producing a series of short, powerful bursts], rather than continuously." The HAARP fact sheet states that the HF beam, which operates in the 2.8-10 MHz band, will only be used 4-5 times a year for several weeks at a time over a 20-year period. Nonetheless, Williams argued, to proceed without a full public discussion of HAARP's potential impacts runs the risk of committing "an irresponsible act of global vandalism. With experiments on this scale," Williams concluded, "irreparable damage could be done in a short time. The immediate need is for open discussion."<P>

Dr. Daniel N. Baker, director of the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, offered a less-alarming assessment. "The natural input of energy to the magnetosphere from the sun is very commonly 10**11 - 10**12 watts," Baker told the <A HREF="journal.html">Journal</A>. "Thus, HAARP may be a small fraction of the energy that flows into the region." Baker added that the ionosphere is, by nature, a "highly dynamic and fluctuating" environment that is able to "flush" away energy disturbances in a matter of hours or days. <P>

Of course, in nature, one cannot simply "flush" something away without anticipating potential "downstream" consequences. Caroline L. Herzenberg, an environmental systems engineer at the Argonne National Laboratory, has suggested that, by "changing the chemical composition of the atmosphere; [and] transporting plumes of particulates or plasma within the atmosphere," HAARP may violate the 1977 Environmental Modification Convention, which bans all "military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting, or severe effects...." The US ratified the convention in 1979.<P>

<H2>"X-Raying" the Earth?</H2>

On June 14, a Senate committee report noted that the Deputy Secretary of Defense had called for increasing HAARP funding from $5 million to $75 million in the 1996 defense budget. The sudden increase would be used to promote a disturbing new mission for HAARP. <P>

Instead of just pouring its vast energy into the skies, the transmitter's power would be aimed back at the planet to "allow earth-penetrating tomography over most of the northern hemisphere" -- in effect, turning HAARP into the world's most powerful "X-ray machine" capable of scanning regions hidden deep beneath the planet's surface. According to the Senate report, this would "permit the detection and precise location of tunnels... and other underground shelters. The absence of such a capability has been... a serious weakness for [DoD] plans for precision attacks on hardened targets...." <P>

Meanwhile, construction on the larger HAARP facility -- with a potential effective radiated power of 1.7 GW (1.7 billion watts) -- is set to begin in 1995. This expanded version would require additional funding from Congress. According to the 1990 project document: "The desired world-class facility... will cost on the order of $25-30 million." The Senate Committee's April report, however, predicts that the cost "could be as much as $90 million."<P>


<H2>What You Can Do</H2> Write Congress to demand a review of HAARP's environmental impacts. Request that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration [NITA, c/o US Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230] reject the HAARP frequency/power request pending the outcome of a Congressional inquiry. Queries and contributions may be sent to NO HAARP c/o Jim Roderick, PO Box 916, Homer, AK 99603.<P>

<I>"Visibility is a crude criterion for assessing environmental damage.... An unprecedented amount of energy can produce an unprecedented reaction. Experimenting with [the ionosphere] is a very delicate thing. A localized event can spread around the Earth fairly quickly." -- Prof. Dick Williams</I><P>

<TITLE>EIJ Winter 95: Project HAARP: The "Official" Impacts</TITLE>

<H1>Winter 1995-Project HAARP: The "Official" Impacts<BR> <I>by Gar Smith</I></H1>

<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Winter 95
<BR> Vol. 10 Issue 1<BR> p21 <HR>

The Fall issue of <I>Earth Island Journal</I> featured
an article on Project HAARP, a joint
US Air Force-Navy plan to "perturb" 
the Earth's ionosphere with intense blasts 
of electromagnetic energy beamed from a site
in Gakona, Alaska. Project HAARP officials 
subsequently supplied the <A HREF="journal.html">Journal</A> with a 
copy of the Final Environmental Impact 
Statement (FEIS). Here is an update.<P>


The construction of the HAARP transmitter 
will affect 51 acres of black spruce 
forest and 18 acres of wetlands. The forests 
will be cut and the wetlands filled. The FEIS
deemed these conifer forests "the least sensitive 
and most expendable" because they 
"are so common." <P>

According to "preliminary estimates,"
HAARP construction would require the 
delivery of 7300 truckloads, totaling 160,000 
cubic yards of "non-frost susceptible 
gravel." The gravel site with the most "potential" 
is 25 miles away.<P>

The impacts on the native moose population 
would include "loss of habitat, interference 
with migration patterns, and 
increased human-caused mortality [i.e., from 
hunting]. The HAARP project would 
directly remove, through clearing, filling or 
fencing, approximately 51 acres of 
habitat...." Habitat loss would also affect black 
bear populations, three wolf packs (totaling 15-24 
wolves) and two caribou herds as well as a 
host of smaller aninmals including red fox, 
coyote, lynx, marten, muskrat, ermine, 
beaver, river otter, wolverine, mink, lemming, 
vole, Arctic shrew, Arctic ground squirrel 
and snowshoe hare.<P>


<H2>Fouling the Air</H2>

"The most important source of air pollutants" 
would be HAARP's 15-megawatt 
power plant, driven by six 3600 hp diesel 
generators. The power plant would 
consume an estimated 191,800 pounds of diesel 
fuel per day, producing roughly 1870 
pounds of SOx (sulfur oxides) and 13,300 
pounds of NOx (nitrous oxides). <P>

Rooftop radiators would disperse the heat 
skyward through exhaust stacks (not yet 
designed). The plant could operate at full 
power for only 38 days before exceeding 
federal air-quality standards.<P>

Approximately 200,000 gallons of diesel 
fuel (stored onsite in four 50,000-gallon 
above-ground fuel storage tanks) would be 
burned during each HAARP "campaign" 
-- a campaign includes ten preparation 
days, 14 experiment days and four 
shutdown days. <P>

The FEIS states that if more than five 
campaigns were scheduled per year, "this 
might require that additional emission-control 
devices be used at the HAARP site." 
Conveniently, HAARP is only scheduled to 
host "four to five campaigns a year...."<P>


<H2>Hitting the HAARP Strings</H2>

Swans are the most abundant of the region's 
119 bird species, followed by ducks and 
passerines. The FEIS notes that the Gakona 
site "lies within the Copper River Basin, 
which is one of Alaska's more important 
migration corridors" along the Pacific Flyway, 
but concludes that only birds weighing 
more than three pounds and measuring 
more than 16 inches in length would be at 
risk from HAARP's 10 MHz beams.<P>

The real danger to birds, however, is 
from flying into the network of HAARP's 
wire-anchored antennas. Most at risk would 
be swans, owls, ducks and passerines.<P>

HAARP's 115-foot-diameter Incoherent 
Scatter Radar (ISR) dish would stand on a 25-foot 
thick, 35-foot-tall support structure. Other HAARP 
antenna elements would rise 80-100 feet 
above the ground. Observers reported that 
song birds and shore birds flew within the 
danger zone 41 percent of the time. <P>

According to the FEIS, "swans, especially 
trumpeter swans, are probably the group 
most at risk of colliding with the antenna 
structures," especially during the October 
migration when poor weather conditions 
force the swans to fly low to the ground.<P>

<H2>Zapping the Ground and the Sky</H2>

The FEIS reports that "the government 
commissioned a special study" to determine the 
"bioeffects" of HAARP's radio frequency 
radiation (RFR). The report concluded that 
"chronic exposure to RFR... did not result 
in demonstrable, detrimental health effects" 
to humans. The FEIS admitted that RFR 
exposure could cause the human body to 
heat up, but that this unwanted heat "can be 
easily accommodated within the 
thermoregulatory capabilities of an individual
[and] may not necessarily be harmful."<P>

The FEIS corroborated the <A HREF="journal.html">Journal's</A> 
concern that "potentially affected systems...
[would] include cardiac pacemakers, 
electro-explosive devices [EEDs], and fuel 
handling systems." EEDs, including flares 
carried by individuals or in vehicles, could 
be exploded 1300 feet from HAARP's 
Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI) 
transmitter -- a quarter-mile away.<P>

Radio frequency radiation could be a 
problem since, as the FEIS notes, Gakona 
lies "within a major commercial air traffic 
corridor that links Anchorage with the 
eastern and mid-western US. It also is 
within the path of flight to and from the 
Orient and Canada. Twelve-to-20 
commercial flights per day utilize the airspace 
above the Gakona Site.<P>

The IRI's 8.0 MHz and 10.0 MHz beams 
"could potentially pose a hazard to 
occupants of aircraft flying nearby... in the 
unlikely event they remain in the main beam 
for an extended period of time." At aircraft 
cruising altitude of 30,000 feet (5.7 miles), the 
inverted cone formed by the sweep of 
the IRI beam is 6.8 miles wide.<P>

Countering assumptions that most of 
HAARP's energy would be "lost" to space, 
the FEIS reveals that "80-90 percent of the 
experiments would employ the IRI in modes 
that refract fundamental radio frequency 
energy Earthward from the ionosphere."<P>


<H2>And What <I>About</I> the Ionosphere?</H2>

The 440-page FEIS states flatly that "The 
ozone layer would not be affected and ozone 
would not be depleted" as a result of 
HAARP operations, but devotes less than a 
page to this critical topic. The only study 
cited is a single 13-page "draft assessment" 
by the Mission Research Corporation (MRC).<P>

The FEIS spends less than three pages on 
HAARP's ionospheric effects and bases its 
conclusions solely on "personal 
communications" between officials at MRC and the 
consulting firm of Metcalf and Eddy. The 
FEIS reports that IRI transmissions will 
cause the temperature of free electrons in 
the Earth's ionosphere could rise by 80 degrees F. 
Below 124 miles, the IRI would trigger a 20 
percent increase in "electron density," while above 
124 miles, electron densities would decrease 
10-15 percent. The effect could last "an 
entire polar night."<P>

A second study, "Independent 
Assessment of HAARP Effects on the Upper 
atmosphere" by R. Roble, also concluded that
"there would be no measurable effeffects to
the Earth's ozone layer." The FEIS indtified 
this study as having been provided by
MRC. The study was described as consisting
of "one page."<P>

The authors of the <A HREF="journal.html">Journal's</A> HAARP story 
remain convinced that the potential 
impacts of Project HAARP deserve a through 
scientific and public hearing.<P>

<H2>HAARP Update</H2>

Armed Service Committee chairman 
Ron Dellums (D-CA), formally invited the 
Pentagon to respond to the issues raised in

<TITLE>EIJ Fall 94: ARCO, Eastlund and the Roots of HAARP</TITLE>
<H2>Fall 1994- ARCO, Eastlund and the Roots of HAARP</H2>
<H3>By Gar Smith</H3>
All atomic and electronic technologies -- from household appliances to nuclear weapons -- radiate energetic particles. While the immediate impacts of human-caused electromagnetic pollution are generally imperceptible, the long-term consequences for the biosphere can be profound.<P>

In 1988, <I>OMNI</I> magazine raised concerns about the environmental consequences of a bizarre electromagnetic invention. According to <I>OMNI</I>, ARCO, the US oil giant, found itself wondering what to do with the estimated 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that it hoped to extract from Alaska's North Slope. While this was enough energy to supply the US for a year, the gas fields were too far from any potential customers. ARCO concluded that it would be too expensive to liquefy the gas and ship it thousands of miles to urban centers. What was needed was a client that wanted access to vast amounts of energy on-site -- in the wilds of Alaska.<P>

Bernard Eastland, an MIT and Columbia University physicist with eight years experience with the Atomic Energy Commission, came to the rescue with an extraordinary plan to use the energy "at the point of production." <P>

Eastland, who soon became president of ARCO's Production Technologies International Company in Houston, proposed burning the vast Alaskan gas fields to power a huge electric generator. The resulting power would be directed into a huge antenna complex, 40 miles on a side. The antennae would be used to focus an intense beam of electromagnetic energy into the upper atmosphere where it would collide with the ionosphere to create a phenomenon called the "mirror force." Eastland was granted a US Patent (# 4,686,605) for this invention on August 11, 1987.<P>

"You can virtually lift part of the upper atmosphere," Eastland told <I>OMNI</I>, "You can make it move, do things to it." One of the tricks Eastland envisioned involved "surgically" distorting the ionosphere to disrupt global communications. Pushing the upper atmosphere around might also generate high-altitude "drag" that could heat and deflect enemy missiles or surround them with "high-energy electrons" that might cause the missiles to detonate in mid-trajectory.<P>

The proposal appealed to the Pentagon, which invested several hundred thousand dollars "evaluating" Eastland's work. Eastland maintained that there were "peaceful" uses for his technology. In one scenario, he explained how beams of electromagnetic power could lift portions of the upper atmosphere and redirect the jetstream to alter global weather patterns. Using "plumes of atmospheric particles to act as a lens or focusing device," Eastland proposed redirecting sunlight and heat to different parts of the Earth's surface, making it possible to manipulate wind patterns, cause rainstorms in Ethiopia, drive hurricanes out of the Caribbean, incinerate airborne industrial pollution and sew up the hole in the Antarctic ozone layer.<P>

"Because the upper atmosphere is extremely sensitive to small changes in its composition," <I>OMNI</I> cautioned, "merely testing an Eastland Device could cause irreversible damage."<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Winter 94: The Greening of Cuba</TITLE>

<H1>The Greening of Cuba <I>by Peter Rosset with Shea Cunningham</I></H1>

<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Winter 94<BR> Vol. 10 Issue 1<BR> p23 <HR>



Times are hard in Cuba: the collapse of the socialist bloc has

led to an estimated 85 percent, drop in exports, imports and foreign

aid; a situation that is exacerbated by the US trade embargo.

While in the mid-80s less than 20 consumer items were rationed

in Cuba, now almost everything is. Some estimates indicate that

the population's food intake may have dropped by as much as 30

percent since 1989.<P>



In spite of this economic crisis, there have been some remarkable

and promising innovations in Cuba. The state farm sector has been

privatized in the form of workers' cooperatives. In response to

a huge drop in pesticide and fertilizer imports, Cuban agriculture

is being transformed. Cuba is presently in the third year of the

largest national conversion from conventional agriculture to largescale

alternative farming in history.<P>



For decades, Cuba depended on its socialist trading partners for

petroleum, industrial equipment and supplies, and foodstuffs.

When trade relations with the socialist bloc collapsed in 1990,

pesticide and fertilizer imports dropped by roughly 80 percent

and food imports fell by more than a half. Now the enormous challenges

facing Cuba are to double food production, halve inputs and maintain

food export production to avoid worsening its foreign exchange

balance.<P>



Fortunately, Cuba has certain advantages. With only two percent

of Latin America's population, it has 11 percent of its scientists

and a well-developed research infrastructure, including research

experience in alternative agriculture.<P>



The alternative agriculture movement took hold among Cuban researchers

as early as 1982 and many promising research results -which had

previously remained relatively unused -- were available for immediate

and widespread implementation in the transition from conventional

agriculture.<P>



Planning authorities in the Ministry of Agriculture have officially

declared that all new agricultural development be based on the

&quot;alternative model.&quot; This concept contrasts with the

&quot;classical model&quot; of conventional agriculture, which

is characterized by highly mechanized farming methods and monocultures

of foreign crop species that are primarily cultivated for export

and require imported agricultural inputs.<P>



The alternative model promotes ecologically sustainable production

by replacing the dependence on mechanical farming equipment and

chemical inputs with animal traction, crop and pasture rotation,

soil conservation, organic soil inputs, biological pest control,

and &quot;biofertilizers&quot; and &quot;biopesticides&quot; (microbial

pesticides and fertilizers that are non-toxic to humans). This

method requires the reincorporation of rural populations into

agriculture by using their labor, as well as their knowledge of

traditional farming techniques, and their active participation

in generating new, more appropriate technologies.<P>



This model is designed to stem the flood of rural migrants into

urban areas and to provide food security for the nation. It is

virtually identical to alternatives proposed in the US, Latin

America, Europe and elsewhere, differing principally in one key

respect: while it represents a utopian vision for many, it is

now government policy and agricultural practice in Cuba.<P>



The Cuban Association for Organic Farming, (a local nongovernmental

organization composed of ecological-agricultural activists), is

working with the Advanced Institute for Agricultural Sciences

of Havana, the Institute for Food and Development Policy and the

University of California to document the transformation of Cuban

agriculture and evaluate the efficacy of the new technologies

by looking at economic productivity and environmental and social

indicators.<P>



Large-scale conversion to organic farming can take between three

and five years to achieve previous levels of productivity. Cuban

scientists and planners hope to accelerate this process by using

sophisticated biotechnology techniques, such as the mass production

of naturally occurring local organisms to create biopesticides

and biofertilizers. Among the alternative tactics being used for

pest control, the most important are conventional biological controls

based on mass releases of parasitic and predatory insects and

the use of biopesticides.<P>



Cuba produces numerous formulations of bacterial and fungal diseases

that attack insect pests. These are applied to crops in lieu of

chemical insecticides. At present, 218 biotechnology centers are

located on agricultural cooperatives, where the workers are typically

people in their twenties who were born on the cooperative and

have received some university-level training. Industrial production

of these biopesticides is under way for larger- scale operations

aimed at export crops. Many biopesticides are applied to crops

in place of chemical insecticides.<P>



Cuba is also one of the world leaders in the use of biofertilizers,

including the standard Rhizobium inoculants for leguminous crops,

as well as free-living bacteria that make atmospheric nitrogen

available for non-legumes, and solubilizing bacteria that liberate

phosphorus for uptake by plants.<P>



It is unclear whether the widespread implementation of an alternative

model of agricultural development will, in conjunction with other

government policies, allow Cuba to emerge from the crisis wrought

by the collapse of the socialist bloc. The experiment in alternative

agricultural currently underway in Cuba is unprecedented, with

potentially enormous implications for other countries suffering

from the declining sustainability of conventional agricultural

production.

<TITLE>EIJ Winter 94: Eleven Inherent Rules of Corporate Behavior</TITLE>

<H1>Eleven Inherent Rules of Corporate Behavior <I>by Jerry Mander</I></H1>

<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Winter 94<BR> Vol. 10 Issue 1<BR> p30+ <HR>



<I>The following list is an attempt to articulate the obligatory

rules by which corporations operate. Some of the rules overlap,

but taken together they help reveal why corporations behave as

they do and how they have come to dominate their environment and

the human beings within it.</I> <P>





1. <B>The Profit Imperative</B>: Profit is the ultimate measure of all

corporate decisions. It takes precedence over community well-

being, worker health, public health, peace, environmental preservation

or national security. Corporations will even find ways of trading

with national &quot;enemies&quot; -- Libya, Iran, the former Soviet

Union, Cuba -- when public policy abhors it. The profit imperative

and the growth imperative are the most fundamental corporate drives;

together they represent the corporation's instinct to &quot;live.&quot;<P>





2. <B>The Growth Imperative</B>: Corporations live or die by whether

they can sustain growth. On this depends relationships to investors,

to the stock market, to banks and to public perception. The growth

imperative also fuels the corporate desire to find and develop

scarce resources in obscure parts of the world.<P>





This effect is now clearly visible, as the world's few remaining

pristine places are sacrificed to corporate production. The peoples

who inhabit these resource-rich regions are similarly pressured

to give up their traditional ways and climb on the wheel of productionconsumption.

Corporate planners consciously attempt to bring &quot;less developed

societies into the modern world&quot; to create infrastructures

for development, as well as new workers and new consumers. Corporations

claim that they do this for altruistic reasons -- to raise the

living standard -- but corporations have no altruism.<P>





Theoretically, privately held corporations -- those owned by individuals

or families -- do not have the imperative to expand. In practice,

however, the behavior is the same. Such privately held giants

as Bechtel Corporation have shown no propensity to moderate growth.<P>





3. <B>Competition and Aggression</B>: Corporations place every person

in management in fierce competition with each other. Anyone interested

in a corporate career must hone his or her ability to seize the

moment. This applies to gaining an edge over another company or

over a colleague within the company. As an employee, you are expected

to be part of the &quot;team,&quot; but you also must be ready

to climb over your own colleagues.<P>





Corporate ideology holds that competition improves worker incentive

and corporate performances and therefore benefits society. Our

society has accepted this premise utterly. Unfortunately, however,

it also surfaces in personal relationships. Living by standards

of competition and aggression on the job, human beings have few

avenues to express softer, more personal feelings. (In politics,

non- aggressive behavior is interpreted as weakness.)<P>





4. <B>Amorality</B>: Not being human, corporations do not have morals

or altruistic goals. So decisions that may be antithetical to

community goals or environmental health are made without suffering

misgivings. In fact, corporate executives praise &quot;non emotionality&quot;

as a basis for &quot;objective&quot; decision- making.<P>





Corporations, however, seek to hide their amorality, and attempt

to act as if they were altruistic. Lately, there has been a concerted

effort by American industry to seem concerned with environmental

cleanups, community arts, or drug programs. Corporate efforts

that seem altruistic are really public relations ploys or directly

self-serving projects.<P>





There has recently been a spurt of corporate advertising about

how corporations work to clean the environment. A company that

installs offshore oil rigs will run ads about how fish are thriving

under the rigs. Logging companies known for their clearcutting

practices will run millions of dollars' worth of ads about their

&quot;tree farms.&quot;<P>





It is a fair rule of thumb that corporations tend to advertise

the very qualities they do not have in order to allay negative

public perceptions. When corporations say &quot;we care,&quot;

it is almost always in response to the widespread perception that

they do not have feelings or morals.<P>





If the benefits do not accrue, the altruistic pose is dropped.

When Exxon realized that its cleanup of the Alaskan shores was

not easing the public rage about the oil spill, it simply dropped

all pretense of altruism and ceased working.<P>





5. <B>Hierarchy</B>: Corporate laws require that corporations be structured

into classes of superiors and subordinated within a centralized

pyramidal structure: chairman, directors, Chief Executive officer,

vice presidents, division managers, and so on. The efficiency

of this hierarchical form (which also characterizes the military,

the government and most institutions in our society) is rarely

questioned.<P>





The effect on society from all organizations adopting hierarchical

form is to make it seem natural that we have all been placed within

a national pecking order. Some jobs are better than others, some

lifestyles are better than others, some neighborhoods, some races,

some kinds of knowledge. Men over women. Westerners over non Westerners.

Humans over nature.<P>





That effective, non-hierarchical modes of organization exist on

the planet, and have been successful for millennia, is barely

known by most Americans.<P>





6. <B>Quantification, Linearity and Segmentation</B>: Corporations require

that subjective information be translated into objective form,

i.e., numbers. The subjective or spiritual aspects of forests,

for example, cannot be translated, and so do not enter corporate

equations. Forests are evaluated only as &quot;board feet.&quot;<P>





When corporations are asked to clean up their smokestack emissions,

they lobby to relax the new standards in order to contain costs.

The result is that a predictable number of people are expected

to become sick and die.<P>





The operative corporate standard is not &quot;as safe as humanly

possible,&quot; but rather, &quot;as safe as possible commensurate

with maintaining acceptable profit.&quot;<P>





7. <B>Dehumanization</B>: In the great majority of corporations, employees

are viewed as ciphers, as cogs in the wheel, replaceable by others

or by machines.<P>





As for management employees, not subject to quite the same indignities,

they nonetheless must practice a style of decision making that

&quot;does not let feelings get in the way.&quot; This applies

as much to firing employees as it does to dealing with the consequences

of corporate behavior in the environment or the community.<P>





8. <B>Exploitation</B>: All corporate profit is obtained by a simple

formula: Profit equals the difference between the amount paid

to an employee and the economic value of the employee's output,

and/or the difference between the amount paid for raw materials

used in production (including costs of processing), and the ultimate

sales price of the processed raw materials. Karl Marx was right:

a worker is not compensated for full value of his or her labor;

neither is the raw-material supplier. The owners of capital skim

off part of the value as profit. Profit is based on underpayment.<P>





Capitalists argue that this is a fair deal, since both workers

and the people who mine or farm the resources (usually in Third

World environments) get paid. But this arrangement is inherently

imbalanced. The owner of the capital -- the corporation or the

bank -- always obtains additional benefit. While the worker makes

a wage, the owner of capital gets the benefit of the worker's

labor, plus the surplus profit the worker produces, which is then

reinvested to produce yet more surplus.<P>





9. <B>Ephemerality</B>: Corporations exist beyond time and space: they

are legal creations that only exist on paper. They do not die

a natural death; they outlive their own creators. They have no

commitment to locale, employees or neighbors. Having no morality,

no commitment to place and no physical nature (a factory, while

being a physical entity, is not the corporation), a corporation

can relocate all of its operations at the first sign of inconvenience

-- demanding employees, high taxes and restrictive environmental

laws. The traditional ideal of community engagement is antithetical

to corporate behavior.<P>





10. <B>Opposition to Nature</B>: Though individuals who work for corporations

may personally love nature, corporations themselves, and corporate

societies, are intrinsically committed to intervening in, altering

and transforming nature. For corporations engaged in commodity

manufacturing, profit comes from transmogrifying raw materials

into saleable forms. Metals from the ground are converted into

cars. Trees are converted into boards, houses, furniture and paper

products. Oil is converted into energy. In all such energy, a

piece of nature is taken from where it belongs and processed into

a new form. All manufacturing depends upon intervention and reorganization

of nature. After natural resources are used up in one part of

the globe, the corporation moves on to another part.<P>





This transformation of nature occurs in all societies where manufacturing

takes place. But in capitalist, corporate societies, the process

is accelerated because capitalist societies and corporations must

grow by extracting resources from nature and reprocessing them

at an ever-quickening pace. Meanwhile, the consumption end of

the cycle is also accelerated by corporations that have an interest

in convincing people that commodities bring material satisfaction.

Inner satisfaction, self-sufficiency, contentment in nature or

a lack of a desire to acquire wealth are subversive to corporate

goals.<P>





Banks finance the conversion of nature; insurance companies help

reduce the financial risks involved. Of course, on a finite planet,

the process cannot continue indefinitely.<P>





11. <B>Homogenization</B>: American rhetoric claims that commodity society

delivers greater choice and diversity than other societies. &quot;Choice&quot;

in this context means product choice in the marketplace: many

brands to choose from and diverse features on otherwise identical

products. Actually, corporations have a stake in all of us living

our lives in a similar manner, achieving our pleasures from things

that we buy in a world where each family lives isolated in a single

family home and has the same machines as every other family on

the block. Recently, the &quot;singles&quot; phenomenon has proved

even more productive than the nuclear family, since each person

duplicates the consumption patterns of every other person.<P>





Lifestyles and economic systems that emphasize sharing commodities

and work, that do not encourage commodity accumulation or that

celebrate non-material values, are not good for business. People

living collectively, sharing such hard goods as washing machines,

cars and appliances (or worse, getting along without them) are

outrageous to corporate commodity society.<P>





Native societies -- which celebrate an utterly non-material relationship

to life, the planet and the spirit -- are regarded as backward,

inferior and unenlightened. We are told that they envy the choices

we have. To the degree these societies continue to exist, they

represent a threat to the homogenization of worldwide markets

and culture. Corporate society works hard to retrain such people

in attitudes and values appropriate to corporate goals.<P>





In the undeveloped parts of the world, where corporations are

just arriving, the ideological retraining process is just getting

under way. Satellite communications technology, which brings Western

television and advertising, is combined with a technical infrastructure

to speed up the pace of development. Most of this activity is

funded by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,

as well as agencies such as US Agency for International Development,

the Inter-American Bank and the Asian-American Bank, all of which

serve multinational corporate enterprise.<P>





The ultimate goal of corporate multinationals was expressed in

a revealing quote by the president of Nabisco Corporation &quot;One

world of homogeneous consumption... [I am] looking forward to

the day when Arabs and Americans, Latinos and Scandinavians, will

be munching Ritz crackers as enthusiastically as they already

drink Coke or brush their teeth with Colgate.&quot;<P>





In the book, Trilateralism, editor Holly Sklar wrote: &quot;Corporations

not only advertise products, they promote lifestyles rooted in

consumption, patterned largely after the United States.... [They]

look forward to a post-national age in which [Western] social,

economic and political values are transformed into universal values...

a world economy in which all national economies beat to the rhythm

or transnational corporate capitalism.... The Western way is the

good way; national culture is inferior.&quot;



<H2>Form Is Content</H2>





Corporations are inherently bold, aggressive and competitive.

Though they exist in a society that claims to operate by moral

principles, they are structurally amoral. It is inevitable that

they will dehumanize people who work for them and dehumanize the

overall society as well. They are disloyal to workers, including

their own managers. Corporations can be disloyal to the communities

they may have been part of for many years. Corporations do not

care about nations; they live beyond boundaries. They are intrinsically

committed to destroying nature. And they have an inexorable, unabatable,

voracious need to grow and to expand. In dominating other cultures,

in digging up the Earth, corporations blindly follow the codes

that have been built into them as if they were genes.<P>





We must abandon the idea that corporations can reform themselves.

To ask corporate executives to behave in a morally defensible

manner is absurd. Corporations, and the people within them, are

following a system of logic that leads inexorably toward dominant

behaviors. To ask corporations to behave otherwise is like asking

an army to adopt pacifism.<P>

<H2><I> A People's Alternative to Structural Adjustment</I></H2>



<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Winter 94<BR> Vol. 10 Issue 1<BR> p27+ <HR>



Davison Budhoo:<BLOCKQUOTE>"Today I resigned from the staff of the

International Monetary Fund after over 12 years and after 1000 days of official

fund work in the field, hawking your medicine and your bag of tricks to

governments and to peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa. To

me, resignation is a priceless liberation, for with it I have taken the first

big step to that place where I may hope to wash my hands of what in my mind's

eye is the blood of millions of poor and starving peoples. Mr. Camdessus, the

blood is so much, you know, it runs in rivers. It dries up too; it cakes all

over me; sometimes I feel that there is not enough soap in the whole world to

cleanse me from the things that I did in your name and in the name of your

predecessors, and under your official seal."</BLOCKQUOTE> <P>



With these words, Davison Budhoo, a senior economist with the International

Monetary Fund (IMF) for more than 12 years, publicly resigned in May, 1988. A

native Grenadian, Budhoo received his degree from the London School of

Economics. He joined the staff of the World Bank in 1966 and later shifted to

the IMF, where he was responsible for designing and implementing Structural

Adjustment Programs (SAPs) for African, Latin American and Caribbean nations.

His 100-plus page open letter to Michel Camdessus, managing director of the

IMF, titled "Enough is Enough," sent shock waves around the world, making front

page headlines in many countries (but not in the US).<P>







Budhoo was the first person to break the IMF's code of silence regarding

internal affairs by exposing extensive statistical fraud carried out by the

fund in Trinidad and Tobago during 1985- 1987.<P>







The IMF and World Bank are separate institutions with distinct roles. While the

bank makes loans for development projects, the IMF lends to governments to ease

deficits and make their economies appear stable to the international market.

The World Bank was created in April 1944 as a lending institution composed of

member governments to help rebuild post-war economies. The IMF was created to

restructure and organize the Western market system of member nations by

promoting international economic cooperation and trade, and by encouraging

stable currencies.<P>





The bank introduced Structural Adjustment Programs in 1980 to increase export

production in debtor nations to provide cash for debt-service payment. Under

"structural adjustment," developing countries typically are required to devalue

their currency; dramatically cut spending on social services, medical care and

education; eliminate barriers to foreign multinationals and trade; privatize

national assets; deregulate business; decrease wages; restrict credit and raise

interest rates.<P>





Due to the radical reorganization of national economies people in "SAPed"

countries often pay for their governments' loans with extreme poverty, hunger

and disease. Using figures provided by UNICEF and UNDP, the editors of the

IMF-World Bank Watchdog estimated that more than six million children under the

age of five have died each year since 1982 in Africa, Asia and Latin America as

a result of IMF/World Bank policies.<P>





SAPs often carry heavy ecological costs as well. The forced privatization of

nationalized industries and public or communal lands often opens Third World

countries to opportunistic multinational corporations resulting in degraded (or

destroyed) and polluted environments. Placing the emphasis on exports rather

than local needs in a time of falling world commodity prices results in

exploitation and depletion of oil, minerals, forests and other natural

resources.<P>





Even though debtor countries paid out more than $1.3 trillion to the IMF

between 1982 and 1990, they were still 61 percent more in the hole in the 1990s

than they were in 1982. According to the 1988 UNICEF annual report, the debt

and interest payments by Southern countries equaled more than three times the

total amount of aid provided by the World Bank and IMF.<P>





"Under structural adjustment, the IMF and the World Bank do not merely

supervise individual sectors of the economy as in the past... they now manage

each country entirely," said an official of the Institute for African

Alternatives. "They have to approve annual national budgets... monetary, trade

and fiscal policies, and give clearance certificates before countries can

negotiate with other foreign lending agencies."<P>





During his years at the World Bank and IMF, Budhoo learned that core staff

members are "successors of colonial civil servants." Pointedly observing that

South Africa is administered by the European Department, not the African

department, Budhoo concludes that "our staff is the logical consequence... of

the prevailing 1944 international ethos of 'superior man' and 'inferior man,'

and the white man and his system to be saved and nurtured, and the black/brown

colonized man to be overlooked and cast aside...".<P>





IMF staff receive six-figure salaries along with generous perks, including

subsidies for travel and foreign work, and housing and education for family

members. A staffer on assignment in the South often receives more than the

basic pay of any head-of- state. Newly recruited staff are often wined and

dined, offered fat consultancy fees and lucrative, tax-free salaries to lure

them into compliance with the IMF against what may be their better judgment.

The promise of becoming a member of the "new nobility of Earth" can be

overpowering.



<H2>IMF Statistical Fraud</H2>





In his 1994 book, Dark Victory, Walden Bello reveals how the Reagan and

Thatcher administrations in the 1980s launched a global offensive to

"subordinate" developing nations by "rolling back the gains that had been made

by the South from the 1950s through the 1970s... decades marked by high

economic growth, successful struggles of national liberation and the coming

together of Southern states to demand a 'New International Economic Order' that

would entail a more equitable distribution of global economic power."<P>





Budhoo recalled how, at one IMF board of directors meeting, then- President

Ronald Reagan declared that the sole duty of the IMF was to convert all

countries to freewheeling Western market economies. Reagan's declaration

signaled that the IMF no longer had to operate under the guise of

"development," or alleviating poverty or any other humanist philosophy.<P>





A key IMF economic indicator used to evaluate a nation's economy is the index

of Relative Unit of Labor Cost (RULC), which compares the competitiveness of a

developing country's manufacturing-labor costs to those of industrialized

nations. A rising RULC means that the costs of a country's manufactured exports

are increasing. The IMF prescription for high RULC is currency devaluation to

lower the expense of exports. The RULC formula was particularly important in

the IMF's appraisal of Trinidad and Tobago when, in 1986, the bottom fell out

of the oil market, the sector accounting for the majority of the country's

export earnings.<P>





A healthy RULC would have indicated that Trinidad and Tobago could successfully

diversify its export base and service its foreign debt. However, IMF reports

for Trinidad and Tobago for 1985-1987 indicated extraordinary RULC increases.

This became the pretext for massive currency devaluation, cuts in government

expenditures and a freeze on public sector wages. But these figures were

false.<P>





In his letter, Budhoo wrote, "What we had done over these years was to

'manufacture' statistical indices -- the RULC and several others -- that would

allow us to prove our point and push a particular policy line, irrespective of

economic realities and circumstances of the country."<P>





The IMF more than doubled Trinidad and Tobago's RULC figures, even though data

were available to enable the staff to calculate the RULC accurately. Even after

Budhoo made the staff aware of its "miscalculations" and senior officials

acknowledged the accuracy of his figures, the IMF refused to admit any error.

Instead, it deleted all references to the index from its report.<P>





The "statistical trickery" resulted in what Budhoo describe as "the sudden and

dramatic freezing up of virtually all foreign funding... [T]he choice that we

have given the government is either to accept our 'deadliest medicine' or to go

it alone as an international outcast. Either way, the consequences are

accelerating economic chaos and ultimate social disintegration."<P>





Budhoo noted that Trinidad and Tobago "only one country from the host of Third

World nations where we are perpetrating the same economic nonsense, with the

same catastrophic consequences."



<H2>A People's Program for Change</H2>





The World Bank's current focus on democratization projects is a sham, Budhoo

charges, designed to convince NGOs that the World Bank is capable of reforming

itself. He believes that reform suggestions, such as demands for "more

participation" and "more accountability," are mostly cosmetic and too

general.<P>





Many experts on multi-lateral lending institutions (including the Peoples'

Tribunal on IMF-World Bank Crimes Against Humanity and Sweden's official aid

agency, SIDA) have called for the abolition of the IMF and World Bank. While

Budhoo feels this is "fully justified", he has concluded that "it will never

happen." he said. So in 1991, Budhoo founded the Bretton Woods Reform

Organization International (BWROI) to launch a campaign to make the World Bank

and IMF more accountable to Southern countries.<P>





BWRO's brand of "reform"` supports the kind of change that will only come about

in response to widespread pressure from those most affected by IMF/World Bank

policies.<P>





In October 1993, in history's largest public demonstration, 500,000 Indians

protested IMF/World Bank agricultural policies and GATT. Budhoo predicts more

"massive participation and massive demonstrations" in India and the Philippines

in the months to come.<P>





BWRO's objectives include:



<UL>



<LI>alternatives to IMF/World Bank SAPs,<P>



<LI>seeking IMF accountability for statistical fraud in Trinidad and Tobago<P>



<LI>creating a Third World Watchdog Committee to assist in negotiations and

interactions with the IMF/World Bank and,<P>



<LI>democratizing macroeconomic decision-making in the South



</UL>





The BWROIs most ambitious effort is the Alternative Structural Adjustment

Program (ASAP), which Budhoo calls "a people's economic program with equity."

Until now, SAPed countries had no concrete alternatives to IMF policies. As an

economist and an insider, however, Budhoo knows that technical expertise is the

IMF/World Bank's Achilles heel. "The technical work at the IMF/World Bank is

really pathetic," he claims. "They cannot justify, in economic terms, the costs

of their projects and they can't stand up to technical scrutiny."<P>





The Third World Watchdog Committee (TWWC), BWRO's technical arm, has begun to

confront the IMF/World Bank on a professional and technical level. "We are

trying to destroy the World Bank/IMF as technical institutions by doing what

they say they're doing -- only we need to do it better," Budhoo has said.<P>





The TWWC's major role has been designing ASAPs on behalf of citizen

organizations and Third World governments. The expertise of committee members

like Ramesh Ramsaran (a former IMF consultant and a consultant to the European

Secretariat in charge of negotiating European aid structure to the Caribbean)

and Morris Miller (former executive director of the World Bank for Canada and

the English- Speaking Caribbean, and former executive director of the Caribbean

Development Bank) ensure that the ASAPs will be able to withstand IMF

scrutiny.<P>





According to BWROI's project director (and Davison's brother) Patrick Budhoo,

creating an ASAP "involves democratically designing a comprehensive, highly

visible and quantifiable economic policy to meet the basic needs of the entire

population" with a clear time frame for implementation.<P>





ASAPs are flexible -- able to accommodate the dynamics of change, ranging from

natural disasters to economic or political upheavals -- and responsive to the

needs of ordinary people.<P>





BWROI develops rural agriculture to create greater food security; linkages with

rural non-agricultural production; a broad economic base with priority given to

small-scale, labor-intensive, high value-added enterprises; improvement of

appropriate rural infrastructure including roads, communications, affordable

energy and technology; and friendly credit, using "Grameen-type" banks that

make small loans for income-producing activities to typically disenfranchised

people, particularly women, at no or low interest rates, using a

peer-group-lending process.<P>





BWROI does not support exporting primary resources and commodities like

Minerals and grains. Export of non-traditional fruits, vegetables and exotic

flowers is acceptable provided that their cultivation is not at the expense of

traditional crops needed by residents.<P>





In 1993, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, India and the Philippines started

initiating ASAPs. Project descriptions for Mexico, Costa Rica, Kenya and Uganda

are underway, and the TWWC has been invited to prepare project descriptions for

Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Jamaica, the

Dominican Republic, Brazil, Peru and Nicaragua.



<H2>Guyana Leads the Way</H2>





In August 1993, the citizens and government of Guyana joined forces with BWROI

to create the world's first ASAP. Guyana is the most heavily indebted country

in the world. It has a foreign debt equivalent to 650 percent of its total

gross domestic product and it is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere,

surpassing even Haiti.<P>





Guyana was once considered one of the more prosperous countries in the

Caribbean region. However, following independence from Britain in 1966, a

corrupt civilian dictatorship (led by Forbes Burnham until 1985 and propped up

by the US, the IMF and the World Bank) succeeded in placing 80 percent of all

economic activity under state control.<P>





Mismanagement and "cronyism" resulted in the country's inability to meet its

export quotas for North American and European markets in the 1970s. An

agreement negotiated with the IMF in 1978 reduced Guyana's budget, but caused a

drastic decline in all sectors of the economy and a corresponding 40 percent

rise in unemployment.<P>





From a ratio of 1:4 (US:Guyana) in 1980, the Guyanese dollar is now valued at

1:130, making it virtually worthless. Since 1988, 80 percent of revenues and 60

percent of foreign earnings have gone into servicing and repaying its foreign

debt. In the late 1980s, and under World Bank supervision, Burnham implemented

an economic recovery program that removed the last barriers to foreign control

over key sectors of the economy. This mainly benefiting foreign investors and

multinationals.<P>





The political tide turned in 1992 when, in the nation's first free elections in

30 years, voters elected President Cheddi Jagan of the People's Progressive

Party (PPP). (President Jagan, a Marxist, had been Guyana's first native-born

Prime Minister in 1953, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered

the government dissolved. In 1961, Jagan's overtures to President John F.

Kennedy were rebuffed and a covert CIA operation drove Jagan out of power.)<P>





Despite good intentions, the PPP was powerless to implement necessary social

and economic reforms due to requirements imposed by the IMF, so the Guyanese,

working with BWROI, established a National Committee(renamed BWRO/Guyana in

late 1994) to oversee the creation of an ASAP "for short-term financial

stabilization and longterm economic and social development."<P>





After receiving BWROI's ASAP Debt Strategy Paper in May 1992, Jagan wrote to

the IMF's Camdessus to plead for debt relief. In a press conference held in

Guyana, Jagan stated, "It is ridiculous to expect real growth in the economy if

we have to continue paying these debts."<P>





In May, 1994, President Jagan and government officials met with Patrick Budhoo

and the Guyana National Committee and issued a resolution declaring the IMF

program for Guyana "massively flawed and inappropriate." The government also

agreed to cancel negotiations with the IMF pending the "conclusions and

recommendations of the people's ASAP."<P>





The International Debt Tribunal (IDT), chaired by Jan Pronk, Minister for

Development Cooperation of the Netherlands, will propose an equitable solution

to Guyana's debt crisis, a critical step if the country is to implement the

ASAP. The IDT will pay special attention to the origins of Guyana's foreign

debt, its structure and growth, its legal basis and legitimacy. Another crucial

step will be getting Guyana classified as a Least Developed Country (LDC) by

the UN, which would entitle Guyana to substantial debt relief and other

concessions not currently available.



<H2>A Rainforest Tribunal</H2>





Money-poor Guyana is rich in natural resources -- bauxite, gold and diamonds --

and has some of the most extensive remaining rainforests in the world (9.1

million hectares or 22.4 million acres).<P>





According to the World Rainforest Movement, approximately 80 percent of

Guyana's forests have been leased for exploitation by multinationals -- many of

them, Asian-based firms responsible for deforestating rainforests in the

Philippines, Malaysia and New Guinea. Under IMF "conditionalities," Guyana now

offers multinationals a ten-year exemption from all taxes -- income,

withholding, property, import and timber. A recent critical addition to the

Guyana ASAP is the appointment of an International Rainforest Tribunal (IRT) to

make recommendations for the renegotiation of the government's agreements with

logging and mining multinationals.<P>





The IRT will declassify secret contracts between the government and

multinational companies, work to reform the Forestry Commission, Mines

Commission, help to revive the Guyanese Natural Resources Agency, and ensure

the Indigenous Amerindian land titles will be honored.<P>





"Guyana is important," Budhoo says, "because we need to show... that we can use

peoples' participation and economic technical skills to push through the ASAP.

It must only be the first of many."<P>





When the Guyana ASAP was presented at European Parliamentary hearings in

Brussels last June, representatives from Poland, the Caribbean, the Philippines

and Latin America expressed support. Budhoo expects the IMP to accept the ASAP

by year-end. In November, Antigua and Trinidad and Tobago initiated ASAPs.

Adoption of ASAPs in those two nations, Budhoo states, "would change the

international equation overnight."<P>





However, the big splash will come in late 1995 when India and the Philippines

are expected to stand up to the international lending community to enact

ASAPs.<P>





Surprisingly few US activists are aware of BWROI and the South's new economic

initiative. It is no accident that Budhoo's resignation and BWROI's work are

practically secrets in the US, while they are major news in Europe and the

Third World.<P>





The "powers that be" want us to believe we have no influence on their policies

and actions. The Guyanese people know differently and face incredible risks by

acting on this knowledge. How can we do less?<P>





As Budhoo so passionately wrote in 1988, "we are not speaking about technical

problems in international finance... we're speaking about our role in shaping

the destiny of humankind... about the legacy that we will leave to generation

upon generation yet unborn...."<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Winter 94: Organic Farmers VS. Malathion</TITLE>
<H1>Organic Farmers VS. Malathion<I>by John Sterling</I></H1>

<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Winter 94<BR> Vol. 10 Issue 1<BR> p20 <HR>

Last October, as the California Department 
of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) began its 
annual ritual of aerial spraying to eradicate 
the Mediterranean fruit fly from Southern 
California, environmentalists renewed the 
call for an end to the spraying program, 
claiming that it discriminates against organic 
farmers and that it does not work.<P>

	Spraying of the pesticide malathion began 
in Ventura County after more than 60 
pregnant "medflies" were found, signaling 
a threat to the region's citrus and avocado 
crops. There are at least two organic farms 
inside the spraying area. Under the California 
Organic Foods Act, any farm contaminated 
with synthetic chemicals could 
lose its organic certification for three years.<P>

 "We have no recourse against the spraying," 
said Mary Ann Carpenter, one of the 
affected farmers. "It's our misfortune that 
we farm in a designated spray zone."<P>

	Malathion, a product of the Swiss chemical 
giant, Ciba-Geigy, Ltd., can damage 
both the immune and nervous systems. A 
1991 California Department of Health Services 
report claimed that people exposed to 
malathion were more susceptible to infectious 
diseases such as pneumonia. The EPA 
is concerned that malathion may cause 
permanent eye damage. A Los Angeles 
couple is suing the state, claiming that their 
son was blinded in 1990 after being exposed 
to the pesticide.<P>

Because CDFA has ruled the medfly an 
agricultural emergency, the expense of the 
spraying program is borne by state and 
federal funds, not by the program's primary 
beneficiary -- the agribusiness industry. 
Emergency reactions are notoriously 
expensive and rarely result in lasting 
solutions, noted Pesticide Watch, 
a San Francisco-based environmental organization.<P>

	Medflies have been found in the state
 every year since 1986. Pesticide Watch said 
that the state sprayed the LA basin 153 
times in 1989-90, dumping a total of 509,583 
pounds of the pesticide. Two medflies were 
found one week after the CDFA declared 
that the flies had been eradicated.<P>

"Malathion is not a selective pesticide," said Michael Abelman, an organic
farmer in Goleta. "It may also kill some of the many beneficial insects that
[organic farmers] depend on." Malathion is known to kill ladybugs, which
control aphids.<P>

	California spent roughly $63 million on 
aerial spraying in 1990, while committing 
only $750,000 to non-chemical alternatives. 
Both Abelman and Pesticide Watch 
advocate shifting funds from aerial spraying 
to alternative eradication strategies that 
emphasize biological controls, such as the 
release of predatory insects and sterile medflies.<P>

Pesticide Watch director Joan Clayburgh 
contends that alternatives will be developed 
only after the medfly is declared "established" 
in California, thus stripping its presence of 
emergency status. Without emergency 
funds, agribusiness would have to develop 
less expensive and longer-term solutions.<P>

Non-organic farmers, and state and federal 
politicians, oppose listing the medfly 
as "established" because they fear an embargo 
of US crops by Japan and other Asian 
countries.<P>

The US accepts produce from medfly-host 
countries and Clayburgh believes that 
there is no reason the Asian countries could 
not do the same.<P>

"It's an attitude problem more than an 
insect problem," said Abelman. "We need 
to take a more holistic approach to farming; 
one that preserves organic balance."<P>

<TITLE>EIJ Winter 94: Ban the Boats!</TITLE>
<H1>Ban the Boats! <I>by Justin Lowe and Gar Smith</I></H1>
<HR> Earth Island Journal.<BR> Winter 94<BR> Vol. 10 Issue 1<BR> p15
<HR>
In his 1994 book, <I>Polluting for Pleasure</I>,a sailboat 
builder Andre Mele makes a persuasive argument 
for the elimination of motorized boating. According to Mele, oil-burning pleasure boats in
the US create "nearly as much atmospheric 
pollution as all of our automobiles and spill 15 
times more oil into our waters than the <I>Exxon 
Valdez</I> -- every year." Mele's book not only
exposes an overlooked environmental culprit, 
it also devotes some practical solutions -- low-resistance 
boats, clean-fuel alternatives 
(including electric and solar-powered boats) and 
strategies to "take back the waterways."<P>

In October, the Environmental Protection 
Agency announced plans to  require 
outboard-motor manufacturers to modify their engines to 
reduce emissions. Outboards represent approximately 
half of all marine engines sold annually
and can release as much uncombusted, 
smog-producing hydrocarbons in an hour as a car 
equipped with emissions-control devices produces 
in 40 hours. The EPA estimates that 
outboards account for three percent of all 
hydrocarbon and nitrous oxide emissions released 
nationwide. The new regulations will be phased 
in between 1998 and 2006.

<TITLE>Myrick's Statement On The Tuna-Dolphin Issue</TITLE>

<H1>Myrick's Statement On The Tuna-Dolphin Issue</H1>
Submitted June 1996
To the House Resources Committee and
Senate Commerce Committee<P> 
 
Statement on Physiological Effects on Dolphins 
Due to Chase and
Capture by the Tuna Industry<P>
 
Albert C. Myrick, Jr., PhD.<BR>
Retired Cetacean Physiologist,
National Marine Fisheries Service<P>
 

Nina Young of the Center for Marine Conservation (CMC) submitted testimony on
Feb. 29, 1996, to the House Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans Subcommittee, that
was sharply critical of my (with other colleagues) dolphin stress research
reports. I strongly contend that the CMC testimony apparently was hastily
prepared without full understanding of stress physiology and without careful
study of the peer reviewed and published accounts of the researches, much of
which has been available in the scientific literature for up to eight years,
that CMC has tried, only now, to discredit. I was not aware of CMC's testimony
until late in March of this year.<P>

In the sciences, it is an obligation or at least a professional courtesy to
notify "errant" authors in advance of the criticisms of their published work,
to permit them an opportunity to consider the offered arguments, and to correct
errors or retract statements. CMC did not do so. It is also a professional
requirement that responsible criticism to scientific reports be screened by a
formal scientific review process to minimize unfounded and irresponsible
argumentation by critics without the necessary qualifications to judge the
evidence in question. CMC did not do so.<P>

Finally, the legitimate forum for serious critical arguments concerning
published reports is in the scientific media, for two reasons:

<UL>

<LI> it helps to
ensure that the criticism has some merit and requires a serious response to the
criticism from the author<P>

<LI>it permits the author to publish the
necessary correction, clarification, or rebuttal response to the criticism, so
the interested readership can judge the merits of both arguments or
interpretations fairly. 

</UL>

Again, CMC has chosen not to do so.<P>

Because of this, the CMC testimony is a particularly excellent example of
criticism that is irresponsible, illegitimate, and unprofessional. It has
misrepresented the evidence by the use of reporting errors, omissions, and
misstatements as well as cavalier disposition of important pieces of research
reports; it has chosen a non-scientific forum in which to attack the
preponderance of published Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) dolphin-stress
literature, waiting until now to criticize some of the peer-reviewed reports
that have existed for many years; and it has failed to invite my timely
rebuttal arguments for fair consideration.<P>

All of these "dirty tricks" CMC has used to persuade a preoccupied audience
that the evidence for fishery stress of dolphins is weak and that stress
factors are unworthy of serious consideration during these hearings.<P>

For those of us who are sensitive to the hundreds of thousands of dolphin lives
that already have been lost to the needs of profit, impatience, and expediency
and those that still hang in the balance, it is alarming that an otherwise
well-regarded coalition, that is the CMC and its allies, would try to make such
an important issue disappear by these transparent and disingenuous tactics. It
is understandable that CMC's political agenda may need to disagree with
conclusions reached in documented reports that now form much of the specific
literature. But to argue, as CMC has done, that published evidence of fishery
stress in the dolphins, that they have agreed to view as trivial and
uncompelling, equates to an absence of such stress and such evidence, is as
dangerous to the hearing process as it is unconscionable.<P>

This is especially true when so little is known about the population abundance
and dynamics of the ETP dolphins. In the murkiness of our poor understanding of
causal relationships of fishery and dolphins, the possible implications of the
legitimate reports whose diverse lines of evidence point so consistently to
dolphin stress by perturbation from the persistent fishery are too important to
future evaluations of ETP dolphin population recovery to be argued away and
ignored.<P>

Putting aside the scientific evidence for a moment, from the circumstantial
information about the fishery alone, it seems reasonable to expect the methods 
and persistence of dolphin fishing will generate unavoidable stressors that
kill and impair function of the dolphins it exploits. It seems obvious for
example that the chase of dolphins by a purse seiner, its three to six
speedboats, and commonly its helicopter would cause substantial stress to the
animals. It is conducted at sustained high speeds, usually lasting 20 to 40
minutes.<P>

The purpose of the chase is to scare, exhaust, and otherwise force the dolphins
to submit to maximum control over the school by the fisher. Numbered among the
many aversive factors of the chase are continuous and unavoidable noise;
turbulence; intimidation of close pursuit; forced, prolonged strenuous
exercise; and threatened oxygen deprivation for excited and panting animals
surfacing to breathe. These should be expected to easily cause substantial
stress in most of the animals and very serious stress in the more vulnerable
animals.<P>

We humans can only try to imagine what the full effects of such a chase must be
on even experienced dolphins that have survived previous chases and sets.
However, little reflection should be required, except by the most prideful and
obdurate skeptics among us, to conclude that these conditions are very unlike
those (to paraphrase the words of CMC) of the natural "rigorous marine
environment" under which the dolphins evolved and for which they "are adapted."<P>

If one realizes that 35 years of dolphin fishing is obviously an insufficiently
long evolutionary period for these dolphin populations to become fully "adapted
to cope with many...[of these very extreme sorts of]...human-related
stressors," the CMC arguments seem ludicrous. In my presentations of
dolphin-stress research to college and civic groups, I am often asked why we
find it necessary to uncover evidence of stress in dolphin fishing and its
resulting mortality, when good common sense tells us that they are seriously
stressed and probably many die from it.<P>

To dramatize what may be not an entirely dissimilar "common-sense" scenario for
humans, we might consider a hypothetical example of forced chasing of a mixed
group of unwilling people to run on foot, for half-an-hour, over an unavoidable
course through scattered areas devoid of oxygen for short distances. The humans
are driven by fear of injury or death to run ahead of armored vehicles. These
tanks are moving at unrelenting speeds of 12 to 15 miles per hour, detonating
small explosive charges near, and maneuvering close to would-be stragglers and
escapees to keep the terrified and tiring herd together. The vehicles are
studded with intimidating prods or projections and programmed to force the
human herd into a confining structure, which itself is forebodingly cramped and
unstable and subject to collapse at any moment.<P>

We might now consider a few of the more disturbing questions that might quite
obviously arise from this hypothetical scenario. How many of this human herd of
newborns, young, adults, and elderly males and females of various physical
conditions and susceptibilities might become casualties of fear, strain,
exhaustion, or physiological malfunction before the elapsed half-hour? Would
all such casualties survive long enough to enter the confining structure?<P>

What percentage of the nursing newborns or dependent children in the herd would
eventually succumb if their parental providers became casualties? How many of
the surviving, more resilient members of this human herd might adapt or learn
to habituate to unexpected and repeated episodes of this nature without lasting
harmful effects? Would repeated trials habituate some or all of them to the
aversive stimuli, or would reexposure condition them into more rapid
submission, but sensitize them to a greater level of stress vulnerability?
Beyond some maximum level of psychological and physical training, would it be
possible that some or even many of the human herd still may not "get used to
it?"<P>

Inasmuch as these questions may apply also to dolphin schools chased by purse
seiners, we only have common-sense answers without definitive experimental
proof. Considering that there is almost total scientific ignorance about most
of these questions for dolphins under such extreme stressor conditions, it is
up to us to ask and answer the most relevant obvious question. Is it ethical or
judicious to allow tuna caught with chased dolphins to be labeled "dolphin
safe," when no studies have shown evidence that this is true, and when all of
our common sense tells us that it is not true?<P>

We turn, now, to the more "scientific" part of this presentation and the
question of whether tuna caught with dolphins with no observable dolphin
mortality should be considered "dolphin safe." This question is predicated upon
at least two assumptions that are to some extent testable with current research
techniques.<P>

The first assumption is that any stress sustained by dolphins in tuna fishing
causes little, if any, mortality. This would mean that any uncounted mortality
before capture or after release from the net would be minimal and thus, the
number of dead counted in the closed net would be very near the actual
mortality. The second assumption is that persistent dolphin fishing including
repeated successful and unsuccessful chases and sets do not affect the
dolphins' long-term biology. Thus, their recovery would be expected if counted
annual mortality is held to some small percentage of its estimated population.<P>

Both of these assumptions recently have been called into question implicitly by
results of various studies by Myrick and colleagues that have addressed
different aspects of ETP dolphin biology. Although these studies have not yet
provided definitive answers concerning the full extent to which ETP dolphins
have been and continue to be affected, their results implicate fishery stress
as being associated with dolphin dental resorption, hypocalcemia, delayed
sexual maturity and reduced pregnancy rates, darkened adrenal cortices and
non-entanglement mortality, and enhanced analgesic behavior in the nets. While
various alternative interpretations may explain the results of each study, only
a stress interpretation is consistent with the results of all of the studies.
Since this is the simplest explanation of all of the data, it should be
regarded as having the strongest probability of being the most accurate
interpretation.<P>

This presentation could easily provide a point-by-point explanation of the
inaccuracies, misstatements, and exaggerations, fill in the omissions, correct
the logic, and repair other damage to our understanding of the evidence of ETP
dolphin stress caused by the irresponsible and unscholarly testimony by CMC.
One example, among the litany of inaccuracies, is the suggestion by CMC that
serum-calcium levels much below 9 mg/dl would not be regarded as being low
(hypocalcemia) by most veterinarians and clinicians. This was followed by CMC's
omission of our presented control data for many dolphin species, including
Hawaiian spinner dolphins, which demonstrated average normal serum-calcium for
dolphins as being near 10 mg/dl, the same as for most other normal mammals.<P>

To discuss every point, would be tedious, time consuming, and, in my opinion,
persuasive (and of further embarrassment to CMC). To do so would also suggest
that the forum and methods chosen by CMC to decide the merits of the published
scientific evidence are legitimate. They are not. In fact, to date there has
been no letter, note, or article published in the scientific media that has
disputed or refuted the results of any of evidence that I (and my colleagues)
have published.<P>

Nevertheless, some sort of general response and assurance to this audience is
called for. It already exists in the form of the most recent peer-reviewed and
published paper on ETP dolphin stress (Myrick and Perkins 1995). Its
introduction provides a working clinical definition of the type of stress under
study (i.e., distress), and reviews the arguments for stress and summarizes the
evidence from past studies. It then reports the results of our study that
provide what is the most important and persuasive evidence of the fishing
stress effects of ETP dolphins found thus far. The full article is available to
the studious.<P>

For the purposes of this presentation and its conclusion, I will briefly
discuss some of the Myrick/Perkins paper's more important points of evidence
and their implications.<P>

<B>First</B>, we examined the cortex of adrenal glands from male spinner and spotted
dolphins found dead in purse-seine nets in sets where no entanglement and no
gear contact or malfunction was observed and on which no evidence of injury
(e.g., cuts, scrapes, net marks) to dolphins by entanglement or entrapment was
noted. This strengthened the probability that all or most of our study dolphins
did not die in the nets from suffocation drowning caused by entanglement,
entrapment, or lethal gear-contact.<P>

<B>Second</B>, because the color of the cortex begins to change from lipid-yellow in
non-stressed mammals to lipid-depleted and blood-colored dark reddish brown in
mammals under acute stress after about an hour, and the various chases,
encirclement, and capture stages of the dolphins in our sample ranged between
just under an hour and more than two hours, we reasoned:

<UL>

<LI>that if most of the cortex samples were red (i.e., not yellow), it would
indicate that the dolphins had been under acute stress before they died,<P>

<LI>that an unsuccessful search for lipids and other evidence of non-stress in
the cortex samples corroborate evidence of stress from the red-colored
cortices,<P>

<LI>that if the chase, the encirclement, or the capture for a set was the
source of the acute stress to the dolphins, we would find a significant trend
of reddening and darkening in samples as each or any of those operations
increased in length of time, and<P>

<LI>that if the statistically significant trends in darkening of the cortices
were found, these would support the hypothesis that our dolphins were like most
other mammals inasmuch as they normally had yellow cortices that could darken
under acute stress.

</UL>

<B>Third</B>, the results showed the following:

<UL>

<LI>the cortices of about 95 % of both samples were regarded as darkened and a
study for absence of lipids and other evidence of stress proved positive. This
supported the hypothesis that the dolphins had undergone acute stress for a
sufficient time before death for the evidence to show up in the cortex. In
laboratory rats that survive, this change begins between 30 and 60 minutes
under continuous acute stress, and<P>

<LI>significant trends (P &lt .01) in cortical darkening associated with increased
chase and encirclement length for the spotted dolphins indicated that:<P>

<UL>

<LI>dolphin adrenals are like most other mammals in their normal color and
acute-stress color,<P>

<LI>artifacts of preparation or preservation were not the cause of color
changes, and<P>

<LI>chase and encirclement were continuous acute stressors to the dolphins.<P>

</UL>

</UL>

At least three important implications can be inferred from the results:<P>

<UL>

<LI>If the dolphins were under acute stress as early as the chase, and since
they died in the nets from no other apparent cause, then it is quite possible
that their deaths in the nets were due to or associated with the acute stress.<P>

<LI>Since most of the dolphins that were sampled showed (by their adrenals)
that they had been under acute stress, it seems likely that those members of
the herds that were released alive were under some degree of stress as well.<P>

<LI>As we know from other species of mammals, stress may be lethal in a matter
of a few minutes or hours or days after the stressor has been removed. If the
dolphins died from stress in the nets, then at least some would be expected to
have died before they reached the nets (and sank unobserved). Furthermore,
additional stress mortalities would be expected to have occurred among dolphins
after their release from the nets.

</UL>

This presentation has discussed some of the common-sense, as well as the
scientific, bases for dolphin fishing generated stress in ETP dolphins. It has
given evidence of the likelihood that substantial acute stress is produced by
tuna fishing on dolphins, and it has suggested how dolphin mortality may occur
in sets where no dead dolphins are found in the nets. There is also some
evidence for chronic fishery stress caused by repeated successful and
unsuccessful sets as well as close proximity of dolphins to repeated sets on
other schools, but it is largely circumstantial.<P>

While it is clear that we have much more work to do in order to test the stress
hypotheses further, it should be equally clear that we do not know enough about
these problems and their complexities to make action decisions that may likely
place the dolphin populations in greater jeopardy. Too many dolphins have been
lost in the past because we acted hastily, greedily, and in ignorance. Are we
ready to permit this to happen once again?<P>

<H2>Dr. Roger S. Payne to Members of Congress </H2>
Whale Conservation Institute<BR> 
191 Weston Road<BR>
Lincoln, MA, 01773<P>

Memo: To Members of Congress<P>

Subject: S. 1420 and H.R. 2823, Legislation now being considered by Congress,
would change the official definition of "Dolphin Safe" that is currently in use
to identify canned tuna for consumers, and would reopen the threat to dolphins
from the tuna industry.<P>

Date: February 26, 1996<P>

As President of the Whale Conservation Institute, I have spent the past
twenty-nine years studying whales in the wild. The Whale Conservation Institute
is best known for its discovery that humpback whales sing songs, and that the
calls of fin and blue whales can travel across oceans (a theory now being
demonstrated to be correct). Our institute has trained many of the leaders in
whale research and pioneered many of the benign research techniques now used
around the world. Our research project on the behavior of Argentine right
whales (now in its 27th season) is the longest continuous field study of a
whale species in existence that is based on known individual animals (we
recognize over 1300 whales). I have led over 100 expeditions to all oceans and
have studied every species of large whale in the wild.<P>

As a member (in 1989 and '90) of the National Academy of Sciences/National
Research Council's Committee on Reducing Porpoise Mortality from Tuna Fishing,
I had extensive exposure to the Tuna-Dolphin problem.<P>

I am writing to present my concerns on the above-mentioned legislation because
I believe it could have a strong negative impact on dolphins. I feel strongly
that any legislation which fosters or legitimizes the practice of setting nets
on dolphins is wrong. I believe that we must, instead, foster alternative
fishing techniques which do not require severe disruption and danger to dolphin
populations (several such techniques exist and are used successfully). It has
been conservatively estimated that some dolphin groups spend as many as four
hours per day fleeing boats from the tuna industry.<P>

At present, a "Dolphin-Safe" label on a can of tuna means that the tuna was not
caught by chasing, harassment, encirclement or capture of dolphins by tuna
purse seine nets. It is a conservative and scientifically defensible
definition.<P>

A proposal, by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) and
Congressional legislation (S.1420 and H.R.2823) would weaken the definition of
"Dolphin Safe." The current federal definition excludes the encirclement of
schools of dolphins by purse seine nets. The new definition would allow
chasing, harassing, encircling, and catching of dolphins by purse seine nets,
as long as no dolphins were "observed" to be killed outright in the nets.<P>

This new definition thus ignores the effects on dolphins of direct injuries, as
well as the physiological effects from the stress of repeated capture. Dolphins
released alive may later die from injuries sustained during chase and capture,
and recent evidence suggests that stress from repeated captures disrupts
dolphin societies and causes physiological harm. Despite the decline in
observed dolphin deaths over the past five years, recent research suggests that
the primary target dolphin populations have not shown any signs of recovering
and that target populations of at least two species appear to be declining.<P>

The proposed change of rules also raises questions about observer reliability.
It is probable that dolphin mortality will occur during the chase and capture
which, for various reasons, will not be detected by observers. For example, the
nets are over a mile in length and the observers will remain on the main vessel
during chase, deployment of nets, and final loading of tuna. Further, mixing of
tuna in different holds aboard ship during trips risks confusion and encourages
misleading reporting.<P>

For all of the above reasons, proposed bills S.1420 and H.R.2823 seem to
constitute a significant step backward in what has been one of the major
achievements in the conservation of wild marine mammal populations living in
international waters, and I do not believe that the re-definition of "Dolphin
Safe" would result in procedures that were safe for dolphins, or that would be
defensible on scientific grounds. I cannot support a policy that promotes the
harassing, chasing, encircling, and capturing of dolphins in purse seine nets
and calls it "Dolphin Safe", and I hope that the Congress will not support it
either.<P>

Thank you for your consideration of these concerns.<P>


 Sincerely,<P>

<TITLE>IMMP Winter 96: Norway, Japan, and Iceland Accelerate War on Whales</TITLE>

<H1>Norway, Japan, and Iceland Accelerate War on Whales</H1>

Last spring, the International Whaling Commission(IWC) and the scientific community berated
Norway for touting  inflated, scientifically unsound estimates of minke whale populations. Norway
responded by admitting that its counts were inaccurate, but refused to cease whaling. This summer,
Norwegian whalers learned the shortcomings of their "kill now, count later" approach. Even after
extending their illegal commercial hunt by four days, whalers fell 20 kills short of their
self-mandated 232-minke quota. Norway plans to continue the minke hunt  despite growing
condemnation from the international community and the mounting economic toll of a global
consumer boycott of Norwegian products.<P>

In November, Japan launched a "research" whale hunt in the newly created Antarctic Whale Sanctuary, through which it plans to take 400 minke whales, an
increase of 100 whales over last year's quota. Takanori Ohashi of Japan's Fisheries Agency
contends that expanding research requires the higher kill quota. This hunt has long been recognized
by the environmental community and the majority of IWC members as primarily a commercial
hunt masquerading as science. The carcasses from this whale hunt are distributed to wholesalers
and restaurants after scientific analysis. Japan remains the world's largest consumer of whale
meat, supplied in part by black market trade in  minke, humpback, and fin whales.<P>

Iceland's fisheries minister Thorsteinn Palsson will soon propose that the Icelandic parliament authorize a
minke whale hunt. Palsson will act on a 1994 government commission's recommendation that
minke whales be hunted on the basis of economic and ecological necessity. Many Icelandic scientists
claim that an overabundance of minke whales, not continued overfishing by humans, is exacerbating
the problem of diminishing North Atlantic fish stocks and that fewer minke would benefit the highly
endangered blue whale by decreasing direct food competition.<P>

<TITLE>IMMP: July 31, 1996: House Votes For Dolphin Death Act</TITLE>
<H1>July 31, 1996: House Votes For Dolphin Death Act</H1>

<H2>Partisan Vote on House Floor Guts U.S. Dolphin Protection Laws</H2>

(Washington, DC) Today, the U.S. House of Representatives voted for legislation
(H.R.2823) that would, if approved by the Senate, reverse U.S. dolphin
protection laws and allow the slaughter of thousands of dolphins.  Commented
the author Rep. Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD): "5,000 (dead) dolphins a year is
biologically insignificant."  Representatives Gerry Studds (D-MA), George
Miller (D-CA), and many others unsuccessfully fought to amend or defeat
H.R.2823.<P>

"This is a death sentence for dolphins," stated David Phillips, Director of
Earth Island Institute.  "Greedy foreign interests and a runaway Republican
Congress are undoing years of work to reduce the slaughter of dolphins by tuna
fishermen.  Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and the Clinton Administration have
achieved a victory for 'free trade,' but dolphins, American consumers, and U.S.
tuna processors will be the losers."<P>

Over 7 million dolphins have been drowned in nets over the past three decades
by the tuna fishing industry, which deliberately targets schools of dolphins
which swim with tuna in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) Ocean.  In response,
in 1992, Congress imposed an embargo on imports and banned sale of tuna caught
by methods that are known to kill dolphins.  Reported dolphin mortalities have
decreased by over 90% in the ETP.  Europe and Canada have joined the U.S. in
requiring dolphin-safe tuna.<P>

But Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and the free-trade advocates in the Clinton
Department of State have tabled H.R.2823 which lifts the embargoes, once again
allowing foreign tuna stained by the blood of dolphins to be sold on U.S.
supermarket shelves.  The legislation would further gut the federal definition
of "Dolphin Safe" tuna to allow chasing, harassing, injuring, and encircling
millions of dolphins annually, as long as no dolphins were "observed" to be
killed outright.<P>

Critics, which includes over 85 environmental, trade, and animal welfare
organizations, including Earth Island Institute, Sierra Club, Humane Society of
the U.S., Defenders of Wildlife, Friends of the Earth, and Ralph Nader's Public
Citizen, contend that the new "Dolphin Safe" definition constitutes consumer
fraud, because many dolphins are known to die from injuries and stress, but are
never seen by ship-board observers.<P>

H.R.2823 is authored by Representatives Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD), Randy "Duke"
Cunningham (R-CA), and Don Young (R-AK), known for their anti-environmental
views.  By contrast, Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) and
Representatives Gerry Studds (D-MA) and George Miller (D-CA), the original
authors of dolphin protection laws, have introduced legislation (S.1460 and
H.R.2856) which retains the current definition of "Dolphin Safe" and encourages
foreign fishermen to use "Dolphin Safe" practices.  A threatened filibuster by
Boxer and Biden in the Senate may halt any action this year on H.R.2823.<P>

"Now, Americans who care about dolphins must look to the Senate to block the
destructive action of the House," Phillips noted.  "Only the U.S. Senate can
prevent Congress from capitulating to Mexico and other foreign countries over
America's strong environmental laws and sacrificing dolphins on the altar of
'free trade.'<P>

"Unless the Senate now blocks the Dolphin Death Act, dolphin killing will again
increase, and consumers will be given no way to buy tuna without contributing
to the slaughter of dolphins," Phillips concluded.

<H2>Dr. John Hall's letter to President Clinton</H2>
242 Rosa Corte<BR>
Walnut Creek, CA 94598<P>

VIA FACSIMILE- May 24, 1996<P>

President Bill Clinton<BR>
The White House<BR>
1600 Pennsylvania Ave.<BR>
Washington, DC 20500<P>

Dear President Clinton:<P>

I am writing you today as a supportive Democrat, a marine biologist and the
owner of one of the newest tunaboats in the American fleet. While my boat is
not a purse seiner, it nevertheless fishes for tuna in the Eastern Tropical
Pacific Ocean using hook and line techniques and produces the finest
restaurant-quality seafood available.<P>

I am writing to ask that you reconsider your administration's support for the
Panama Declaration and H.R. 2823 and S. 1420. As a marine biologist who has
been involved in the Eastern Tropical Pacific tuna fishery for almost 30 years
(since 1970) I want to assure you that implementing the Panama Declaration
through H.R. 2823 and S. 1420 will <B>not</B> reduce bycatch (dolphins, fish and sea
turtles) in the tuna purse seine fishery.<P>

In order to reduce bycatch of fish and sea turtles we need to work to close
those areas of the Gulf of Panama to purse seining during that portion of the
year when small tuna are most prevalent there. This would substantially reduce
the kill of small tuna, sharks, billfish and sea turtles known to occur in the
Gulf of Panama in large numbers. Dr. Martin Hall of the IATTC has suggested to
me that it might be possible to eliminate up to 60% of the bycatch associated
with sets on "logs" if we could close purse seining in the Gulf of Panama
during a portion of the year. Time-Area closures are a standard fishery
management tool used throughout the US and around the world. Working to
establish a Time-Area Closure in the Gulf of Panama should be one of our top
priorities if we really want to reduce bycatch associated with the tuna purse
seine fishery in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean.<P>

In order to reduce bycatch of dolphins further we need to <B>stop</B> setting purse
seine nets on spotter and spinner dolphins (the primary targets of the tuna
purse seine fishery since those species are most commonly followed by yellowfin
tuna) until the stocks of dolphins have recovered to levels equivalent to the
Optimum Sustainable Populations. At present there is little argument that those
two species of dolphins have been reduced by about 80% from their 1960
population levels. That means that more than 7 million dolphins have been
killed in the fishery since about 1960.<P>

The National Marine Fisheries Service has estimated that it may take up to 100
years for bottlenose dolphins off the east coast of the US to recover to their
former levels from a disease outbreak during 1986-87, and the bottlenose
populations were estimated to be reduced by the disease only about 50%. The
estimates by the IATTC that spotter and spinner dolphins would recover to their
former levels in only 25-30 years with continued fishing on them is simply
ludicrous. The biology of bottlenose dolphins and spotter and spinner dolphins
is too similar for such a marked difference in recovery times to be reasonable
-- someone is way off the mark in their estimates of the time necessary for
recovery, and I don't think its the NMFS.<P>

If one aim of your administration is to allow non-US fishermen to import their
"dolphin-safe" tuna into the US, and I think that is a reasonable idea. We
could do that by allowing any tuna that was observed to be caught using a purse
seine technique other than setting on dolphins to be imported. Rather than
embargo tuna caught by setting on dolphins based on national compliance, we
could develop a boat by boat compliance standard using the already existing
IATTC 100% observer coverage in the ETP purse seine tuna fleet. That tuna
caught by setting on dolphins would not be eligible for importing into the US,
all other tuna caught in purse seines in the ETP would be.<P>

I believe the goal of reducing bycatch in all fisheries is laudable. The best
way to reduce the bycatch of all species in the ETP tuna purse seine fishery is
to stop setting on dolphins AND implement fishery management techniques that
will reduce the bycatch of fish, sharks and sea turtles at the same time. Those
techniques are available; we just have to be persuasive and work with the
international community to implement them. Signing a bill based on H.R. 2823
and S. 1420 will not get us there, but will result in the deaths of tens of
thousands of additional dolphins and untold mortalities of fish, sharks and sea
turtles. In addition, I believe your support for those bills will create major,
avoidable political problems for you during the upcoming election.<P>

You have asked me for my continuing support for your administration. I ask you
for your support on this issue in return.<P>

Sincerely,<P>

John D. Hall, Ph.D.<P>

<H2>What You Can Do</H2>

Please call your U.S. Senators at the U.S. Capitol Switchboard 202-224-3121 and
tell them to OPPOSE S.1420 and support S.1460<P>

Call your Congressperson at 202-225-3121 and tell them to reject H.R, 2823 and
support H.R. 2856<P>

Call Newt Gingrich, House Speaker at 202-225-0600 and tell him the same thing,
he can stop H.R. 2823<P>

Call the President at 202-456-1111 and tell him to withdraw his support for the
dolphin-death bills S.1420/H.R. 2823.<P>

<TITLE>IMMP Winter 96: New Threats to Dolphins</TITLE>

<H1>New Threats to Dolphins</H1>

<IMG SRC="immp.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT  VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2>

A runaway Congress could reverse years of progress on protecting dolphins on the high seas, but
Earth Island Institute, along with  a coalition of organizations, and Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA)
and Joseph Biden (D-DE), is fighting back. Boxer and Biden, the original authors of the
dolphin-safe tuna program, have introduced S-1460, the Dolphin Protection Act, to continue
preventing dolphins from drowning in tuna nets.<P>

As the <I>Ocean Alert</I> goes to press, two legislative efforts to weaken US policy on dolphin
protection have been introduced. The first of these threats surfaced in September, when US
Representative Randy "Duke" Cunningham (R-Escondido), joining hands with the so-called
Wise-Use Movement, took aim at dolphin protections by introducing HR-2179. If passed, the bill
would repeal the federal definition of dolphin-safe and allow dolphin-unsafe tuna to flood the US
market. HR-2179 would further allow US tunaboats to once again kill dolphins, setting an
international dolphin kill quota as high as 50,000 annually. David Phillips, IMMP Director,
quickly labeled HR-2179 the "Dolphin Extermination and Consumer Fraud Act."<P>

HR-2179 had barely been introduced when Mexico and several trade-oriented groups issued the
"Panama Declaration" after a series of secret meetings in Washington, DC. The declaration
represents an international effort to force Congress to lift the ban on the import and sale of
dolphin-unsafe tuna and to change the definition of dolphin-safe in a way that hides the truth from
consumers. The current definition of dolphin safe, under the Dolphin Protection Consumer
Information Act, sponsored by EII and authored by Senators Boxer and Biden, prohibits all chasing,
capturing, and setting of nets on dolphins. The declaration, by contrast,  redefines dolphin-safe to
mean no <I>observed</I> dolphin mortality, allows the US tuna fishing fleet and the fleets of
countries that want to export tuna to the US to resume setting purse seine nets on dolphins to catch
the tuna that swim beneath them, and would  permit up to 5,000 dolphins to be killed each year.
The actual number of dolphins observed killed in the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission
(IATTC) program last year was 4,095, so the Panama quota would allow killing of approximately
1,000 more dolphins every year. The declaration also calls for allowing dolphin-unsafe tuna
imports into the US in the name of free trade, a reversal of the four-year-old US tuna embargo
against countries whose fleets' dolphin safety practices are not comparable to our own.<P>

Senators Ted Stevens (R-AK) and John Breaux (D-LA), who have long opposed the dolphin-safe
tuna program, introduced S-1420 in the US Senate to implement the Panama Declaration.
Unfortunately, the pro-trade Clinton Administration is currently in support of the bill, as are five
environmental organizations. Greenpeace, the National Wildlife Federation, World Wildlife Fund,
Environmental Defense Fund, and Center for Marine Conservation are inexplicably supporting
drastically weakening dolphin protection. However, US tuna processors are standing firm in their
commitment to buy tuna caught without setting nets on dolphins.<P>

Changing US law could have grave consequences for the dolphins that swim with yellowfin tuna in
the Eastern Tropical Pacific. After all, for 30 years, dolphin populations have been horrendously
depleted by disastrous fishing practices. Eastern spinner and northeastern spotted dolphin
populations are currently estimated at only 44% and 23%, respectively, of original numbers. Even
dolphins that are not killed in nets are subjected to chase by high-speed powerboats and to
entrapment in  nets, both of which are extremely stressful for dolphins. There is growing evidence
that the physiological repercussions of this trauma may cause mortality never observed by IATTC
monitors and cumulative long-term effects that may reduce reproductive success for those dolphins
repeatedly chased and encircled. Further, dolphins with injuries, such as torn fins or broken jaws,
would not be counted as "observed" dolphin mortalities. Naomi Rose of the Humane Society of the
United States (HSUS) explains, "It is not simply a matter of direct mortality. The concept of 'take'
encompasses more than killing. This type of harrassment may have serious physical consequences.
Considering how severely depleted these populations are... this is not good management." Proponents
of HR-2179 and S-1420 argue that there is nothing to worry about. Biologically, however, it is
not known what numbers are needed for successful breeding and regeneration.<P>

Thanks to the staff of Senators Boxer and Biden, and Representatives George Miller (D-CA) and
Gerry Studds (D-MA), the bills on the Senate and House floors are being watched closely to block
any back-door deals. Earth Island Institute is working to stop passage of both HR-2179 and
S-1420. By contrast, S-1460 would keep dolphin protections in place. S-1460 would also help to
resolve trade issues by supporting research and observers, as well as giving further incentives to
dolphin-safe fishers by allowing their tuna to be imported from countries that are currently
embargoed.<P>

In September, EII sponsored a full-page advertisement in the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> condemning
HR- 2179.  Pierce Brosnan (of James Bond fame), Julian Lennon, and other celebrities joined EII
in Malibu for an October fundraiser to benefit dolphins. Peter Coyote has narrated a television
Public Service Announcement, and other public outreach plans are in the works.<P>

We need your support in fighting the efforts to weaken US dolphin protections. Free trade at the
expense of dolphins is a bad deal.<P>

<H1>Keiko Begins Rehabilitation</H1>

<IMG SRC="frepic6.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT  VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2>

As we go to press, final preparations are underway for the historic transfer of the orca whale Keiko
from the Reino Aventura marine park in Mexico City to a new rescue and rehabilitation center at
the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon.<P>

The move takes place on January 7th, when the 21-foot-long, 7,000-pound star of <I>Free Willy</I> will make the nine-hour flight in a C-130
Hercules transport plane donated by the United Parcel Service.<P>

The new facility at the Oregon Coast Aquarium will be filled with cold, ozone-treated seawater from the neighboring Yaquina Bay, and
aggressive efforts will be made to cure Keiko's skin condition and other ailments. Meanwhile,
Keiko's rehabilitation will continue to aim at making him the first captive orca whale ever
returned to the wild, in the waters off Iceland.<P>

The major fundraising campaign for the operation of the new center is underway.<P>

The Pelagic Shark Research Foundation (PSRF) is working to halt the practice of attracting great
white sharks through "chumming." Chumming is the creation of an ocean-borne trail of animal
parts and blood to lure sharks, which have a highly developed sense of smell, to vessels. Operators
typically dump some 2,000 pounds of chum, including terrestrial mammal entrails, into the water
to create a mile-wide chum slick to attract the sharks. Clients, who pay upwards of $800 each, are
then lowered into the water in a steel cage to watch the sharks feed. Since sport chumming for great
whites targets the sharks for the "thrill of close observation," it violates a California law that
mandates that great white sharks are a protected species that cannot be commercially or
recreationally fished or otherwise pursued.<P>

Despite widespread public opposition, commercial charter boat operators in the Santa Cruz/ Monterey Bay area continue chumming, claiming that it
is a benign practice, equivalent in impact to whale watching expeditions. PSRF Executive Director
Sean Van Sommeran disagrees, "Sport contact with the sharks through chumming violates the
protective spirit of California law AB-522 and can be extremely hazardous to  the sharks and
humans involved. Intrusive human activities such as chumming alter sharks' natural predatory
behavior and disrupt the research on which we need to base protection efforts." The Surfers'
Environmental Alliance and Division Ten of the Commercial Abalone Divers Association have
brought a lawsuit against two shark chumming expedition operators. Lawyers are proceeding on the
basis that the practice of chumming violates the Federal Marine Research Protection and
Sanctuaries Act, the Ocean Dumping Act, the Clean Water Act, and California Fish and Game codes
that protect great white sharks from being pursued and harrassed.<P>

The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) is currently considering restricting or prohibiting chumming. Aaron
King, Program Specialist at MBNMS commented, "The Sanctuary Program and the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration are very concerned about the issue of shark chumming and whether
or not it is compatible with other uses of the sanctuary and with the preservation of sanctuary
resources."

<TITLE>IMMP Winter 96: Closing Markets for Dolphin-Unsafe Tuna</TITLE>

<H1>Closing Markets for Dolphin-Unsafe Tuna</H1>

<IMG SRC="immp.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT  WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=175 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2>

As recently as August of 1995, Portugal's largest tuna importing and processing company,
<I>Comercial e Fabril de Conservas, S.A.</I>(COFACO), still purchased yellowfin  tuna from
non-EII-approved, dolphin-unsafe suppliers in Latin America and processed, canned, and sold its
product to European supermarkets. After months of pressure from EII and the economic leverage
created by the refusal of US and European companies to buy from them, COFACO agreed to go
dolphin-safe and to buy tuna only from EII-approved suppliers.<P>

COFACO's supply of albacore tuna comes from an Azorean fleet of small fishing  boats using the pole and line fishing method. In spring
of 1995, the International Monitoring Program (IMP)-Portugal regional coordinator Joao Carlos
Neves received reports from Portuguese marine biologists and environmentalists that Azorean
fishermen, including  albacore tuna fishers, were hunting more than 5,000 dolphins a year with
harpoons and lances. Reports indicated that dolphin meat was being used as bait and for human
consumption in the Azores. Meanwhile, tuna companies were buying this albacore unaware that the
tuna fishermen were killing dolphins. The Azorean government  denied the reports of dolphin kills.
Without observers on the small tuna boats, there was little proof.<P>

Beginning in August of 1995, Neves and Brenda Killian, Director of the IMP, made a series of trips to the Azores to investigate,
with the support of <I>Projecto Delfim</I>, a Portuguese research and advocacy organization for dolphins
and whales. Neves and Killian found shops on the Azorean islands of Pico and Faial selling dolphin
jawbones and earrings and necklaces made of bottlenose and common dolphin teeth. Tourists on Pico
recounted their horror at seeing dolphins being harpooned just a few miles offshore. These were
some of the many indications that the killing of dolphins was continuing without any enforcement of
the laws prohibiting the slaughter.<P>

Neves and Killian presented their evidence to COFACO and representatives of Bumble Bee Seafoods, Inc.. Bumble Bee immediately warned it would not
purchase any tuna from COFACO until EII-approved observers were on board vessels fishing
albacore for COFACO. Bumble Bee's cooperation and adherence to the EII dolphin-safe criteria were
crucial in negotiating with COFACO. In September, 1995, COFACO stipulated that the company would
allow EII-approved observers on board all vessels in the Azorean fleet that supply tuna to COFACO,
prohibited captains or crew members on board any of the fleet's vessels from any killing of
dolphins, prohibited any harpoons or lances on board the vessels, and prohibited any dolphin meat
from being brought on board the vessels for use as bait or for human consumption. COFACO also
pledged to assist in the development of an independent observer program. This program began on
October 1, 1995.<P>

Killian credits the dolphin-safe conversion of the Azorean fleet to the
commitment of Bumble Bee Seafoods and other companies that uphold the current dolphin-safe
criteria, "Companies adhering to dolphin-safe policies provide a strong market force to stop the
killing of dolphins. Six years ago, we wouldn't have had this leverage. Without the dolphin-safe
policies, the slaughter would have continued." Referring to current threats to the definition of
dolphin-safe in the US (see article, p. 1), Killian added, "This is one of the important reasons why
the current dolphin-safe definition in the US must be upheld -- as a model for other countries."<P>

<HR>

<H2>Monitor Highlight</H2>

<B>Joao Carlos Neves</B> has been EII's regional coordinator for IMP-Portugal since April, 1994. His
inspection of Portuguese tuna factories and investigation of Azorean dolphin kills in association
with albacore tuna fishing were pivotal in Portugal's progress toward dolphin-safe status this
summer.<P>

Neves notes, "The IMP plays a decisive role in the economy of Portuguese tuna canneries.
In fact, to be an EII-approved dolphin-safe company is crucial to the economic health of the
canneries." Of his own work, he says, "Being part of the EII team is a privilege. There is nothing
more rewarding than knowing that there are dolphins swimming out there because of us. Nothing
can beat that feeling."

<TITLE>IMMP Winter 96: A Message from David Phillips</TITLE>

<H1>A Message from David Phillips</H1>

<IMG SRC="immp14-2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2>

A major battle is underway in Congress, and its outcome will affect the fate of dolphins and many of
our other hard-won environmental protection laws. If the Wise-Use Movement, the Mexican
government, the trade bureaucrats in the Clinton Administration, and a group of
compromise-oriented environmental organizations get their way, the laws protecting dolphins will
be severely weakened.<P>

If we lose this fight, we'll return to days when the chasing and setting of nets
on dolphins was encouraged and thousands of dolphins will be unnecessarily slaughtered. It will
reverse twenty years of progress to end the largest killing of marine mammals in the world.
Companies and importers will be able to slap phony "dolphin-safe" labels on tuna cans, and
consumers will be powerless to do  anything about it.<P>

This is just the kind of undermining of our laws that was warned against in the battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement with
Mexico. The dolphins are first on the chopping block, and many other laws are hanging in the
balance. If the dolphin laws are sacrificed, it will set a terrible precedent and encourage a broad
array of challenges to US health, safety, and environmental laws.<P>

Fortunately, the campaign to stop the gutting of dolphin protection is picking up steam. More than 70 environmental organizations
across the country are joining in to stop the dolphin killing bill. By winning this one, we can send
an important message that the public  -- not Mexico or NAFTA or GATT -- has the right to set
environmental standards.<P>

Thanks for your help in the fight ahead!

<TITLE>IMMP Winter 96: Whales Alive Update</TITLE>

<H1>Whales Alive Update</H1>

Whales Alive staff are working to fully establish the Hawai'ian Islands Humpback Whale Sanctuary,
which requires approval by Hawai'ian Governor Ben Cayetano before it takes effect in state waters.
The sanctuary will give whale advocates the opportunity to interact directly with federal
representatives at a local level to shape policy that affects the whales regardless ofpotential changes
in the federal Endangered Species Act. The population of the Northern Pacific Humpback Whale, on
the federal Endangered Species List since 1971, is still severely depleted and  its habitat
threatened.<P>

<TITLE>Ocean Alert Fall 1995: The Norwegian Whaling Scandal</TITLE>

<H1>The Norwegian Whaling Scandal</H1>


For the past three years, the Norwegian government has claimed that there are more than 
86,700 minke whales in the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean and that a kill quota of 301 per 
year is scientifically justifiable. 
<P>

Meanwhile, Earth Island Institute and a spate of other environmental organizations have 
disputed Norwegian estimates and called on Norway to abide by the global commercial 
whaling ban. Members of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) also questioned 
these whale population estimates because all research and calculations were done by 
Norwegian officials without any review from outside scientists.
<P>

Despite strong public opposition worldwide, Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Brundtland held 
fast to the high estimates and sent out the whalers. For two years, Norwegian whalers have 
killed whales in violation of the global moratorium. And, because the Norwegian whale kill 
was considered "science-based," the Clinton Administration chose not to impose trade 
sanctions on Norway for conducting its outlaw whaling.
<P>

Now, startling new evidence has surfaced that Norway's whale population estimates have, 
in fact, been grossly exaggerated and that its formulas for calculating populations contain 
numerous errors. A special meeting of the IWC's Scientific Committee recently examined the 
data, and even Norway's own scientists have been forced to admit the errors.
<P>

As a result, Norway's whaling program is in disarray. In April, the Norwegian government 
reduced its estimate of the minke population by more than 20 percent, to 69,600. Further 
review may show that even this estimate is far too high. The Fisheries Ministry has also 
reduced this year's whale kill quota from 301 to 232. Lars Walloe, head of Norway's Whale 
Research Program, told Reuters that the error is "a bit embarrassing."
<P>

The repercussions go much further. Norwegian whalers now say that unless they receive full 
financial compensation of $8,500 (1,565 kroner) per whale for the reduction in the planned 
quota, they will kill all 301 whales, in defiance of both the IWC ban and the Norwegian 
government limits. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="whlmeat.gif" ALIGN=Right 
VSPACE=10 
HSPACE=10>

The whalers are also becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to export whale 
products. Demand for whale meat in Norway is dropping, and there is pressure to resume the 
export of whale meat and blubber to Japan, where the prices paid are far higher. The 
Norwegian government has blocked the sale of 300 tons of whale blubber -- which now sit 
frozen in storage at processing plants. Steiner Bastensen, leader of Norway's whaling 
association, is pushing to have the whale kill quotas raised to 1980 levels of 1,800 per year. 
<P>

These will be hot topics at the June IWC meetings in Dublin, Ireland, during which member 
nations will pressure Norway to stop its outlaw whaling and abide by the international 
whaling ban. 
<P>

Norway's fraudulent minke whale-population estimates also provide ample justification for 
the Clinton Administration to impose sanctions against Norway. Under US law, the president 
can embargo products from countries violating international treaties. Such sanctions could 
cost Norway up to $100 million per year in lost revenues. By taking this action, the US 
would send a strong signal that countries must honor their obligations to international 
agreements. If Norway is permitted to violate the commercial whaling ban and base its 
catch on inaccurate whale-population data, there will be little to prevent Japan, Iceland, 
and a host of other countries from doing the same. This precedent could cause the entire 
IWC moratorium to crumble.

<TITLE>Ocean Alert Fall 1995: Keiko to Move to Oregon</TITLE>

<H1>Keiko to Move to Oregon</H1>

Finally there is some good news for Keiko!  After nearly a year of planning, Keiko, the orca 
that played Willy in Warner Bros.' hit film, Free Willy, is being prepared to move to a new 
home. President of the newly formed Free Willy Foundation, Dave Phillips, said, "The pieces 
are coming together for the historic relocation, rehabilitation, and possible release of Keiko."
<P>

In 1994, Lauren Shuler-Donner, the producer of Free Willy, asked us to help create a plan 
to move Keiko to a better facility. About 16 years old, Keiko has been living in captivity for 
14 years and performing in marine parks. He now lives at Reino Aventura, a marine park in 
Mexico City in facilities that are too small. Keiko is nearly 20-feet long, weighs about 7,000 
pounds, and has a skin condition called papilloma that needs treatment. His teeth have also 
been worn down from years of gnawing at the side of his tank, and he needs to be in colder, 
natural sea water. People from around the world have demanded that Keiko be moved to a 
better home and eventually returned to the wild.
<P>

<IMG SRC="frepic3.gif" ALIGN=Left 
VSPACE=10 
HSPACE=10>

After an intense search, a site was selected at the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, OR. 
The new center will be a state-of-the-art, deep-water pool 150-feet long, 75-feet wide, and 
25-feet deep filled with two million gallons of cold sea water pumped from adjoining Yaquina 
Bay. The water quality will be regulated by sophisticated sand filters and an ozone filtration 
system to ensure that it is always clean. In addition, there will be underwater viewing 
windows and a "rubbing beach." Keiko will be fed 300 pounds of restaurant-quality fish 
daily, frozen to destroy parasites and supplemented with vitamins. Dr. Lanny Cornell, a 
veterinarian with extensive experience treating orcas, will direct Keiko's medical care and 
supervise his rehabilitation. Also, two of Keiko's trainers from Reino Aventura will stay with 
him for several months to make his transition easier, and the professional staff at the Oregon 
Coast Aquarium will ensure that he has first-rate care. Currently under construction, the 
facility is scheduled to be finished in December 1995, and Keiko will be moved shortly 
thereafter.
<P>

Never before has a captive orca been returned to the ocean. While people are optimistic, 
Keiko has many obstacles to overcome before he can survive in the wild. In addition to his 
health problems, Keiko must relearn behaviors of wild orcas. He must learn to hunt for his 
own food and interact with other orcas. Said Dr. Cornell, "We won't really know if we can 
retrain Keiko to live in the wild until he is in the new facility, and we get a chance to better 
evaluate his health. But, a strong, male orca of his age should have an excellent chance to 
survive in the wild."
<P>

Once at the new facility, Keiko will never perform for the public. The center is designed 
solely to rescue, rehabilitate, and release marine mammals. It is expected to help not only 
Keiko, but a number of other dolphins and whales over the years.
<P>

The project has been made possible by sponsorship from Warner Bros., the Craig McCaw 
Foundation, Earth Island Institute, the Humane Society of the US, and the Oregon Coast 
Aquarium. Nevertheless, it  is a huge task and an additional $3 million must still be raised. 
The response from the public has been overwhelming, with people sending in donations to 
the Free Willy Foundation. The Foundation greatly appreciates people's support.
<P>

A special Keiko Adoption Kit has been prepared so people can get involved. Said Phillips, 
"Our work to help Keiko is far from over, and he faces a long road before he can rejoin his 
family. I know that it can be done and am optimistic about his future."

<TITLE>Ocean Alert Fall 1995: The Dolphin-Safe Tuna Anniversary</TITLE>

<H1>The Dolphin-Safe Tuna Anniversary</H1>

<B>A Personal Perspective of Five Years of International Tuna Monitoring<BR>
by Director Brenda Killian</B>
<P>

<IMG SRC="brenda.gif" ALIGN=Right 
VSPACE=10 
HSPACE=10>

I will never forget that day -- April 12, 1990. H.J. Heinz Co., the parent company of StarKist 
Seafood, announced that it would become "dolphin-safe." After years of campaigning to 
stop the drowning of dolphins in tuna nets, we had finally reached victory. Support from 
hundreds of thousands of people who wrote letters, boycotted canned tuna, and staged 
demonstrations in front of tuna companies had paid off.
<P>

Amid the celebration, champagne flowed and staff cheered, grateful that Heinz had decided 
to take the lead in putting an end to the dolphin slaughter. Within hours of StarKist's 
announcement, the other two major canned-tuna companies, Chicken of the Sea and 
Bumble Bee Seafoods, announced that they, too, would become dolphin-safe. Documenting 
this momentous decision, the news media responded with headlines and newscasts.
<P>

That night, I went home filled with gratitude. For years, I had wanted to help stop the killing 
of dolphins by tuna fishers. Yet, after the announcement, I knew that our job was far from 
over. We had to ensure that the tuna companies were not just becoming dolphin-safe to 
escape the canned-tuna boycott but were actually committed to ending the killing of marine 
mammals.
<P>

Within months of the StarKist announcement, we convinced the US Congress to implement 
legislation defining dolphin-safe tuna and outlining labeling requirements. More and more 
companies were declaring their tuna dolphin-safe, yet there was no enforcement in place to 
ensure that tuna labeled dolphin-safe was not caught in driftnets or by setting nets on 
dolphins.
<P>

I began research on the sources of the massive amounts of tuna coming into the US. In late 
1990, I conducted the first investigation of the largest tuna exporting nation -- <A HREF="../gsc/thai.html">Thailand</A>. I 
discovered that most of the canneries were purchasing and processing tuna caught by 
driftnets, and some had also purchased tuna caught by setting nets on dolphins. As the 
pressure from US customers increased, the majority of the Thai tuna canneries ceased 
purchasing driftnet-caught tuna and  indicated to us an interest in establishing dolphin-safe 
policies.
<P>

We had to be on guard against companies misrepresenting tuna as dolphin-safe. This meant 
placing observers at tuna-loading sites, in processing factories and warehouses, and even 
aboard some vessels. To accomplish this, the International Monitoring Program (IMP) was 
created in September, 1990. In the ensuing five years, the program has expanded greatly. 
There are currently more than 25 monitors inspecting tuna facilities on every continent and 
on board a sampling of vessels operating in all of the world's oceans.
<P>

Tuna companies in countries that once relied on tuna caught with dolphin-unsafe fishing 
methods, such as Italy, Spain, Taiwan, Ecuador, and <A HREF="../gsc/costa.html">Costa Rica</A>, have been convinced to 
implement dolphin-safe policies. IMP monitors are given unrestricted access to all areas of 
production and all purchase records to ensure compliance with dolphin-safe policies.
<P>

A whole host of new dolphin-safe canneries has been a key part of the 96-percent decrease 
in dolphin mortality in the past five years. More tuna vessels are switching to methods that 
do not involve the intentional chasing and setting of nets on dolphins. Long-held attitudes 
of tuna fishers and tuna-company representatives have also changed. There is a greater 
interest in fishing techniques to ensure that dolphins are not harmed and that the marine 
environment is sustained. Many tuna-company officials who previously had refused entry to 
their companies now invite IMP monitors to inspect their operations.
<P>

But the work is not over. We will not be satisfied until all dolphin-unsafe markets are closed. 
And, unfortunately, there are many other serious threats to dolphins and the marine 
ecosystem, including  human encroachment, pollution, over-fishing, and direct hunts of 
dolphins and whales. Without question, the past five years have shown that positive 
changes can be made and the future for dolphins is brighter. Thanks to the support and 
hard work of people around the world who think the slaughter of dolphins is too high a price 
to pay for a tuna  sandwich, we have come a long way. Together we will continue this fight 
to protect dolphins.

<TITLE>Ocean Alert Fall 1995: Saving Seals in San Francisco Bay</TITLE>

<H1>Saving Seals in San Francisco Bay</H1>

<B>Dianne Kopec Directs a New Initiative</B>
<P>

Seals, sea lions, and sea otters were once found in great numbers within the fertile estuary 
of San Francisco Bay. Yet, in the 1800s, the European fur market decimated seal 
populations along the west coast of North America. Seal populations dwindled and breeding 
areas were abandoned. By 1900, the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) was the only marine 
mammal with a resident breeding population in San Francisco Bay. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="seals.gif" ALIGN=Left 
VSPACE=5 
HSPACE=5>

After the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibited direct killing of harbor seals, their 
populations increased along the California coast. But, the San Francisco Bay harbor seal 
populations did not change. 
<P>

Evidence suggested that high accumulations of toxic pollutants in the Bay were affecting 
seal populations. These were the same contaminants that had been linked to severe 
reproductive declines and disease in the seal population along Europe's northern coast. In 
the summer of 1988, more than 16,000 harbor seals died from a virus that spread along the 
North Sea shores.  Recent studies have shown that the pinniped immune system, like that of 
other mammals, is damaged by toxic pollutants, reducing the ability to fight off disease.
<P>

In 1989, Dianne Kopec, in collaboration with Dr. James T. Harvey at Moss Landing Marine 
Laboratories, began a wide-ranging study of the bay's resident harbor seal population. 
During the four-year study, Kopec and Harvey  made regular counts and observations at the 
primary "haul-out" sites in the bay, where seals congregate on rocks. The biologists drew 
blood samples from wild seals for pollutant and health analyses and created the first picture 
of contamination in a wide sampling of the bay seal population. Scat was collected from the 
haul-out sites and analyzed to determine the seals' prey. Photo-identification and 
radiotelemetry methods were used to monitor the seals' daily and seasonal movements and 
to locate preferred feeding areas within the vast bay.
<P>

The results of the study will be released this summer. The report documents the seal status 
and their accumulated load of toxic pollutants. As a new member of the Earth Island 
Institute staff, Kopec will use the findings as the basis for further seal population work and 
to develop a campaign to inform the public and policy makers on how to protect the last 
resident marine mammal in San Francisco Bay.
<P>

<H1>Monitor Highlight</H1>

<IMG SRC="jacqline.gif" ALIGN=Right 
VSPACE=10 
HSPACE=10>

Jacqueline Sauzier is the regional coordinator of the EII-Mauritius monitoring program office. 
Since early 1994, Sauzier has been inspecting the tuna canneries and  ports of Mauritius to 
validate the dolphin-safe activities in the region. Sauzier is also a supporter of the Friends 
of the Environment and the Mauritius Marine Conservation Society, two non-governmental 
organizations in Mauritius.
<P>

Says Sauzier of her job with the monitoring program, "...working with Earth Island Institute 
made me discover international issues that are unknown in Mauritius. I have also learned a 
lot about the world of tuna fishing and canning." She continues, "I was able to meet Mr. 
Gome Gnohite Hilaire, the regional coordinator for the EII-Ivory Coast monitoring office ... I 
am glad to be a part of the Earth Island 'family'."

<TITLE>Ocean Alert Fall 1995: Whales Alive Project Report</TITLE>

<H1>Whales Alive Project Report</H1>

Whales alive, an initiative of the International Marine Mammal Project, hosted nearly 20,000 
visitors during the 1995 humpback whale migration through Hawai'ian waters, including 
6,000 enthusiastic Japanese whale-watchers. Whales Alive's efforts to promote a better 
understanding of cetaceans is helping change Japan's whaling policy.
<P>

Meanwhile, controversy continues to rage about the newly designated Hawai'ian Islands 
Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. Established under federal law in 1992, the 
sanctuary needs approval from Hawai'ian Governor Ben Cayetano to operate in state 
waters. And, a well-financed misinformation campaign against the sanctuary is being 
orchestrated by thrill-craft operators and harbor developers. As a result, many people have 
been confused. To show support for the sanctuary, the January 1995 Whales Alive 
Conference featured presentations by sanctuary staff and began a petition drive.  
<P>

The Fourth Annual Whales Alive Conference is scheduled for January 24 to 28, 1996 at 
Wailea, Maui.

<TITLE>Answering Your Questions About Keiko</TITLE>

<IMG SRC="fw-keiko.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>

<H1>Answering Your Questions About Keiko</H1>
<I>Last updated November 27, 1996</I>

<H2><B>Q.</B> How has Keiko adapted to his new facility?</H2>

<B>A.</B> Keiko has made great strides at the Oregon Coast Aquarium. He is far
more active, very attentive, and spends considerable time exploring his new tank.<P>

January 7, 1997 will mark the first anniversary of Keiko's relocation to our
new center in Oregon. <P>

<H2><B>Q.</B> I heard he was skinny. How is his appetite now? What does he eat?</H2>

<B>A.</B> Keiko's health continues to dramatically improve.  His weight has
increased by more than one thousand pounds. Keiko is eating approximately 200
pounds of fish per day.<P>

Efforts are just beginning in the experiment to re-teach Keiko to catch live
fish.  In the months ahead this work will continue.  It has been many years
since Keiko ate live fish, but this is an important part of his ongoing
rehabilitation.<P>

He eats a great variety of fish, including salmon, sardines,
herring and squid.
<P>

<H2><B>Q.</B> How long will Keiko be at the Oregon Coast Aquarium?</H2>

<BR CLEAR=ALL><IMG SRC="iceland.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>

<B>A.</B> We remain very optimistic about the chances of bringing Keiko back to full
health, and re-introducting him back to his native habitat in Iceland.<P>

Keiko has been in captivity for fourteen of
the seventeen years of his life. Though we've made great strides in his weight, muscle tone
and skin condition, there are still some hurdles to overcome.<P>

He will need to learn various skills necessary
for surviving in the wild. We expect this to take one to two years. Luckily,
Keiko is now in what we feel is the best marine mammal rehabilitation center in
the world, with the finest veterinary care and water quality available. We'll
keep you posted on his progress.<P>

<H2><B>Q.</B> How is Keiko's skin condition?</H2>

<B>A.</B> His papilloma skin condition is almost entirely
resolved.  Intensive veterinary work continues toward his rehabilitation.
Curing Keiko's
skin condition has been one of the most important tasks.<P>

Keiko's skin condition, called papilloma, causes the areas around his
pectoral fins and tail to become raised and cracked. The
extremely cold, high quality natural sea water coupled with state-of-the-art
ozone water treatment will provide the best chance for curing the papilloma. 
Although it is still much too early to predict a recovery, some of the affected

Wild orcas often swim 50 to 100 miles a day in the wild. In order to
strengthen his body for long-distance swimming, Keiko needs plenty of exercise.
New exercises and training practices are being employed to develop his muscles
and encourage fast swimming.<P>

Wild orcas often lift the front halves of their
bodies above water in order to spot food and investigate their surroundings.
Keiko will also be encouraged to begin this behavior, called "spyhopping."<BR><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<IMG SRC="aquar.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>

<H2><B>Q.</B> Will Keiko get a companion for his tank?</H2>

<B>A.</B> Orcas are, by nature, very social animals with strong family bonds. 
For years, Keiko shared his tank at Reino Aventura with bottlenose dolphins.
However, the water temperature in Keiko's new pool is too cold for bottlenose
dolphins. We are investigating the possibility of bringing in other marine
mammals. A stranded or captive cold-water dolphin, such as a pacific whitesided
dolphin, would be a good candidate. The new facility was built with enough room
to rehabilitate several stranded dolphins and whales at the same time.<P>

<H2><B>Q.</B> Can people visit Keiko?</H2>

<B>A.</B> Yes. Though his days as a performing orca are over, Keiko is observable
 from a below-water-level viewing area at:<P>

<H1>Keiko's Incredible Voyage</H1>

<H2>Successful Move To Oregon Coast Aquarium</H2>

<IMG SRC="fw-hoist.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=331 HEIGHT=232>

In the early morning hours of January 7th, the world's most famous orca whale and
star of the movie <I>Free Willy</I> began the long and historic journey from
Mexico City to Newport, Oregon.<P>
  
After more than two years of planning, the Free Willy - Keiko Foundation brought
together a team of top veterinarians, Reino Aventura staff, and crane, truck, and
airplane operators to oversee the complicated task of successfully moving a
nearly four-ton whale.  Emotions were running high.  More than 27,000 people
silently filed by Keiko's pool in Mexico to say their last good-byes to the whale
they had known and loved for eleven years.<P>
  
At midnight, the maneuvers began.  Directed by Dr. Solarzano and Dr. Cornell, the
veterinary team coaxed Keiko into the sling.  The months of practice, combined
with Keiko's calm disposition, made a big difference.  It was an eerie scene, lit
by powerful floodlights, as the crane lifted Keiko into the water-filled
transport box.<P>
  
Even at two o'clock in the morning, tens of thousands of Keiko fans lined the
processional route from Reino Aventura to the airport to wish Keiko good luck and
"adios."  Free Willy Foundation director David Phillips called it "the most
amazing outpouring of love for an animal ever.  That made it all the more
important that we do the job right."<P>
  
<BR CLEAR=ALL><IMG SRC="fw-express.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=357 HEIGHT=245>

Awaiting Keiko at the Mexico City airport were a C-130 Hercules cargo plane,
donated for the trip by United Parcel Service, and a chase jet arranged by the
Discovery Channel, the producers of the upcoming television documentary on
Keiko's story.  By daybreak, Keiko and the twelve person transport team were
aloft for the nearly three- thousand- mile trip.<P>

Throughout the flights, Keiko was carefully monitored.  Lanolin cream was rubbed
onto his back to prevent drying and cracking.  Drs. Cornell and Solarzano, who
have transported many whales and dolphins, agreed that Keiko traveled extremely
well and remained very calm.<P>

Keiko headed to the new rescue and rehabilitation center at the Oregon Coast
Aquarium, built by the Free Willy - Keiko Foundation.  Contractors worked
virtually around the clock to have the state-of-the-art 2.2-million-gallon pool
ready.  Private donations from thousands of individuals and school classes,
combined with generous grants from the Craig and Wendy McCaw Foundation, Warner
Bros., New Regency Productions, and the Humane Society of the US made the
facility's completion possible.  In contrast to Keiko's pool at the marine park,
the new center features four times more swimming area, acoustically varied
surfaces, inlets and water jets for creating in-tank currents, better temperature
control, and the most advanced ozone treatment and filtration systems available. 
After final adjustments of the pool's water temperature, salinity, and filtration
systems, everything was ready for Keiko.<P>

After flying nearly eighteen hours and braving rain and low cloud ceilings, the
C-130 finally touched down in Newport.  There to greet Keiko were throngs of
media and a big crowd of children holding "Welcome to Oregon" and "We love Keiko"
signs.<P>

<BR CLEAR=ALL><IMG SRC="sling.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>

Now all that was necessary was the twenty minute truck ride to the aquarium and
the final step of lifting Keiko into the new pool.  Rows of satellite trucks
broadcast live as the world watched to see how Keiko would fare.  As he was
hoisted forty feet in the air and carefully lowered into the water, the crowd
cheered and cameras flashed.  Keiko pushed free of his sling, immediately took a
deep dive, and swam several laps of the pool.  Within a half hour, he was
exploring, vocalizing, and eating fish. There was a huge collective sigh of
relief.  Keiko had made it.   Phyllis Bell, President of the Aquarium, stated: 
"We mounted a round-the-clock watch on Keiko for the first three days, but after
just 24 hours it was clear that he was settling in well."  Karla and Renata,
Keiko's trainers from Mexico, relayed the word:  "He's doing great!" <P>
 
Even with this crucial step taken, the Free Willy - Keiko Foundation's work is
still in full swing.  Now the task is to bring Keiko back to full health.  He
needs to gain more than two thousand pounds, and things are off to a very good
start.  His food consumption has risen to 245 pounds per day, 100 pounds per day
more than he was eating in Mexico.  Current priorities are to cure his skin
condition and build up his muscle tone.  All this is in anticipation and hope
that Keiko may be able to be returned to his native waters and family off the
coast of Iceland.  We'll keep you posted on Keiko's progress.<P>

<TITLE>Support for Keiko Soars</TITLE>

<H1>Support for Keiko Soars</H1>

<IMG SRC="fw-kids.gif"  WIDTH=236 HEIGHT=165 ALIGN=RIGHT>

The Free Willy - Keiko Foundation is grateful to the tens of thousands of people
who have contributed to our efforts to move Keiko to the Oregon Coast Aquarium
and begin his rehabilitation. The creativity and commitment schools and other
organizations have demonstrated in raising money for the cause are impressive.
According to Foundation spokesperson Mark Berman, "Children from all across the
country have amazed us, sending anything from a few cents up to a school project
generating $31,000." Three elementary schools are among the outstanding examples
of devotion to Keiko's well-being.<P>

In 1993, Jean Jakob's third grade class at Northwest Elementary in Tampa, Florida
began working to raise money for Keiko's relocation and release. Upon realizing
that, unlike his Free Willy character, Keiko was still in captivity, the entire
school signed on to the effort to help him. Through bake sales, door-to-door
canvassing, and "dollars for Keiko" collections, Jakob and the schoolchildren
raised over $30,000, which they presented to the Foundation in late 1995. In
January, a Tampa television station, WTVT, flew Ms. Jakob, two students, and two
parents to Newport, Oregon where they received a behind-the-scenes tour and had
the opportunity to wish Keiko well on behalf of their community.<P>

<BR CLEAR=ALL><IMG SRC="in-aqu.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>

In Kodiak, Alaska, near the cold waters where other orcas like Keiko live,
Peterson Elementary School hosted a penny drive to relocate Keiko. Students
placed a Free Willy penny jar in the hallway of the school for fifteen minutes
each morning for approximately one month and spent hours collecting and wrapping
the pennies. Organized by Peterson's student council, the penny drive set and met
a goal of raising 30,000 pennies, for a total of a $3000 donation towards Keiko's
rehabilitation.<P>

Close to Keiko's current home at the Oregon Coast Aquarium, students at Sam Case
Elementary School in Newport, Oregon recently raised $4500 by sending fundraising
letters, selling buttons, and holding a penny drive, and a raffle. Students from
eighteen primary and secondary schools in the Salem/ Keizer School District in
Oregon have also raised more than $4000. Students from the West Chester Area
School District in Pennsylvania, sponsored by environmental education teacher
Elizabeth Anderson, sold T-shirts and raised tips by working at a local
restaurant to donate $1000 for Keiko's rehabilitation.<P>
 
The initiative demonstrated by students throughout the country testifies to
children's concern for protecting wildlife and demonstrates their ability to make
a difference. Please write to us for more information about what you and your
school group can do to get involved!<P>

<H1>What You Can Do</H1>

<IMG SRC="fw-window.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=245 HEIGHT=358>

<H2>How You Can Help Whales and Dolphins</H2>

Keiko's hoped-for return to the wild raises the question of how safe the oceans
are for wild whales. Whales are still in danger from <A HREF="../bw/bw.html">marine pollution</A>, oil
spills, ozone depletion that affects phytoplankton growth, and, once again,
commercial whaling. In 1986, the International Whaling Commission banned all
commercial killing of whales. In 1992, Norway began killing minke whales in
defiance of this ban and Japan continues to kill whales by claiming that it is
for scientific research purposes. Now that Norway has broken the agreement,
Iceland is also pursuing plans to resume commercial whaling.<p>

<h2>U.S. dolphin protection legislation</H2>

<IMG SRC="rep-vw.gif"  WIDTH=333 HEIGHT=207><P>

<A HREF="http://www.earthisland.org/immp/ddstop.html">U.S. dolphin protection legislation</A> and the
embargo against tuna from countries whose tuna fishing methods are not
dolphin-safe have spared the lives of hundreds of thousands of dolphins.
Eastern spinner and northeastern spotted dolphin populations are still severely
depleted because of the deadly practices of the dolphin killing fleets. Even
so, a number of tuna fishing countries claim that the U.S. regulations
requiring that tuna be caught without setting of nets upon dolphins are too
strict.<P>

<IMG SRC="payne.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT  WIDTH=260 HEIGHT=305 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2>
"More than 90% of the world's canned tuna markets are now 'dolphin safe',
according to figures from the United Nations," stated Phillips.  "The Mexican,
Venezuelan, and Colombian governments must realize that the technique of
setting nets on dolphins to catch tuna is cruel, unnecessary, and will never be
acceptable to the American public."<P>

Earth Island Institute announced the "Dolphin Death Act" has been stopped in
the U.S. Senate and will not become law. "These bills would have crippled
dolphin protection and misled millions of Americans," explained David Phillips,
Director of Earth Island Institute. "Thanks to the public outcry and to the
leadership of Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and the bipartisan group of Senators
and House members, the dolphin-safe label is safe"<p>

We must stop Congress  from passing any "Dolphin Death Act" changing the
definition of dolphin-safe to again allow the chasing, capture, and entanglement
of dolphins. Many of  you have seen the horrific footage of dolphins being chased
and encircled in purse seine nets to catch the tuna beneath them. Even when
dolphins do not die in the nets, they are traumatized, and may suffer physical
injury from which they will later die, unobserved. <P>

Voting for the "Dolphin Death Act" were:  Jim Saxton (R-NJ), Don Young (R-AK),
W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R-LA), Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD), Peter Torkildsen (R-MA),
Linda Smith (R-WA), Walter Jones (R-NC), Jack Metcalf (R-WA), James Longley
(R-ME), and Solomon Ortiz (D-TX).<P>

Voting NO were:  George Miller (D-CA), Gerry Studds (D-MA),  Sam Farr (D-CA),
Frank Pallone (D-NJ), Sam Gejdenson (D-CT), and Patrick Kennedy (D-RI).<P>

Please write to your representatives to urge that they oppose any change in the
definition of dolphin-safe and any weakening of dolphin protection in the name of
free trade:<P>

<TITLE>IMMP: Keiko-The Long Effort for a Return Home</TITLE>
<H1>Keiko-The Long Effort for a Return Home</H1>
INTERNATIONAL MARINE MAMMAL PROJECT<P>

<I>The Winter/Spring 1995 Ocean Alert (formerly the Dolphin Alert) is an Earth Island Institute publication.</I><P>

<IMG SRC="immp2.gif"><P>
<I>Keiko, the orca which starred in the 1993 hit film, <B>Free Willy</B>, leaps in the air.<P></I>

For more than a year, controversy has swirled around the plight of Keiko, the orca that played the role of "Willy" in Warner Bros.' hit film, Free Willy. Would Keiko stay at Reino Aventura, a Mexico City theme park that is inadequate for his needs, or end up in another country? Would he ever make it back to the wild?<P>

Our project took on a prominent role in coordinating rehabilitation efforts for Keiko. On November 21, 1994, IMMP announced that Warner Bros. and New Regency Productions had donated an initial seed grant of $2 million to establish the  Free Willy/Keiko Foundation.<P>

EII Executive Director David Phillips said that the Foundation will vigorously pursue plans to relocate Keiko to a larger facility, where his health problems can be treated. The ultimate goal is to return him to the wild. Phillips called the plan, "...a major undertaking that will require top scientists, veterinarians, and a huge funding commitment. But, if Keiko's rehabilitation efforts are successful, he could be the first captive orca ever released back to the wild.  That would be an unparalleled success story."<P>

Keiko's rehabilitation is difficult because of a skin condition he has developed. While not life threatening, it must be cured before he can return to the wild. He is also underweight from spending many years in captivity and needs to be in cold sea water that approximates his original habitat off the coast of Iceland. Keiko is about 15 years old and weighs approximately 8,000 pounds - roughly the weight of 53 average-sized adults. <P>

For the past seven months, we have been developing a proposal to construct a new deep-water tank for Keiko at the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, OR. If moved there, Keiko would no longer be a performing animal. Instead, the focus would be on his rehabilitation. "It is a perfect site with a dedicated team ready to go," said Phillips. The Free Willy/Keiko Foundation needs an additional $6 million  necessary to realize the plan. <P>

In addition to its initial contribution, Warner Bros.' has committed to seek worldwide funds through the upcoming release of the sequel, Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home, and to plan benefit movie premieres around the world.  <P>

"It is one of the largest corporate contributions ever for a threatened species. Warner Bros. has already worked closely with us to educate millions of people about the world's whales, and they deserve a lot of credit for jump-starting the new Foundation's efforts," said Phillips.<P>

Though organizing and funding Keiko's rehabilitation plan will be a challenge, Phillips is optimistic. "Millions of people - school kids, scientists, and businesspeople - across the country want to see the right thing done for Keiko. He has come to symbolize the public's concern for the plight of whales," Phillips said.<P>

<TITLE>IMMP: Final Court Victory for Dolphins</TITLE>
<IMG SRC="immp1-ii.gif"><P>
<I>A dolphin and yellowfin tuna swim together</I><P>
<H1>Final Court Victory for Dolphins</H1>
INTERNATIONAL MARINE MAMMAL PROJECT<P>

<I>The Winter/Spring 1995 Ocean Alert (formerly the Dolphin Alert) is an Earth Island Institute publication.</I><P>

After nearly seven years of litigation, Earth Island Institute's and the
Marine Mammal Fund's lawsuit against the US Department of Commerce over
failure to follow the legal requirements of the Marine Mammal
Protection Act (MMPA) is finished. In November 1994, Chief Judge
Thelton Henderson of the US District Court for Northern California,
entered the final judgment in favor of EII and the Marine Mammal Fund.
The court also retained jurisdiction over the interpretation and
exaction of all issues regarding enforcement of the MMPA relating to
the tuna/dolphin fishery.<P>

This case brought a stunning and unprecedented series of achievements
for dolphin protection. At the time the suit was filed, more than
100,000 dolphins were being killed every year by US and foreign tuna
fleets that were intentionally setting nets on dolphins to catch tuna.
Today, that dolphin kill has been reduced by more than 97 percent. When
we first went to court, there were 35 US tuna vessels using the deadly
technique of setting nets on schools of dolphins. Today there are
none.<P>

This legal effort deserves considerable credit for these breakthroughs.
Highlights of the case include: <P>

<UL>
<LI>In 1989, by court order, the US fleet was required to place a
federal observer aboard each vessel. This was instrumental in
providing, for the first time, accurate information on the level of the
dolphin kill. Without observers on every vessel, it would have been
impossible to implement dolphin protection measures such as the ban on
explosives used to herd dolphins into tuna nets.<P>

<LI>In an historic 1991 ruling, the court ordered embargoes be imposed
against the importation of tuna into the US from Mexico, Venezuela, and several other countries
that were killing dolphins at rates far above those allowed under US
law. Halting tuna imports from countries with massive dolphin kill
rates was critical to lowering foreign dolphin mortality rates. These
embargoes remain in place today.<P>

<LI>In 1992, Judge Henderson ruled that embargoes must be implemented
against "intermediary" countries, such as Italy and Japan, that
imported tuna from the embargoed countries and then exported tuna to
the US. This ruling was instrumental in preventing the laundering of
dolphin-unsafe tuna. Though these embargoes on intermediary nations are
still in place, they are threatened by a government appeal which will
be heard by the 9th Circuit Appellate Court. The government claims that
our suit on this issue should not have been heard by the District
Court, and must, instead, be brought before the Court on International
Trade.<P>

<LI>In 1994, EII won a court order that prohibits all setting of nets
on Northeastern offshore spotted dolphins. Scientific evidence shows
that this population has been severely depleted. Though this stock is
down to only 23 percent of its initial population, the National Marine
Fisheries Service (NMFS) took the position that a continued kill could
be allowed. Again, Judge Henderson ruled that the government's
arguments were wrong and that tuna fishers must stop all further
killing of this dolphin stock.<P>

</UL>
During the early years, EII's court battles were fierce because the federal agencies opposed full enforcement of the MMPA. On numerous occasions, Judge Henderson rebuked the US government for its contravention of the law. In response to the government's pleadings not to impose tuna import embargoes, Judge Henderson wrote, "Simply put, the continued slaughter and destruction of these innocent victims of the economics of fishing constitute an irreparable injury to us all and certainly to the mammals whom Congress intended to protect. Indeed, for those species now threatened with extinction, the harm may be irreparable in the most extreme sense of that overused term." <P>
Without question, the future of dolphins is far brighter today than when EII first filed suit. Much credit is due to the fantastic team of  lawyers at Heller, Ehrman, White, and McAuliffe, who handled this case for EII on a pro bono basis. During the nearly seven years of litigation, the dolphin team at Heller, et.al. has worked more than 8,000 hours on this case, totaling more than $1.4 million in time and costs. We are continuing our efforts before the courts to try to recover these fees from the government.<P>
EII wishes to thank the following attorneys at Heller, et.al. who have worked on this case over the years: Josh Floum (lead counsel), Deborah Sivas, Elizabeth Robinson, Mike Charlson, Wayne Braveman, Wondie Russell, Helen Bendix, Robert Borton, Nicholas Van Aelstyn, Michelle Goldberg, Cynthia Koehler, Ted West, and Michael Bucci. <P>

<TITLE>IMMP: Norway's Rampant Whale Slaughter</TITLE>



<IMG SRC="immp3.gif"><BR>



<I>The shaded area above illustrates the IWC's Southern Ocean whale sanctuary.

All whales in this area are protected and cannot be hunted for any reason, but

Japan has filed an objection and has killed 330 minke whales.</I><P>



<H1>Norway's Rampant Whale Slaughter</H1>



INTERNATIONAL MARINE MAMMAL PROJECT<P>



<I>The Winter/Spring 1995 Ocean Alert (formerly the Dolphin Alert) is an Earth

Island Institute publication.</I><P>



Renegade Norwegian whalers may soon be joined by Icelandic and Japanese whalers

in defying the International Whaling Commission (IWC) whaling ban. In addition

to minke whales that <A HREF="whlclaim.html">Norway continues to kill in

defiance of the IWC's moratorium</A>, reports now indicate that endangered fin

and humpbacks are also being slaughtered illegally. But, the Clinton

Administration refuses to impose economic sanctions on Norway.<P>



Our project continues to press for an end to commercial whaling. By educating

the public about the threats still facing whales, urging the Clinton

Administration to ban all fish imports from Norway, as well as  conducting

undercover investigations of illegally smuggled whale meat, we aim for a final

end to the unnecessary whale slaughter. In 1993, Norway openly defied an IWC

global ban on commercial whaling and killed 226 minke whales in the

Northeastern Atlantic Ocean. In response, the US Commerce Department certified

that Norway was "diminishing the effectiveness" of the IWC and thereby

authorized President Clinton to ban the import of certain Norwegian products.

However, last October, Clinton notified Congress that he would not impose

sanctions until "good-faith" negotiations to persuade Norway to abide by the

IWC commercial whaling ban had concluded. But, no good-faith negotiations ever

took place between the US and Norway. Instead, Vice President Gore held secret

meetings with Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Brundtland and helped Norway obtain

a whale kill quota from the IWC at its annual meeting in May. Once news of

these meetings was leaked, Earth Island and a host of other environmental

organizations waged a campaign to alert the public to the administration's sell

out. Full-page newspaper advertisements criticized the US' actions, and

citizens sent thousands of letters and telegrams to the White House to pressure

the administration to protect the whales.<P>



At the IWC meeting, Norway failed in its attempt to overturn the global whaling

ban. No country was granted a quota for commercial kills. In addition, a

resolution was passed establishing a whale sanctuary in the Southern Ocean of

Antarctica. Commercial whaling is prohibited in the sanctuary which covers

one-third of the world's oceans and contains close to 90 percent of the

remaining whales. EII Executive Director David Phillips called the sanctuary,

"...a big step forward for international whale conservation."<P>



Even with the establishment of the sanctuary and the IWC's refusal to grant any

commercial quotas, Norway announced that it would again defy the moratorium.

Since May 1994, Norway has killed 301 minke whales, a 20 percent increase over

its kill last year. In addition, Japan responded by filing a formal objection

to the Antarctic Sanctuary, saying that the minke whale population is large

enough in that region to sustain commercial whaling. In 1994, Japan proceeded

to kill 330 minke whales, including 21 in the North Pacific Ocean under the

guise of "scientific research." Iceland has also stated its intention to

commence killing whales again by the spring of 1995.<P>



Up to this point, Norway has defied the IWC commercial whaling ban with

impunity. Its recent vote not to join the European Community (EC) makes the

EC's ban against commercial whaling inconsequential to Norway. The EC is now

unable to pressure Norway to stop whaling; it could embargo Norwegian products.

It is illegal for whale meat to be bought or sold in any EC nation. <P>



While Norway generates up to $7 million annually by selling whale meat, a US

ban on its fish imports would cost Norway more than $100 million in lost

revenue. The Clinton Administration could take the lead and impose sanctions

against Norway, sending a strong signal that Norway's blatant disregard for

international bans cannot be tolerated. Norway's whale slaughter affects not

only the minke whale. It opens markets to the killing of all types of whales,

including those populations on the brink of extinction. In an attempt to assess

the illegal trade in whale meat, IMMP is supporting a team of undercover

investigators to take DNA samples of whale meat sold around the world. "It is

quite clear that meat from highly endangered fin and humpback whales is on

market shelves right now," said Phillips.<P>



The IWC meets again this June in Ireland. We will keep up the pressure to

ensure that the ban stays in place and is properly enforced so that the world's

whales will no longer be killed illegally.<P>

<TITLE>IMMP: Int'l Tuna Com. Fails to Reduce Dolphin Kill Quotas</TITLE>
<IMG SRC="immp1-ii.gif"><P>
<I>A dolphin and yellowfin tuna swim together</I><P>
<H1>International Tuna Commission Fails to Reduce Dolphin Kill Quotas</H1>
INTERNATIONAL MARINE MAMMAL PROJECT<P>

<I>The Winter/Spring 1995 Ocean Alert (formerly the Dolphin Alert) is an Earth Island Institute publication.</I><P>

At a meeting in La Jolla, CA in October 1994, the InterAmerican Tropical
Tuna Commission (IATTC) let stand the international tuna fleet's
dolphin kill level of 9,300 for 1995. The IATTC, an international
commission established to manage tuna populations, has come under
increased scrutiny recently over the tuna fishery's impact on
dolphins.<P>

EII Executive Director David Phillips called the IATTC move, "...a
total cop-out. At a time when the total dolphin kill has been less than
4,000 in each of the past two years, the fact that the IATTC has set a
kill quota of more than twice as high is absurd."<P>

The US delegation to the IATTC wanted a 1995 quota of 4,000 but was
rebuffed primarily by the delegation from Mexico, the largest remaining
dolphin-killing country. All commission decisions must be made by
consensus.<P>

Fortunately, the US tuna fleet adheres to a stronger domestic law, the
International Dolphin Conservation Act (IDCA), which severely limits
the US fleet's dolphin kill. The IDCA calls for a descending quota
eventually reaching zero by 1999 or earlier. Because the US fleet
killed 114 dolphins in 1994, the maximum allowed for 1995 is 113.
Regardless of the IATTC resolutions, the US fleet must comply with the
requirements of the stronger and more effective IDCA. To date, no US
tuna boats have applied to operate in the Eastern Tropical Pacific
Ocean (ETP) in 1995. This represents the first time since the late
1950s that no US tuna vessels are engaged in dolphin-unsafe fishing
techniques.<P>

Whether the international fleet will kill 9,300 dolphins this year is
unknown. Mexico, Venezuela, and Vanuatu continue to use dolphin-unsafe
fishing practices. Yet, of the 40 Mexican tuna purse seiners, 12 have
shown the ability to fish dolphin-safe. Our staff will continue to
press for an end to all encirclement of dolphins and for a reduction of
the IATTC quota to zero.<P>

<TITLE>IMMP: Monitoring Program Report</TITLE>

<H1>Monitoring Program Report</H1>

INTERNATIONAL MARINE MAMMAL PROJECT<P>

<I>The Winter/Spring 1995 Ocean Alert (formerly the Dolphin Alert) is an Earth Island Institute publication.</I><P>
<IMG SRC="immp5.gif"><P>

Our international monitoring program (IMP) has been continuing its
mission to promote sustainable and dolphin-safe fishing methods. This
first-of-its-kind independent monitoring  program investigates tuna
fishers, packers, and importers to ensure the reliability of
dolphin-safe labeling. In addition, IMP is attempting to spotlight
countries with tuna fleets that continue to kill marine mammals by
using driftnets or purse-seine nets.<P>

In September 1994, IMP Director Brenda Killian spent two weeks
conducting initial investigations into Taiwan's tuna industry to
determine if it abides by the driftnet moratorium. In the past,
Taiwan's fishing industry has used primarily driftnets, but in 1992 the
United Nations passed a global resolution banning the use of all
high-seas driftnets longer than 1.5 miles. Killian met with industry
and government officials to discuss actions taken by the government to
uphold the driftnet moratorium. She discovered that the effort to close
all international markets to driftnet-caught fish is paying off; the
use of driftnets in Asia is disappearing.<P>

In Mexico, the tuna fishing fleet relies heavily on the purse-seine
method to catch tuna. IMP continues to investigate canneries, storage
facilities, and vessels to verify that no dolphin-unsafe tuna is sold
to importers in Europe and elsewhere. IMP also encourages all Mexican
canneries to become dolphin-safe. The number of Mexican purse-seine
vessels that are not setting nets on dolphins is increasing. Because
the international markets for dolphin-unsafe tuna are closing, tuna
fishers have an incentive to sell their dolphin-safe catch to the
EII-approved canneries that IMP monitors in Italy, Spain, Portugal,
<A HREF="../gsc/costa.html">Costa Rica</A>, Colombia, and Ecuador.<P>

IMP's monitors continue to be active in the Philippines as well,
working directly with fishers to ensure that their methods are
dolphin-safe. These fishers often use fish aggregating devices called
payaos which attract tuna. For the past two years, the monitoring
program has placed observers aboard vessels to investigate the presence
of dolphins around payaos and to ensure that fishers do not
intentionally set nets around any dolphins. IMP's monitors also conduct
classes on the boats to educate the fishing crews about the role of
dolphins in the marine ecosystem and how to safely release any that may
become trapped in the nets accidentally. <P>

IMP's efforts to encourage more countries around the world to adopt
dolphin-safe policies and fish in ways that do not harm marine mammals
is a major undertaking. "It is encouraging that representatives from
the tuna industry around the world, especially in countries like Mexico
and Taiwan that were leaders in using methods that are dolphin-unsafe,
are now opening their doors to us and cooperating with our monitoring
program. As a result of our efforts, the dolphin mortality rate has
decreased by over 90 percent since IMP began," said Killian. The work
that began in <A HREF="../gsc/thai.html">Thailand</A> and the Philippines now covers Costa Rica,
France, Spain, Italy, Ivory Coast, Mauritius, Portugal, Senegal,
Indonesia, Ecuador, Colombia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Taiwan,
Mexico, Turkey, and China. Site investigations are also planned for
South Africa, <A HREF="../journal/mclibel.html">Brazil</A>, Venezuela, Namibia, Chile, Papua New Guinea, and
Iran. Killian calls it part of the effort to ensure that dolphin-safe
policies are upheld and markets for dolphin-unsafe tuna are closed.<P>

<H1>IMMP: A message from David Phillips</H1>

INTERNATIONAL MARINE MAMMAL PROJECT<P>

<I>The Winter/Spring 1995 Ocean Alert (formerly the Dolphin Alert) is an Earth Island Institute publication.</I><P>

If ever we needed a wake up call, we just got it. The leadership of both the House and the Senate of the new Congress are out to attack  our hard-won environmental protection laws. Need proof? Just look at the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. It has been critical to the success of our efforts to protect whales and dolphins. As part of the House leadership's "streamlining" program, it was just abolished.<P>
Unfortunately, this hints at more things to come, as the backers of the "Wise Use" agenda try to destroy decades of conservation progress.<P>
Thankfully, there is a silver lining. Public support for wildlife and environmental protection is still extremely strong. Our task is to find a way to translate that popular support into action. We've faced formidable odds before and have been able to come up with some sizable victories. <P>
1995 will test us as never before as we fight to make the oceans safe for dolphins, whales, and all other forms of marine life. This is a particularly significant year for the environmental movement - it marks the 25th Anniversary of Earth Day. This day honors the environment and recognizes the need to protect all living things. Sadly, the battles that were waged in the 1970s must still be fought today. Some dolphins are still being killed in tuna nets. Whales are being slaughtered by renegade whalers.<P>
We need your support now more than ever before to put a final end to these slaughters. We encourage you to read the articles in this Ocean Alert and take action.<P>

<H1>Wildlife of the Vezcaino Desert Reserve</H1>



This fragile breeding and calving environment for gray whales is 

also home to many marine and terrestrial plant and animal species.  

<A HREF="../strp/strpprob.html">Sea turtles</A>, the endangered pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, 

coyotes, resident and migratory birds such as the peregrine 

falcon, golden eagle, black brant geese, osprey, and blue-wing 

teal all make their home there.  Scallop, clam, lobster and 

abalone fisheries sustain the resident community.  In the 

project's environmental impact statement(EIS)  ES claims no damage 

to the lagoon and surrounding area would take place because this 

site is "wastelands with little biodiversity and no known

<TITLE>IMMP: Agreement to stop eating Washington State fish.</Title>
<h2>Agreement to stop eating Washington State fish.</h2>
<I>Agreement to stop eating Washington State fish in response to sea lion kills and poor management of fishing runs.</I><P>



I, the undersigned, agree not to buy or consume any fish caught in Washington State waters if any sea lions are killed under the guise of improving fish runs. If sea lions are killed in Washington State, then a precedent will be set for the slaughter of marine mammals throughout the country. Fish populations are crashing worldwide because of human greed and mismanagement. Marine mammals should not be slaughtered because we have killed too many fish and ruined the environment. If there are not enough fish for the orcas, dolphins, seals, and sea lions in Washington State, then there are not enough for me. Marine mammals do not have a choice to eat anything but fish - but I do. Therefore, I agree to give up eating Washington fish so that I do not contribute to the death of our nation's marine mammals by competing with them for what little fish is left in our oceans and so that I do not support inhumane and unscientific fishing methods which involve the killing of marine mammals.<p>

Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Service are responsible for protecting both marine mammals and fisheries. If they do not do their job and protect both, then I will work toward that end myself. These agencies will be responsible for this action because they will force citizens to take measures to protect what the agencies have allowed to be destroyed. Marine mammals are a national treasure and we demand that they, as well as the fish, be protected and allowed to live. <P><P><P>

<H1>Pressing Environmental Issues at Baikal<BR>
What Price to Pay?</H1>

<TITLE>Baikal Currents- Pressing Environmental Issues at Baikal<BR>
What Price to Pay?</TITLE>

<H2>The Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Mill</H2>

 Those who are concerned about the fate of
Lake Baikal are aware of the problems related to this notorious mill, located
on the Lake's south shore.  A special inserted supplement  provides information
on this issue: chronicles the history of this issue, gives an update on recent
action at Baikalsk, and discusses prospects for the future.  Please see
supplement to learn about the latest developments in the movement to halt the
mill's damaging operations.<P>

<H2>The Level of the Lake</H2>

The change in the level of Lake Baikal has been one of the most serious
problems affecting the environmental well-being of the Baikal region.  The
issue of rising water levels in Baikal is one that has not been openly
discussed for a long time.  In 1994, for the first time, it was brought to the
public's attention by InterBaikal (an independent newspaper, published in
Irkutsk). <P>

The level of the lake was raised about one meter upon the completion of the
Irkutsk power dam in 1958.  Over 1,200 square kilometers of valuable
agricultural and wetlands were flooded. Even today, there is a constant process
of erosion causing the destruction of the lake shores, and threatening
railroads, highways, and harbors.<P>

By the end of the 1960s the omul-fish harvest dropped by up to 10-15 percent,
and the productive quality and weight of each fish dropped by a factor of two.
(Some scientists  regard this as evidence of the impact of the dam). No serious
studies have been done on the impact of this project.  Some are arguing for
raising level of the lake even more. <P>

Dr. A. Sukhodolov of the Research Institute of Regional Economics:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"If raising the level of the lake even higher by another half meter would
translate into an increase of energy production by the entire Angara power
system (by as much as 1.6 billions kilowatt-hours), then this will result in
saving 1.4 million tons of fossil fuel annually.  It will reduce air emissions
from other power stations in the Irkutsk-Zima industrial region.. In theory it
is possible to restore the original level of the lake, but this will interfere
with the normal work of the Bratsk and Ust-Ilimsk power stations downstream,
and will badly influence the entire water-industrial complex on the Angara and
Yenisey Rivers... It would not be possible to guarantee low energy prices in
this case." </BLOCKQUOTE>

Leonid Bezrukov of the Institute of Geography, Irkutsk:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"If achieving even higher Lake levels would be prohibited, this would hardly
have much influence on the normal work of the Irkutsk and even less so on the
other power stations of the Angara-Yenisey system.  And, to boot, it will
eliminate the necessity to spend billions and billions for bank reinforcement
works... First and foremost, serious analyses based on good science are
needed--this will allow us to measure with ruble figures all the plusses and
minuses.  What we need is the participation of resource economists, experts who
will provide economic assessment of the damage already done and project
potential costs versus benefits of each scenario."</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H2>Baikal Law</H2>

There have been plans to enact a Baikal Law at the federal level for several
years now.  (It was deemed most appropriate to do this at the national level
because the Baikal watershed encompasses three different states in the Russian
Federation; therefore a special law should be passed in Moscow to better
protect the lake as a whole.)<P>

At the beginning of this year, there were five different drafts of a proposed
Baikal Law in existence, each put forward by different factions.  The latest
draft, entitled "About the Protection of Lake Baikal" was offered on April 26, 
1995 by State Deputies of the Duma (Russian Parliament) Alexeev, Bosholov, and
Bratishev, among others.  This draft was accepted at a first reading, to be
followed by further readings.  In fact the Duma held special hearings in
Irkutsk on the first of June with 15 people attending from the State Duma.  At
this hearing there were many remarks and corrections made on the original
draft.  The main discussion centered around: <OL>

<LI>the role of a future Baikal Commission (its legal status, structure, and
jurisdiction);<P>

<LI>the future use of a Baikal Ecological Fund<P>

<LI>the reconstruction or closing
of ecologically dangerous enterprises around the lake, including the
prohibition of cellulose production on the shores of Baikal<P>

<LI> land use policies in the core zone.  

</OL>

A second reading of this draft was planned for Moscow  in July.  Perhaps
because there were so many corrections in this latest draft, the Duma decided
not to take the time to hear this latest draft of the Baikal Law.  There is
little hope that any version of the Baikal Law will be heard by the Duma 
before next summer.	<P>

<I>The information drawn from reports by Nelli Romanova and
Natasha Zhavoronkova of the environmental and public interest law  groups known
as EPRA and EcoJuris, located in Irkutsk and Moscow respectively.</I><P>


<H2>What Price to Pay?</H2>

The surplus of electric power generated by Irkutsk Hydropower System (which
includes Irkutsk, Bratsk, and Ust-Ilimsk Power Stations) is 15 billion kilowatt
per hour,  that is 3 times higher than the average annual power production of
the Irkutsk Power Station . <P>

The cost of reinforcing the shorelines in order to preserving the Old Baikal
Railroad against higher lake levels will amount to 140 billions rubles (or over
$30 million at 1995 rates).<P>

Residents of the northern towns of Nizhneangarsk and Severobaikalsk, where some
of corollary damage was greatest,  have been unsuccessfully trying to draw
attention to this problem. They have formed a group (Fedor Pilugin, Evgeny
Mariasov, and Pavel Nepomnyaschikh; e-mail: davan@glas.apc.org.  This group
appealed to the government of Buryatia. Their main concern is for Yarki Island
(a long sandy island at the far northern tip of Baikal), as well as for pasture
land around Severobaikalsk and Nizhneangarsk. They have requested that a
special <I>expertisa</I>  (or environmental impact assessment) be held to make
a decision on how to reduce the level of the lake. <P>

Lately,  the impact of the dam has  been showing itself in a more obvious way,
and has forced officials to pay more particular attention to this issue.  A
special commission to investigate the consequences of this situation was formed
recently in Buryatia. <P>

At the same time, a federal working team was formed (chaired by Mr. Mikheev,
the head of <I>Minvodkhos</I>  - Ministry on Water Issues and Management).<P>

<A HREF="supp95p-p.html">The Governmental Commission on Baikal</A> in it's October resolution made a
decision  to estimate the  impact of the fluctuation of the lake level, and to
ask the  Irkutsk Region to allocate funds for this study from it's Ecological
Fund

<H2>The Heavens Will Aid the Island of Yarki</H2>

by Albina Andreeva<BR>

special for Baikal Currents and InterBaikal<BR>

August 1995<P>

The gradual disappearance of the island of Yarki, located on the northern
extremity of Lake Baikal, is only a small part of the more complicated problem
of preventing catastrophic changes on the shores of lake Baikal caused by the
water backup from the Irkutsk Hydrosystem dam.  The negative consequences of
the artificial rise in the lake's water level are intensified by the repeated
forcing of the water level over the norm that was established in the planning
designs.<P>

According to the chairman of the Water Resources Committee of the Republic of
Buryatia, V. Molotov, "From 1980 to 1994, in violation of  existing laws, the
Irkutsk Power Engineering Center (Irkutsk Energo) didn't adhere to established
norms, as a result, the normal backup water level, established at the 457 meter
mark was exceeded no less than 10 times. And each centimeter in excess of this
level reflects meters of ruined area primarily on the eastern side.  On the
Irkutsk side the  problems are not so obvious and not as severe as in Buryatia.
<P>

A year ago representatives of the government of the Republic of Buryatia
intended to sign an agreement with the administration of the Irkutsk Oblast for
an increase in the normal backup water level (up to the 457.20 meter mark) in
exchange for a decrease in the tariffs on electricity supplied to Buryatia.  If
this decision had been implemented, it is possible Yarki Island would now only
be a memory.  <P>

Under the pressure of public opinion and realizing it had made a mistake, the
government revoked its decision and went further in a different direction,
changing its color somewhat green.  On the 7th of December, 1994, at the
meeting of the Governmental Commission on Baikal, the First Deputy Chairman of
the government of the Republic of Buryatia, M.A. Spasov informed about the
catastrophic events on the shores of Lake Baikal and called for preventive
measures.<P>

The most important among these measures is strict regulation of the water level
of Lake Baikal.  A working group was formed with the participation of the
representatives of the Administration of the Krasnoyarsk region, the Irkutsk
Oblast, the government of Buryatia, and also interested ministries and
departments. At the meeting of this group, which took place on the 28th of July
in Ulan-Ude, the parties agreed not to exceed the back- up water level,
established at the 457 meter mark.  A system of control over the rate of the
work of the Hydro Electric Station was also planned.  Should these agreements
be fulfilled, the further destruction and flooding of significant parts of the
shore zone, including the island of Yarki, will be prevented.<P>

However, everything is dependent upon money. At this point in Buryatia and
Irkutsk, there is no hope of raising this money except for profits from the
exploitation of hydro- resources. But it is still not certain when all the
necessary normative documents and working plans  will be worked out.  In the
meantime, trust must be placed in Her Majesty, Nature.  According to the
prognosis of scientists from the hydro-meteorological service, after 1995 a dry
period is expected with a subsequent decrease in the inflow of water to the
Lake.  Thus, it is possible that the water-horizon of the Siberian Sea will
fall to an acceptable level by natural methods. And this may cause problems of
an opposite character, no less and perhaps more severe and complicated.  Nature
does not like to be subjugated.<P>

<H2>The Boguchansk Power Station.</H2>

The completion of construction on the Boguchansk hydro-electric station (BoGES
is a Russian abbreviation) will have an immediate effect on the region known as
Nizhnee Priangarie (in the north-eastern part of the Irkutsk Oblast').<P>

BoGES represents the 4th step - i.e., it is the 4th hydro-power station--along
the Angara-Yenisey river system.  Construction started in 1976. The projected
capacity at BoGES will be 4,000 megawatts, although initially it will produce
some 3,000 megawatts. This project was started to help develop a complete
energy infrastructure for industrial activity on the western side of Baikal.  It is
also intended to provide for the growing demand for energy in all of eastern
Siberia, including the Irkutsk region.<P>

Construction site of this dam was selected in 1984 but was not confirmed with
the Baikal Bureau of Reclamation, or with the Fish and Game  Department.<P>

The Irkutsk Regional Government issued a resolution allocating 34,365 hectares
of land for the operation of the Boguchansk Power Station.  In August of 1989,
the Ust-Ilimsk county government issued a resolution which prohibited the
cutting of forests in that area which would be flooded for BoGES, at least
until the results of an official Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) would be
known.  In 1992-1993, all work was stopped due to an EIA performed by the
Krasnoyarsk Regional Committee on Nature Protection.  The findings of this EIA
were negative, since the project is not in compliance with nature protection
laws.

<H2>A 208 meter dam would drown:</H2>

An EIA on the dam done by the Krasnoyarsk Science Center in 1993 indicated a
208 meter dam would drown:<UL>

<LI>107,400 hectares (268,500 acres) of land, of which 85,700 (214,250 acres) is
forested.<P>

<LI>2 million cubic meters of (timber) wood<P>

<LI>3,5 million tons of other, non-timber plant matter, such as plants and dead wood<P>

<LI>120 archeological sites (some dating back to 30-40 thousand B.C..)<P>

<LI>100 monuments of wooden architecture <P>

<LI>31 villages<P>

</UL>

What is more, the land that will be inundated contains the burial places of
many animals who died from Siberian anthrax!  In all, estimated damage from the
dam (for Nizhneilimsk County alone) will amount to 126 billion rubles (28
million dollars) annually, to be incurred for at least the next 100 years
(using January 1995 price levels).</I><P>

<H2>Citizens of Nizhneilimsk County's letter to Boris Yeltsyn</H2>

<I>A local group recently prepared a letter to the Russian government to inform
them of this issue and to seek support from other activists who understand the
problem and the probable impact of the Boguchansk Project.  Their letter
follows:</I><P>

To: President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsyn<P>

Prime-Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin<P>

On March 26 of 1994, Resolution #236--entitled "On the Completion of
Construction of the Boguchansk Power Station"-- was issued by the Russian
Federal Government. The decision to finish this project poses ecological
threats to a vast area, including the Ust-Ilimsk and Kezhemsk Counties in the
Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk regions.  <P>

Up and down the Angara River a huge industrial complex of chemical, micro
biological, metallurgic, forestry, and cellulose enterprises is located. 
Wastes from all these enterprises are discharged into the Angara and its
artificial reservoirs.<P>

The construction of three reservoirs along the Angara has caused flooding of a
massive part of the Angara valley and adjacent lands.  This flooding was done
without any precaution to clear reservoir beds, nor to counter the decrease in
the river's ability for self purification.  What is more, there ... has been a marked increase in soil erosion and the destruction of the river
banks.  This has all resulted in a worsening of water quality in those
reservoirs that are used as a principal source of drinking water. <P>

(At present the quality of drinking water at the proposed site for the
Boguchanskaya power station is classified as "dirty" and "extremely dirty".)<P>

It is commonly recognized that many valley hydro stations are inexpedient,
since the damage caused by their construction is far greater than the resulting
economic benefits.  At present there are numerous examples of smaller hydro
stations, which are ecologically safe and, collectively, of greater
capacity.<P>

Governmental Resolution was not confirmed with the local administrations, which
is a violation of the Russian Constitution and contradicts the current laws on
nature protection.<P>

We appeal to you with a request to stop the enactment of Resolution #236, at
least until the results of an Ecological Impact Assessment are received by the
Russian Ministry of Nature Protection.<P>

Signed by citizens of Nizhneilimsk County.<P>

<HR>

A citizen organization called "Save the Angara" was formed in Ust-Ilimsk in
1994 (this group can be reached through the <A HREF="bcci.html">Baikal Center</A>, or, more directly,
at 665770 Ust-Ilimsk, P.O. Box 1326, tel: 51-438)  Also  Association for the
Rehabilitation of Angara-Yenisey, Krasnoyarsk Ecological Movement and Friends
of Siberian Forests are publicly opposing the completion of the BoGES
project.<P>

<H1>Environmental Activism</H1>

<TITLE>Baikal Currents- Environmental Activism</TITLE>

Environmental Activism in the Baikal Region is the principal program of the
<A HREF="bcci.html">Baikal Center For Ecological and Citizen Initiatives</A> for 1995. The aim
of this project  is  to widen the circle of "green" activists in the region by
helping them establish contacts both intra- and inter-regionally, providing
them with informational and organizational support, helping them with the
development and implementation of projects which improve the region's ecology,
and by promoting feelings of personal worth and significance among local
people. The work of the Center has been made possible with the support of
<I>Eurasia Foundation</I>. <P>

<H2>Preliminary Results on a Irkutsk Survey</H2>

A Survey on Environmental Activism in the Baikal region.  (conducted by the
Baikal Center) should be completed by spring 1996, but some preliminary results
on a survey in Irkutsk follow:<P>

According to the results of a survey conducted in the city of Irkutsk, there
are 17 NGOs (non-governmental groups) which are engaged in environmental
issues.  Most of them were established in the  early 90s. The focus of interest
for most of these groups is  ecological education and the development of
eco-tourism.  Some groups are involved in helping local protected areas,
cataloging natural monuments, or publicly monitoring the use of local natural
resources.<P>

Many groups are trying to strengthen information networks.  Everyone is for
closer ties between NGOs and for more cooperation in general.  According to
this survey, the lack of information or the difficulty of access to information
is viewed as one of the most serious obstacles to effective work.  Information
on the following subjects is considered the NGO's  most useful (in order of
preferences stated): <OL>

<LI>ecological education

<LI>ecotourism

<LI>foreign experience in the sphere of nature protection, education, and
tourism development

<LI>financial possibilities for funding NGO programs

<LI>data (statistics) on ecological issues

<LI>evaluation of the overall ecological situation in the Irkutsk region.

</OL>

The main ecological problems in the region which need urgent attention are,
according to this survey of Irkutsk groups:<OL>

<LI>the Baikal Law

<LI>the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Plant

<LI>Forest Protection

<LI>the Level of Baikal

<LI>Ecological Education

<LI> Air Emissions and Water Discharges

<LI>Industrial Waste Management

<LI>Reduction of Anthropogenic Impact on Baikal itself

<LI>Sewage Treatment Facilities in Urban Areas

<LI>Poaching

<LI>Establishment of Independent Environmental Information Network

</OL>

NGOs presently are interacting well with each other, as well as with the
Irkutsk Regional Committee and with the Society for Nature Protection.  Most
Irkutsk NGOs are interested in cooperation with foreign NGOs, but mainly expect
financial support from local and federal governmental agencies.  Once again
they see the main obstacle in the way of solving ecological problems as being
the lack of cooperation and coordination between various governmental agencies,
private enterprises, industries, and NGOs.<P>

<H2>Baikal Ecoforum</H2>

The Baikal Center began the first stages of planning for the Baikal
Ecoforum, a meeting among  environmental organizations and for
environmental activists of the region.  The meeting hopes to address two main
questions:<OL>

<LI>How to facilitate/include meaningful citizen participation in
those decision-making processes which directly affect the environment and/or
the implementation of conservation programs.<P>

<LI>How to make work and
cooperation among NGO's more effective.<P>

</OL>

 The agenda will include discussion on
the following current ecological programs and problems:<UL>

<LI>Baikalsk Paper & Pulp/Selenginsk Paper & Cardboard Plants

<LI>Changes in Lake Baikal's water level

<LI>Boguchansk Hydro-Electrical Dam

<LI>Atmospheric pollution in the Angara Valley

<LI>Water quality in the Angara region

<LI>Regional mineral extraction, e.g: the Udokan copper mines

<LI>Environmental Education

</UL>

The proposed dates for the conference are April or November of 1996. Neighbors
from nearby regions and foreign colleagues working on Lake Baikal are invited
to participate in this forum.  The local government <I>Committees on Nature
Protection</I> will be taking part in the conference as well.   The first funding
for this event have come from <A HREF="baikal.html">Baikal Watch</A> and from the <I>Ecological Fund
of the Irkutsk Region</I>.  The Baikal Center is also applying to the Ecological
Funds of the Chita Region and the Buryat Republic, as well as to other funding
sources, in order to make this conference possible. <P>

In November, the Center began work on a new program, known as: "Public Rights
for Healthy Environments in the Baikal Region and Zabaikal'e: Enhancing the
Role of Citizen and Public Participation in Environmental Decision-making and
Policy Implementation (<I>Baikal Paper and Pulp Plant and Baley</I>)." These
programs, made possible with the support of the <I>US Agency for International
Development</I> through the American organization <I>Save the Children</I>, are
described more  in a special supplement.<P>

<H2>The first regional NGO convention</H2>

took place in Ulan-Ude and was devoted to a discussion of NGO participation in
the implementation of "The Program for Preservation of Biodiversity in Russia,"
which has been developing under World Bank auspices, and includes a Baikal
component.  The idea of this program is "to demonstrate the possibility for
regional interdisciplinary and intergovernmental coordination in the sphere of
regional biodiversity protection" and "to promote initiatives for strengthening
schemes of natural resource management." <P>

There are three so-called model projects developed as a part of the Baikal
component program.  These projects--each to take place in one of the watersheds
of three small rivers (the Bolshoe Goloustnoe, the Tugnui and the Khilok)--are
as a whole viewed as tools for the implementation of proposed strategies.<P>

It is proposed by the program to established Supervisory Council (SC) which
will be in charge of implementing the projects. This SC shall include, along
with the heads of the regional Committees on Ecology, three representatives of
NGO groups and the  scientific community.<P>

The various Baikal NGOs, although deeply dissatisfied with the outcome of this
larger project (they consider that the proposed model projects do <I>not</I>
suggest a strategy for biodiversity preservation in the region), nevertheless
have decided to take a pro-active role, and in order to help prevent a
potential useless waste of money and time, they have elected their
representatives to the SC. <P>

A resolution from this convention was delivered to the heads of regional
administrations, as well to representatives of the World Bank and the Russian
Ministry of Nature Protection.  Also, a number of proposals for organizational
management of the project were suggested.<P>

<H3>Resolution from Representatives of Ecological NGOs at Baikal</H3>
Sept. 30, 1995, Ulan-Ude.<P>

Conference participants support the decision by the GEF to provide a grant of
$20,000,000 to Russia for the purpose of preserving biodiversity.  We realize
that it has been necessary to deal with all sorts of bureaucratic problems
while preparing this stage of the project, and do hope that organizational
mistakes made so far will not re-occur during the implementation phase of this
project.  In part, it is necessary to point out that, in Irkutsk and Buryatia,
work on the preparatory phase (from Oct., 1994 to April, 1995) of the project
was conducted in a somewhat secretive manner, and without appropriate
publicity.  The selection of working group leaders was not done on a
competitive basis, and this is reflected by the fact that not the best choice
was made in selecting model projects.  This fact without doubt will be
reflected also in the quality of the program and its significance.<P>

We do not have any doubt that broad publicity and discussion of this project
throughout the Baikal region will not only help to improve its implementation
prospects, but also will secure the support of the local population. There is
no possibility for success of this project if the people of the region will not
take part in it.<P>

Proposals for structuring the Supervisory Council for the project:<OL>

<LI>The Director of the executive group for model projects shall be approved by
the Supervisory Council.<P>

<LI> All local projects shall be selected in open competition, with preliminary
publication of all submitted project proposals. Projects with the potential for
the most serious impact shall be considered for independent public
assessment.<P>

<LI>Representatives of regional NGOs shall be elected and are accountable to a
Regional NGO Conference.<P>

<LI>It is recommended to consider  a decision  passed only if it receives
two-thirds of the Council 's votes.<P>

<LI>Simultaneous service in the Project Management Group, the  Supervisory
Council and the Baikal Commission shall not be permitted.<P>

</OL>

<H2>Save The Baikal Seal!</H2>

As many of you may know, the grassroots group <I>The Baikal
Ecological Wave</I> has been a leader in efforts to save
the Baikal seal (the famous fresh-water <I>nerpa)</I>. 
Over the last year, the Wave has been working with
scientists to investigate the <I>nerpa's</I> status.  The
Wave is trying to determine the  effects of legal culling,
of poaching, and of pollution on the seal.  It is using the
results of this research to lobby for better protection for
the <I>nerpa</I> and its habitat.  It is also producing
video-documentaries for Russian television, and preparing
materials for its environmental education programs in local
schools.  The Wave has been collaborating closely with
Earth Island Institute's <A HREF="baikal.html">Baikal
Watch</A> and <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">International
Marine Mammal Project</A> (whose seal specialist, Dianne
Kopec visited with colleagues at  Baikal).  Final
assessments on the general health of  the seal, and of
Baikal itself, will be available in report form by late
spring of 1996.<P>

<H3>Nerpa and their Environment threatened</H3>

Lake Baikal, magnificent and incredibly beautiful, is known
throughout the world.  More and more people are drawn here
to enjoy its severe beauty and to experience for themselves
the uniqueness and preciousness of this natural creation. 
And all visitors dream of catching a glimpse of its only
mammal, the Baikal seal, locally called nerpa, an endemic
that inhabits the expanses of this inland sea.<P>

The Baikal nerpa (Phoca sibirica) is a representative of
the order of pininpeds and the family of real (earless)
seals.  Nerpa spend most of their life in the water,
surfacing periodically to breathe. Thanks to the capacity
of their blood to hold oxygen, nerpa can remain under water
for up to 45-60 minutes.  In winter, when Baikal is frozen
over, nerpa makes escape holes in the ice.  <P>

In mid-March nerpa give birth to one or, very occasionally,
2 pups, in snow dens on the ice.  At first the pups are
yellow-green in color, but in two weeks turn white.  This
white fur is the pup's camouflage, enabling it, in the
first weeks of life, while it is still feeding on its
mother's milk, to be practically unnoticeable on the ice.
By the time it switches on to independent feeding on fish
its fur turns a silvery-gray.  On the market, this fur is
considered the most beautiful and expensive, and for this
reason such pups are the main object of hunting. <P>

Nerpa remain today the object of both official and
unofficial hunting. The main hunt takes place on the ice on
sleds, but since 1970, two other forms of hunting have been
introduced to Baikal--from boats with rifles, and using
nets. Shooting the animal usually result in the nerpa's
managing to escape into the water, later to die, to no
purpose, of its wounds.  The most effective method is with
nets set at the bottom.  Nerpa, caught in the netting, are
usually brought out of the water dead from drowning.<P>

Hunting for nerpa's meat, fat and fur, has been carried on
since ancient times, but in the 20th century, because of
more intensive development on the shores of Baikal and
higher prices for nerpa products, hunting increased
dramatically.  Clearly, if we want to maintain the numbers
at least at today's (decreased) level, official hunting
should be reduced, or better still, in our opinion, banned
altogether. <P>

In addition to the problems of hunting, there is industrial
pollution around the lake which weakens the animals ability
to combat infection.  Another stress factor for the nerpa
population is the impact of global warming on the lake's
ice conditions, on which nerpa are closely dependent. <P>

In order to properly understand the problem and come to a
well considered policy,  the participants of the joint
Russian-American  project "Nerpa" (financed by ISAR, the
Institute of Soviet-American Relations) are undertaking a
survey among local people, hunters, tourist firms, park
rangers, and scientists in order to assess the state of the
nerpa population, the significance of the hunting, and what
is necessary for it to be cut or stopped without causing
social or economic conflict.<P>

A very important part of the Nerpa project is its emphasis
on information and education.  One of the aims of the
project is to bring nerpa closer to the attention and
hearts of the people of the Baikal region through video,
films, information, and exhibitions for adults and
children. It should help all of us to better understand
nerpa and their habitat, and develop in us the desire to
care for both. In our industrial society, constant efforts
are required to heighten people's perception of the natural
world and to help us feel its wonder and fragility.  We
hope the project "Nerpa" will help us in this task.

<H3>How to contact "Save the Nerpa" project</H3>

For more information on the Save the Nerpa project, contact
Jennie Sutton, Director of the <I>Baikal Ecological
Wave</I> (e-mail: sutton@wave.irkutsk.su) one of the
leading independent environmental groups in the region. The
group was formed in 1991 with the goals of facilitating the
development of a grassroots environmental movement,
providing environmental education and awareness, publishing
environmental education materials, and completing
conservation projects. One of the most important tasks of
the Baikal Wave is to inform the public about the condition
of the environment and the facts about violations of
environmental laws and regulations.   Currently, the Baikal
Wave is working on creating a video studio, and a
grassroots network of environmental educators to distribute
informational newsletters.  <P>

<HR>

<H2>The Green Zone Program</H2>

The Green Zone Program was started in 1995 in the Irkutsk
Region by the <I>Irkutsk Branch of the All-Russian Society
for Nature Protection</I>. (Vera Shelenova or Peter
Khrenov. <P>

The violation of existing regulations on using so-called
"green" (water protective and primary forest land) zones
has become a common-place occurrence in the Irkutsk region.
Lands once allocated and zoned according to their special
natural importance have been withdrawn from protection for
the purpose of establishing gardening coops, private
dachas, and other developments. <P>

This turn of events has met with the vocal protests of the
public.  Beginning in 1990 the public was questioning  the
continued vitality of green zones in Irkutsk, and
surrounding cities such as Shelekhov, Angarsk and
Usolie-Sibirskoe.  In 1991, an official resolution
entitled: "On the Status of Green Zones in Urban Areas and
Settlements of the Irkutsk Region" was adopted, but it
didn't have any positive impact--green zones are still
being withdrawn for improper uses.  The local mass media
has paid a great deal of attention to this very issue, and
has published various documentation of these violations.  A
protest by 8 NGOs at the Federal Prosecutor's Office did
not meet with an adequate official response.  Attempts (by
the Irkutsk Regional and County Committees on Nature
Protection, as well as by local NGOs) to oppose the
destruction of these green zones have not been very
successful so far.<P>

The most "famous" case has to do with the construction of
condominiums on the outskirts of the city on lands  located
within a water protection zone with the special status  of
lands designated for study purposes only. Among the owners
of the new dachas and condominiums are representatives from
the Irkutsk Regional and County Governments and the
Committees on  Ecology and  Land Use.<P>

One of the latest examples is the construction of eight
stores right on the banks of the Angara and Ushakovka
Rivers, some 20-30 meters from the water and in the one of
the most picturesque areas.  City authorities "blessed" the
construction and did not even bother to comply with the
existing regulations, claiming that these are, in fact,
just temporary structures.  For, despite the fact that
these buildings not only obscure scenic views and cause
traffic problems on the roads that parallel these
serpentine rivers (not to mention the impending ecological
damage), the projects are going full speed ahead. <P>

While the Irkutsk Committee on Nature Protection was filing
their protest with the General Prosecutor of the region,
the owners of these stores (well-to-do private car trading
enterprises) are making these "temporary" structures look
more permanent: they have constructed a parking lot right
on the edge of the water, hoping to make the stores look
more inviting to customers. <P>

As time is goes by, the public's attention span on this
issue has shortened. The public's common response has been:
"What can we do? Fortuna (the name of the culprit
enterprise, that means "fortune, luck and fate" in Russian)
is not there to look after us!"  And the destruction of
green zones goes onward. <P>

But there are ways to address this issue and to make a
change, or so believes Vera Shelenova, the Co-Chair of the
Irkutsk Branch of the All Russian Society for Nature
Protection.  Her task has been to draw broader attention to
this problem.  So her organization has initiated a "Program
for Public Participation in the Protection of Green Zones
in the Urban Areas of Irkutsk."<P>

This Program is targeted to provide complete and adequate
information to the general public regarding green zones,
and in so doing, help them lobby for their protection.
Their plan is:<OL>

<LI>To establish a data base  which will include all
existing resolutions, legal acts, scientific data, and
other information collected while monitoring all the
existing green zones.<P>

<LI>To conduct a survey among inhabitants of the Irkutsk
Oblast re.: the problems facing green zones.<P>

<LI>To publish maps of all  the green zones in Irkutsk,
Angarsk, Shelikhov and Usolie.<P>

<LI>To organize public monitoring programs, and appoint
public "guardians" for these green zones.<P>

<LI>To conduct public programs for "adopting" and cleaning
these zones.<P>

<LI>To develop drafts and initiatives for consideration by
local legislative and executive authorities. <P>

</OL>

Under item number 6 above, the following requests have
already been submitted to:<OL>

<LI>the Irkutsk Regional Land Use Committee (to provide the
public with open access to information concerning the
so-called "Plan of Land Allocation for Garden Coops and
Dachas, and other Proposed Private and Public Lands")<P>

<LI>the Legislative Committee (to inform the public of cases of
non-compliance with the 1991 Resolution on Green Zones)<P>

<LI>the Regional Committee on Nature Protection (to have them
hold public hearings on the status of green zones, where
results of environmental impact assessments related to
green zones will be shared)<P>

<LI>the Department of Forest Management (asking them to
provide information on the general scheme of forest
restoration and forest management in green zones). <P>

<H1>Even One Dollar Or One Helping Hand Can Make A
Difference</H1>

<TITLE>Baikal Currents- Even One Dollar Or One Helping Hand Can Make A
Difference</TITLE>


Direct, "on the ground" financial support has made a world
of difference to a number of groups at Baikal.  In 1995, a
number of American foundations and other groups (often with
assistance from the US Agency for International
Development) contributed to environmental projects.  Among
them Eurasia Foundation, ISAR, German environmental groups,
and the World Wildlife Federation.<P>

<H2>First grants from a private foundation awarded at
Baikal.</H2>

The American <I>Global Greengrants Fund</I> (in association
with the <I>Pacific Environmental Resources Center</I>, and
with the participation of members of Siberian and Far
Eastern independent organizations), is continuing its small
grants program for Siberia and the Russian Far East.  The
first grants were allotted in July of 1995.  Seventeen
organizations and individual activists received support,
including four from the Baikal region. For example, it made
funded the following restoration project in the village of
Shumak.<P>

<H2>Case study: Cleaning up in Shumak.</H2>

The  famous Buryat Shumak (hot springs) has  become
cleaner.  Last year, 28 large garbage dumpsites were
discovered along the Shumak. This summer about one ton of
non-combustible debris was removed with the help of a
helicopter.  Now only about 50% of the garbage remains near
the Shumak, debris which is more difficult to salvage as it
is in a liquid, kasha-like state.  This work was carried
out by around 70 volunteer participants, including a number
of Buryat teens.<P>

In the summer of 1996, work will continue on eliminating
the remaining garbage piles and on monitoring the water
sources feeding the Shumak.<P>

Liya Sandanova says:  "We are conducting a search for
transferable technology which can utilize wastes for other
purposes in regions far from civilization.  We are working
on the issue of biotoilets.  We are studying the experience
of people living in nature preserve areas, people who have
created an exemplary model, where a natural equilibrium
with the environment is maintained, the same as we would
like to see in Shumak.<P>

We request those with experience in utilizing waste
products to help with advice on how to accelerate
composting of organic waste, of which there is quite a bit
along the water sources."  For more information contact

<H2>Volunteer for a Siberian Nature Reserve this Summer!</H2>

The Baikalo-Lenski Nature Reserve (or zapovednik, in
Russian) is looking for hardy and adventurous volunteers
for trailbuilding this summer season.  It is one of the
largest in Russia;  it comprises 660,000 hectares, and is
situated in the Irkutsk Region,  one of the most wild and
inaccessible parts of Lake Baikal.  The zapovednik boasts
110 km of shoreline, the Baikal mountain range, and the
headwaters for the Lena, the Kirenga, and other Baikal
tributaries.  About 90% of the zapovednik is forested,
providing habitat for over 250 species of birds and 50
species of wild animals.  About 200 bears live in the
zapovednik, the largest concentration around Baikal.  No
wonder that one of the zapovednik's areas is called "Shore
of the Brown Bear". <P>

The zapovednik is relatively young, only 8 years old, and
lacks any amenities for visitors.  Work will begin this
summer on construction of an educational, interpretive
trail, and we need your help!  Volunteers will be needed
during the first part of July, the best time to be at
Baikal, and will last two or three weeks.  Volunteers must
be physically strong and healthy, able to do strenuous work
and willing to live in primitive conditions (i.e.: sleep in
tents or cabins).  Work groups will consist of 7 or 8
people.  <P>

Volunteers are responsible for transportation to the
zapovednik (a round trip San Francisco-Irkutsk will cost
about $1,200), as well as for living expenses while there
(about $100-200 a month).  Volunteers must also bring their
own sleeping bag, warm clothing, rain gear, and rain boots.
The zapovednik will provide all necessary work tools and a
guide-instructor.  <P>

All visas, invitations, and other logistics will be
arranged through the <A HREF="baikal.html">Baikal
Watch</A>.  We can help with your trip planning.  Start
planning now for this exciting opportunity!  	<P>

<H1>Environmental Education at Baikal</H1>

<TITLE>Baikal Currents- Environmental Education at Baikal</TITLE>

<H2>Local Groups</H2>

<B>The Ecological Organization of Angarsk</B>--or
<B>GEO</B>--(664816 Angarsk, 179-11-41, e-mail:
irkutsk@glas.apc.org. Contacts: Larissa Chikalina and
Larissa Lobkova) was established by several children's and
youth environmental groups, as well as by middle school
teachers in Angarsk.  The Angarsk city administration also
supports the activities of GEO, which features
environmental education for school children and the
creation or expansion of summer nature camps.  Besides
these school programs, GEO is forming an Angarsk
environmental information center, as well as renewing work
in the Ptichii Nature Preserve.  <P>

<B>The Ecological Center (NMETS)</B> (665914 Baikalsk, Irkutsk
Oblast, Yuzhnii Way, Kvartal 1, apt. 6, e-mail:
ceei@cetin.irkutsk.su, contact: Alexey Gulin)was created in
1995 with the help of the municipal government.  Their
purpose: to develop visual aids and practical tools from
local materials for use by school children in a local
environmental monitoring laboratory.<P>

<B>The Center for Ecological Education and Information</B>
(665914 Baikalsk,  Irkutsk Oblast, Gagarin post office, box
74, e-mail: ceei@cetin.irkutsk.su, contact: Victor
Khotilovich,) has already been in existence for eight years
(though only three as an "official" organization).  This
independent group conducts studies on environmental
protection and conservation, making use of modern
technology, computer-generated ecological games, excursions
and field work (such as the clean-up of recreational areas
along the lake shore).  They have published an "Ecological
List," replete with independent research products done by
local children on the flora and fauna of Lake Baikal, with
the children themselves acting as the designers and
editors.<P>

<B>Davan and The Youth Tourist Club</B> (671717 Severobaikalsk,
Buryatia, Taezhik, tel.30139-20323, e-mail:
davan@glas.apc.org, contact: Maria Moshkina, Evgeny
Mariasov). This group is preparing an ecotourism guidebook
showing prime routes for tourists.  They are also studying
environmental conditions in public recreational areas at
Lake Baikal and Lake Sludyanskii.<P>

<B>Ekos Ecological School</B> (670002 Ulan-Ude, Babushkina 2 ,
tel.3-32-00).  Headed by Antonina Derevtsova, this school
was founded in 1992 and is for children between the ages of
13-17.  The school's mission is to provide an in-depth
understanding about ecology and the world as a whole.<P>

<B>The Republic of Buryatia Student Ecology-Biology Center</B>
(640038 Ulan-Ude, Oreshkovo, box 3076, tel. 4-59-41,
contact: Oleg Selyaev, and Sergei Tararin).  This Center
was opened in 1991 on the model of the former Republic
Group for Young Naturalists (founded in 1954).  The center
is a sort of "island" where urban children can experience
nature.  Here children are given the opportunity to work in
gardens and other natural settings.  They prepare flower
beds, plant seeds, and take care of their seedlings, look
after farm animals.  Before all else, this center seeks to
deepen the knowledge and basic understanding of natural
science through special study group programs.  They offer
organized programs on ecology, bee keeping, hydro-biology
and other topics.  In all, some 22 study groups are at
work.  The center cooperates with practically all schools
in Buryatia.  At present, this group is helping set up a
series of Republic-wide school ecocenters, where the unique
aspects of local natural habitat, as well as elements of
applied biology can be observed.<P>

<B>Window to the World</B> (672090, Chita, box 1041,e-mail:
chita@glas.apc.org, contact:Inga Zinovieva). This is a
joint project of the  Chita Chapter of the Baikal Fund, the
<A HREF="bcci.html">Baikal Center</A>, the Baikal Division of the Ecological
Academy, and the Zabaikalsk Center for Biodiversity
Preservation.  Together these groups organize seminars for
educators and environmental activists, develop school
programs for river monitoring (the so-called GREEN
project), and help schools prepare academic programs and
special ecology courses.  Two seminars have already been
held for teachers of the Baikal region on interactive
methods of ecological education.  This group also publishes
a news bulletin called "The Future Starts Today."<P>

The <B>All-Russian Society for the Protection of Nature</B>
(Irkutsk, Sukhe-Batora, 15, Vera Shlenova) is one of the
most active groups in helping coordinate the activities of
those occupied with issues of environmental education in
the Irkutsk region.<P>

<H2>Spanish Connections</H2>

The Buryat Regional Department for Lake Baikal and two
Spanish ecological associations: The Natural Heritage
Preservation League IPCENA (of Barcelona, Catalonia) and
The Institute for the Preservation and Study of Environment
DEPANA (from Laeida, Catalonia)---have set up a joint
program called Help Baikal.  In July of 1994, an agreement
on cooperation was signed in Ulan-Ude.  The basic task of
the project is to create an environmental education center,
whose purpose will be to facilitate sustainable development
and rational use of the region's natural resources.  The
project initiators have held two public meetings and have
prepared a brochure about Baikal for the Spanish public.
<P>

The Spanish ecologists took on the responsibility of
procuring financial support for creating this educational
center, which will:<UL>

<LI>Work with local peoples and help raise their ecological
consciousness;<P>

<LI>Develop concrete environmental education programs for
schools;<P>

<LI>Work on ecotourism projects;<P>

<LI>Develop student and scientific exchange programs.<P>

<H2>Baikal Center Seminars:</H2>

 Together with the Chita Division
of the <B>Baikal Fund</B>, the <B>Window on the World</B> program,
and with the collaboration and financial support of the
<B>Pacific Environment and Resources Center</B>, the second
regional teachers' seminar was held in Chita this last
July. The seminar focused on the subject of "Interactive
Methods of Environmental Education, Including Environmental
Games".  Seminar participants worked on the development of
a local chapter of <B>Project GREEN</B> (Global Rivers
Environmental Education Network), which teaches
schoolchildren to monitor water quality in small rivers. 
At least three schools from the Baikal region will take
part in this program.  <P>

The teaching materials and lesson plans are being prepared
by "Windows on the World." (See above.)<P>

The Baikal Center is continuing to compile a database to
widen the network of connections between environmental
education teachers.  The Center provides regular
consultations concerning existing eco-education programs,
organizations, and information sources.  Curricular support
and environmental literature has been provided to 11
regional schools.  In the Irkutsk region, the Center
collaborates with Larissa Slatina of the Irkutsk In-Service
Training Teacher's School and Larissa Chikalina.<P>

<TITLE>Baikal Currents-From local media and official sources</TITLE>

<H2>From local Baikal newspapers (July- September)</H2>

<H3>Natural gas of Kovykhta</H3>

Four American Banks have expressed an interest in helping develop this natural resource deposit.  Among the
first stock holders are the Irkutskenergo Enterprise, which intends to use the Kovykhta natural gas deposits
to increase local power capacities.  Other groups such as Bransvik and the American First Boston Bank, as
well as Japanese and Korean businessmen, have expressed serious interest in the Kovykhta deposits. Starting
in 1996 a Kovykhta development project will become part of the larger federal program, known simply as "Power
and Energy".<P>

<H3>New Laws and Regulations at Baikal</H3>

In July, a new  Law on Fees for Land was enacted in Irkutsk.  A Law on Tourism was adopted in Buryatia in
November. At the same time, a Tourism Law for the Irkutsk Region is being developed by the Irkutsk Regional
Law Institute.<P>

<H3>Sykhoy Log gold mine</H3>

On September 20,1994 the Government of the Russian Federation issued a resolution for the development of the
Sykhoy Log gold mine in the Irkutsk Oblast'.  Among the stock holders of the Lenzoloto (Lenagold) company is
the Australian Firm STAR.  Ten percent of the stock belongs to the Irkutsk Region itself, and 69 percent of
the stock holders are various private Russian companies.<P>

<H3>Lake shore terrain in danger</H3>

In February, 1995 the Irkutsk Regional <B>Comprehensive Ecological-Economic Program "Baikal"</B> was approved
by the administration of the Irkutsk region. According to a decree issued by the Irkutsk Governor, in 1995
alone, some 1,868 million rubles will have been allocated for the scheduled implementation of this program.
In August, 1995, a federal ordinance sent additional funding from the federal budget for this very program in
the Irkutsk region.  Thus, a total of 3,787 million rubles is to be spent on this program in 1995. All funds
will be used for <A HREF="fall95pr-en.html">re-enforcement of lake-shore terrain</A> in the southern part of
the lake.  (Another 2 billion rubles has been assigned from the regional Ecological Fund for the
implementation of a joint Russian-German landscape zoning program, and for the improvement of municipal
sewage treatment facilities in Sludyanka. <P>

<H3>Buryatia air emissions decreased</H3>

In Buryatia, due to a reduction in industrial development, air emissions decreased by 12.6 percent in
comparison with 1994. The main air polluters are Gusinoozersk power station, the Ulan-Ude Power Station, and
industry in the Kyakhta Region.<P>

<H2>Forestry Issues In Siberia.</H2>

by  Georgiy Kuznetsov<P>

"The fact that our region is the richest in forest resources in this country is a common knowledge,"  stated
Mr. V. Mironov, one of the leading foresters of the Irkutsk region.  This quote appeared in the "Eastern
Siberia Pravda" newspaper several years ago.  And at that time he meant not only Russia, but the entirety of
the Soviet Union.  To prove his point, one need only compare the total territory of the Irkutsk region, some
767,900 sq. km (or 285 thousand sq. miles) and its total forest area (714,450 sq. km.), and one accounts for
more than 92 per cent of the Oblast'. (figures are from the official state forest registration dated January
1, 1993).  <P>

Mr. Mironov goes on to say:

<BLOCKQUOTE> If one considers that about nine billion cubic meters of wood is concentrated in this region of
Russia, 80% of which is coniferous, then there should be no doubt that we are incredibly and fantastically
rich.  We can fell trees forever, and there will be still more. There will be more than enough left for our
children and grandchildren.  And when the time of our great grandchildren comes, new forests will grow where
we are felling trees today.  So it seems there is nothing to worry about.  Just fell, sell, and live
rich.</BLOCKQUOTE>

However, Vladimir Bulygin, who recently served as chief government nature protection inspector for the
region, and now is a lawyer for the regional government, offers a different point of view on the subject.  In
the "Eastern Siberia Pravda" newspaper he states: "Have a look at the forest, not through the reports of the
Forestry Department, but through an airplane window.  Half of our Siberia is as clean shaved as the head of
an old-time Siberian exiled prisoner."<P>

Annually, more that 150,000 square kilometers (or 55,000 square miles) of forest are logged in the Irkutsk
region, mostly without any foreign "participation".  According to Mironov, up to 30-40 percent of logged
trees remain unremoved from the forest. Lots of timber is wasted or lost in transport, and even more is
wasted in processing wood.  In Russia, on average, 1,000 cubic meters of timber are used to produce only 30
tons of paper.  For comparison's sake, the same amount of timber could produce up to 140 tons of paper in the
USA and more than 160 tons in Finland.<P>

Added to all this is the fact that, between 1981 and 1990, more than 1,435,000 hectares of forest in the
Irkutsk region were lost to forest fires.<P>

According to Deputy Governor Mr. Nosyrev, representatives of foreign timber companies that have approached
the government of the Irkutsk region so far are interested only in the export of raw, unprocessed timber. Not
one company has expressed any interest in creating a joint-venture for processing timber in the region. On a
more positive note, in recent years it has been noted that timber harvests in Irkutsk have decreased by more
than half.  But this reduction is not due to a wiser or more caring treatment of the forests, but to the
general economic crises that is slowing down Russia.<P>

<I>Facts and quotes provided by  Georgiy Kuznetsov, an environmental journalist living in Irkutsk.)</I><P>

<H2>Land Use Issues</H2>

Implementation of the joint Russian-American land use program for the Baikal watershed continues in 1995. The
Governmental Commission on Baikal recommended that it's findings be taken into consideration for any future
land use plans.<P>

(also see special supplement, p. 7 )<P>

<H3>Ecologically Sustainable Development's</H3>

In  1994-1995 (through May), the <A HREF="bcci.html">Baikal Center</A> assisted in implementing Ecologically Sustainable
Development's (ESD's) Comprehensive Land-Use Plan for the Baikal Region.  Baikal Center employees coordinated
all preparations for a summer of field projects in the town of Bolshoe Goloustnoe and on the island of
Olkhon.  Special task forces completed a church renovation project, restored and re cultivated a kilometer
long section of lake shore, and assembled a solar-panel system for the Bolshoe Goloustnoe school.  At Olkhon
a support center for local farmers was opened with the help of the <B>Schumacher Society</B> and ESD.  The
ESD contract was completed in May. Starting  in May of 1994, the  Irkutsk Regional Administration, Irkutsk
Institute of Geography, Irkutsk Committee on Nature protection, County Administrations of Irkutsk and Olkhon
started a joint project with a Land Use Bureau (GMBH) from Germany.  An official agreement was signed,
targeting the development of legal acts and norms for landscape zoning.<P>

Irkutsk governmental officials and specialists from the Institute of Geography got acquainted with land use
planning strategy from Germany. Field work took place in Bolshoe Goloustnoe and Olkhon.<P>

The fact that the question on other land use program was on the agenda of the Baikal Government Commission
(see  Special  Supplement, pp.5-6) gives us hope that governmental officials in the Irkutsk region will
coordinate their efforts with all parties involved.<P>

<H1>About The Baikal Center</H1>

<TITLE>Baikal Currents- About The Baikal Center</TITLE>

The fundamental goal of the <A HREF="bcci.html">Center</A>'s work is to offer informational and logistical help to the environmental
movement and to the citizens of Baikal.  It is to support citizen initiatives for change, and to help with
the development and implementation of independent environmental programs.  For these purposes, a substantial
part of the Center's time is dedicated to developing structures for processing information for other groups
or individuals.<P>

A significant part of the Center's work consists of providing consultative help to the region's visitors and
residents.  The Center often plays the role of "Tourist Information Center," providing information and advice
(for example, on whom to contact, where to find needed information, or who is working on this or that
project).  The Center makes arrangements for visiting scientists, activists, and journalists.  Consultative
services are <P>

also provided to help to find reliable sources of funding.<P>

<H2>Update</H2>

While the Center's work is headquarters in Irkutsk, it continues to serve and establish contact with groups
on both sides of the lake.  Following the closure of temporary offices in Ulan-Ude, the Buryat capital, and
Chita, all the Center's informational and coordinating work has been transferred to one office in Irkutsk. 
Happily, the number of volunteer helpers has grown.  (We are especially grateful for the help of Mikhail
Rybalko and Ariadna Reida, students at <B>Irkutsk State University</B>.)  The Center is also happy to welcome
aboard newcomers Yulia Bogomolova, Anna Maryasova, and Michael Agrafonov. We also grateful to Debra Sharky of
TBI, who spent 3 months in Irkutsk assisting  our work and  glad to admit a more close collaboration with
PERC and TBI.<P>

In Chita, as before, the BC's primary partner remains the <B>Baikal Fund</B>.  Questions regarding the activities
of Chita eco-groups may be directed to us in Irkutsk, or to Inga Zinovieva and Tatiana Strizhova in Chita.
Tel: (3022 2) 2-19-62;  e-mail: chita@glas.apc.org.  In Buryatia, the Center has established an
<B>Environmental NGO Support Station</B> which provides computers and e-mail access to 8 groups (see page 16 for
a list).  This station is located in the <B>National Library of the Buryat Republic</B> in Ulan-Ude<P>

 <H2>Baikal Center Club</H2>

The Baikal Center Club  began work in Ulan-Ude and Irkutsk, producing a calendar full of events such as
films, lectures, and TV-video screenings, meetings with visiting environmentalists and colleagues.  These
meetings are intended for guests visiting the region, people who work in the field of environmental
protection and/or sustainable development, and other NGO representatives. <P>

We encourage those who have travel plans to Baikal to let us know in advance of your visit:  The Baikal
Center Club is interested in arranging lectures and presentations for and by visiting NGO representatives,
scientists, scholars, and activists.<P>

<H1>Baikalsk Pulp And Paper Plant (BPPP)</H1><P>

<TITLE>Baikal CurrentsSupplement- Baikalsk Pulp And Paper Plant (BPPP)</TITLE><P>

Those who are concerned about Lake Baikal are aware of the problems
related to notorious Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Plant.  For over 30 years
this very iussue has been the centerpiece of discussions and arguments
between scientists, environmentalists, developers, industrialists and
governmental officials.  The environmentalists lost the battle to stop
construction of this huge factory on the shores of Baikal in the
1960's.  Since then, there have been various efforts to use common
sense and find an alternative to the existence of the Pulp and Paper
Plant at the southernmost point of Baikal. Some of these efforts have
been more obvious, but mostly they have consisted of  "routine" work by
researchers, scientists, and those who cared. <P>

Only when very obvious threats are posed (such as the  plan to
discharge Baikalsk Pulp And Paper Plant (<B>BPPP</B>) waste into Irkut
river) does the public pay attention  and become actively  and
effectively involved.  <P>

Over the last ten years, public attention to the Plant itself, as well
as to other ecological threats to Baikal, has subsided.  Only a few
activists have been trying to keep attention focused on this issue. 
Even the  development of a special Law on Baikal doesn't change the
situation with the BPPP very much: after many talks, none of the many
variants of this law have been adopted, and with each passage through
the legislative bodies the Law  becomes weaker and weaker (see page 3
of Baikal Currents).<P>

This fall, however, the Baikalsk Plant again became the center of
attention of various environmental activists and scientists throughout
the region and Russia. Even Greenpeace Russia has developed a Baikalsk
Plant campaign.  We hope that this latest wave of interest, action, and
legislation will finally lead to a permanent resolution of the problem
that will protect the lake, its environment, and its people.<P>

Please check here for <A HREF="supp95f-f.html">Facts And Figures On The
BPPP</A><P>

<H2>History of Official (In-)Action at BPPP</H2>

In 1987 the Soviets decided to reprofilie the mill within five years -
by 1993 at the latest. The decision was passed by the Central Committee
of CPSU and by the Council of Ministers as No. 433 dated 13.04.87.<P>

The Russian Federation Government reconfirmed the reprofiling decision 
by issuing decree No. 925 dated 2.12.92 , titled: " On Reprofiling the
Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Mill and Creating Compensating Industry to
Replace Pulp Production". <P>

A Comprehensive Federal Program to ensure the protection of the lake
was approved as No. 1306 dated 25.11.94. This program states:<UL>

<LI>The Baikalsk  Pulp and Paper Mill is the leading  industrial
enterprise causing irreparable damage to the environment and to the
health of the people, being the only one to be  situated on the shore
of the lake and discharging its waters into the lake.<P>

<LI>The Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Mill hasn't begun to fulfill the
Government's resolution on reprofiling; indeed, the Plant has been
investing in technological improvements for pulp production, thus
demonstrating that they does not intend to change the production
process, only make it more efficient. <P>

</UL>

In 1993, the Government of the Russian Federation, along with the
Ministry of Ecology, resolved to hold an international call for
proposals on potential remodeling of the Baikalsk Plant. The
competition never took place,. However, 8 variants for remodeling the
plant were considered by the Administration of the Irkutsk Region. The
so called "variant No. 8" was chosen as the most appropriate. <P>

According to the Head of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) for the
Irkutsk Committee on Nature Protection, Natalia Ryabukhina, all 8
variants have undergone an EIA. The approved 8th variant still doesn't
comply with all existing environmental regulations: it's EIA showed 15
points that need to be taken into consideration.<P>

Variant No. 8 calls for the diversification of the Baikalsk Plant by
establishing a mechanical timber processing enterprise and paper
production from imported materials.  The following production is
planned: lumber, prefabricated wooden houses, furniture, mattresses,
technological-mechanical pulp, paper for packaging, and wallpaper.  
The converted enterprise should provide employment for 1,700 people.
<P>

Variant No.8 was adopted by the Administration of the Irkutsk Region in
Resolution # 385 of December 29, 1993 and submitted to Goscomimushestvo
(The Federal Committee of the Russian Federation on Property) and
approved on August 25,  1994.  But this program was not introduced to
potential investors, and no bidding was announced. <P>

In September , 1994 another variant was introduced by the  Limnological
Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences by
M. Grachev, A. Suturin, N. Aldokhin, and A. Sukhodolov.  It was called
"rokirovka", or castling. It calls for converting the Baikalsk Plant
into a bottling plant for Baikal drinking water and for the production
of soft drinks  and liquor using Baikal water.  Also food and furniture
would be produced at the plant.  Simultaneously, it calls for the
modernization of the Selenginsk Plant and the construction of
facilities for producing bleached Kraft there.  It was calculated that 
this variant would require an investment of $150 million USD.  <P>

A task force to study this proposal was established under the umbrella
of the Administration of the Irkutsk region in May, 1995.  The European
Community has expressed interest in the idea, but it is still an idea
rather than a developed program or a project.  Still, it is the only
option that halts the production of pulp, with all of its attendant
ecological degradation, at the lake.<P>


<H2>Local  NGOs to UNIDO: "Say  What?"</H2>

Here is the response of local environmentalists regarding the findings
of the United Nations Economic Development Organization (<B>UNIDO</B>) experts:<P>

Environmentalists have been struggling for over 30 years against the
production of pulp at Lake Baikal.  It is clear that our Government,
while publicly supporting the remodeling of the mill, aims instead to
modernize the mill's pulp production.  They did not even mention
remodeling.  The <A HREF="supp95un.html">UNIDO recommendations</A> for modernization both shocked
and caused protest among specialists and researchers who are engaged in
ecological and technical issues concerning the Baikalsk Mill.  These
recommendations are self-serving and many of the statements were
contradictory.  Furthermore, many of the economic calculations didn't
seem to be right.[<I>See also</I> <A HREF="mccubbin.html">Neil McCubbin, formerly of UNIDO team,
comments.</A>]<P>

Ecological reasoning proves the fact that the UNIDO experts lacked
competence, although they sounded professional in their
press-release.<P>

Here's the proof :<OL>

<LI>The group, excluding the coordinator, consisted of 8 experts from
Finland (those who were ready to supply the modernization equipment),
Germany, Scotland, Holland, Russia and Canada.  The group included an
analyst on finance from Finland, a sociologist from Holland, and a
Russian researcher (Mr. Grachev, Russian Academy of Science
corresponding member ).  Dr. Grachev had difficulty finding a common
language with the othercommittee members ("differences in approaches" as we were informed by
the participants of the conference).<P>

The experts visited the mill for 1-8 weeks, and in their final report, 
they stated:<P><UL>

<LI>The Pulp and Paper Mill doesn't cause any damage to the environment
and to the health of the people<P>

<LI>The harmful substance emission regulations are too strict: they
should be liberalized and adapted to the production capacity  of the
mill (we ask: why not to the possible reaction of the environment and
the health of the people?) <P>

<LI>Despite this, the mill should be modernized (why, if everything is so
good already?) <P>

</UL>

Modernization would be going on for 5 years at all stages of the
production process, putting new equipment units into operation (that
means practically building a new mill within the premises of the old
one!) Remodeling the mill is unreasonable and would cost $600 million,
just modernizing the first production line would cost $118 million. 
These calculations are indisputably tricky:  if the mill were closed,
the cost of dismantling would amount to $230 million, including
financial support and social benefits for those who would lose their
jobs ($100 million), while if modernization were carried out, the work
force would be reduced (regarded as a positive argument), though social
benefits for them are not considered here. The report contains many
more such contradictory details.<P>

<LI> The <A HREF="supp95un.html">UNIDO expert recommendations</A> are
ecologically dangerous.  The experts propose burning old, accumulated sludge,  but they are surely
aware that dioxides (with a reputation for being terrible and toxic
substances) would be emitted into the air.  The experts also offered to
establish the standards for atmospheric emissions in kg/ton (they claim
it is a common practice everywhere in the world), instead of mg/cubic
meter for air and mg/l for water. The unit of kg/ton could be an index
of advanced technology and ecology only. If such units are accepted,
the mill is practically given Carte-Blanche for producing
100,000-300,000 tons of pulp.  The requirements on the emission norms
will be met, while  total environmental emissions will increase  2 or 3
times.  When referring to the accepted world norms for methylmercaptan emissions (
0.05 kg/ton ), the committee never tells us how much pulp those mills
are producing or how their environment differs from that of Siberia. [<I>See
also</I> <A HREF="mccubbin.html">Neil McCubbin, formerly of UNIDO team,
comments.</A>]<P>

<LI> It is unacceptable  to claim the necessity of adapting ecological
norms to meet  technical capacity.  We claim the norms should be
oriented toward protecting people and the environment from irrevocable
and harmful influences caused by pollutants. <P>

<LI> The experts fully ignore the unique quality of water in Lake Baikal 
and its chemical and hydro-biological parameters.  They don't have any
idea of the climate: Lake Baikal is situated in the center of the Asian
continent, the biggest in the world according to its latitude extent. 
It experiences anticyclones and calm winds nearly eight months a year,
while the Lake Baikal shoreline is noted for mountain and valley winds
and breezes.  Here the air emissions  hoveri over the mill zone for
7-10 days and then accumulating and whirling together with the
shoreline circulation.<P>

</OL>

Therefore, it seems strange that it was the city of Irkutsk, located 70
km away from Baikal, and not the Baikalsk Mill that was named as the
main source of pollution around the lake.  It is ridiculous to compare
the toxicity of the mill with that of Irkutsk, considering that Irkutsk
waste-waters cannot flow into Baikal, because Irkutsk is located
downstream of the lake, on the banks of Baikal's only outflowing river,
the Angara.<P>

The character of this document not only undermines United Nations Economic Development Organization (<B>UNIDO</B>)'s reputation
among Russian people, but it also makes us question the role of our
authorities, especially the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs.  It is quite
clear that the UNIDO initiative coincides very much with the intention
of developed countries to encourage the primary processing of raw
materials in developing countries, thus protecting their countries
against ecological crisis and expanding the equipment supply market.<P>

The Pulp and Paper Mill Management are well-known for their greediness
and use of any means to achieve their goals.  They demonstrated it in
the 1960s when they fooled the Government, stating that the Baikalsk
Mill would be emitting nothing but water and oxygen! They inspire fear
among their employees by predicting unemployment, thus making them
dependent on the mill.  They never mentioned the fact that, after the
modernization program they support, some workers will be thrown out.<P>

History is returning to the point where we are in danger of  losing our
Russian national heritage.  (Prepared by Vera Shlenova and Bella
Chebanenko on behalf of the Irkutsk Branch of the Society for Nature
Protection).<P>

<H2>RESOLUTION</H2>

Resolution of the Government Commission on Baikal, October 18, 1995,
Irkutsk<P>

The resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation of December
2nd, 1992,  No.925, envisaged the implementation of conversion of the
Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Plant over the period 1993-1995.  Neither the
Ministry of Economics nor Goskomprom (the State Committee for Industry)
saw to the implementation of  that resolution.<P>

In this situation, bearing in mind the necessity to solve the
environmental problems connected with the work of the Baikalsk Pulp and
Paper Plant,  and also the significance of the plant as fundamental to
the existence of the town of Baikalsk,  the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper
Plant worked out and coordinated an investment plan for the  Plant's
conversion together with the Irkutsk Regional Administration.   This
program was  sent  to Goskomimushestvo (the State Committee for
Property) but to date has not been confirmed. In 1995, an international
assessment of the situation at the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Plant and
options for conversion was undertaken with participation of  UNIDO
specialists.<P>

Bearing in mind the above, the Commission resolved:<P><OL>

<LI>To  ask the Government of the Russian Federation to change the<P>

period for the conversion of the Baikalsk Plant.<P>

<LI>To  ask the Government of the Russian Federation to make changes in
the "Complex Federal Program for ensuring the  protection of Lake
Baikal and rational use of the natural resources of its basin"
stipulating conversion of the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Plant and a
solution to the social problems connected with this in the town of
Baikalsk.<P>

<LI>To recognize the necessity of conversion of the Plant based on the
principles of the investment program agreed on by resolution No.385 of
the Head of the Irkutsk Oblast Administration, dated 29.12.93.<P>

<LI>To propose to the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Plant and
Goskomimushestvo that, together with Roslesprom (the Russian Ministry
of Forestry) and the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences, they
complete the above mentioned program, have it confirmed by the
respective Ministries and Departments and the Irkutsk Regional
Administration, and submit it to the Government Commission on Baikal by
the 1st of January 1996 for further confirmation by the Government of
the Russian Federation.  And while completing work on  the program, to
take into consideration the following:<P><UL>

<LI>provision for the protection of Lake Baikal as a World Heritage
Site;<P>

<LI>minimization of the impact of the plant on the region's natural
environment, including the exclusion of elemental chlorine from the
production process and the reduction of gaseous emissions;<P>

<LI>diversification of the plant's production.<P>

</UL>

<LI>To accept the proposal of the Russian Academy of  Sciences to
develop a model for the sustainable development of the south Baikal
region through 2005, together with the appropriate  Ministries and
Departments,  financed from the budget stipulated in the Baikal Program
and from other sources.<P>

</OL>

<H2>"In the Clutches of the Beaurocrazy" (sic) </H2> <P>

by Sergey Shapkhaev, Head of Buryat Department  on Baikal*<P>

At a meeting of the Governmental Commission on Baikal, held in Irkutsk
on October 18, 1995, it was confirmed that the situation surrounding
the problems of the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Plant (BPPP), as well as
the regulation of the lake level had come to a dead end with no
solution in sight.  <P>

As the BPPP problem was being discussed in front of this Commission, it
was becoming obvious that a bizarre "love quadrangle" had come into
play among the Irkutsk Oblast' administration, the State Forestry
Service, various federal agencies, and representatives from academic
science.  Each of these parties advanced their own rather convincing
and resounding arguments, shifting responsibility for solving these
problems onto the shoulders of their opponents. Industry
representatives strongly advocated the idea of modernizing the mill,
upholding the results of an international study recently performed by
UNIDO (the UN Commission on Industrial Development- see p. 4).  They
comcluded that, thanks to the technological progress of the last 10
years, the continued production of cellulose by the BPPP was by far the
most environmentally pure and harmless option for Baikal's ecosystem. 
<P>

The Director of the Limnological Institute for the Siberian Division of
the Russian Academy of Science, Dr. Grachev, criticized the results of
the UNIDO study.  After analyzing trends in the world cellulose market,
he came to the conclusion that, even with the transition to the latest
modern technology for processing cellulose, the mill's production will
soon become non-competitive due to rising costs for raw materials and
the use of water.  Moreover, the transition to modern technology will
result in a sharp cut in the number of mill workers, increasing the
social tension in Baikalsk and the Slyudyanka regions of southern
Baikal. "Improving a mega-industry in the region contradicts the idea
of sustainable development," added the scientist.  As a way out of this
situation, he suggested reprofiling the factory into a bottling plant
for producing Baikal drinking water and similar beverages and other
products.  He proposed transferring the production of bleached
cellulose to the Selenga Cellulose and Cardboard Plant, adding that the
economic assessment for this "castling" maneuver has found support from
the President and the Government of the Buryat Republic.<P>

The Chairman of the State Committee on Ecology for the Irkutsk Oblast',
Y. H. Udodov, expressed doubts about the introduction of absolutely
harmless cellulose production technologies in the foreseeable future,
considering current economic realities.  He called on the Government
Commission on Baikal to demonstrate their principals and order the BPPP
shareholders, the government of the Russian Federation, and the plant
administration to develop a timetable for reprofiling the BPPP, to the
exclusion of any cellulose or paper production.<P>

The Deputy Head of the Irkutsk Oblast' administration accused the
federal agencies of inaction and unwillingness to solve the BPPP
problem.  In part, he referred to the fact that the government of the
Russian Federation had in fact obstructed plans for an international
competition-convention for the reprofiling of the plant (they had done
this by not allocating sufficient funds to organize this convention). 
In his turn, the conference chair, Deputy Minister for Environment and
Natural Resources of the Russian Federation, A.A... Averchenkov,
shifted all responsibility for the present situation to the Ministry of
Economy and the Government Committee on Industry of the Russian
Federation, neither of whom had representatives present at the
conference.<P>

Finally, all interested parties, including the Siberian Division of the
Academy of Sciences, agreed to form a group which would, on the basis
of the Irkutsk Oblast' investment program (see page X), prepare a
proposal for the long-term future of the BPPP and present it to the
Government Commission on Baikal. Perhaps this decision only satisfied
the Academy of Science representatives, who usually receive special
funding in these cases for additional research.   (For a description of
what the Baikal Center's program intends to do about this situation,
see below)**<P>

The Buryat delegation, who in the first stages had maintained a
diplomatic silence, became much more lively after lunch, especially
when discussion turned to the regulation of the lake level.  The
Director of Irkutsk Energy, B. I. Syutkin, poured oil on a smoldering
fire when he predicted an impending ecological catastrophe in Irkutsk. 
He announced that the downtown section of the city would be inundated
following increased releases through the dam at the Irkutsk
hydroelectric station following an unusually wet summer.  The high
inflow-rate of rivers between June and August raised the level of
Baikal.  And in order to meet the requirements set by the Government
Committee on Baikal (in an agreement between the Irkutsk Oblast' and
Buryatia on the inadmissibility of letting the level of Baikal rise
above the 457.0 meter mark), workers at the power plant had begun
increasing the outflow of water through the dam.  This would lead to a
rise in the water level beyond the dam, in the tail waters below.
If--before the construction of the dam--these floods would last several
days, then now they would last a month or more.  In principle this
could lead to unwanted consequences for the large population of Irkutsk
(e.g., washing away buildings, destroying lines of communication,
etc.).  <P>

In the animated discussion that this touched off, more attention was
paid to possible methodologies for determining any damage that would be
caused by the artificial fluctuations in the level of Baikal.  A
decision was taken to finance a study of these methodologies by the
Ecological Fund of Irkutsk Oblast'.  For some reason, problems
concerning  damage and the calculation of compensation were mainly
discussed. However, the idea of solving the problems by minimizing them
 was practically not discussed at all. Somehow, everyone had earlier
resigned themselves to its inevitability, and concentrated on potential
liability claims.  This strategy could hardly be seen as
constructive.<P>

(In the end, the conference participants, having "let off steam" on the
previous questions, calmly and without emotion listened to short
presentations by A. Malevskiy, S. G. Shapkhaev, and I. P. Glazyrina. 
They reported on the implementation of the Comprehensive Program of
Land Use Policy for the Russian Portion of the Lake Baikal Basin, as it
was evolving on the territories of the Irkutsk Oblast', Buryatia, and
the Chita, respectively. It was taken under advisement to use the
experience and results of this work in implementing other programs that
affect the use of natural resources or the protection of biodiversity
in the Baikal Region.) <P>

<H3>Notes</H3>

* Buryat Department on Baikal (e-mail: shap@techn.buriatia.su) deals
with issues of  comprehensive use of land, was established  in 1993
with an American assistance for implementation of the land use program
and works with ESD (Ecologically Sustainable Development,
e-mail:esd@igc.apc.org, tel. 518-873-3200)<P>

** As part of the Citizen's Rights to a Healthy Environment Program,
the following steps will be taken to resolve the Baikalsk problem: <P>

1) organizing a database of all concerned parties and interpreting the
data for public consideration; <P>

2) engaging in active outreach and education campaigns in order to
promote public involvement;<P>

3) discovering why, after so many studies , proposals, and resolutions,
 nothing has been done to change the plant;  and holding accountable
those who are responsible for decisions not being implemented;<P>

4) advocating for an international competition for companies wishing to
invest in and reprofile the plant;<P>

5) organizing an international boycott of pulp products from Baikalsk
in order to reduce the plant's economic feasibility;<P>

6) organizing public hearing on the Baikalsk Plant as a case study for
public participation.<P>

<TITLE>Baikal CurrentsSupplement- United Nations Economic Development
Organization recommends.</TITLE>

Early in 1995, a local Baikalsk newspaper (<I>Baikalskiy Celluloznik</I>,
January 5) published information about the invitation of UNIDO (United
Nations Economic Development Organization) experts to develop one more
program for conversion of the Plant.  The experts' tasks were to
provide independent, expert advice on modifications to the process
employed at the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Plant.  In September, 1995 a
meeting to discuss the results of UNIDO's study  took place in
Baikalsk.  Excerpts from the UNIDO Final Document follow:<P>

"The Baikalsk Plant doesn't have a serious impact on Lake Baikal. From
the beginning of it's work in the 60s until 1990, the Baikalsk Plant
waste discharges are probably the best in the world.  Since then, only
a few enterprises which produce Kraft have been able to match the
quality of the Baikalsk discharges."<P>

"There are no appropriate alternatives to closing the Plant, so we can
avoid  the expenses connected with social issues. "The best protection
for the Lake will be if the existing Plant is modernized."<P>

"The standards for discharge at Baikalsk are the strictest in the
entire world. It is practically impossible to meet them."<P>

"The Plant has very good production capacity and good domestic and foreign market.<P>

"The technological processes at this plant, in comparison with similar
plants elsewhere, are relatively clean."<P>

"It is possible to achieve zero water and air emissions from this type
of industry, but it will require big investments. <P>

"At present, the Plant purifies waste
waters and produces energy.  It is possible to monitor it's air
emissions and water discharges.  It will be more difficult to monitor
the situation if somebody establishes small enterprises."<P>

"The only advantage of the Plant closure will be the elimination of air
emissions, which rae above established limits now, but not dangerous,
according to scientific research."<P>

"The closure of the plant will bring unemployment.  Recultivation of
the surrounding areaafter  dismantling the Plant will require
$229,000,000 US, and total expenses, including social and economic
costs, will be about $600,000,000 US.  It is difficult to find money
for those purposes." <P>

"Also, it is difficult to decide who will be responsible for the
storage of lignine. <P>

The will be no way to treat municipal wastes if the Plant is
closed."<P>

"In order to seriously consider the establishment of timber, wood
products, furniture, etc., serious feasibility studies and a real
business plan are needed."<P>

"There are no advantages to the idea of moving industrial facilities to
Selenginsk." <P>

"Discharges will be the same as at the Baikalsk Plant.  The bleaching
process in Selenginsk will cost more, since it will require additional
technological capacities, and capital investments will be much higher
than if the Baikalsk Plant is remodeled."<P>

"Due to the fact that, at present, no harm to Baikal is done by the
Baikalsk Plant, we recommend modernization, which will  reduce energy
consumption and minimize discharges into the lake, reduce air emissions
and solid waste discharges."<P>

"Complete modernization can be accomplished within the five year
period."<P>

<TITLE>Baikal Currents- Neil McCubbin, formerly of UNIDO team, comments.</TITLE>

<H1>Neil McCubbin, formerly of UNIDO team, comments.</H1>

<H3>Published by request of Neil McCubbin. Unedited.</H3>

I was very interested to receive your special supplement to your <A HREF="fall95.html">"Baikal
Currents"</A> newsletter which addressed the UNIDO study of the Baikalsk town and
industry in 1995.  As one of the members of the UNIDO team, I would like to
correct some misconceptions in the <A HREF="supp95un.html">document</A>, which I hope will be helpful in
resolving this issue in a logical way.<p>

Please note that I am writing this because I am interested in Baikal. My
assignment with UNIDO is over, and I have no professional involvement.<p>

<H2>Summary</H2>

The starting point of any discussion must be the situation as it exists to-day,
with an operating pulp mill on the shores of Lake Baikal.  Many hard words have
been said in the past, but re-hashing them leads only to hard feelings, not
solutions.<p>

Most people involved recognize that Lake Baikal deserves the highest level of
environmental protection, for scientific reasons (it is a very special body of
water) and also because is has a special place in the hearts of Russians.<p>

The UNIDO team was made up of seven independent experts from outside Russia,
some of whom have extensive experience in pulp and paper, while others have a
background in sociology etc. that gives them a very broad view of the world. 
All have experience in working in a variety of  economic, technical and
climatic conditions.  Only two could conceivably have a financial interest in
the modernization of the mill in the sense that their employers are are
engineers who get involved in building mills.  Their company, PI, is prabably
too small to become involved in Baikalsk.  I consider their inclusion in the
group quite reasonable, due to their engineering knowledge and the need for a
balanced analysis.  To the others, there is no conceivable financial advantage
in the outcome of the Baikalsk dispute.  I have been involved in developing
environmental regulations in Canada and the US, and have been widely criticized
by the industry for being too demanding.<p>

We all accepted the assignment because it is professionally interesting.  The
fees UNIDO pays are far below world market rates.<p>

The mandate was to consider all aspects, and we were given no instructions or
subjected to pressure to recommend a particular solution by UNIDO.  Naturally,
the mill staff wanted to keep the mill running, some local environmentalists
wished to close it, and we heard a number of positions expressed by the people
involved.<p>

The key issue is "What is best for Baikal?"  The team concluded that the Lake
and region are best with a modern, environmentally clean operating mill, which
would take care of the residual sludge lagoons and reduce air emissions
substantially.  We could not see any realistic possibility of developing
alternative industries in the town in any reasonable time frame.  It would
require at least tern years to develop industry and/or tourism to support the
population.  Other developments would not necessarily be environmentally
friendly. Around the world, the large modern industries are becoming cleaner,
while small industry and commence is much harder to control.  Tourism, in
particular, can be a serious environmental problem.<p>

If the mill is shut down, we have serious concerns that the money to clean up
the site would not be available, and that uncontrollable industry would take
over, with undesirable environmental consequences. In principle, the government
is responsible, but in view of much more serious concerns elsewhere, we believe
that if the mill is shut down, it would simply rot, and ultimately the lignin
lagoons would leak to the lake due to lack of maintenance.<p>

The greatest environmental risk would be that the mill continue, with
modernization paralyzed by continuing dispute, till the mill cannot maintain
its environmental protection measures.<P>

<H2>Comments by NGO's on UNIDO Report</H2>

Some points require clarification or correction.

<H3>UNIDO team</H3>

Refer to above, and note that the Finnish and Austrian suppliers of pulping
equipment who were at the Baikalsk meetings in September, were NOT involved in
the team.  I believe they were invited to the mill to explain the environmental
advantages of the technology the mill.  The UNIDO team had no contact with them
prior to reaching conclusions and writing the report.<p>

<H3>Emission Regulations.</H3>

We did not say they should be adapted to mill capacity.  We said they should be
based on mass flow of pollutants, NOT concentration.  If limits are based on
concentration, them the mill is encouraged to use plenty water to dilute
discharges.  We discussed limits in terms of kg/ton pulp since this is the
practical and widely accepted way of comparing mills and environmental
protection technology.  The mill limits should be converted to units of kg/day
that are low enough to protect the lake and to force the best available
pollution prevention technology.  Some of the current limits are far lower than
science can support, and only serve to force additional energy consumption for
no benefit.<p>

NGO's questioned "If mill is so good, why modernize".  The answer is to correct
equipment of declining efficiency and to make the mill best in the world with
respect to water pollution.  It was best for many years, but technical advances
have put a few mills ahead of it.  Also, the technology we recommended is a
major step towards zero effluent.<p>

We do not regard a reduction in mill employment as positive step.  It is a fact
of life that technological advances increase efficiency. They also increase
prosperity ,and open up other employment opportunities. We are well aware of
the significance of incinerating dioxin containing sludge.  The process can be
controlled satisfactorily.  The fact is the sludge exists, and a positive
solution is desirable.  The tendency to criticize all incineration because some
incinerators do not work well defies common sense.<p>

When criticizing the unreasonably low limit on methyl mercaptan discharges, we
are well aware of the Siberian conditions.  The mills we referred to with
respect to the limit of 0.05 kg/ton produce anywhere from 200 to 3000 tons per
day pulp.  Baikalsk has about half the capacity of the average mill in North
America or Scandinavia or Brazil.<p>

We are very well aware of the unique quality of Baikal water.  We examined
considerable data from Russian and foreign investigators, and considered the
reliability of the data carefully.  I have worked in Canada for many years,
where the climate is similar to Siberia.<p>

When we pointed out that Irkutsk had an effect on the lake, we were referring
to airborne pollutants.  I assume the comments in the newsletter were due to a
mistranslating somewhere.<p>

I am not sure it is true to say that developed countires wish to encourage
primary processing of raw materials in developing countries to protect their
own environments.  However, this is a very complex issue, and I agree that
there are may things to criticize in the policy of the developed countries.<p>

There is a worldwide problem in that developed countries have more stringent
environmental controls, but this is not relevant to Baikal, since the mill
regulations are much more stringent than in any Western country.  I suggest
that the solution to the Baikalsk problem can be found best by logical
discussion, and not by unsupported emotional statements.<p>

<H1>For Life In Baley</H1>

<TITLE>Baikal Currents Supplement- For Life In Baley</TITLE>

Baley  is a town in the Chita region with a population of 23 thousand,located on
the Unda river, 350 kilometers east of Chita, approximately 1000 kilometers from Baikal.<P>

This town, despite being small and very remote, is well known as one of the centers of the Russian gold mining industry.<P>

Gold was discovered in Baley  during the "gold rush" at the end of the 19th century.  In 1928, quartz veins rich in gold were discovered.  In
August, 1929,  an enterprise called BaleyZoloto (Gold of Baley) was established
and intensive gold mining began.<P>

By 1933, 33 per cent of the entire gold mining of Eastern Siberia was
concentrated in Baley. <P>

But Baley is also known (not so broadly, though) as a center for mining monocite,
a mineral which contains uranium and thorium 232. Thus, the natural level of
background radiation in Baley is rather high: 60-70 microroentgen per hour (in
Chita it is 14-16 microroentgen per hour). <P>

The entire area of Zabaikal'e is known for a very peculiar natural environmental
condition: high levels of radon and  radioactive emissions, which are good to
keep in mind whenever talking about development in this area.<P>

As complex a situation as this is, it has been further  complicated by the
careless and irresponsible development during the Soviet era: after the ore was
processed, sand tailing dumps  were not properly taken care of, and no
rehabilitation measures took place.  Instead, this fine, nice-looking golden sand
was used by the developer (now shut down, it was a subdivision of what is now
Minatom:  Ministry of Nuclear Affairs)  for the construction of apartment
buildings and  kindergartens.  Indeed, a prudent developer never wastes any
materials! And this action caused a disaster.<P>

For years people have been exposed to high levels of radioactivity and didn't
even suspect it.  The Chita Branch of Federal Medical Sanitary Inspection tried
to draw attention to this fact in the 80s, but at the time, this area was
"classified" and monitoring of the site was the domain of the Third Department
(connected to the Defense Ministry) of  the Ministry of Health. Subsequently, the
results of the monitoring were never made public.  Only in 1992 was the local
sanitary inspection allowed to perform an Environmental Impact Statement. The
radiological EIS confirmed that the situation in Baley, Krasnokamensk, and
Oktyabrskiy was disastrous. (The remaining dumps have still not  complied with
all existing regulations). <P>

<H2>Extracts from the report of 1992  geochemical expedition</H2>

 There are 11
local abnormalities within the total area of 11 square kilometers, with a high
background radiation at 50 bekkerel per cubic meter (this is 6 to 33 times normal
levels). <P>

71 buildings were inspected, 27 of them apartment buildings.  Radon concentration
is 2 to 37 times above the permissible level, at  200 bekkerel per cubic meter.
Thus, the annual dose of radiation is over 2 ber per year, or 4 times higher than
accepted norms.<P>

<H2>Extracts from "The Report on the Health of the Population of the Chita
region"</H2>

Nov. 14, 1994 by the Eastern Siberian Science Center of the
Russian Academy of Medicine:<P>

A preliminary medical-ecological survey conducted in 1993 by the Siberian Branch
of the Medical Scientific Academy revealed that the level of oncological disease
(predominantly lung cancer) in Baley outrates all other places in the Chita
region.  It is 3-4 times higher than in other areas.  Down's syndrome is
diagnosed here 3-5 times more often than in European areas.  A survey of
children's health revealed a devastating situation:  <P>

95.4% of children suffer minor physical abnormalities, <P>

81% have changes in immunnograms (three times higher than normal)  Concentrations
of sodium in hair is 8 to 25 times higher than normal<P>

Concentrations of manganese is 3 to 48 times higher than normal.<P>

In atmospheric air in Baley, proportions of lead, manganese, arsenic and  mercury
are 50 times higher than allowed by sanitary norms.  19 percent of women in Baley
and Krasnokamensk (a town with an industrial uranium mine, south of Baley) end
their pregnancy with miscarriages.<P>

54.8 % of children have speech problems and psychological activities connected
with the development of speech are reduced.<P>

Compensatory abilities of the nervous system are very limited.<P>

The level of congenital abnormalities in children of Baley and Krasnokamensk
(9.83 per 1000) is 5.2 times higher than in Irkutsk, and 3-8 times higher than in
Kazakhstan or St. Petersburg.<P>

4.7% of children were diagnosed with oncological disease.<P>

Rather rare problems, such as congenital cataracts, are registered extremely
often in Baley.<P>

73.3 % of the children have symptoms of immune deficiency.<P>

<H2>From  interviews with  the  citizens of Baley:</H2>

"If I learn that I got cancer, I'll find a gun and go and shoot all our
government officials. I don't care, since I will die anyway..."  <P>

"Shall we write a  letter to the United Nations in order to be heard?"<P>

"Probably, all of us who live in contaminated houses shall gather together, go to
the closest train station and block the railroad. Maybe then somebody will pay
attention to our situation?"<><P>

<H2>Chronology of official documents and events on Baley.</H2>

The radiological situation in Baley was studied by a Federal Environmental Impact
Statement on October 15, 1992.<P>

The Chita Regional Administration developed a program for the Normalization of
the Radioactive Situation in Baley, Krasnokamensk and Oktyabrskiy for 1993-19925.
The estimated cost was over 8 billion rubles (1992 prices).<P>

Federal Agencies approved the program as a whole on July 26, 1993,  and
recommended that Minatom include measures to rehabilitate the areas contaminated
as a result of nuclear industry, allocating 2,487 billion rubles from the federal
budget.<P>

This decision was confirmed by the Russian Government on July 6, 1994 with The
Emergency Measure on Handling Radioactive Wastes for 1994. In addition, an
agreement allocating 785 million rubles to he Chita region was signed. (Not one
kopeck has been received from federal funds for this program so far).<P>

Also, the Chita region, parts of which the EIS declared to be disaster areas,
became a part of the Federal Program "RADON", which was established in 1994-95 to
reduce levels of radiation among the population.  This program (which is still
not adopted by the government) also suggests allocating  money from the regional
budgets. This means that it will not be implemented, since the Chita Regional
Treasury is empty.<P>

In 1993, 8 million rubles were provided for Baley to take care of its problems.
According to the estimates of the local administration it will annually require
4,500,000,000 rubles (1993 prices).<P>

Meanwhile, the situation in Baley and the surrounding area becomes more and more
devastating. <P>

<H2>For Rich or For Poor, For Better or For Worse......?</H2>

A Canadian gold company, Armada Gold, holds 56% of the shares of Baley Gold and
49% of Baley Tailings. According to information provided by the company itself on
the World Wide Web, the gold deposit at Baley is an open pittable resource of
approximately  65 million tons at a grade of 3.3 gm/ton or 6.9 million ounces.
The tailings have an average of 0.8 gm of gold per ton, and contain about 1.1
million ounces. <P>

Feasibility studies have been completed and they propose resuming operations at
Baley in the summer of 1996. <P>

<H2>Goal of the <A HREF="bcci.html">Baikal Center</A>  Program</H2>

In response to a request from the town administration and the NGO "For Life In
Baley" and in cooperation with the Chita Branch of The Baikal Fund, we are
initiating a two-fold program:<P>

1. To find an approach which will allow some positive changes for Baley;<P>

2. To empower local people to make these changes.<P>

The final objectives of the program are:<P>

1. To develop documents for consideration by the Government of the Russian
Federation for recognition of Baley as an ecological disaster zone (which 	<P>

means that some emergency funds will be allocated from the federal budget);<P>

2. To introduce a legal initiative as a measure of social justice for Baley
citizens 	<P>

and to provide compensatory measures;<P>

3. To publish a booklet with stories of Baley inhabitants and Baley as a study
case; <P>

4. To initiate a civil case on behalf of families in Baley.<P>

Also, while working on this program, we are  looking for charitable organizations
which will be able and willing to provide assistance to the Baley Children's
Hospital, which is in a state of collapse.  For more information and a list of
emergency help needed please  contact us at  e-mail: <baikalwatch@igc.apc.org> or
<chita@glas.apc.org>, or <irkutsk@glas.apc.org><P>

<H2>A Community-based Mapping Workshop,
Baram Region, Sararak</H2>
1995
<P></P>


<P>In mid-1995 The Borneo Project conducted a mapping workshop in the Baram region of Sarawak, East Malaysia.  The intent of the workshop was to provide the indigenous representatives in the area with practical skills they would need to be able to produce maps of their land and resources.  Maps can be an important source of documentation for indigenous resource knowledge, land use, and planning.  And, in light of the continuing destruction of the forests for timber production and other land conversion schemes, maps can be a critical form of documentation for legal defense of native customary lands.</P>

<IMG SRC="mapping.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT alt="Map of Borneo" VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5>

<P>
	The workshop was held at the longhouse village of Sungai Keluan (Berkeley's sister community), but participants came from all over the Baram region.  Participants, men and women, ranged in age from 18 to 70.  We emphasized the importance of participation of as many different people in the community as possible.  And while some had received more education than others (especially the younger folks), others had a profound knowledge of the local landscape, including local names and boundaries, which was critical to the mapping efforts.  </P>

	The approach taken in conducting the workshop was twofold: first, we emphasized the fact that they are the experts on their land and resources, and therefore it is up to them to determine what would be mapped; second, we taught mapping concepts and techniques, and provided materials needed to gather data and produce maps. </P>
<P>
	In order to determine and prioritize the mapping needs of the participants, we facilitated a number of group discussions which encouraged participants to think about the issues they needed to address and the resources to be mapped.  Next we conducted a sketch-mapping exercise in which members from the various communities used tape, string, paper and any other materials they chose to layout a large-scale map of their lands; these tactile maps were then transferred onto paper maps.  The results were astounding.  After hours of enthusiastic and animated discussions, the groups had produced high quality, albeit not highly accurate, maps of their respective territories, most seeing their land on a map for the first time.
	The formal training component of the workshop can be divided into two distinct phases: (1) "classroom" instruction of map-related concepts and techniques; (2) practical exercises in data collection, plotting of field data, and drafting of final maps. </P>
<P>
	The teaching of the conceptual material was perhaps the most challenging part of the workshop.  Concepts such as scale, compass direction and geographic coordinates are complex, especially for people with a limited education.  However, with repetition and some creative improvisation, we were able to convey these concept to a majority of the participants.  This was an important component of preparing them for making meaningful and accurate maps. </P>
<P>
	After several days of instruction in the corrugated steel-roofed community pavilion we were all ready to go into the field.  Splitting into teams, we surveyed trails, streams, and boundaries using compass (direction) and tape (distance), meticulously recording data points and significant features on the landscape.  In addition, to the traditional compass and tape, we used to 2 global positioning system (GPS) units (donated by Magellan Systems Corp.) to gather precise geographic coordinates for selected points.  While introducing this technology complicated the process of instruction, the power of this tool has the potential to greatly enhance mapping efforts in the region. Phase II of the mapping project will involve a follow-up training in the more advanced applications of GPS.</P>
<P>
	In the final few days of the workshop we turned to the task producing maps from the data we had collected.  After determining an appropriate scale, each team plotted the survey data they'd collected onto graph paper.  The survey lines were then rectified according to GPS points, which provided a network of "control points" of geographic coordinates, providing a link to maps of Sarawak or the world as a whole.  Finally, this "raw" data was to be traced onto a final map, to which was added a legend, title, scale, source, and other pertinent information.  Unfortunately, time constraints prevented us from plotting all the points collected and producing a final map.  But we were gratified to find out that within a week of our departure, the participants continued the work and produced a high-quality map of their forest preserve area. </P>
<P>
	The enthusiasm over the mapping workshop was palpable among the participants.  Village elders stressing the importance of recorded information about their land renewed the struggle to defend their way of life.  The younger generations feeling empowered expressed optimism about controlling their own future.  And we out-of-place Westerners preparing for departure felt that we had learned as much if not more from these peaceful, good-natured people living their day-to-day existence in the beautiful, at times harsh, Borneo interior.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Asian Forests Disappearing 
Faster and Faster</P></H2>

By Leah Makabenta
<P>

BANGKOK, Feb 28 (IPS) - The good news is that with new satellite imagery, scientists can now find out exactly how much forest is left in the world and of what kind.
<P>

The bad news is: they have found forests, especially in Asia, are disappearing faster and faster.
<P>

The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) carries out a study of tropical deforestation every 10 years. In 1980, the estimated deforestation rate for the Asia-Pacific region was two million hectares per year.
<P>

According to FAO's latest estimates, the annual rate of deforestation in Asia increased during 1981-1990 to 3.9 million hectares -- about 1.3 percent of the total forest. This is 50 percent more than the loss rate for Latin America, and Asia's forests are disappearing so fast that FAO now says it may have to do its 10-year forestry survey more frequently.
<P>

''One percent may not look like a lot, but when you consider that it has occurred over a period of 30 years, it is enormous,'' says Klaus Janz, a senior FAO forestry official.
<P>

FAO figures show the rate of deforestation is highest -- two million hectares a year -- in insular South-east Asia (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea).
<P>

In continental South-east Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam), the rate is 1.4 million hectares a year while in South Asia it is 1.7 million hectares.
<P>

Thanks to recent advances in science and technology, it is now possible to track down the exact amount of forests that the world loses each year as well as their causes and effects.
<P>

The state of forest lands can be determined by satellite imagery. Remote sensing can monitor and assess land use patterns. Data can be digitised and analysed using geographical information systems (GIS).
<P>

Having found a method of assessing the problem, however, forestry experts from different regions often find it difficult to arrive at a common understanding of their subject. ''When we want information on 'lowland dipterocarpus forests' from a group of countries, we may receive data about 'tropical moist forests', 'tropical rainforests', 'tropical broadleave evergreen forests', and so on. But do they all encompass the same things?'' asks FAO's regional representative for Asia-Pacific, Obaidullah Khan.
<P>


International forestry experts are meeting in the Thai capital this week to review the state of forest resources monitoring systems in the Asia-Pacific region.
<P>

Deforestation is among the most serious of the environmental problems facing the region, indiscriminate felling of forests having occurred with particular severity during the last three decades, according to the U.N. agency.
<P>

This uncontrolled dissipation of forest resources was at the centre of concern at the 1992 U.N. Earth Summit in Brazil, said Khan. The Agenda 21 blueprint for environmental action stressed the importance of forest resources monitoring and assessment for proper conservation and utilisation measures, he said.
<P>

The five-day Bangkok meeting, which ends Friday, will discuss ways to standardise forest type classification systems, assess and improve the accuracy of information, and enhance the capacities of the various countries for carrying out this work.
<P>

Incompatibility of figures over forest types among countries is only the first obstacle in collecting accurate forest resources information in many developing countries in the region, said FAO regional forest resources officer M. Kashio.
<P>

Countries have differing technological and institutional levels, with some having fully utilised modern technologies such as remote sensing information and GIS while many are still on the development stage in these technologies.
<P>

The objectives of the forest assessment work itself may also need to be reviewed to include not just volume and value of timber but also other resources of the forest such as biodiversity, soil and water conservation functions.
<P>

FAO experts now say their present forest resources assessment exercise every 10 years may not be sufficient to monitor the accelerated deforestation in developing countries.
<P>

Meeting participants include forestry officials from Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.
<P>

They are joined by experts from Britain's Cambridge University, the Bangkok-based Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) and from other U.N. agencies, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which monitors the global environmental situation by satellite and the Mekong Secretariat which recently launched a forest resources assessment programme.

<P>
Press Release, Lahmeyer International Frankfurt am Main Germany  October 17,
1995 
</P>

<H2>Lahmeyer International is Planning Bakun Hydropower Project in Sarawak,
Malaysia 
</H2>

<P>Bakun, the most important hydroelectric power plant in Southeast Asia with
an installed generating capacity of 2400 megawatts and a financial cost of more
than six billion DM, is to be constructed over a period of seven years and
finished by the year 2003. Lahmeyer International has been contracted to plan
the hydropower facility and to draw up the contract documents for the
construction and tendering and will support the project development groups
during their contract negotiations.

<H2>Seminar on Bakun Dam: Feasibility, Impact and Alternatives
</H2>

<P>
 2nd &amp; 3rd December 1995    </P>

<P> Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 
</P>

<P>(Organised jointly by Institute For Community Education and Selangor Chinese
Assembly Hall-Youth, in collaboration with the Coalition of 40 Malaysian NGOs)  
                  </P>

<CENTER>SEMINAR RESOLUTION 
</CENTER>

<P>The Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and participants present at the
Bakun Dam Seminar on the dam's feasibility, impact and alternatives held on the
2nd and 3rd of December 1995 call upon the Government to address the following
issues:</P>

<P>1) Viability
</P>

<P>
Serious questions have been raised concerning the Bakun Hydroelectric Project's
(HEP) viability in terms of economic, ecological, technical, social and cultural
considerations.  Specifically, the Bakun HEP is not economically viable; and the
current dam design has not adequately addressed the dangers of flooding and
reservoir-induced seismicity.  We urge the Government to seriously consider
viable alternatives to the existing Bakun HEP proposal. Views and suggestions
from the public and concerned NGOs must be seriously considered.
</P>

<P>
2) Access to Information 
</P>

<P>We urge the government to make publicly available all 17 feasibility studies
and reports conducted on the Bakun HEP. All the appendices, interim and final
reports of the relevant Environment Impact Assessments must also be made
accessible to the general public. We urge the Government to declare publicly its
resettlement plan for the affected communities. 
</P>

<P>3) Public Accountability 
</P>

<P>We urge the government to respect due process of environment impact
assessments (EIA) by making all EIA reports publicly available prior to their
approval. We urge the Government to conduct integrated studies into the Bakun
HEP as one single project, to consider its social consequences, economic costs,
and ecological impact. 
</P>

<P>4) The Needs of the Indigenous Communities 
</P>

<P>We are concerned that the Government's Resettlement Plans have not been made
public. It is our understanding that there is a plan to resettle the affected
communities in the infertile Belaga area in which they cannot make a decent
living - this is not acceptable. We further note that the affected communities
themselves have expressed opposition to this resettlement plan.  We urge the
Government to resolve all outstanding issues pertaining to the resettlement and
compensation of the affected communities.  We further urge the Government to
base its development projects on a serious consideration of the needs and
aspirations of the indigenous communities. It is essential that all the people
participate in the decision-making process, and are informed of all alternatives
related to this Bakun HEP. 
</P>

<P>5) Alternatives
</P>

<P>
We understand that there are sufficient energy alternatives that are cheap and
viable to sustain Malaysia's future energy requirements. There should be a
coherent Energy Policy based on energy conservation and renewable resources.  We
urge the Government to explore all other viable energy alternatives to the Bakun
HEP. The Bakun HEP must not resume until all such studies are exhausted.
</P>

<P>
6) Access 
</P>

<P>We urge the Malaysian and Sarawak Government to provide unrestricted access
to Sarawak and the Bakun HEP site to all concerned individuals and NGOs.  In
this regard, we protest that Dr. Weilou Wang was unable to obtain a visa to
attend this seminar and share his expertise with the participants. This was in
spite of him making his applications one month before the seminar.
</P>

<P>
7) Ultimate Responsibility
</P>

<P>We urge the Government to clarify its position in committing public funds to
the construction of the Bakun HEP.  Since Ekran Berhad is believed to bear only
20% of Bakun HEP's total equity, we urge the Government to clarify the parties
financially responsible for the completion, operation and maintenance of the
Bakun HEP.  We further urge the Government to give a public assurance that the
electricity tariffs will not be increased to subsidise the Bakun HEP.  WE URGE
THE GOVERNMENT TO CEASE ALL WORK ON THE PROJECT SITE, AND MUST NOT RESUME, UNTIL
ALL THE ABOVE MATTERS ARE RECTIFIED. 
</P>

<H2>Sarawak Government empowered to approve EIA Report
</H2>

<P>
The Borneo Post (front page)
</P>

<P>December 7, 1995  KUALA LUMPUR. The Sarawak Government is empowered to
evaluate and approve the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report for the
Bakun hydro-electricity project, the Dewan Rakyat, was told today.  Following
the passage of the Sarawak Natural Resources and Environment Ordinance 1993, the
state government has such powers, Deputy Minister of Science, Technology and
Environment Datuk Abu Bakar Daud said. 
</P>

<P>The Ordinance was to ensure that development projects which were likely to
have an effect on the environment were subjeced to EIA studies particualrly
projects involving resources under the jurisdiction of the state government. 
The Bakun hydro project was government by the ordinance, Abu Bakar said when
winding up the debate at committee stage on matters pertaining to his minstry in
the Supply Bill for next year. 
</P>

<P>He was responding to the points raised by Dr Maximus Johnity Ongkili
(PBS-Bandau) who wanted to know why the Sarawak Government had been given the
power to approve the EIA report and had expressed the hope that it would not set
precedent for other states. 
</P>

<P>At this point Dr Tan Seng Giaw (DAP-Kepong) rose to say that conferring such
powers to approve EIA reports to state government was not correct in line with
moves to coordinate efforts to safeguard the environment.  Abu Bakar said under
the Federal Constitution land and forests were under the jurisdiction of state
governments.   
</P>

<H2>BAKUN BULLETIN  
</H2>

<P>This bulletin was prepared by Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM/Friends of the
Earth, Malaysia). They may reached at 27 Lorong Maktab, 10250 Penang, Malaysia.
Fax No: + 6 04 375  705, Phone No: + 6 04 376 930. 
</P>

<P>1. BAKUN CASE POSTPONED TO 24 JANUARY 1996 
</P>

<P>~ The legal suit brought by Kajing Tubek, Tahu Lujah and Saran Imu against
Ekran Berhad, the Malaysian Government and the Malaysian Director General of
Environmental Quality has been adjourned yet again at the behest of the
defendants. 
</P>

<P>~ The case was originally meant to be heard by the Kuala Lumpur High Court
on 4 August 1995 but was adjourned to 14 December 1995 . However, due to a last
minute application by the Attorney Generals chambers to the High Court, the case
has been adjourned once again--this time, to 24 January 1996 ... we hope it will
then be heard!  
</P>

<P>2. SECOND PART OF BAKUN EIA APPROVED WITHOUT PUBLIC FEEDBACK 
</P>

<P>~According to Ekran's executive chairman, Tan Sri Ting Pek Khiing, the
second part of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) report was approved by
the Sarawak Natural Resources and Environment Board (NREB) on 9 December 1995. 
The second part of the EIA cocncerns the construction of the dam and ancillary
facilities.  Public interest groups such as Sahabat Alam Malaysia have expressed
their outrage at the approval of the second EIA by the NREB:
</P>

<P>
~The practice of making EIAs available to the public after it is approved makes
the EIA meaningless. EIAs have to be made public before they are approved. This
is to enable comments to be made to the relevant approving bodies. Approval
should be given only after the comments are given due and proper consideration.
For a gigantic and controversial project like the Bakun dam it is all the more
reason why the EIA must be displayed and made public before it is approved. An
open and transparent EIA process will strengthen public confidence.</P>

<P>~The first part of the EIA, on Reservoir Preparation was approved by the
NREB in April this year. The approval of the first EIA also generated tremendous
controversy as the authority for approval of the EIA was transfered from the
federal level (the Department of Environment) to the state level (the NREB). 
The transfer of jurisdiction from federal level to the state level was effected
by a retrospective amendment to the Environmental Quality (Prescribed
Activities) (Environmental Impact Assessment) Order 1987, which was published in
the Government Gazette of 21 April 1995.  3. Financing and Construction of the
Bakun dam
</P>

<P>~ Ekran Berhad intends to list its 100 per cent owned Bakun Hydroelectric
Corporation Sdn Bhd on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) as a means of
financing the RM 15 billion Bakun Hydroelectric Project (BHEP). Ting Pek Khiing,
the executive chairman of Ekran said an application for the proposed listing
would be made to the Securities Commission next year.  
</P>

<P>~ The construction of the Bakun dam will be undertaken by the Bakun
Hydroelectric Corporation Sdn. Bhd. (BHC). While the tender for the construction
of the dam, power plant and transmission lines will be closed on 15 January
1996, the BHC has already awarded a RM 247 million contract to the South Korean
Dong-Ah Construction and Industrial Co. to divert the Balui River.  Dong-Ah
Construction and Industrial Co. built the Songsu bridge over the Han River in
central Seoul which collapsed, killing 32 people in October last year.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Borneo Forest Reserve for Trekkers and Scientists</P></H2>


<P ALIGN=CENTER>by Amy Haight, Reuter (Tue, 8 Nov 94)
<P>



BATANG AI, Malaysia (Reuter) - Cancer scientists and backpackers could soon be running into each other in a remote stretch of Borneo jungle that is being turned into one of the world's largest tropical rainforest reserves.
<P>
         
The 2.47 million acre virgin rainforest, straddling Malaysian and Indonesian territory on the huge southeast Asian island of Borneo, is the largest transfrontier reserve in the wet tropics.
<P>
         
The Lanjak Entimau/Bentuang-Karimum Biodiversity Conservation Area -- not the most user-friendly name to tout in tourist brochures -- is home to many newly discovered species of endangered plants and animals, including land crabs, snakes and lizards, local scientists say.
<P>
         
The mountainous, officially protected area is virtually inaccessible and that is the way its protectors would like it to stay. But for the adventurous, and patient, traveler, it represents one of the world's few remaining frontiers.
<P>
        
The easiest way to reach Lanjak Entimau, the Malaysian part of the transfrontier park, is a five-hour bus trip over mostly unpaved roads from the Sarawak capital of Kuching to the Batang Ai Longhouse Resort, managed by Hilton International Co.
<P>
         
From there, Lanjak Entimau is just a 25-minute helicopter ride away, or a four-hour boat journey up river -- or a two-day trek through mostly untracked jungle.
<P>
         
The helicopter lands not far from the hut of a local scientist.
<P>
         
Ecologist Paul Chai has been studying the forest reserve for six months and his discoveries include 1,000 new species of trees.
<P>
         
Knee-deep in the vegetation he was observing, Chai admires a legume vine, the largest vine in the rainforest.

``These vines live in harmony with the trees. They wrap themselves around the cane palms and are very important to the surrounding environment,'' Chai said.
<P>
         
He spends his days laboriously collecting species and discussing their properties with the local Iban tribe.
<P>
         
``The local tribes use these plants for birth control as well as curing cough, kidney disorders, snake bites and infertility. Our findings are proving this to be true. We want to learn as much as we can from them before the older generation passes on,'' Chai told Reuters.
<P>
         
Cancer research has already taken place in the surrounding area of Sarawak, an oil and timber-rich state on the Malaysian part of Borneo.
<P>
         
In 1993, the National Cancer Institute of America approved the compound Costatolide as an interim replacement for Calanolide for preclinical trials. Both substances were collected from two species of Bintangor trees in Sarawak.
<P>
         
Recently, both compounds have been found to be AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) inhibitors.          
<P>

Five American and Malaysian collaborating agencies are involved in this research program and the local government hopes their findings will bring several more international prospectors to Lanjak Entimau.
<P>
         
But Barney Chan, manager of the Sarawak Timber Association, said international companies are not leaping at the chance to explore new opportunities.
<P>
         
``We want to present the findings to interested groups, but no one is really coming forward. I don't think people understand the expense of locking up our forests. It's immense,'' Chan said.
<P>
         
Malaysia, the world's largest exporter of tropical hardwoods, has come under fire in recent years by Western environmentalists who accuse it of indiscriminately felling trees in the Borneo rainforests.
<P>
         
To combat the criticism, Malaysia has invested in areas such as Lanjak Entimau by declaring it ``protected.''
<P>
         
Meanwhile, Chai and his colleagues dig through the jungle in search of the wonder cures. Their latest test has been on the antibiotic properties of frog skin. The results, Chai happily reports, look positive.
<P>
         
``My results have already convinced me that this area has the potential to be a biodiversity conservation area. We hope to interest others,'' he said.

(from Mori no Koe Issue # 8)</P>

Japan's tropical timber imports in 1994 and 1995 were characterized by a continued increase in the proportion of plywood imports in relation to log imports.  Plywood imports from Malaysia in particular increased dramatically, while tropical log imports from most regions decreased.  Japan's imports of tropical hardwood logs from all regions except Africa totalled 6.8 million m3 in 1994 (8.6% decrease from 1993) and 5.9 million m3 in 1995 (12.9% decrease from 1994).  Total tropical hardwood log imports including African timber were 6.5 million m3 in 1995 (African timber import statistics for previous years are not available.)  Imports of tropical plywood from Indonesia and Malaysia decreased slightly to 3,736,000 m3 in 1994, but reached an all-time high of 3,988,000 m3 in 1995.  Tropical sawnwood imports decreased 4.5% to 1,297,000 m3 in 1994, and are thought to have remained about the same in 1995 (Total for Jan. - Nov. U95:  Malaysia 597,493 m3, Indonesia 479,730, all regions 1,252,075 m3).  It is difficult to gauge how the shift to plywood imports has affected Japan's overall consumption of tropical timber (in terms of raw material), due to the lack of data on the efficiency of wood use in the wood processing industries of Indonesia and Malaysia, but it is not thought to have decreased much.  The simple total of all tropical timber imports decreased 5.8% to 11.8 million m3 in 1994, and a further 1.1% to 11.7 million m3 in 1995, but total imports in roundwood equivalents (calculated using conversion coefficients used by the FAO) increased slightly in 1995.

Tropical hardwood log imports from Sarawak, Malaysia decreased 9.3% to 4.5 million m3 in 1994 and 12.6% to 3.9 million m3 in 1995.  Japan's imports accounted for about 52% of log exports from Sarawak in 1994.  Log imports from Papua New Guinea increased 10.1% to 1.9 million m3 in 1994, but then decreased 17.9% to 1.6 million m3 in 1995, whereas those from the Solomon Islands decreased 2.3% to 338,000 m3 in 1994 but increased 12.8% to 381,000 m3 in 1995.  Africa has also become a major supplier of logs to Japan, but it is unclear when this trend emerged.

Tropical plywood imports from Malaysia increased 34.6% to 508,000 m3 in 1994 and 90.6% to 970,000 m3 in 1995, while those from Indonesia decreased 6.2% to 3.2 million m3 in 1994, and a further 6.5% to 3.0 million m3 in 1995;  plywood imports from these two countries totalled 90.7% of all (including non-tropical) plywood imports in 1995.  The decrease in plywood imports from Indonesia is thought to reflect increasing inavailability of raw logs, which has forced more and more manufacturers to halt production.  Japanese importers have been eager to import Malaysian plywood in order to diversify sources, even though it is not yet certified according to JAS (Japan Agricultural Standards) and is thus at a disadvantage in terms of price and quality compared to JAS-certified Indonesian plywood.  Japanese domestic production of plywood (which accounted for 87.6% of use of imported tropical hardwood logs) in 1995 was 4,458,000 m3, accounting for 50.4% (a 4.2 point decrease in share from 1994) of total  (domestic and imported) plywood supply.  Plywood imports, which were less than 10% prior to 1985, are expected to exceed domestic production for the first time ever in 1996.  (Nikkan Mokuzai Shimbun, 1 March 1996)

Though the simple total of tropical timber imports decreased somewhat in 1994 and 1995, this cannot be equated with reduced environmental and social impact, as logging of steep slopes and water-catchment areas as well as premature second logging of coups is feared to be intensifying in the already seriously depleted forests of Sarawak, Malaysia, while logging in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands is causing serious violations of residents' rights.  These trends reflect a vast increase in local wood processing in Sarawak, Malaysia, a ban on log exports from Sabah, Malaysia since 1993, and capture of a large share of the Japanese market by the Indonesian and Malaysian plywood industries.

<H2>Logs Contribute 42% of Sarawak's Exports Last Year
</H2>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Sarawak Tribune, 3rd March '95)</P> 

<P>SIB - The timber sector, in the first eleven months of last year,
contributed 42 percent (RM5,122.9 million) of the state's total exports which
amounted to RM 12, 039.5million.</P>

<P>
 According to statistics from the Sarawak Timber Association (STA), the export
value of logs and timber products from Sarawak last year comprised logs (RM2,
367.2 million), sawn timber (RM1, 025.9 million), plywood (RM1,277.3 million),
veneer (RM406.3 million), moulding (RM19.5 million) and dowels (RM26.6 million).</P>

<P>
 For 1993, the total export value was RM5, 137.8 million.</P>

<P>
 The total log production for 1994 was estimated to be 16.3 million cubic metres
which was lower by 200, 000 cubic metres than the given production quota of 16.5
million cubic metres.</P>

<P>
 The reason for the difference was due to the bad weather conditions over the
year which hampered logging operations.</P>

<P>
 Of the amount, about 7.7 million cubic metres were allocated for local
processing.</P>

<P>
 From the total estimated log production last year (16.3 million cubic metres)
hill logging made up 12.9 million cubic metres while swamp logging totalled 3.4
million cubic metres. The total log production last year was a decrease from
1990 to 1993.</P>

<P>
 In 1993, the total logs produced were 16.7 million cubic metres, in 1992 18.8
million cubic metres, in 1991 19.4 million cubic metres and in 1990 18.8 million
cubic metres.</P>

<H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Malaysian Elections:   Democratic? - No - Demagogic!! </P></H2>

<P>
 As the Malaysian election looms, the country's indigenous people continue to
suffer harassment and abuse for their opposition to the style of 'development'
which strips them of their forests, their rights and their freedom.</P>

<P>
 In the Malaysian state of  Sarawak, logging of the tropical forest is still
taking place at the fastest rates in the world.  Volumes of extraction far
outstrip even the most conservative estimates for a 'sustainable' harvest. In
1990 the International Tropical Timber Organisation  (ITTO) recommended a
reduction of annual log production to 9 million cubic metres per year. For the
past 5 years the actual figure has been between 16 million and 19 million cubic
metres per year.</P>

<P>
 Members of the Penan tribe of the Malaysian state of Sarawak continue to
receive threats, harassment, imprisonment and physical abuse for their
opposition to logging on their traditional land. Reports from the region over
the past year have included several incidents where Penan tribespeople were
killed under suspicious circumstances by unknown assailants in the jungle.</P>

<P>
 Girls and women have been sexually harassed and there have been many cases of
rape by logging workers and police field force personnel.  Last week there were
reports that the Police Field Force pointed  their M16s at several Penan
tribespeople  in the upper Baram region. They  told them that if they opposed
logging they would be shot.</P>

<P>
 In the upper Rejang region of  Sarawak, Prime Minister Mahathir wants the
implementation of  plans to build the Bakun Dam to be carried out  as soon as
possible.  (Sarawak Tribune April 5th, 1995).  The company contracted to
undertake the project, Ekran, is headed by a timber tycoon .The first stage of
implementation of the project will be the clear-felling of  200 000 hectares of
tropical forest for timber used in the construction of the dam - in addition to
the forested area in the dam site to be cleared. Ekran is slated to earn more
than $250 million from the felling of the trees.  The dam will displace 5000
indigenous people and inundate an area the size of  Singapore. Over 3500
signatures have been collected in the area opposing the project.</P>

<P>
 In a state where the Environment Minister owns his own timber company,  links
between loggers, politicians and the process of 'development'  shouldn't be
surprising.  However Prime Minister Mahathir's insistence that the world keep
out of Malaysia's internal affairs while blatant human rights abuses and the
devastation of the world's oldest and richest tropical forest continues, is too
much to ask.</P>

<P>
 If opposition to the politics of plunder is suppressed  within Malaysia - then
we have a moral obligation to publicly reveal the truthful situation in other
parts of the world.  </P>

<TITLE>STRP: Why should you ask for Turtle-Safe shrimp?</TITLE>

<H1>Why should you ask for Turtle-Safe shrimp?</H1>

Responsible Shoppers want to know<BLOCKQUOTE> Can we have our shrimp and save rare, wild sea turtles too?</BLOCKQUOTE>

Sea turtles have lived quietly on Earth for 100 million years. Yet six out of
the seven species of sea turtles are now in danger of extinction. Shrimp
fishing is one of the major reasons. By asking for Turtle-Safe shrimp, you help
create an incentive for shrimp fisherman to protect endangered sea
turtles.<P>

<H2>How do sea turtles get caught in the nets?</H2><P>

As shrimp nets are dragged through the water, they catch everything in their
path - needlessly trapping unwanted fish and sea turtles. Sea turtles ensnared
in shrimp nets are held under until they drown. Thousands of endangered sea
turtles are killed this way every year.<P>

<H2>How can shrimp nets be made Turtle-Safe?</H2><P>

It's easy. By using Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs), shrimp fishermen help
protect sea turtles without reducing their catch of shrimp. TEDs are grids that
are sewn into shrimp nets and guide sea turtles out an escape hatch. TEDs not
only let sea turtles escape, they also keep  out much of the otherwise wasted
fish, protecting shrimp caught in the nets and saving fishermen the time of
sorting through their catch.<P>

<H2>Aren't sea turtles protected by law?</H2><P>

Yes, and the law requires shrimp fisherman in the U.S. and 14 other countries
that export shrimp to the U.S. to use TEDs. But more than 2,000 sea turtles
washed up in 1994, suggesting that many shrimpers are failing to comply with
the law. Additionally, seafood suppliers continue to import shrimp from
countries where TEDs are not required.<P>

<H2>How does the Turtle-Safe program work?</H2><P>

Members of the nonprofit Earth Island Institute fund educational and marketing
efforts in cooperation with responsible shrimp fishers. Participating fisherman
sign agreements with Earth Island Institute stipulating that they properly
utilize TEDs and agree to monitoring. Their catch is registered as Turtle-Safe.
Earth Island observers monitor compliance from the boats to the marketplace, to
certify that shrimp is Turtle-Safe. The goal is simple: by giving shrimp
fisherman the every reason to comply with laws protecting sea turtles, together
we can help rescue these exotic, gentle creatures from the brink of
extinction.<P>

<H2>Won't you join us?</H2><P>

Help make sure these endangered creatures survive. Three things you can do
right now are listed on the back of this pamphlet. To join us today, call the
number below. And remember, always look for the Turtle-Safe shrimp mark when
buying shrimp.<P>

Only wild shrimp caught in TED-equipped net, or outside sea turtle habitats
are certified Turtle-Safe.<P>

Farm raise shrimp are not certified because their ponds can destroy habitat and
pollute water.<P>

<H2>3 things you can do to save endangered sea turtles</H2><P>

<OL>

<LI><B>Eat only turtle safe shrimp.</B><P>

Shrimp nets that don't allow sea turtles to escape are a major threat to these
endangered creatures. By asking for Turtle Safe shrimp, you help create an
incentive for shrimp fisherman to protect endangered sea turtles.<P>

<LI><B>Spread the word among your friends, and the businesses you patronize. </B><P>

Look for the Turtle-Safe shrimp mark where you dine and shop. If you don't see
it, let grocers and chefs know you'll accept nothing less. The more people
demand Turtle-Safe shrimp, the sooner we ca stop the slaughter of sea
turtles.<P>

<LI><B>Learn more about sea turtles and how you can protect them. </B><P>

</OL>

The campaign to rescue sea turtles is a campaign to protect our ocean
environment. These shy, quiet , mysterious creatures outlasted the dinosaurs.
But will they survive the 20th century? You can make a difference. Join us by
calling (800) 859-SAVE. For more information about sea turtles and how you can
help save them, write us at our address below.<P>

<H1>STRP Central American Nesting Beach Program</H1>
<TITLE>STRP: Central American Nesting Beach Program</TITLE>

The goals of the Sea Turtle Restoration Project's Central American Sea Turtle Nesting Beach Program are to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Address the root causes of the slaughter of sea turtles -uncontrolled commercial exploitation and lack of community control over natural resources- at both the national and local levels;<P>

<LI>Address the needs of local economies by promoting the establishment of locally engineered sustainable development alternatives to uncontrolled exploitation; <P>

<LI>Promote citizen participation in problem solving by developing educational campaigns that build links between activists in the affected countries and their U.S. counterparts; and<P>

<LI>Support emerging organizations in Central America in their call for international pressure to protect endangered sea turtles and our common marine resources.<P>

</UL>
At present we have focused our program primarily on the countries of Nicaragua and Mexico because of their prominent sea turtle nesting beaches. Our programs in these countries will be discussed separately below.<P>


<H2>Nicaragua</H2>

The olive ridley is known to have nested in <I>arribadas</I> exceeding 5,000 females at only a dozen beaches worldwide. Of these, two are located on the southern Pacific coast of Nicaragua, Chococente and Playa La Flor. Chococente is a National Wildlife Reserve, and Playa La Flor is located by the Nicaraguan village of Ostional, near the <A HREF="../gsc/costa.html">Costa Rican</A> border. <P>

IRENA, Nicaragua's natural resources agency reports <I>arribada</I> nesting aggregations of olive ridleys at both sites in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 individuals, but Stephen Cornelius (World Wildlife Fund, pers. comm.) believes the actual size of <I>arribadas</I> may be even higher. Even at the lower estimates, this would place these beaches among the nine largest extant nesting sites for this species. Leatherbacks, Pacific green turtles and hawksbills also nest at these sites.<P>

Local communities have harvested the eggs of turtles arriving in <I>arribadas</I> for thousands of years.  In the past, harvesting did not adversely affect the turtle populations since the number of harvested eggs was relatively small compared to the millions of eggs laid by the turtles. However, in recent years, increased ability to ship the eggs long distances, coupled with other pressures on turtle populations, have led to the continued decline of the populations. One solution has been sustainable egg harvesting programs including monitoring by biologists and establishment of permissible quotas for harvesting. The local communities are then allowed to harvest the permitted number of eggs from turtles arriving early in the year in exchange for patrolling and protecting the beach from poachers during late year arrivals.<P>

In 1981 the Nicaraguan government began operating sustainable egg-harvesting programs at these beaches. However, in the early 1990's a seriously deteriorating economic situation within the country caused major budget cuts which derailed the conservation programs. Sporadically, the beaches were either completely closed to locals by the Army or uncontrolled harvesting was allowed. In 1990 and 1991, the beaches were exploited by egg poachers with practically all of the eggs were being stolen because no funds were available to monitor or patrol the beaches. <P>

In the face of this ecological disaster, STRP initiated a decisive and aggressive program. STRP coordinated the construction of field stations and hired Nicaraguan biologists to conduct studies at these sites. We also funded park rangers at Playa la Flor and organized a sea turtle training program for Nicaraguan biologists, college students and resources managers. Continued research into the socio-economic aspects of human-sea turtle interactions, as well as the biological studies of sea turtles, are being used to develop policies to control the harvesting of eggs so as not to be detrimental to sea turtle populations, while meeting the needs of local communities. Work is continuing on long-term management plans for the areas. In addition, we have coordinated an exchange between Nicaraguan community leaders, biologists and resources managers involved in sustainable egg harvesting projects with their colleagues in Costa Rica who have also established egg harvesting programs.<P>

 The experiments underway at Chococente and Playa La Flor offer real hope for the sea turtles of the eastern Pacific. We will continue to raise resources and involve the international sea turtle community in support of these model programs. <P>

<H2>Mexico</H2>

In 1989 STRP began working with others to embarrass the Mexican government into closing a slaughterhouse where 35,000-75,000 turtles were being killed yearly. STRP traveled to Mexico and returned to the U.S. with a first-hand account of the carnage including graphic video footage. We launched a media and grassroots campaign in the U.S. which generated articles and editorials in major newspapers, magazines and television. Other national and international environmental organizations joined the campaign which generated more than 70,000 letters to the Mexican President. In 1990, Mexico responded to our pressure, declaring a permanent ban on the killing of sea turtles and agreeing to eventually join the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), doing so in 1991. <P>

In addition to demanding closure of the slaughterhouse we advocated that economic alternatives be found for the local communities which had grown to rely on income from the harvest of these endangered animals. STRP initiated discussions toward transforming the former sea turtle slaughterhouse into a sea turtle natural history museum and won acceptance for this idea from local communities and Mexican environmental organizations. In September 1991, after extensive discussions with members of the Mexican government, President Salinas announced that "the sea turtle museum shall be created on the shores of Oaxaca." <P>

We were encouraged by the 1990 ban; however, our monitoring of Mexico's enforcement revealed serious backsliding in the following years. Accordingly, in 1993 STRP launched a major campaign to compel the Mexican government to enforce its sea turtle protection laws. STRP ran a full page ad in <I>The New York Times</I> to coincide with September 20, 1993 visit of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to San Francisco, California, with the headline "DOES MEXICAN PRESIDENT CARLOS SALINAS HONOR HIS ENVIRONMENTAL PROMISES?" A protest was conducted outside of the International Industrial Conference, where president Salinas gave a speech on NAFTA, and President Salinas was compelled to revise his speech to address his pledge to protect sea turtles and use turtle excluder devices. He claimed that Mexico was enforcing its sea turtle protection laws and that Mexico was "vigorously enforcing" the use of turtle excluder devices on Mexican shrimp vessels. 
 
President Salinas requested a private meeting with STRP's Director, wherein he reiterated his personal commitment to the protection of sea turtles and agreed to an independent monitoring program for Mexican shrimp vessels. Unfortunately, however, the Mexican government never permitted the promised monitoring program.<P>

In addition to our efforts on the national level we have also been active at the local, community level. A unique program which integrates sea turtle protection with community development in a Nahuatl indigenous community in the towns of Colola- Maruata, Michoacan, Mexico, run by Mexican environmentalists has strived to find alternatives for communities which once commercially harvested sea turtles for their skin and meat In addition to involving the townspeople in the conservation program for sea turtles, local economic alternatives which are operating include: an iguana raising project, dying of textiles with natural dyes produced by a marine snail, a crafts/ceramic co-op and eco-tourism. STRP has been able to financially assist these endeavors through its expedition program.<P>

It has become clear that we will need to maintain our vigilance to protect turtles in Mexico, and we will continue to
<OL>
<LI>monitor enforcement by the Mexican government;
<LI>pressure the Mexican government to de-politicize sea turtle conservation to allow NGOs to participate in developing policies; and
<LI>encourage solutions that meet the needs of local communities.

<H1>Expedition program</H1>
<TITLE>STRP: Expedition program</TITLE>

Our expedition program brings North Americans to critical sea turtle habitats to participate and provide needed human power in conservation activities. Learning about sea turtle conservation first-hand has proven to be an excellent tool for bringing the plight of the sea turtle to North Americans; our participants come home with an intense desire to help the sea turtles and the communities that surround their nesting beaches. Over the past three years STRP has coordinated several successful expeditions to important sea turtle nesting beaches in Mexico, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. <P>

One of the most important aspects of these expeditions is that they demonstrate to the local communities the international importance and uniqueness of their environment and the economic value of <B>living</B> sea turtles to their communities. In addition, these eco-expeditions can provide long-term support for sea turtle conservation and sustainable development projects. <P>

These expeditions also support the local community and conservation efforts in a more direct manner: a per person fee is paid to the host site which supports the conservation/research program. Local people are hired to assist the expedition group. Other expedition activities, such as sight-seeing excursions, also produce income for people from the local community. Overall, we estimate that over 70% of the money received for these expeditions is spent in the host country. The remainder is used to cover expenses of STRP staff time and to promote the expeditions.<P>

Direct support generated from our expeditions program resulted in funding a $4,000 grant proposal from Ostional, Costa Rica to complete a health clinic and community center and $1,800 to support sea turtle conservation at Mexico's most important nesting beaches for the black sea turtle in Colola, Michoacan<P>

<H1>STRP India Campaign</H1>
<TITLE>STRP: India Campaign</TITLE>

The Sea Turtle Restoration Project is launching a new campaign to preserve and protect the Bhitarkanika Reserve in India. This campaign will expand our work geographically (into India) and allow us to diversify ecologically to work towards the protection of a large number of endangered marine and terrestrial habitats and species. Our campaign is aimed at educating and empowering concerned citizens in the West to support a grassroots campaign in India to halt a development scheme that threatens the entire biodiversity of the southeastern India and local people's sustainable use of natural resources in this spectacular and sacred place. Indian environmentalists have specifically asked us to mount such an educational campaign in the West, to support their demands to protect the natural heritage of southeastern India. Furthermore, this campaign will help to build and solidify permanent links with these activists in our common fight to protect global biodiversity. <P>

STRP was approached because the threatened site includes the most important nesting beach in the world for the endangered olive ridley turtle and because of our past success in helping local activists draw international attention to their issues. As with all our campaigns, we see the sea turtle issue not only as a single-species environmental tragedy that needs immediate attention, but as a vehicle for shifting the paradigm of how the human species views its relationship with the natural world. We will continue to provide an analysis that stresses the unequal distribution of wealth and lack of community control of natural resources as the underlying roots of environmental destruction. <P>

The context for our work at Bhitarkanika can be summarized by a quote from Banka Behary Das:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"If nature has any paradise it is here in Bhitarkanika. It is a gift of nature to humanity and should be conserved at any cost." <P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Banka Behary Das is is a "freedom fighter" who worked with Gandhi for the independence of India from Britain. He served 3 1/2 years in prison for his non-violent work, and after independence was elected to Parliament. He has now turned his attention to protecting the natural heritage of India and has founded a progressive NGO, Krushak Mahasangh, which has been instrumental in fighting for the protection of mangrove forests and local culture, and against prawn farming.  Mr. Das and his organization have requested our help to protect the Bhitarkanika Reserve.<P>

Bhitarkanika in Orissa, India is the site where more sea turtles nest than any other place in the world. As recently as March 1992, 610,000 pregnant females emerged from the sea to lay eggs during a six day period in the reserve. The mass simultaneous arrival called the <I>arribada</I> has been described as one of the most spectacular events of nature and occurs in great numbers at only four places on the entire planet. <P>

The Reserve is home to a large number of endangered species. White-breasted sea eagles hunt for food along the mangrove-lined shoreline which is filled with openbill and painted storks, and dozens of species of herons and egrets searching for fish and shrimp to feed their young. Six species of kingfishers and the largest population of bareheaded geese in Asia also call this place home. All told, 80,000 wading birds nest in the reserve. Two other endangered sea turtles also live and nest here, including the largest turtle in the world, the giant leatherback, and perhaps the most beautiful, the hawksbill. Endangered pythons and king cobras also live here, as do the endangered salt-water crocodile and an endangered soft-shelled turtle.<P>

The late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi recognized the importance of sea turtles to the people of India and the international importance of this nesting site for a species that migrates thousands of miles through the sovereign waters of many nations and into international seas. While sea turtles and their eggs were not eaten by the local people of Orissa, in the 1970s, outsiders came to exploit the eggs and meat for the markets of Calcutta and beyond. Gandhi had the beaches and forests of the area declared a reserve to protect the biodiversity of the region. <P>

<H2>The Threats</H2>

Now, twenty years later after Gandhi declared the area a reserve, this place is threatened by the construction of a commercial fishing port for 500 mechanized shrimp trawlers, a fish processing plant and a large shrimp farm operation only a few kilometers from the reserve. In addition, a road is planned to be built through the mangrove forest to service the construction of the port. <P>

Why has this location been chosen for the development of a port? One active environmentalist in India, a member of the IUCN Species Survival Commission summed it up in these few words "politics, vote-catching and money." Once again, lack of control of natural resources by the local community is resulting in the sacrifice of a natural treasure for the profit of a few at the expense of many.<P>

Shrimp vessels are notorious for drowning endangered sea turtles. Worldwide, more than 150,000 turtles drown in shrimp nets each year, although technology exists to prevent the capture of turtles.<P>

In the past ten years, there has already been a significant increase in shrimp trawlers in this region of Orissa, India, and with it an increase in turtles drowning in shrimp nets. Three thousand turtles or more wash up on shore each year at Bhitarkanika, and this represents only a small fraction of the turtles that actually die unnecessary and horrible deaths as they struggle to free themselves from the net to surface for air. Even when the turtles are still alive in the nets, fishermen often club the pregnant females to death to get them out of their nets, rather than cut and damage their nets and allow the turtles to escape alive.<P>

Regulations for the reserve require shrimp trawlers to stay five kilometers away from the nesting beach, but the law is almost never enforced. With a large increase in fishing vessels, the situation will only get much worse.<P>

Modern shrimp farming has proven to be a terribly destructive practice throughout the world. Large tracts of mangrove forests, the nursery grounds for most fish and shell-fish (including many pelagic species) are destroyed for the shrimp-growing ponds. Mangrove forests also provide nesting and feeding sites for wading birds, birds of prey, crocodiles and hundreds of additional species fish, reptiles, mammals and birds. Shrimp farming has not proven to be sustainable. After a few very profitable years (for the owners), the ponds become toxic and unusable due to the high input of fertilizers, antibiotics (including the widespread use of human antibiotics in Asia and South America), and waste produced from the extremely high density of shrimp. When a farm is no longer economically productive, the cheapest and most common practice is to abandon it and clearcut another tract of mangroves and move the operation. This type of shrimp farming has destroyed 80-90 percent of the mangrove forests of Ecuador and large areas of Asia and South America, as well as the livelihood of local communities who have long relied on the high productivity of mangrove forests for food, fuel and building materials. Regeneration of mangrove forests, and the biodiversity it supports, from land that was formerly in shrimp production is low, at best.<P>

Road-building through the mangroves to the fishery complex is expected to have the same effects on the region as road-building has had on forests in the U.S. and the Amazon. Increased access brings increases in poaching of wildlife and destruction of cultural and natural resources.<P>

Are there alternatives? Environmentalists in India stress that other ports in the region could easily be enlarged and modified to handle additional vessels and processing plants. Time is needed to develop plans that allow for sustainable use of natural resources which allow community control and benefit. Local communities must have access to information from other locales which have already felt the destructive impacts of increased trawling and shrimp farming on their local resources.<P>

<H2>The Plan of Action</H2>

Activists in India have called for an international campaign to pressure the government of India to reconsider any expansion of fishing, development and shrimp farming in the area that will adversely affect the reserve and the biodiversity of the region. To date, no U.S. organization other than Earth Island Institute has taken an active role in organizing such a campaign. <P>

The Sea Turtle Restoration Project of Earth Island Institute is in an excellent position to play a lead role in organizing a grassroots and high-profile media campaign to build a coalition with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) throughout the world. Earth Island's Sea Turtle Restoration Project and <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">International Marine Mammal Project</A> have had considerable success in mounting such campaigns. Our successful campaigns have lead to major worldwide changes in fishing practices that destroy marine diversity as demonstrated by:
<UL>
<LI>success of protecting <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">dolphins</A> from tuna fishing in the eastern Pacific
<LI>the closing of the notorious sea turtle slaughterhouse in Mexico
<LI>the international banning of driftnets, and 
<LI>the on-going campaign to implement the use of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in the U.S. and worldwide. <P>
</UL>

In addition, Earth Island has personnel working on fishing issues in Asia, including <A HREF="../gsc/thai.html">Thailand</A> and the Philippines. Earth Island Institute has just formed a <A HREF="../map/map.html">Mangrove Action Project</A> (MAP) with NGOs from Asia and South America. We will work closely with this new project and be able to use their already strong connections in India and throughout Asia. Support has already been distributed to support regional conferences in Asia and South America on the impact of shrimp farming by MAN, and Earth Island personnel have developed extensive contacts with organizations concerned with this issue.<P>

<H1>STRP Latin American Monitoring</H1>
<TITLE>STRP: Latin American Monitoring</TITLE>

The goals of this program are to:
<OL>
<LI>watchdog compliance with US and Mexican laws and international treaties designed to protect sea turtles and their habitats, and<LI>build and augment the grassroots environmental movement in Latin America for the protection of these global resources.
</OL>
This program targets Latin American countries for the following reasons:<P>
<OL>
<LI>US consumers are the primary users of the fish products derived from these fisheries, and therefore, we must assume some responsibility for ensuring the industry is conducted in an ecologically responsible way.<P>

<LI>The geographic area of concern borders the US as well as several Latin American countries. It is an extremely biologically diverse ecosystem and one in which highly industrial development is expanding and poorly controlled.<P>

<LI>STRP has already begun the process of building strong relationships with environmentalists in Central America.
</OL>		
<H2>Enforcement</H2>

The Latin American Monitoring Program seeks to collect evidence about whether marine protection laws and international treaties are being enforced. Specifically, monitors will determine the extent to which turtle excluder devices are used and whether the Mexican ban on the slaughter of turtles for leather and shells is being enforced.<P>

This program is necessary because industries cannot be expected to self-monitor and few governments expend the resources necessary to provide sufficient monitoring programs. Furthermore, enforcement mechanisms cannot be triggered without hard evidence of violations.<P>

In the United States citizen groups often act as watchdogs to ensure that environmental laws are implemented and enforced. When problems exist, these groups lobby regulators or Congress or they file lawsuits - and they are often successful. In Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America environmental protection is still in its formative stages. An environmental movement exists, but it is hampered by economic realities, the enormity of problems, corrupt government, and fear of reprisals.<P>

Environmental protection cannot be achieved simply by legislating within national boundaries. Recognizing this, and in an attempt to give parity to US industries competing with foreign companies, Congress has passed laws requiring companies exporting to the US to maintain standards of environmental protection comparable to those applied to domestic companies. These laws are: The Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act and Public Law 101-162. For instance PL. 101-162 requires foreign countries exporting shrimp to the US to abide by the same sea turtle kill rates permitted to US fleets.<P>

The acquisition of more hard data about compliance with these laws will provide the facts needed to convince the US to use diplomatic and trade pressures for international environmental protection. Also, our monitoring program will identify violations of national laws of Latin American countries. For instance, Mexico has laws that prohibit the slaughter of sea turtles and that require the use of <A HREF="strpted.html">TEDs</A>. There is widespread concern, and some evidence which we have obtained, that these laws are not being properly enforced. For example, recently a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist reported to STRP that 11 nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles (only 400 nesting Kemp's turtles remain in the world) were killed when Mexican shrimpers, with no <A HREF="strpted.html">TEDs</A>, were illegally trawling in a protected marine reserve. In another incident, poachers in Baja California were discovered with 20 dead sea turtles. They have gone unpunished. This monitoring program would be very useful in identifying and publicizing problems such as these and assisting Mexican conservation groups in pressing for enforcement of existing laws.<P>

<H2>Building the Environmental Movement</H2>

While we believe citizens in Latin American countries are as concerned with environmental protection as US citizens, an environmental movement on par with those in North America or Europe does not yet exist.<P>

A monitoring program in Latin America would assist in building the grassroots environmental movement in this region. As in other areas where STRP has developed a monitoring presence, the monitoring staff hired by STRP would be indigenous citizens. In many instances it would provide the first compensated environmental activists in these countries. Establishing a monitoring program would also create a foothold for expanded environmental advocacy. STRP's umbrella would add credibility and protection from retaliation.<P>

We believe the STRP model of grassroots organizing combined with high profile media work is an extremely effective strategy for the protection of marine biodiversity. The monitoring program will be a model for local activists to learn and develop strategies for addressing other environmental issues. Training of monitoring staff will include time working in the San Francisco office and may also include STRP staff taking temporary assignments in, and frequent travel to Latin America.<P>

STRP has developed a strong, international reputation in marine biodiversity issues. STRP's ability to provide strong leadership and high profile media attention in legal actions, legislative efforts, and international diplomacy will provide an effective shield for nationals employed in the monitoring program. The degree to which this organization is regarded by its adversaries as a force to be reckoned with is exemplified by high level meetings with Presidents and Ministers in various Latin American nations and effective international legislation.<P>

<H2>Program Activities</H2>

The specific program activities include initial start-up activities involved in establishing monitoring offices, including staff time, travel, opening offices, and hiring and training staff. Once the program is operational, the day-to-day tasks of the monitors would include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>establishing a presence on the loading docks of shrimping vessels to monitor for the use of turtle excluder devices;<P>

<LI>recording both compliance with and violation of national and international regulations, using video and tape recorders to document violations;<P>

<LI>record-keeping and report preparation for filing with STRP's San Francisco office;<P>

<LI>monitoring aboard ship to ensure proper <A HREF="strpted.html">TED</A> use and to collect data on incidental and destructive by-catch;<P>

<LI>conducting seagoing spot inspections of shrimp vessels to ensure proper <A HREF="strpted.html">TEDs</A> use;<P>

<LI>-providing educational materials and workshops on turtle biology, the ease of using and availability of <A HREF="strpted.html">TEDs</A> and sustainable turtle egg harvesting programs; and,<P>

<LI>coordinating and assisting other NGO's (e.g. Grupo 100 in Mexico) on specific issues.<P>
</UL>

STRP believes that this monitoring program will provide an effective method for expanding enforcement of laws and regulations applying to sea turtles. If countries refuse to comply, then the documentation obtained by monitors will assist in building cases for US diplomatic pressure and trade sanctions. Further, the information gathered by the monitors will be used to certify compliance with <A HREF="strpted.html">TED</A> regulations. This information is of great assistance to processors desiring to buy turtle-safe products and for them to gain greater access to growing world turtle-safe markets. The goal is to create self-sustaining, indigenous programs over a period of three years. In some instances turtle-safe companies may be convinced to provide financial support for monitoring efforts.<P>

<H2>Time Schedule</H2>

STRP would like to initiate this program in late 1994 by establishing monitoring offices in Mexico and Costa Rica. By the end of the first year or beginning of the second, we plan to expand the program to include operations in Colombia and Ecuador.<P>

<H1>Statement of the Problem</H1>
<TITLE>STRP: Statement of the Problem</TITLE>

Sea turtles have been on earth for over 150 million years, and they predate the dinosaurs. Until this century, these giant reptiles were abundant members of the oceans ecosystems. Sea turtles form a unique assemblage of marine bio-diversity and occupy a novel position in the oceans' food web, feeding on an unusual range of prey including jellyfish, sponges, tunicates, algae, sea grasses, and crustaceans. The nesting phase of their life cycle also makes them an important component of beach and coastal ecology. The nesting females and the massive quantity of eggs laid are eaten by a myriad of predators ranging from small crabs to jaguars. Even the bacteria and micro-fauna of beaches are strongly influenced by the nesting turtles. Scientists have hardly begun to speculate on the detrimental impacts that the complete loss of the sea turtle species would have on the delicate balance of ocean and beach ecosystems.<P>

Sea turtles have been an important part of the diet of coastal peoples for thousands of years, and local human consumption has probably had a minimal impact on sea turtle populations. However, today's commercial exploitation for international markets and incidental drownings threaten the sea turtles, local people's subsistence use of turtles and the biological diversity of the oceans. Sea turtles migrate thousands of miles through the waters of many nations as well as international waters, a fact which emphasizes the need for international cooperation in their protection.<P>

Six of the seven species of sea turtles have been declared endangered or threatened by the U.S. Endangered Species Act and several international treaties. Nonetheless, sea turtle populations continue to decline under an onslaught of human-caused threats. At sea, they are subject to incidental capture in the nets of shrimping and other fishing vessels. On land, commercial development along once isolated coasts threatens their nesting beaches. Meanwhile, the uncontrolled pollution of the oceans continues, and everything from oil-tar balls to floating plastic are commonly found blocking the intestines of sea turtles that have washed up dead along our coasts. Fibropapilloma, a formerly rare disease that has become extremely common, is devastating some turtle populations. Direct commercial exploitation of adults and uncontrolled harvesting of eggs also threaten many populations. <P>

Incidental capture of sea turtles in shrimp nets has been identified as the most important human-caused threat to sea turtles in the U.S., suggesting a much larger global problem which has not yet been adequately quantified. More than 85 nations besides the US are engaged in shrimp fishing, and most of them do not require vessels in their waters to use <A HREF="strpted.html">TEDs</A>. We estimate that more than 155,000 turtles may drown each year due to this failure. Progress is being made to control this threat within U.S. waters and beginning efforts are now being made in the Atlantic/Caribbean region. Yet little or no effort is directed at the larger worldwide problem. <P>

Shrimp trawling is not only devastating to turtles but to other parts of the <A HREF="../immp/immp.html">marine environment</A> as well. It is estimated that 10 pounds of fish (excluding an unquantified number of invertebrates) are killed and discarded for every pound of shrimp caught. In the U.S. alone, 10 billion fish are destroyed each year by U.S. shrimp vessels. The worldwide impact of shrimp trawling is staggering and remains unquantified. Its impact on other commercial fisheries and the livelihood of subsistence fisher-folk is known to be devastating throughout the world. <P>

U.S. consumers play a major role in creating the demand for more and more shrimp trawling operations. Shrimp is an expensive luxury item that is imported out of the developing world to feed the affluent of the developed world. The U.S. is the largest consumer nation of shrimp, both caught and farmed. <P>

The ridley species has a nesting strategy unique among all turtles. Described as one of the most spectacular events in the reptile world, the "<I>arribada</I>", which is the nearly simultaneous arrival of thousands of pregnant females -sometimes more than 100,000 turtles at a single locale- makes this species extremely vulnerable to commercial exploitation.  There used to be a dozen <I>arribada</I> sites worldwide, but two-thirds of these sacred sites have been decimated, and now only four remain on the entire planet. Even these last four <I>arribada</I> sites are at risk. <P>

Watching a giant sea turtle lumber out of the sea and lay her eggs as her kind has done for eons, literally since before the time of the dinosaurs, it is easy to sense something magical and mysterious. Scientists do not understand why only the ridley turtles use this mass nesting strategy. One hypothesis is that by "putting all your eggs in one basket", no predator can take them all and some will survive to become the next generation. This strategy has worked for the sea turtles for 150 million years, yet the human predator of the past 100 years has driven this species and five other species of sea turtles to the brink of extinction.<P>

Imagine what it is like to watch tens of thousands of ancient creatures return to the same beach where their kind has for thousands of years and complete this ritual all at once! By the time the <I>arribada</I>, has subsided, literally tens of millions of sea turtle eggs will have been deposited on the sandy beach, providing sustenance and an important link in the web of life for an incredible diversity of wildlife of the region. Possibly even more remarkable are the few nights some 45 days later when literally millions of tiny, baby hatchlings crawl out of the sand and head for the ocean, finding their way by heading toward the reflection of stars and moonlight off the sea. Few of these cookie-sized babies will make it to adulthood decades later, as the majority are eaten by the hundreds of predators who feast on this bountiful food source. But this is the way of nature, and the turtles are a keystone species that supports the abundant web of terrestrial and marine wildlife located throughout the reserve.<P>

<H1>International Implementation of Turtle Excluder Devices</H1>
<TITLE>STRP: International Implementation of Turtle Excluder Devices</TITLE>

The leading cause of human-induced sea turtle mortality in the United States in recent years has been from the incidental capture and drowning in shrimp trawls, according to a 1990 National Academy of Sciences study. Estimates of U.S. annual mortality ranged from approximately 11,000 to 55,000 before the requirement to use Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). TEDs are "trap doors" that are attached to shrimp nets and reduce sea turtle mortality by more than 97 percent while insignificantly affecting shrimp catch. The devices cost $50-400 per net. <P>

Attempts to require the use of TEDs on U.S. shrimp fishing vessels have resulted in significant controversy over the past ten years. TEDs have now been required on shrimp fishing vessels in the United States. The dire predictions by the U.S. shrimp fishing industry that use of these devices would result in the collapse of the U.S. shrimp industry have proven unfounded. To the contrary, TEDs have proven to be effective in reducing turtle mortality, inexpensive and have not significantly reduced the harvest of shrimp.<P>

Sea turtle mortality for the combined fleets of the more than 85 nations which harvest shrimp are not known. Assuming an equal capture rate between the U.S. and international fleet (number of turtles per ton of shrimp), sea turtle mortality worldwide would exceed 155,000 per year. After approximately $10 million and ten years of research and development in the United States, it is necessary to begin transferring information and technology to the more than 85 nations who use shrimp trawls.<P>

The U.S. Department of State's actions to implement the use of TEDs internationally have been relatively ineffective and inefficient. A bi-lateral approach, instead of a multi-lateral approach to negotiations, and US AID funding continues at a snails pace. At the present rate of 3 countries per year, technology transfer could take 30 years to complete. The additional positive benefits of TEDs technology, such as protection of artisanal and important commercial fisheries, are not being promoted abroad. A new innovative approach is necessary, and STRP has developed and begun to implement a multi-faceted program to address the problem, comprising international cooperation, public education and litigation.<P>

<H2>International Cooperation</H2>
STRP and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) have jointly produced a video tape promoting the use of TEDs, and the U.S. Information Agency has contacted STRP requesting the opportunity to distribute the tape worldwide. Our alliance with UNEP will include co-sponsorship workshops on TEDs, as well as cooperation in producing a U.N. resolution encouraging the use of TEDs.  Government representatives from Pakistan have contacted STRP requesting instruction in the use of TEDs. Earth Island Institute has developed excellent ties with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) around the world and has employees working in Asia and Central America. This places us in an excellent position to work with NGOs to pressure their own governments to take responsible action. Since virtually all TEDs research has been done in the U.S., information is not readily available in many nations. STRP will develop and distribute needed information on TEDs to governments and NGOs. These materials will emphasize the negative impacts of shrimp bycatch on other fisheries, especially local and artisanal fisheries that are important to the local economies of many nations. Modifications of TEDs to reduce fish bycatch may prove to be a determining factor in convincing many developing nations to embrace TED technology.<P>

<H2>Public Education</H2>
Earth Island Institute has developed excellent working relationships with national media in print, television and radio. The Sea Turtle Restoration Project works extensively with Public Media Center (a non-profit media, marketing and communications agency) in helping to develop public participation in policy issues relating to marine conservation. STRP will use these contacts in organizing citizen awareness and participation in encouraging the use of TEDs.<P>

<H2>Litigation</H2>
Public Law 101-162 section 609, enacted by Congress in 1989, requires nations who wish to export shrimp to the United States to "adopt regulations governing the incidental taking of sea turtles comparable to those of the U.S., and that the average rate of incidental taking be comparable to the incidental rate of capture by U.S. vessels." The clear intent of this law is to encourage nations to adopt regulations requiring TEDs on all shrimp trawling vessels fishing in waters shared with five sea turtle species (Kemp's ridley, hawksbill, loggerhead, green, leatherback).<P>

To compel nations to take these actions, the law specifically prohibits the importation of shrimp into the U.S. from nations which have not adopted regulations that reduce incidental sea turtle capture to rates comparable to those of the U.S. Despite section 609's clear mandate to include "... <U>all</U> foreign governments which are engaged in ...commercial fishing operations which...may affect adversely [endangered] species of sea turtles...", the Department of State issued regulations which severely limit the scope of the law, and which greatly reduce its potential to act as a catalyst for international implementation of TEDs. Specifically, the State Department regulations limit coverage to only 14 nations in the wider Caribbean/western Atlantic region. These 14 nations represent less than 17 percent of the 85 countries that import shrimp into the United States and only 9.1 percent, by metric tons, of the total world wild-caught shrimp harvest. Furthermore, the Department of State regulations illegally extended by three additional years the May 1, 1991 deadline for compliance.<P>

After unsuccessful negotiations with the Department of State to employ universal and equal application of PL 101-162, STRP filed suit. Unfortunately, the Department of State has proven it will not vigorously enforce this law without legal oversight and citizen pressure. We will use the lawsuit to generate pressure to streamline TED technology transfer to developing nations, leverage additional expenditures of U.S. funds to help nations implement TEDs compliance and to alert the public of its role in influencing policy.<P>

    <P><FONT SIZE=+3>P</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>aper has played an important role
    in the development of modern civilizations. However, it's possible to use
    too much of a good thing, and often we find ourselves surrounded by more
    paper than we'd like, putting undue pressure on forests, costing too much
    money, and eventually needing to be disposed of as landfill or incinerator
    waste. How do we cope with this problem?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>This document discusses the issue by focusing on the type
    of paper we use in offices -- in copiers, computer printers, and fax machines.
    It lays out strategies for reducing the quantity and cost of paper we use.
    That is, it tells how to make workplaces more <B><I>paper efficient</I></B>.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Background: How Much Paper Americans Use</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Every year, the United States consumes over 90 million
    tons of paper. This paper use is an average of nearly 700 pounds per person,
    over ten times what it was at the turn of the century. The overall paper
    industry constituted $129 billion of our economy in 1993.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Our interest here is limited to that kind of paper used
    in photocopiers, computer printers, and fax machines. We'll call it 'copy
    paper,' to distinguish it from the many other kinds of paper also used
    in offices, such as catalogs, cardboard boxes, and tissues. The annual
    use of this single type of paper is about 3.5 million tons, or 27 pounds
    per person. Paper prices rise and fall, but at average prices we spend
    about $3.5 billion per year buying copy paper. Most copy paper is used
    in offices, and the average office worker uses about 10,000 sheets per
    year, though many use considerably less and some much more.</FONT></P>

      <P ALIGN=CENTER><HR><FONT COLOR="#330099" SIZE=+1>&quot;The average office
      worker uses about 10,000 sheets per year of copy paper, at a cost of about
      $50.&quot;</FONT><HR></P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>How much paper is 10,000 sheets? In one large stack, 10,000
    sheets of unused paper rises just over 4 feet (for a variety of reasons,
    as you use paper it takes up more space), and weighs about 100 pounds.
    Spread the paper out and you could cover the floor of a 10 foot square
    office 65 times, or a 3 by 6 foot desk more than 360 times. For every hour
    worked, about 5 sheets are used. At a typical volume price, this might
    only cost $50 to buy, but as we'll see later, buying the paper is just
    one of many relevant costs.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some time ago the idea of the 'paperless office' spread
    as a distant ideal; no doubt this had something to do with familiarity
    we all have with 'paperwork' and the perceived promise of electronic alternatives
    such as computers. Paper is far too useful and satisfying to want to get
    rid of it, or be successful if we tried. A paper efficiency approach acknowledges
    the usefulness of paper, but recognizes that we can still use considerably
    less of it than we now do.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Increasing paper efficiency will usually be quite separate
    from office paper recycling programs. Successful efficiency efforts will
    inevitably mean less material collected for recycling (and less put into
    landfills as well). Recycling goals and programs will need to be adapted,
    but recyclers understand that it is better to make less waste than to produce
    more and recycle it.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>What is Paper Efficiency?</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last year (1996) marked the 25th anniversary of the first
    copier manufactured with an automatic &quot;duplexing&quot; feature (duplexing
    is copying onto both sides of a sheet). Most people have made duplex copies
    at one time or another, but today, most copies are still single-sided.
    Duplexing some of these copies that are now single-sided is a way to get
    the same information on fewer sheets of paper -- and so is one example
    of improving paper efficiency.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another route to paper efficiency arises when copying
    a book. In many cases, one can copy two book pages onto one side of a 'standard'
    (8.5 x 11 inch) sheet, particularly if the 'percent reduction' feature
    of the copier is used to reduce the size of each page. Use of both strategies
    together (duplexing and putting two original pages on each copied page)
    can avoid up to three of every four sheets.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Paper efficiency is much like energy efficiency. A more
    efficient car needs less gas to go the same distance as a less efficient
    one. Adding insulation to the walls of a house will reduce the heating
    (or cooling) bill and also make the house more comfortable to be in. Just
    as energy efficiency is not about &quot;freezing in the dark&quot;, improving
    paper efficiency does not involve doing without the information on the
    paper.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The key to efficiency is that we usually don't want the
    paper itself, but the <I>service</I> it helps to provide (for example,
    we buy a newspaper for the news it contains, not for the newsprint). Because
    of this we rarely focus our attention on the paper itself, and organizations
    don't have a &quot;Paper Department&quot;. Instead, every part of an organization
    uses some paper in delivering its product, but only as a medium. By spending
    some time to examine and rethink our use of paper, we can do a favor for
    ourselves, our organizations, and the environment, by using it better.</FONT></P>

    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Why Should I Be Concerned About Paper Use?</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many environmental, economic, and other advantages can
    be achieved by reducing the amount of paper you and those around you use.
    The environmental costs of paper production alone are considerable. For
    example, papermaking has high forest and land-use impacts: Pulp mills in
    the United States consume more than 12,000 square miles of forest each
    year; almost half of all trees cut now end up as paper, and the percentage
    is increasing. In addition, pulping and bleaching processes emit up to
    1,000 chlorinated organic compounds (&quot;organochlorides&quot;) including
    dioxin, one of the most toxic and persistent substances on Earth. </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another environmental motivation for adopting paper efficiency
    measures centers on the increasing volume of waste dumped into municipal
    solid-waste landfill sites. According to the National Office Paper Recycling
    Project, more than 12 million tons of waste paper are generated each year
    in the U.S. by office workers. Almost all of this tonnage is destined for
    landfills. These landfills -- sources of methane and volatile organic contaminants
    -- currently comprise approximately 20 percent of all sites on the Environmental
    Protection Agency's Superfund pollution-cleanup list. Yet they're overflowing,
    and space for more garbage is fast running out. Since 1978, according to
    the EPA, more than 80 percent of all U.S. landfills have reached capacity
    and been forced to close. The agency estimates that by 2008, only 1,234
    landfills will be operational, in part because the economic and social
    barriers to opening new landfills are prohibitive. Even with effective
    recycling programs in place, a considerable amount of paper still ends
    up being dumped: paper comprises from 40 to 50 percent of the trash in
    typical landfills. </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>While these are compelling reasons for paper efficiency
    in and of themselves, often the dollar savings are most influential in
    getting people to change their paper habits. The effort may require both
    time and money. To justify the expenditure, people need to know they're
    making a wise investment.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The role of paper in global climate change (forestry,
    paper production, use, and disposal) is complex, but it appears that reducing
    paper use helps alleviate our climate problems. </FONT></P>
    <P><A NAME="anchor534517"></A></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Saving Energy, Money, and Time</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Paper takes a considerable amount of energy to produce.
    A sheet of paper made from wood consumes the <I>equivalent</I> of about
    17 Watt-hours (<I>Wh</I>) of electricity (about 12 <I>Wh</I> for 100% recycled
    paper). This means that the manufacturing <I>energy</I> for the 5 sheets
    an hour typically used by office workers is about the same as that needed
    to run an 80 W bulb. However, the <I>cost</I> of the paper is close to
    the electricity cost of four 80 W bulbs. Obviously reductions in paper
    use could have significant energy benefits. </FONT></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P ALIGN=CENTER><HR><FONT COLOR="#330099" SIZE=+1>&quot;Your Organization
      probably spends over ten times as much money <I>using office paper as it
      does to buy it.&quot;</I></FONT><HR></P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the economic front, the U.S. as a whole spends a considerable
    amount of money buying paper, and an even larger amount in the course of
    <I>using</I> this paper. This is particularly true for office paper, where
    costs such as printing, copying, storage, and mailing overwhelm the paper
    purchase cost. Saving money by reducing some of these expenditures is an
    important rationale for reducing paper use.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>A third type of benefit of better use of paper is the
    qualitative effect on our businesses and lives. Whenever you have to carry
    stacks of paper a distance (such as when traveling), you become aware that
    having less of it to lug around makes life easier. When we have fewer sheets
    of paper in our homes and offices, we will spend less time looking for
    those that are mis-placed or lost. Businesses are increasingly converting
    to electronic form, operations that had previously been paper-based. Many
    have found that the <I>quality</I> of information processing increases
    and the time it takes (both labor and total elapsed time) to process or
    summarize information drops precipitously.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>As individuals and as employees within organizations,
    we should always remember that reducing paper use brings a whole set of
    benefits. Some changes may have little effect on overall costs, and so
    environmental benefits can be the main motivation. In other cases, the
    dollar savings by themselves are compelling and so can take the lead.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>What Can You Do?</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Once you've decided to improve your paper efficiency,
    the question arises as to how specifically to accomplish this. What you
    can do depends on the kinds of uses of paper in your vicinity, the level
    of efficiency already present, and your authority and ability to make changes.
    While some improvements can be made in many offices, there are probably
    some unique to your organization. Some changes are clear and obvious, with
    others less certain, or complicated to bring about.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The initial step should be an inventory answering the
    question: &quot;How is paper used in my office?&quot; The inventory can
    be short and general, extremely detailed, or (most likely), somewhere in
    between. In the process of collecting this data, you are likely to discover
    possible improvements, or have others tell them to you. A paper use inventory
    is never &quot;finished&quot;, but only developed to greater detail and
    updated over time.</FONT></P>

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>As your inventory takes shape, you can begin to identify
    and implement changes to improve your paper efficiency. Ideally you will
    observe the results of the changes in less paper purchased and other costs
    reduced. However, effects often take time to show up and other changes
    (e.g. in business conditions, equipment, or operations), can obscure the
    effect of efficiency changes.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are many paper flows through an office, with the

    important stages, and it can be measured at any of these; try to measure
    all of them. As you inventory paper, try to gather the:</FONT></P>

    Number of images made (and calculated duplexing rates)</FONT></P>
    <P><INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="checkbox" VALUE="checkbox"><FONT SIZE=+1>
    Dollars involved (e.g. for purchasing, copying, or mailing)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following are some strategies for paper measurement in
    purchasing, printing &amp; copying, faxing, mail &amp; shipping, storage,
    disposal, off-site imaging, and high-volume uses.</FONT></P>
    <P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="#anchor845274">Up to Contents</A></P>
    <P><A NAME="anchor539098"></A></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Purchasing:</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Most organizations buy large quantities of a few kinds
    of paper and small quantities of many kinds. With luck, you can locate
    all the information for the few, large kinds, and perhaps just an overall
    dollar estimate for the rest. If your purchasing department can't help,
    sometimes the distributor you buy from can provide the information (after
    all, it is their business to know about paper purchases, while it isn't
    one of your organization's core interests). If you can't locate all the
    information, consider making informed estimates from knowledge you have
    or by asking people. Often someone will know rough quantities such as that
    they buy &quot;8 boxes every 2 months&quot;. When you see a label on a
    ream of paper, consider taking one for reference, as they usually list
    the brand, type, size, and weight.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Be aware that some paper purchases may be 'hidden'. For
    example, some copying jobs may be contracted out because they are particularly
    large, or have special requirements such as color imaging, large-size copies,
    special paper, or particular binding or folding needs. These are probably
    only worth tracking down when particularly large, or when done on a regular
    basis. If you have a print shop or copy center within your organization,
    they may have special ways of buying paper, and also may have better knowledge
    of the paper they buy than does the purchasing department that buys all
    kinds of products.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Copy paper varies in price, but a good estimate is $1,000
    per ton, which is $2.50 per ream, 50 cents a pound, and half a cent per
    sheet.</FONT></P>
    <P ALIGN=CENTER><HR><FONT COLOR="#330099" SIZE=+1>&quot;Copy paper costs
    about $1,000 per ton, or 50 cents per pound.&quot;</FONT><HR></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>To understand how paper is used in your photocopiers,
    computers, and fax machines, you'll first want to know what types of equipment
    you have that are in common use. If your organization is small enough,
    you can simply walk around and write down the brand and model number of
    each device; in a larger organization, there may be inventory or leasing
    records (many copiers are leased rather than bought). With luck, there
    will be a few models of printers and copiers that will make up most of
    the stock of machines. Try to locate the operating manuals for these models,
    as they may have information useful to you later on. Each machine has a
    rated 'capacity', which is the maximum number of images the manufacturer
    recommends that it make per month. Most office equipment is used at rates
    well below its capacity, often 15% of it. So, even if a copier is rated
    at 50,000 images per month, it probably makes closer to 10,000. There are
    probably a few pieces of equipment that are hardly used; make life simpler
    and don't bother with counting their paper use, unless they are particularly
    expensive to operate (such as some color printers or copiers).</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Along with capacity, it is important to know the rated
    imaging speed. Machines don't necessarily run at the rated speed, either
    ever, or under ordinary use, but speed is a good way to categorize machines.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another source of data is the image counter found on many
    devices. Laser printers often print a sample output sheet when turned on,
    and some of these often have the number of images they have made in one
    corner. By collecting several of these (from the same printer) some time
    apart, you can see how much it is printing. You may have turned this &quot;feature&quot;
    off in a previous efficiency effort, but a printer &quot;self-test&quot;
    will probably produce the same sheet. Copiers usually have a counter inside
    that records the number of images made, and as with the printers, you can
    see how much it is used, by simply subtracting an early count from a later
    one.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>You are most likely to have information about image counts,
    so to arrive at estimates of paper use, you need a duplexing rate for each
    machine. All imaging equipment is rated by the number of images made per
    minute of operation. Estimates of national average duplexing rates are
    shown below. For laser printers, they essentially never can duplex for
    machines less than 10 pages per minute (ppm); rarely for 10 to 20 ppm;
    sometimes for 20-30; and usually for machines that operate faster than
    30 ppm.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another aspect of imaging on paper is the toner (ink)
    and equipment maintenance. Copier toner and maintenance is often 1 to 3
    cents/image. Laser printer cartridges are often 1 to 2 cents/image, with
    ink jet printer costs similar. You can use the amount of toner or ink bought
    as an indication of the number of copies made. However, you might use it
    considerably slower or faster than average, so use such estimates cautiously.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Faxes are an interesting case in that the person who sends
    the fax doesn't use extra paper (except if there is a confirmation sheet),
    but the sender incurs most of the cost in the form of the phone charge.
    Many fax machines take about 40 seconds to send each page, though you can
    easily time your machine on several faxes to confirm this. You may find,
    or be able to generate, periodic reports of fax activity; these can provide
    records of pages per week for both incoming and outgoing faxes, and an
    indication of the balance among local, long-distance, and international
    faxes (which indicates cost). Your phone bill for the fax line may indicate
    total transmission time, which, divided by the time per sheet, indicate
    pages sent. While the sheets of paper used is due to the incoming (not
    outgoing) faxes, you can observe the ratio between these from activity
    reports. Imaging costs for fax machines are similar to those for printers
    (except sometimes for thermal fax machines)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The weight of first class mail sent in the U.S. is about
    half that of the copy paper we use. While most of this mail is not copy
    paper, the amount of copy paper that is mailed is still considerable. For
    a letter between 1 and 11 ounces, the extra ounces (23 cents per ounce)
    cost about $7,000 per ton, or seven times the cost of buying paper. The
    first ounce is about $10,000 per ton. Thus, avoiding mailings or reducing
    the weight can be a significant cost savings. The following table presents
    two examples of reduced paper and postage costs from duplexing. In the
    last column, the number of sheets is reduced enough so that the mailing
    can be folded in three and so use a smaller, lighter envelope.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Most of us store paper on our desks, on shelves, in filing
    cabinets, and perhaps in central long-term storage often away from our
    individual offices. With less paper around, you might be able to do with
    fewer filing cabinets, saving the cost of the cabinet and the floor space
    it occupies. Count, or estimate, the number of file cabinets you have and
    determine how much floor area they occupy (2.5 ft2 is a common footprint).
    Multiply by the value of that floor area and you might get a cost from
    $25 to $100 per year for the space. Assuming 2,000 sheets/foot of file
    space, a typical 4-drawer cabinet might have a capacity of 16,000 sheets.
    Assuming it is just 75% full, it would contain 12,000 sheets or 24 reams.
    At $2.50/ream, this is $60 of paper, and so the value of the floor area
    is often comparable to an annual paper purchase cost of the paper in it.
    While the file cabinet lasts many years, it costs several times the cost
    of this paper, so is notable, but less than the paper or floor area cost.
    All of these usually pale in comparison to the value of the time spent
    filing and retrieving papers from the file cabinet.</FONT></P>

    paper recycling programs record how much copy-type paper is collected,
    but you are unlikely to get this for the regular trash. However, you are
    unlikely to save much money on disposal compared to other dollar savings
    from paper efficiency. One exception can be if large amounts of paper are
    shredded to destroy the content on the paper. Shredding costs can vary,
    but $500 per ton is not uncommon.</FONT></P>

    The close agreement is probably decieving, as some paper inevitably gets
    damaged before being used, taken home by employees, or otherwise not used
    as anticipated, so the image counts may be slightly too high or the duplexing
    rate slightly too low. Nevertheless, these data present a good overall

    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Action Steps (Efficiency Strategies)</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Strategies for improving paper efficiency often apply
    across many types of use, such as duplexing on copiers and laser printers.
    Dollar savings (per ton) vary considerably, with some only saving paper
    purchase costs and others saving much more.</FONT></P>
    <P><A NAME="anchor576686"></A></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Duplexing:</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>One of the most effective ways to reduce paper use is
    using both sides of a piece of paper rather than just one, that is, duplexing.
    While we often do this already, we could be doing it considerably more.
    With duplexing, one saves money on buying paper and on storage and mailing.
    It is also easier to fold and staple, and to carry around. While some prints
    and copies need to be single-sided, most do not.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>High speed copiers and computer printers nearly always
    have extra hardware for duplexing, and low speed machines almost never
    do. If you are buying a medium speed machine (21 to 44 copies per minute-cpm),
    be sure that you get one with a duplexing unit. Copiers are available that
    can be set to default to duplex so that you don't need to remember to set
    the duplex mode on; this is a requirement of the EPA <I>Energy Star</I>
    program for large copiers.. Some copiers duplex better than others; ask
    sales people to explain to you why the machine they are offering duplexes
    better than competing models. Duplex copying is often slower than single-sided
    copying; if the speed reduction is too much, many people will avoid duplexing,
    so ask about copying speeds for a variety of modes. Low paper jam rates
    while duplexing is also an attribute to look for. If you buy many copiers,
    consider one of the services that tests machines and reports how well they
    work.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Because higher capacity equipment is usually better for
    duplexing, consider having fewer, larger printers and copiers. You can
    often save money on the initial cost of the equipment and on operating
    costs. If your office has a computer network, consider replacing several
    small printers with one large printer that defaults to double-sided output
    (this avoids the need to have the software work well with duplexing), and
    one smaller, older, printer for single-sided output.</FONT></P>
    <P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="#anchor845274">Up to Contents</A></P>
    <P><A NAME="anchor292887"></A></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Paper Reuse:</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another paper efficiency strategy is to reuse paper that
    has already been imaged on one side (by a printer, a copier, or outdated
    letterhead), but has a clean second side (this is &quot;half-used&quot;
    paper). Avoid paper that is folded, torn, or dirty, and be sure to take
    off any staples, paper clips, or Post-Its&reg;. Some people think that
    half-used paper will damage the output device, but many people have reported
    successfully using half-used paper. Fax machines are a good candidate for
    half-used paper as they almost never have duplexing units and fax output
    is almost always strictly for internal use (not mailed). If there are several
    laser-printers in an office, one can be designated as a 'draft' printer
    and always be stocked with half-used paper. If half-used paper is particularly
    curled (from a laserprinter), you can remove most of this by putting a
    heavy weight (e.g. several phone books) on a stack of it for a few days
    or weeks.</FONT></P>
    <P><A NAME="anchor294227"></A></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Image Reduction:</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The ability to reduce or enlarge images is common on copiers.
    When copying a book, one can often get two original pages on to one side
    of the copied sheet. Because reduction works in two dimensions, you only
    need reduce by 30% (to 70%) to cut in half the area of an image. While
    reproducing entire standard pages requires a 35% reduction (to 65%), books
    often have smaller than standard pages and most documents have larger than
    necessary margins, so the reduction can usually be less than this.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Image reduction is also possible with printing. Many word
    processing and presentation preparation applications can print two, four,
    or more &quot;pages&quot; on each output page. Often this is called &quot;2-up&quot;,
    &quot;4-up&quot;, etc. printing. With the high quality of current printing
    technology, considerable reduction is possible while maintaining readability.
    Also while printing it is possible to reduce margins between the text and
    the edge of the page, and reduce the point size used. This is particularly
    useful for widely reproduced documents, and when small changes can avoid
    an additional sheet of paper. Image reduction saves imaging costs as well
    as paper costs, so that every pound of paper avoided saves considerably
    more than does a pound avoided through duplexing (for example).</FONT></P>

        <P ALIGN=CENTER><HR><FONT COLOR="#330099" SIZE=+1>&quot;Image reduction
        saves on imaging costs, which are much more than paper purchase costs.&quot;</FONT><HR></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>For example, consider a printer costing 2.5 cents/image
    and paper at 0.5 cents/sheet. A 4-page document would cost 12 cents traditionally,
    which could be reduced to 11 cents by duplexing, 6 cents by &quot;2-up&quot;
    printing, or 5.5 cents with both.</FONT></P>
    <P><A NAME="anchor295479"></A></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Image Avoiding:</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The savings are largest for those images that can be avoided
    entirely. Simple examples of this are fax cover sheets, confirmation sheets,
    and printer cover pages. Often there are alternatives such as fax summaries
    that record many transactions on one sheet, or placing document identifiers
    (date/time, file name, or owner) on the document rather than on a separate
    cover sheet. For more than minimal use, avoid thermal fax machines as the
    resulting output is often copied onto regular paper and so increases paper
    use and imaging.</FONT></P>

    <P><A NAME="anchor291770"></A></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Paper Thickness:</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Most copy paper is &quot;20 pound&quot; paper, which in
    this case is the weight of 2,000 sheets. Inkjet printers and color copiers
    often use 24 lb paper, for better imaging, and letterhead paper is also
    often thicker than 20 lb. If you use a large amount of greater than 20
    lb paper, consider and possibly test thinner paper. There are some applications
    for which 16 lb paper is appropriate, particularly those unlikely to be
    duplexed (such as fax machine output). Some imaging equipment is not rated
    to use paper that thin (though it may still work satisfactorily), and even
    if it does, thin paper may not hold up in use, particularly if it will
    be subsequently put through a copier document feeder. A promising alternative
    is 18 lb paper, though this is as yet not widely available.</FONT></P>
    <P><A NAME="anchor286533"></A></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Imaging Savings:</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some strategies don't save paper at all, but are still
    worthwhile. Many inkjet and laser printers have 'economy' or 'draft' modes
    that use less toner than is standard. This can save on ink/toner costs,
    which can be as large or larger than paper costs. In addition, some printers
    operate faster in such draft modes.</FONT></P>
    <P><A NAME="anchor287522"></A></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>What might the future hold?</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>There has been a consistent trend of more imaging shifting
    from copying to printing. Fax machines are a good example of this, in that
    when an image might previously have been copied and mailed, now it is scanned,
    transmitted, and printed by a fax machine. More and more of what we &quot;copy&quot;
    will be documents that are on-line and so printed instead. As copiers shift
    to digital processing, the distinction between printing and copying will
    diminish. There are available &quot;multifunction&quot; devices that can
    fax (in and out), scan, print, and copy, though these are mostly low-speed
    devices. As imaging devices become cheaper and more widely spread, there
    may be more imaging done on devices that can't reasonably duplex automatically
    (though manual duplexing may remain an option).</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Improvements in electronic data management will likely
    mean eventual reductions in the amount of copy paper we use, but how much
    and when is unclear.</FONT></P>
    <P><A NAME="anchor289178"></A></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Conclusion</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The paradoxes of paper are that while it is not too expensive
    to buy, it is considerably more costly to use, and that while each sheet
    is quite cheap, we use enough of them to make the total a considerable
    cost. The improvements you can make in your own paper use are likely to
    be straightforward and mostly use technology already present in your office.
    Don't worry if most of your solutions seem mundane or unsophisticated.
    While you may find it useful to assess the environmental benefits of using
    paper better, always make sure to count the dollar benefits (all of them),
    as someone else will want to know.</FONT></P>

  such as kenaf.</FONT></I></B></P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER><HR></P>
  
  
  
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+3>D</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">URING THE 1940s AND EARLY '50s, paper
  usage in the United States nearly doubled, reaching 40 million tons a year by 1956 (Americans now use 90 million
  tons annually). During that time, regional wood-pulp shortages became common
  across the country. Forests were being logged wholesale to feed paper
  mills' voracious appetites for pulp, and the pressure on them steadily increased.<BR>
  <BR>
  In response, researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture undertook
  an exhaustive search for an alternative, non-wood fiber crop capable of satisfying the
  paper industry's needs. In 1960, after having investigated nearly 200 promising plant species, the agency announced its finding: 
  The best fiber source for papermaking was <I>Hibiscus cannabinus</I>, a cousin to cotton and okra, commonly
  known by its Persian name, &quot;kenaf&quot;. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">
  
  Now welcomed as an income producer by a growing
  number of farmers, primarily in the Southeast where the crop flourishes,
  at that time kenaf was still relatively new to this continent, and its
  acceptance by the locals was slow in coming. Kenaf's historical roots extend
  deep into Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia (places where its
  common name varies widely). For thousands of years, its fiber has provided
  people in those regions with fiber for clothing, rope, sacking, and rugs,
  while its tender seedlings have been served as a nutritious vegetable.
  Luckily for those needing to conserve forests, kenaf fiber also makes great
  paper, which may be the plant's principal value as a successful, non-invasive
  transplant to the United States.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Through repeated trials and commercial ventures
  in the U.S., kenaf has proven to be as good as or better than trees for
  papermaking. When processed whole, kenaf stalks make excellent pulp for
  newsprint. When stripped from the stalk's core, kenaf's long, woody bark
  fibers-called &quot;bast&quot;-compare favorably with virgin fiber from
  pine trees (the most common pulp source in the U.S.) and other softwoods.
  The bast provides an ideal furnish for making strong, high-quality printing
  and writing papers. The plant's shorter core material, by contrast, performs
  much like hardwood fiber. It produces lower grades of paper with less tear
  strength, though it can still effectively comprise more than a third of
  top-grade kenaf paper.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
  </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+3>T</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">oday
  more and more farmers and paper manufacturers are looking to kenaf as a
  way of diversifying their fiber base. For farmers wanting to get into alternative
  markets promising a good return, the plant is a boon. It grows rapidly,
  reaching 12-18 feet in just five months. Southern pines in tree plantations,
  by contrast, take 20-25 years to reach harvest stage, making them a risky
  investment for small farmers who can ill afford to tie up land for such
  a long period. Moreover kenaf plants, unlike trees, fit well into rotational
  crop systems. Tree plantations are monocultures. They replace forests that
  have been clearcut, while playing none of a true forest's ecological roles
  in preserving habitat and protecting wildlife.<BR>
  <BR>
  Kenaf's value per acre of land, moreover, is greater than pine's since
  its fiber yield (6-10 tons of dry fiber per acre annually) ranges from
  two to five times higher than pine's. Most significantly, its pulp yield
  ranges-conservatively-from 22-60 percent higher than pine's, depending
  on the pulping process used. Kenaf bast alone yields about as much pulp
  per acre as pine- which still leaves a heap of core fiber to be marketed
  for such products (in addition to paper pulp) as particle board, potting
  soil, poultry litter, horse bedding, and oil and chemical adsorbents for
  bioremediation.<BR>
  <BR>
  Kenaf reaps a wide range of other rewards for farmers, their families,
  and their communities. It's a hardy crop, resistant to most pests and diseases,
  and able to stand up under widely varying degrees of weather. It crowds
  out weeds, which limits the need for herbicide applications. Its leaves
  are plowed back into the earth to recycle nitrogen and other nutrients,
  reducing the need for heavy chemical fertilization. It's ideal for rotation
  with legumes, corn, sorghum, and other food crops, a practice that maintains
  soil quality, maximizes harvest yields, and prevents the spread of root-knot
  nematodes, one of the principal threats to kenaf's health.<BR>
  <BR>
  Especially in uncertain economic times, when cash-strapped farmers often
  must let parcels of land lie fallow because of food surpluses dumped on
  the world market, kenaf's inclusion in a crop-rotation scheme can diversify
  income sources, increasing financial security.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
  </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+3>B</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">y no
  means are farms the only sector of society able to profit from kenaf's
  qualities. Small-scale (&quot;mini&quot;) pulp-and-paper mills can be situated
  near kenaf farms to readily take advantage of the fiber. Outfitted with
  state-of-the-art technology, such mills can be relatively cheap to construct
  and easy to finance. They can improve regional economies by distributing
  jobs to more small-to-medium-sized mills rather than centralizing them
  at huge mills, while cutting the environmental and economic costs of transporting
  fiber.<BR>
  <BR>
  To ecologically minded, cost-conscious papermakers, kenaf looks particularly
  attractive. It can create an exceptional product while substantially reducing
  pollution, conserving energy, and cutting production expenses. The fiber
  can be pulped with existing technology. It is low in lignin content compared
  to wood. Only eight percent of kenaf bark (and 13 percent of the whole
  stalk) is made up of the cellulose-bonding substance, compared with 30
  percent for pine, which makes it considerably less energy intensive. When
  mechanically rather than chemically processed, kenaf takes about 37 percent
  less energy to pulp than wood-a fact that, again, translates to considerable
  cost and environmental savings.<BR>
  <BR>
  But the advantages don't stop there. Kenaf can be more easily bleached
  than wood using non-chlorine agents such as ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and
  oxygen. These benign processes eliminate chlorinated compounds and other
  pollutants from the paper-mill waste-stream. In turn, they keep dioxin-one
  of the most toxic and persistent substances on Earth-from further contaminating
  the biosphere (dioxin from industrial sources has already spread to all
  of Earth's regions, including the polar regions).</FONT></P>

  so many factors working in its favor, it seems that, by now, the kenaf-paper
  industry ought to be well developed. Surprisingly, it remains in its infancy.
  As of late 1996, the only company manufacturing kenaf paper commercially
  in the U.S. is Vision Paper, a division of New Mexico's K.P. Products.
  Though the mill it employs can turn out up to 100 tons of kenaf paper a
  month, the demand for the commodity has remained modest. Only when paper
  purchasers begin demanding tree-free products in sizeable quantities, and
  kenaf becomes a significant source of fiber for several mills, will the
  industry at last be able to take off.<BR>
  <BR>
  What stands in the way is resistance to change, especially on the part
  of the entrenched pulp-and-paper industry that fattens its profits at the
  expense of forests. Its owners have long turned a blind eye to the consequences
  of their wood addiction, while banking on their customers continuing to
  do so as well.<BR>
  <BR>
  What the mainstream paper industry prefers not to acknowledge is that the
  relatively low prices it charges for virgin-wood paper fails to reflect
  the product's hefty environmental toll-the destruction of intact-forest
  ecosystems, fragmentation of wildlife habitats, depletion of the stratospheric
  ozone layer, and contamination of air and waterways, among other impacts.
  If these costs were tallied up and added to customers' bills, the outmoded
  paper market would change dramatically. Kenaf paper-which leaves forests
  intact while minimizing energy consumption and pollution-would quickly
  be seen to make both economic and ecological sense.<BR>
  <BR>
  As with all enterprises, however, the emerging kenaf-paper industry faces
  environmental challenges. Because kenaf requires about as much irrigation
  water as cotton, its cultivation in drier regions of the U.S., including
  southern California and the Southwest, could impact wildlife and vegetation.
  Care will be needed to ensure that kenaf fields are sited in areas with
  ample rainfall, such as the Southeast, and that they leave a plentiful
  supply of water for native species and habitats.<BR>
  <BR>
  An expanding kenaf industry, struggling to price its product competitively
  with subsidized wood-based papers, might feel compelled to use chlorine
  for bleaching, since it's substantially less expensive than hydrogen peroxide.
  Such economic pressure must be countered by public education emphasizing
  chlorine's toxic toll on the biosphere. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Kenaf and other &quot;Earth friendly&quot; paper
  alternatives offer viable, job-creating solutions to environmental problems
  caused by timber harvesting for virgin-wood paper. Nonwood paper is clearly
  the necessary alternative. Currently, however, such alternatives are more
  expensive than virgin-wood paper due to significant start-up costs for
  mills, smaller economies of scale in the marketplace, and the disadvantage
  in competing with the dominant paper industrey which enjoys considerable
  government subsidies. Rethinking paper means rethinking these subsidies,
  either scaling them back or eliminating them altogether. ReThink Paper
  supports policies that favor a truly sustainable paper industry.</FONT></P>

  some green-thinking corporations (among them Apple, Aveda, Esprit, and
  Fetzer Vineyards) are helping to preserve forests and reduce pollution
  by producing printed materials on kenaf. A few far-sighted publishers have
  successfully employed kenaf, most notably Gar Smith, editor of <I>Earth
  Island Journal </I>, who pioneered the use of kenaf in magazine publishing,
  and HarperCollins, which printed David Brower's <I>Let the Mountains Talk,
  Let the Rivers Run </I>entirely on kenaf. These advances stemmed from the
  leadership of visionary executives intent on demonstrating that environmental
  protection and business imperatives go hand in hand. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
  Such ground-breaking efforts are but the beginning of a push to spare forests
  and clean up pollution by shifting from an outdated, destructive mode of
  production to one that's appropriate for a cleaner 21st century. The emergence
  of a viable kenaf industry will not occur overnight, nor without considerable
  trial and error and sacrifice on the part of many individuals. Public awareness
  and support of the paper is essential. Certainly no idea as good as kenaf
  paper should be allowed to die, nor will it, so long as environmentalists
  work for it, for Earth's sake. </FONT></P>

We grew it to rig the great New England sailing ships, traveled west in
Conestoga wagons covered in hemp, dressed in homespun hemp cloth when we

and fed the poultry with hemp seed. We used hemp to help develop this country.&quot;

  <P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The greatest barrier to hemp-paper manufacturing
  in the United States today is the short-sighted government ban on the cultivation
  of industrial hemp.</FONT></B></P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=+3>H</FONT>EMP IS AN HERBACEOUS ANNUAL PLANT NATIVE TO ASIA
  that grows well in many temperate climates. It typically reaches 6-12 feet
  in its four-month growth period, producing approximately 3-6 tons of dry
  fiber per acre annually - nearly twice as much as southern pine. Hemp also
  competes well with weeds and is resistant to most pests. As a result, few
  pesticides and herbicides are required for cultivation. Hemp's rapid growth
  rate, high fiber yield, and its many applications make it an attractive
  industrial crop for manufacturing a variety of products including cloth,
  rope, birdseed, paint, varnish, soap, oil and paper.</P>
  <P>Hemp has been cultivated worldwide for 6-10,000 years. The use of hemp
  fibers for paper production dates back almost 1900 years to China, where
  paper was first manufactured. In fact, the oldest-known piece of paper
  (circa 140-87 BC) contains hemp fibers. Until the 19th century, paper was
  manufactured from cloth rags in Europe and the Americas. Because most cloth
  was made from hemp and flax, they became the primary paper feedstocks.
  The Gutenberg Bible (15th Century), the King James Bible (17th Century),
  the first and second drafts of the Declaration of Independence, and the
  original works of Mark Twain, Victor Hugo, Alexander Dumas, Lewis Carroll,
  and Thomas Paine were all printed on paper made of hemp fibers.</P>
  <P>Technological advances in the late 19th century made it cheaper to use
  wood instead of rags for pulp and paper production. Despite renewed interest
  in hemp during WW I, cultivation was banned in 1937 because of hemp's association
  with marijuana. During WWII this ban was lifted, and the USDA encouraged
  farmers acrosss the country to grow &quot;Hemp for Victory.&quot; In 1940,
  world hemp production peaked at approximately 832,000 tons per year. However,
  after WW II, the restrictions were reinstated and global hemp production
  declined significantly. Approximately 124,000 tons of hemp are currently
  harvested annually worldwide. The majority is now produced in China and
  Eastern Europe.</P>
  <P>In the 1980s, interest in hemp as a viable and sustainable fiber crop
  began to develop in Western Europe and North America in association with
  growing concern about the impacts of deforestation and air and water pollution
  caused by the pulp and paper industry. Hemp has developed a reputation
  as an ecologically sound, non-wood alternative to wood for paper production.
  As a result, the market for hemp paper has begun to grow steadily. In 1994,
  the US imported approximately 2,000 tons of hemp paper.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>t is difficult to analyze the economic costs and
  environmental impacts of hemp paper production because the fiber is frequently
  processed with antiquated technology. Outdated mill technology can only
  convert 50 percent of the stalk into pulp and the scale of production is
  small (an average of 5,000 tons/year compared with modern wood pulp mills'
  250,000 tons/year). As a result of these economies of scale, hemp pulp
  and paper is expensive. These antiquated mills tend not to have chemical
  recovery systems, releasing effluents directly into local environments.</P>
  <P>However, recent laboratory research and new pulping processes (now at
  the demonstration level) have shown that hemp can be pulped more productively,
  cheaply, and with fewer negative environmental impacts than trees. When
  modern pulping processes and mill technologies are used, fewer chemicals
  and less energy are required to pulp hemp fibers. In addition, up to 80
  percent of unprocessed hemp can be converted to pulp (compared with an
  average of 43 percent of wood fibers), and mill effluent is significantly
  cleaner. Furthermore, toxic chlorine bleaching processes can be replaced
  with environmentally benign processes that use oxygen, hydrogen peroxide,
  or ozone.</P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>he greatest barrier to hemp paper production in
  the US today is the ban on legal cultivation. Industrial hemp is grown
  from certified seed varieties, guaranteed to produce low amounts of THC
  (0.05-1%, as opposed to 3-15% in marijuana. In 1937, when hemp cultivation
  was banned, the chemical THC had not been identified.) In the past few
  years, several countries, including England, Canada, Germany and Australia,
  have relaxed restrictions, joining more than 20 countries that allow hemp
  cultivation. There are also efforts in several states (KY, CO, VT, HI,
  MO, SD, IA) to allow hemp research. These factors could positively influence
  the future of industrial hemp cultivation in the US. As new advances in
  farming, processing, and pulping move from experimental to commercial applications,
  hemp's potential to become a major pulp feedstock for paper production
  may finally be realized.</P>

<P>It's April 22, Earth Day 1996, and the environmental community is torn.
One of its key players pulled away from the fold by releasing a faulty report
on &quot;environmentally friendly paper,&quot; then failing to follow through
on promises to correct some of its errors. This serious mistake severely
affects our forests, air, and water. It also undermines the progress of
small businesses, farmers, and environmentalists working to develop an ecologically
sustainable paper industry. <BR>
<BR>
On December 19, 1995, the EDF and its Paper Task Force (including Time Inc.,
McDonalds, Duke University, Johnson and Johnson, and The Prudential) released
the long awaited Recommendations for Purchasing and Using Environmentally
Preferable Paper., a summary of sixteen in-depth &quot;white papers&quot;.
The report has been criticized for validating the status quo of pulp and
paper industry practices rather than challenging its environmental soundness.
<BR>
<BR>
In response to a wave of criticism about the accuracy of its work (available
in press kit), the PTF only agreed to withhold and revisit White Paper #13
(WP13). This background research report inadequately addressed the use of
annual crops such as kenaf, hemp, and wheat in &quot;tree-free&quot; (nonwood)
papermaking. Unfortunately, inaccuracies were identified throughout the
white papers. Nonetheless the PTF proceeded to issue the Recommendations,
including WP13's flawed analysis. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We can't wait any longer.&quot; says Emily Miggins, Director of ReThink
Paper at Earth Island Institute. &quot;The EDF and the Paper Task Force
promised to revisit and respond to the inaccuracies found in White Paper
#13 and the Recommendations. Four months have passed, and all they've done
is aggressively push their flawed report to large corporate paper consumers
across the country, while making no apparent effort to correct its errors.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The co-option of environmental groups by corporate money and conservative
forces has become an increasingly serious problem and the EDF is leading
the way in this trend. EDF's removal from the Endangered Species Coalition,
their less recent but controversial stance on NAFTA, and their support of
the pulp and paper industry status quo through the Paper task force is indicative
of this trend. <BR>
<BR>
Alicia Culver, Coordinator of Ralph Nader's Government Purchasing project
added, &quot;We are disgusted that the Environmental Defense Fund has allowed
itself to become corrupted by the pulp and paper industry by recommending
that purchasers buy paper products from mills that create dioxin and other
toxic pollutants even though more environmentally sound technologies are
available in the United States and abroad.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A coalition of environmental groups, including ReThink Paper, have strongly
criticized the Paper Task Force Recommendations and white papers for a number
of reasons. Criticism has been raised for:<BR>
<BR>
&#183; evaluating land-use impacts of tree plantations versus nonwood fibers
by comparing fiber yields only. This overlooks tree plantation impacts such
as clearcutting natural forests to establish fast-growing tree monocultures;
excessive nitrogen depletion; and the removal of valuable acreage from annual
rotational farming systems for 8-30 years per tree crop.<BR>
<BR>
&#183; endorsing the pulp and paper industry association's (American Forest
&amp; Paper Assoc.) so-called sustainable forestry guidelines that identifies
many of the industry's ecologically damaging practices as &quot;sustainable&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
&#183; recommending less environmentally preferable paper options. Paper
industry representatives recently used the PTF Recommendations to help defeat
a California legislative initiative (AB 826) that would have given state
procurement preferences to totally-chlorine free (TCF) paper products. In
addition, Time Inc.'s commitment to Greenpeace to use TCF in its publications
is in jeopardy as a result of the PTF's work. Finally, the Alliance for
Environmental Technologies, a pro-chlorine bleaching Wise-Use group regularly
uses the Recommendations in its media propaganda. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What gets me, is that a highly credible environmental organization
[EDF] has knowingly issued inaccurate information. It hurts small businesses,
farmers, and all those who are working hard to introduce the tree-free paper
concept&quot; said Tom Rymsza, President, KP Products, U.S. manufacturer
of kenaf plant paper.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The EDF is supposed to be the science behind our movement,&quot; added
Brian West, Associate Director of ReThink Paper. &quot;We've been deeply
disappointed and set-back by the inadequate job they have done on this campaign.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Critics of the Paper Task Force made a good faith gesture by trusting the
group to act responsibly. By now the PTF should have corrected its misleading
reports and alerted its readers to these shortcomings. This Earth Day marks
the four-month anniversary of the PTF Recommendations release and the good
faith of those who were promised has been betrayed. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Internal Revenue Service April 15, 1996<BR>
Washington D.C.<BR>
To Whom It May Concern:<BR>
<BR>
I have decided to hold out a small percentage of my income tax this year
as a protest against the way this government does business.<BR>
<BR>
There are a lot of us who feel that our government is failing us. We love
our country but fear our government. Expression through the ballot box does
not seem to adequately, or accurately, represent our interests. I believethe
reason that only a small percentage of the population votes is not due to
laziness, but because we have lost faith in the system. The money it takes
to get elected leaves our legislators beholden to special interestgroups
who are the politician's real constituency. The people's concerns are not
represented, while the industries that make the government jump read like
a &quot;Who's Who&quot; of enemies to the environment.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps being an environmentalist has gone out of fashion, but anyone who
has flown over Washington, Oregon, or Northern California and seen the clearcuts
and the immense destruction to our forests cannot possibly let go of that
image. Last week a court in San Francisco overturned a logging ban in sensitive
spotted owl habitat in the Pacific Northwest. I realize that the fate of
the spotted owl may be a low priority to many people who are just trying
to pay their bills and feed their families. But it is my belief that our
destiny is inextricably tied to the plight of the forest, the<BR>
spotted owl, and our millions of other relations in nature, with whom we
share this planet in the grand and interconnected Web of Life. It does not
make sense that we have a series of federal laws, including the Endangered
Species Act and the Wilderness Act, designed to protect the forest, yet
we still use federal tax dollars to subsidize its destruction. <BR>
<BR>
The recent passage of the Salvage Logging Bill now allows the timber industry
to go into any area of our forest, including sensitive wilderness areas,
with roads built by our tax dollars, to take out any trees damaged by fire
or insects. Believe it or not, the bill also allows logging any trees that
could be in danger of fire or insect damage, which amounts to every tree
in the forest. There is also unprecedented language in the bill that allows
no judicial review of the logging. This has effectively doubled private
logging of public land. I would think that with only four percent of the
native old growth forest remaining in this country, our government would
be doing everything in its considerable power to preserve what is left instead
of leading the charge to destroy it.<BR>
<BR>
I do not see why we cannot have both jobs and a clean environment. Nor do
I see why we do not subsidize alternatives to all these destructive industries.
Why do our tax dollars go to subsidize timber, coal, petrochemical, mining,
nuclear, and war industries?<BR>
<BR>
Our future success and survival depends on the life in the forest in a very
pragmatic and economic way. During the housing boom after the end of World
War II, the Department of Agriculture decided to increase the amount of
timber harvested from our national forest reserves from less than one billion
board feet annually to more than ten billion board feet. This increase was
justified as a means to provide lumber to build affordablehomes for returning
American soldiers. Fifty years later, the ForestService still has a multi-billion
board feet delivery quota and our tax<BR>
dollars subsidize the timber industry to the tune of almost $500 million
dollars annually. Yet our national forests no longer supply lumber for affordable
homes. Now the overwhelming majority of the timber harvest is either chipped
to make paper or exported, along with jobs, to Japan. [For specific numbers,
see the <A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~rot">Thoreau Institute</A>.]<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, forests do not have to be used to make paper or most building
materials. Another program begun by the Department of Agriculture during
World War II to ensure an adequate supply of natural resources was the &quot;Hemp
for Victory&quot; campaign. Industrial hemp, a non-psychoactive type of
Cannabis sativa that is genetically distinct from marijuana, along with
other agricultural crops like wheat, rice straw and kenaf, can be used to
make paper, particle board, paint, clothing, and thousands of other products.
It is a potential alternative crop for struggling American farmers who recently
lost their federal subsidies. The timber, mining, nuclear, and oil industries,
on the other hand, have not lost their federal subsidies. [The Mining Law
of 1872 routinely requires the United States to give away billions of dollars
worth of minerals for a fraction of their fair market value. The Oil Depletion
Allowance allows the petroleum industry to avoid paying hundreds of billions
of dollars worth of federal taxes.]<BR>
<BR>
Industrial hemp is grown legally in Canada, England, Australia, China, South
Korea, the former Soviet Union, and at least thirty other countries worldwide,
without any reported problems. Still, a government agency, namely the Drug
Enforcement Administration, has used federal tax dollars to intimidate every
state legislature that has tried to return this valuable crop to its farmers.
Just last week, four senior agents from the Rocky Mountain Division of the
DEA, spent the entire day on duty at the Colorado state capital, testifying
and lobbying against passage of the Colorado Industrial Hemp Production
Act. They misrepresented the federal law as it applies to industrial hemp
and once again, &quot;successfully&quot; thwarted another state's attempt
to develop an alternative fiber industry. [See, Thomas J. Ballanco, The
Colorado Hemp Production Act of 1995: Farms and Forests Without Marijuana,
66 U.Colo.L.Rev. 1165 (1995).]<BR>
<BR>
I fail to see the rationale behind using our federal tax dollars to block
the development of a new, environmentally sound, sustainable, and economically
profitable industry while continuing to allocate billions of dollars to
the industries that threaten our very survival on the planet. We can, and
we must, work to develop those industries that provide both jobs and environmental
protection. I refuse to fall for the false dilemma of choosing one or the
other. Our tax revenues must buy us both. Instead of giving ten thousand
dollars to the IRS, I donated it to aid the development of a domestic hemp
industry.<BR>
<BR>
I lived for ten years in Los Angeles where the air is unfit to breathe,
the water unfit to drink and the beaches frequently post &quot;Swim at your
own Risk&quot; signs. I rationalized living there in the name of my drive
toward &quot;success.&quot; But I cannot rationalize it for my daughter.
I envision a world of non-polluting cars and solar powered houses. I have
my piece of the forest to live in and enough money for my family, but the
fact is, I care. To borrow a phrase from the Lorax, somebody has to, &quot;Speak
for the trees.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Two hundred and twenty years ago, we embarked on an historic journey to
&quot;form a more perfect union&quot; because we refused to submit to taxation
without representation. Until my tax dollars stop going to subsidize destructive
industries like timber, I cannot in good conscience continue to give. We
the people must recognize the power that we have as consumers and tax payers
when our votes do not work. I refuse to continue to submit to taxation without
representation. If boycott and tax resistance are the only avenues left
to us, then that is the route I will take.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely, <BR>
<BR>

  <BR>
                         <FONT SIZE=+4>O</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ne of the most
  critical issues confronting environmentalists today is the ravaging of
  North American forests by the pulp and paper industry. Even with half the
  forests that once covered the planet already destroyed, the United States
  continues devouring some 4 billion cubic meters of timber annually. Thirty
  percent of all the trees logged in the country go into manufacturing paper
  products. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The plundering of forests by the timber industry has severe
  ecological consequences for the nation: a loss of wildlife and habitat;
  degradation of riparian systems; an increase in global warming; and the
  disruption of local communities and economies. While there are signs of
  hope in the form of labor-intensive and community-based sustainable forestry
  plans and practices, these efforts are still in their infancy. Meanwhile,
  worldwide paper consumption is projected to expand 46 percent by the year
  2040.<BR>
  <BR>
  Reducing paper consumption levels through reduction, reuse, and recycling
  strategies is crucial to preserving our forests. However, these approaches
  alone have yet to succeed in adequately protecting domestic forests. Virgin
  tree-fibers remain by far the dominant component in papermaking. Every
  time a fiber is broken down (either in pulping or recycling), it becomes
  weaker, making the addition of strong virgin fibers a neccessity. Until
  virgin wood pulp is replaced as the primary fiber 'strengthener' in paper
  manufacturing, the industry will continue to destroy forest ecosystems.
  </FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Ecological Alternatives</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>One of the most promising solutions to this situation
  is the replacement of virgin-wood fibers with more environmentally benign
  <A HREF="tffibp.html">non-wood fibers</A> from paper crops (such
  as hemp or kenaf), reclaimed fabric, or agricultural residues such as wheat
  straw, rice straw, sugarcane, cotton linters, and other &quot;waste&quot;
  material left over after harvest. A large scale substitution of this kind
  would make a substantial contribution to the protection of forests and
  other natural systems. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Earth friendly&quot; paper alternatives offer viable,
  job-creating solutions to environmental problems directly caused by timber
  harvesting and virgin wood pulp and paper manufacturing processes. However,
  nonwood paper is currently more expensive than virgin-wood paper due to
  significant industry start-up costs, smaller economies of scale, and heavy
  government subsidization of the pulp, paper and timber industries. Government
  regulatory and procurement policies and subsidy programs have encouraged
  growth of the timber, pulp,  and paper industries and their irresponsible
  ways by making polluting and forest destruction the most inexpensive ways
  to operate. This situation has instituted an uneven competitive climate,
  skewed towards virgin wood-based paper production.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>ReThink Paper advocates replacing such environmentally
  unsound subsidies and policies with programs aimed at creating a sustainable
  paper industry. Ecological paper alternatives should be the wave of the
  future. </FONT><BR>

  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rethink Paper works to educate the public about ecological
  paper issues in the following ways:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>-- Produces</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> fact sheets, monographs,
    and resource guides about non-wood fibers, paper efficiency, and related
    issues. We're in the process of putting together a comprehensive consumer
    guide to ecological printing and writing papers.</FONT></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>-- Assists</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> corporations, nonprofit
    organizations, and government agencies in making informed, ecologically
    sound paper-purchasing decisions. This work is undertaken in order to significantly
    increase the use of tree-free fibers and post-consumer recycled paper.
    We seek to increase the demand for ecologically sound paper--making it
    cost-competitive--while reducing demand for wood-based paper.</FONT></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>-- Works</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> with major printing
    firms and publishing houses to develop the experience and technical knowledge
    necessary to provide non-wood paper-printing services.</FONT></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>-- Provides</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> information about
    the economic and environmental advantages of non-wood paper production
    to pulp and paper corporations evaluating non-wood alternatives.</FONT></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>-- Consults</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> with members of
    congress and government agencies to strengthen environmental regulations
    pertaining to pulp and paper production. We encourage government purchasing
    policies that favor non-wood papers.</FONT></P>
    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>-- Organizes</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> lectures about
    the advantages of non-wood and recycled papers for schools, colleges, government
    offices, business meetings, and environmental and paper industry conferences.</FONT></P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>-- ReThink Paper's education and advocacy efforts are
    based on extensive research. Members of the RTP staff work with government
    researchers, university professors, professional papermakers, economists,
    chemists, forestry experts, and farmers to obtain the most up-to-date,
    useful and influential research data pertaining to the non-wood, recycled
    and virgin wood-based paper industries.</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4><FONT COLOR="#BF0344" SIZE=+1>Publications</FONT></H4>
  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>ReThink Paper is continually producing and updating both
  printed and Web-based fact sheets, technical monographs, and other reports
  on ecological paper manufacturing and use (see our hemp, kenaf, and paper-efficiency
  reports on this site). We're also putting together a comprehensive consumer
  guide to ecological printing and writing paper. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

Tree-Free Paper</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Paper made without trees is not a new concept. In fact,
  it is as ancient as paper itself: throughout history, paper has been made
  from a variety of plants. Only in the past century have forests been cut
  extensively to make paper. Re-educating the public about the various materials
  that can be used to make paper is an important component of ReThink Paper's
  work.<BR>
  <BR>
  Shifting towards agricultural fiber sources such as <A HREF="kenaf.html">kenaf</A>,
  <A HREF="hemp.html">hemp</A>, wheat and rice straw, and corn stalks for
  paper raw materials is an opportunity to diversify the paper industry's
  sole reliance on trees for paper fibers, thereby protecting our forests,
  reducing pollution associated with pulp and paper manufacturing, and stimulating
  new economic opportunities in rural communities.<BR>

<H1>Earth Island Journal:100% tree-free since '94<HR></H1>
During the past two years Earth Island Institute has explored and advocated
the use of <A HREF="tffibp.html">tree-free</A> fibers for <A HREF="tfpdef.html">paper</A>
production. Earth Island's efforts began with the publication of a series
of articles in its quarterly magazine, Earth Island Journal, investigating
the current paper industry and the potential for change. In 1994, putting
words into action, Earth Island Journal published the first 100 percent
tree-free magazine in the US using paper made from the kenaf plant. <BR>
<BR>
Earth Island now proposes to move beyond the demonstration phase and initiate
a formal ReThink Paper campaign. We are able to begin this campaign with
the generous and enthusiastic support and funding of the Turner Foundation,
based in Atlanta, and the Columbia Foundation located here in San Francisco.<BR>

<title>About Global Service Corps</title>



</head>







<body>







<H2>The Global Service Corps Philosophy</H2>







Global Service Corps is an international service-learning organization that is 



built on the participation of its volunteers and staff, both in the developed 



and developing countries of the world.  Its program is established on the view 



that the personal lives and activities of people around the world are 



increasingly intertwined.  It is important that we understand the 



interrelatedness of our actions and the effect they have on individual health, 



social well-being and environmental stability worldwide.  We are all 



responsible for the health of the whole world.<p>







Wealthy countries are now acknowledging that overconsumption and unsustainable 



production in industrial countries is the main cause of poverty and 



environmental harm throughout the world.   At the same time, the values and 



wisdom of traditional and indigenous cultures are increasingly being 



acknowledged as essential to the well-being of all the world's people. 



Those 20% of us living in developed countries, who consume 80% of our natural 



resources, have the benefit of material wealth, technology and education to 



appropriately share.  We have a moral responsibility to do so.  Those 80% of us 



in developing countries have a wealth of culture, tradition and community to 



share in return.  We need each other!<p>







The projects of Global Service Corps provide a means for participants to 



understand each other's cultures and problems while at the same time actively 



addressing at a community level some of our many global issues.  You are 



invited to participate as a Global Service Corps volunteer in developing and 



supporting activities that provide opportunities for healing and further 



awareness of our world.  The Global Service Corps program offers opportunities 



for volunteers from developed countries to work together with citizens of 



developing countries on sustainable development projects in their local 



communities.  The warmth and friendship shared with our host community members 



and fellow volunteers is an experience you will long cherish.  As a participant 



in this program, you are in for an adventure in cultural exchange, learning and 



service that could last a lifetime.<p>

<title>GSC Longterm Volunteer Opportunities</title>



</head>







<body>







<H2>Long Term Global Service Corps Volunteer Opportunities</H2>







Long term volunteer placements are available at the project sites of the short 



term project trips.  Long term volunteers go through a more extensive 



application procedure which is meant to match volunteer backgrounds and 



experiences to the specific needs of the project and host organization.  Once 



the  long term volunteer is accepted, s/he participates in the project trip 



which serves  as an orientation period for his/her long term placement.  In 



exceptional cases  where a prospective volunteer's background and 



experience has already  prepared him/her for service at a project site, the 



volunteer may choose not to  participate in the short term project trip.  In 



this case, the registration fee covers  the full cost of placement and the 



following terms and conditions apply to the  placement.<BR>







<H3>Placement Terms and Conditions</H3>



<p>



The costs of registering as a Long Term Volunteer with Global Service Corps 



are as follows: $250 initial registration fee followed by remaining balance of 



$250 once the placement is secured, for a total of $500.  This $500 is applied 



to  the cost of the short term project associated with the placement;  this 



short term  project experience provides the on-site orientation for the long 



term placement.   If Global Service Corps is unable to make a placement, all 



money is refundable  less $50.00 for administrative fees.  If a placement is 



made by Global Service  Corps and the prospective volunteer decides not to take 



it, the initial $250.00 deposit is non-refundable.<p>











<B>Services provided by Global Service Corps include the following:</B><BR>







<OL>



<LI>Arrange a volunteer placement with the host organization appropriate to skills of volunteer.



<LI>Arrange with the host organization for room and board in exchange for 



volunteer work.  Room and board is often provided through a homestay and 



includes food common to the local diet.  In most cases, room is provided in 



exchange for volunteer work and board is provided on a minimum cost basis.



<LI>Provide basic orientation material to familiarize volunteer with the host country and organization. 



<LI>Provide information about recommended medical precautions, including 



immunizations and other health related information.  



<LI>Provide information regarding procedures for obtaining a visa to enter the host country. 



<LI>Arrange for discounted airfare, if desired.



</OL><p>











<B>Responsibilities of the volunteer include:</B>







<OL>



<LI>Provide for own health insurance.



<LI>Adhere to agreement of working conditions to be confirmed with host 



organization before final acceptance of placement.



<LI>Send monthly reports to Global Service Corps of volunteer experience. Immediately 



notify of any significant difficulties.



</OL><p>











<H3>Application Procedure</H3>







You may request a long term application form by contacting <B>Global Service Corps Volunteers</B>, 



300 Broadway Ave., Suite 39, San Francisco, CA 94133-3312, USA

<h1 align=center>Kenya Biointensive Gardening Project</h1>



<h3 align=center>



<I>Live in a village family home while assisting a loving and joyful people in producing healthy food.</I>



</h3>







<img SRC="hujambo1.gif" align=left>







<p>Volunteers attend a biointensive training program in Mumias which ends with an all-day public seminar for 



Kenyan citizens. Volunteers are divided into pairs for their homestays in local villages, where they work with 



Kenyans to provide biointensive workshops for farmers. Relaxation time during the three-week trip includes 



an overnight camping trip to a local rainforest and a two-day safari in the beautiful Masai Mara.







<p>We depart the U.S. on a Friday, traveling via London and arriving on Saturday evening in Nairobi.  We spend 



Sunday relaxing and exploring Nairobi, visiting local markets and other areas of interest. The following day



we travel to the Mumias CPK (Anglican) Diocese headquarters in western Kenya.  Here we spend four days 



learning some of the techniques of biointensive gardening and community development.  While in Mumias we 



are housed in dormitory style accommodations or in local homes.







Following our training, we move to local villages in the Mumias area where we will be placed in pairs with local 



families.  During the next 10 days we assist villagers and local women's cooperatives with the initiation of biointensive 



garden plots. Participants have the opportunity to deeply experience the local culture as they fully join in family 



and community life.  Kenyans are warm, engaging people who love to converse about local and world events. 



We will enjoy memorable times of community dancing, singing and evening discussions around candle light.  



While living in village dwellings with minimum western conveniences, we will also enjoy the Kenyan diet including



ugali (corn meal), sakuma weeki (kale-like vegetable), and tropical fruits.







<p>We spend the next two days visiting the fabled Masai Mara Wildlife Reserve. Nowhere else in Africa is wildlife 



more plentiful than the Masai Mara, famous for its great concentrations of gazelle and antelope and their natural



predators--the big cats.  We then travel to Nairobi arriving in time for some final shopping and our concluding 



banquet dinner.  We depart Kenya on a Saturday evening, and arrive back in the U.S. on Sunday evening.

for a briefing with the CPK Diocese Health Committee. Pairs of volunteers spread out to small villages near 



one of six CPK village health clinics, where they work with Kenyan nurses to teach preventive health care 



to women's groups and other village organizations. Presentations and training are seasoned with a 



mid-project retreat at a local rainforest.







<p>We depart the U.S. on a Friday traveling via London and arriving Saturday evening in Nairobi.  After 



spending two days of orientation and sightseeing in Nairobi, we travel on Tuesday to Mumias, western 



Kenya.  Here we are hosted by local community members and housed in their homes.  Our project



consists of offering health care education to local community members, volunteer health care workers, 



and nurses and medical officers in charge of village clinics.  We will be working in small teams or two or 



three, with teams perhaps including a medical doctor, a nurse or MPH, and a community educator.  



(Experience in a medical field would be useful but is not mandatory.) Subjects to be taught in this health 



education and training program include the following:  Clinical knowledge and skills; prevention of diseases 



common to the area including malaria, respiratory infections, diarrheal disease, and AIDS; family planning; 



food supplementation; and public health education, with a particular emphasis on women's health issues.







<p>During our time in Western Kenya, we will also spend two days and an overnight enjoying the nearby 



Kakamega National Rainforest.  This trip offers a mid-project break for some relaxation, group considerations 



and further planning.  On our return to Nairobi we have a final day available for sightseeing.  We depart Kenya 



on Saturday evening, and arrive back in the U.S. on Sunday evening.  For those interested in extending their stay in



Kenya, a three-day safari to the Masai Mara game reserve will be available for an additional cost.

<h3>Kenya Project News</h3>







<p>Can you help? Returned Kenya Health volunteer Bonnie Griffith, R.N. tells us that the health care professionals are 



reporting a 60% HIV infection rate in the Mumias area of Western Kenya. 40% of all beds in the Saint Mary's Hospital 



are filled by AIDS infected patients.  Some sources claim that two-thirds of the continent of Africa will be infected with 



AIDS by the year 2005. Bonnie met with AIDS trainers from St. Mary's Hospital and the CPK (Anglican) Diocese, who are



enlarging their AIDS awareness programs to cope with this emergency situation and need assistance from GSC 



volunteers. AIDS awareness is now the focus of our health education work along with our related educational efforts in 



the areas of family planning and public health. We appreciate the work done by Bonnie and by recently returned long-term 



volunteer Elizabeth Visceglia in updating the structure of our health education program in Mumias. 







<p>"They have stopped all other health programs so they won't be overwhelmed by AIDS patients."

<title>Costa Rica Trip</title>



</head>







<body>







<h1 align=center>Costa Rica Eco-Service Project</h1>



<h3 align=center>



<i>Experience small village lifestyle while assisting with community service and conservation projects.</i>



</h3>







<img SRC="hola1.gif" align=left>







<p>The Costa Rica Eco-Service project is a 2-1/2 week project working with rainforest communities who are 



struggling to keep themselves going without damaging their environment. Volunteers stay one week



with each of two different Costa Rican communities, participating in their efforts to both survive and sustain, 



and experiencing the day-to-day life of the people.







<p>Volunteers will depart the U.S. and arrive in the Costa Rican capital of San Jose.  The following morning, 



the group will be driven through lush countryside to the beautiful Monteverde rainforest preserve.  After a 



brief orientation and guided tour of the rainforest provided by the Monteverde Conservation League, we 



will travel to the small developing community of San Gerardo located in the heart of the International 



Children's Rainforest.  Here we will stay for six days in the eco-lodge facilities and assist the members of 



the community in their project of creating and developing a center for scientific research and eco tourism.  



The group will assist with activities such as gardening, construction, and trail maintenance.







<p>For the second half of the trip, the group will travel to Buen Amigo, a small farming community working to 



become self sustainable.  We will stay either in the new eco-lodge dormitory or in the homes of hospitable 



local families.  The work done in Buen Amigo is chosen by the community, based on their needs at the time.  



Such activities could include reforestation, picking coffee, or working on the eco-lodge.  After six days in 



Buen Amigo, we will travel to La Fortuna, a resort town at the foot of the spectacular Arenal Volcano.  



There the group will enjoy relaxing in the famous hot springs and admiring the amazing view of the volcano.  



Finally, we return to San Jose where we will enjoy a goodbye banquet dinner.  The following morning we 



will return to the United States, satisfied by our contribution to communities of the Costa Rican rainforest.



<p>

<h3>Costa Rica Project News</h3>







<p>The people of the rainforest communities of Costa Rica are being torn by two opposing forces: protecting their 



environment and feeding their families. The community of San Gerardo, for example, live s on land that is 



environmentally protected by the government. This makes it almost impossible to grow enough food using



traditional methods, so almost all of the people of San Gerardo have moved away. The Monteverde Conservation 



League, a Costa Rican environmental organization, had an idea. They began building a research station for 



scientific study of the rainforest. By increasing opportunitie s for employment and education, they hope to



encourage the people of the community to return to the lands they once called home, where they can both feed 



their families and protect their ecosystem.







<p>In Other News...







<p>We recently heard from Paul Englander, a returned GSC volunteer from our December '95 Costa Rica project. He 



said he liked it there so much, he wants to go back! We are setting up a long-term placement for him at Monteverde, 



and he should be there by the middle of this summer.  Welcome back Paul! And, hasta luego!







<p>"Working as a team in a group of volunteers/ local people helping to improve the community was what I wanted to 



do... This was the perfect way to give something back."







<p>Paul Englander, 



<br>Once and future GSC volunteer

<title>Guatemala Trip</title>



</head>







<body>







<h1 align=center>Guatemala Biointensive Gardening Project</h1>



<h3 align=center>



<I>Learn biointensive gardening techniques and share this knowledge with local villagers.</I>



</h3>







<img SRC="hola2.gif" align=left>







<p>GSC volunteers in Guatemala will learn biointensive techniques at the New Forests Project's Agroforestry 



Training Center in Nueva Concepcion, near the southern coast of the country.  They will help put together a 



public seminar to demonstrate these new skills to Guatemalans in the area.  Then they will trek to outlying villages,



where they will share their new abilities with rural farmers who are eager to learn more fruitful ways of growing 



food for their families.











<p>The group departs Friday morning, arriving in Guatemala City that evening.   The next day, we travel to 



the project site in Nueva Concepcion in southwestern Guatemala.  Here we attend a 4 day bilingual 



training session on the methods of biointensive agriculture.  Side by side with Guatemalan cohorts we will 



learn such techniques as crop selection, double digging, composting and seedling management.  During 



this time, the group will stay in the dormitory at the Agroforestry Training Center.  On the following day, the 



newly trained volunteers will assist in presenting a public seminar on biointensive agriculture to the local



villagers.







<p>During the next two days the group will enjoy a relaxing mid-project break at beautiful Lake Atitlan, and 



then settle into homestays in various communities near Nueva Concepcion.  Teams of two GSC volunteers 



and one Guatemalan partner will work with women's groups and other village organizations to teach and 



demonstrate the biointensive techniques that were learned in the first half of the trip.  We will help the



Guatemalans create organic gardens, moving towards a more sustainable form of agriculture and away



from deforestation and environmental damage.  On the final day of the project, the group will travel to the



historic town of Antigua, in the outskirts of Guatemala City.  There we will have a chance to do some



sightseeing and shopping before returning to the United States the following day.<p>







<hr>







<h3>Guatemala Project News</h3>







<p>Volunteers on our October program will have the once in a lifetime chance to be part of the birth of an 



exciting and urgently needed new program. Guatemala offers a perfect example of the need for 



biointensive agriculture in developing countries. Poverty and poor land distribution have forced farmers to



destroy lush forests to grow enough food. GSC volunteers will play a crucial role in fighting this trend. By 



revealing biointensive skills to local farmers, participants will not only help remove the causes of deforestation 



but will let the Guatemalan people nourish themselves in a way that is healthier, more productive, and



consistent with their own culture. New Forests Project, our partner in this endeavor, has many years of 



experience in Guatemala. Their staff is familiar with the culture and conditions of rural life, and they predict 



that biointensive agriculture will substantially enrich the people of Guatemala.  







<p>"These farmers are the people that we must reach if we are to reverse the catastrophic deforestation 



occurring around the world today"

<title>Thailand trip</title>



</head>







<body>







<h1 align=center>Thailand English Instruction Project</h1>



<h3 align=center>



<i>Community service and cultural exchange with people from the "Land of Smiles".</i>



</h3>







<img SRC="savat2.gif" align=left>







<p>Like many global citizens, Thais are eager to learn English as a way to communicate with foreigners 



and as an entry into the international marketplace.  In rural Thailand, schools often lack the resources 



to hire native speakers or acquire further training for their present teachers.  GSC collaborates with these 



schools, providing volunteers to teach language and cross-cultural awareness in small villages.  For many 



Thai students, this is their first opportunity to meet and practice with a native English speaker.     







<p>The group will depart on a Saturday, and arrive in Bangkok the following day. After spending Monday resting 



up and sightseeing in Bangkok, we will depart the next morning for the Chiang Mai region of northern 



Thailand.  Our destination will be a local village set among the rolling green mountains of this region.  Here 



the group will be teaching English in local schools and also working with local community leaders and villagers, 



assisting with community projects. Typical projects include assisting in the construction of a women's cooperative 



building, helping with gardening projects, or working on a potable water system.<p>







<p>Participants will be housed in homes of the villagers and will join these families for some meals.  The homes are 



traditional wooden houses and the meals will consist of simple, delicious Thai fare.  You may have to do without



conveniences such as Western toilets and electricity during your stay.  At the same time, you will be welcomed into 



the homes of undoubtedly some of the friendliest people in the world who are always eager to offer farangs



(foreigners) warm hospitality.  Although our group will be accompanied by a Thai-speaking guide, you will enjoy 



learning new ways of communicating across culture and language differences.







<p>During our stay in the village, the group will spend several days exploring the Chiang Mai region, including a nearby 



national park.  We depart for Bangkok on the final Thursday.  On Friday and Saturday we spend time visiting the



Bangkok area, including local Buddhist wats (monasteries), the floating markets and other highlights.  We will depart 



Bangkok on Saturday, and arrive in San Francisco on Sunday.<p>







<hr>







<h3>Thailand Project News</h3>







<p>Thailand project participants live and work in the rustic villages of the beautiful Lamphun Province.  Here, we will 



experience the exceptional Thai warmth and hospitality while staying with a local family, sharing meals and activities 



throughout our stay. Days will be spent teaching at a nearby school or Buddhist monastery.  Thai youth are enthusiastic 



and affectionate students and will be very excited to have a foreign teacher.  Weekends will be free for sightseeing and 



exploring the region.  Past participants have traveled to nearby Chiang Mai or hired a guide for a trek into the



mountains to visit the indigenous hilltribe peoples.







<p>In Other News...







<p>Assisting with these efforts is GSC's new in-country coordinator, Lisa Patlis.  Lisa, who participated in our August 



1994 Kenya Biointensive project, recently set up house in Bangkok with her husband and acts as a local representative 



for GSC.  She coordinates with the growing number of schools that have expressed interest in having GSC volunteers 



teach English to their students.  In addition, she is establishing connections with other community development



projects in which GSC volunteers may participate.  Lisa has an MA in public administration and, before moving to 



Thailand, worked with HUD in Washington D.C..

<H2>HOW TO REGISTER FOR A GSC VOLUNTEER PROJECT TRIP</H2>







Since Global Service Corps is interested in giving as many people as possible 



the opportunity to learn about our global challenges while assisting on a 



sustainable development project, we do not require a specific technical 



expertise or educational background.  However, there are two general 



requirements which all participants must meet:<p>







<OL>



<LI>You must be committed to participating on a trip which has as its primary 



purposes service and learning.  GSC project trips are not just an alternative, 



&quot;interesting&quot; vacation.  



<LI>You must be willing to be flexible and open to a less structured and more 



&quot;laid back&quot; environment. While citizens of developed 



countries are usually accomplishment-oriented and time-structured, citizens of 



developing countries are more often interested in the experience of events and 



relationships.  This means that activities may not  always take place as 



originally planned or &quot;on time.&quot;  Flexibility, good humor and 



a willingness to experience life through another perspective are all 



prerequisites to participation.



</OL><p>











<B>There are two ways to register for a GSC Volunteer Project Trip:</B><p>







<OL>



<LI>If you have already become a Global Service Corps Supporter 



(see <A HREF="invol.html">How you can be involved</A>), 



merely notify the GSC office which project trip you wish to participate 



in and you will be sent materials to compete your application process. These 



will include an application and release form, information about travel and 



health insurance, details regarding the project setting, and a volunteer 



background and information form.  You will later receive additional information 



including a day by day itinerary, a map of the host country, health 



precautions, a clothing and equipment list, information on discount airfares, 



and helpful words and phrases in the local language.







<BR>



<li>If you are not a Global Service Corps Supporter, send the $35 registration 



fee to the GSC office (Global Service Corps Volunteers, 



300 Broadway, Suite 38, San Francisco, CA 94133-3312, USA. 



Checks should be made out to Global Service Corps/Earth Island Institute)



<BR>



along with the following information:



<BR>







<UL>



<LI>Name (as it appears on your passport)



<LI>Address



<LI>Telephone numbers (home, office and fax)



<LI>Which project trip you wish to participate in



</UL>







</OL><p>







You will then be sent materials to complete your application.  After this first step of the application process 



is completed, you will be asked to submit a $500 deposit with the remainder of the project trip fee due 



45 days before departure.<p>

<TITLE>IMMP: Dolphin Death Act Stopped!</TITLE>

<H1>Dolphin Death Act Stopped!</H1>

<H2>Strong Public Opposition Kills H.R.2823 & S.1420</H2>

For immediate release Oct. 3, 1996<P>

<IMG SRC="payne.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT  WIDTH=260 HEIGHT=305 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2>

(San Francisco)  Earth Island Institute announced today that the "Dolphin Death
Act," H.R.2823 and S.1420, has been stopped in the U.S. Senate and will not
become law.<P>

"These bills would have crippled dolphin protection and misled millions of
Americans," explained David Phillips, Director of Earth Island Institute. 
"Thanks to the public outcry and to the leadership of Senator Barbara Boxer
(D-CA) and the bipartisan group of Senators and House members, the dolphin-safe
label is safe"<P>

Phillips attributed the demise of the Dolphin Death Act to the fact that:<P>

The American public would not accept the trashing of the successful Dolphin
Safe tuna program.  S.1420/H.R.2823 would have dropped the current U.S. ban on
import and sale of tuna caught by methods known to slaughter thousands of
dolphins annually.  S.1420/H.R.2823 would have further misled consumers by
changing the U.S. definition of "dolphin safe" tuna to allow chase, harassment,
encirclement, and capture of dolphins with the deadly nets as long as an
observer did not see any dolphin die outright.  In fact, scientists suggest
that not all dead dolphins would be detected and that others would die after
being released from the nets due to physiological shock and injuries sustained
during chase and capture.<P>

Congressmembers received tens of thousands of letters and phone calls from
concerned constituents about the Dolphin Death Act.  In the past two weeks
alone, students organized rallies in Washington DC, Mill Valley CA, and in
Malibu CA, in opposition to passage of the Dolphin Death Act.<P>

Phillips also credited the tenacious fight waged by opponents of the Dolphin
Death Act in the Senate and the House, especially by:
<UL>
<LI>Senator Boxer
<LI>Representative George Miller (D-CA)
</UL>

 They were helped by many other members, including:
 <UL>
<LI>Senators Joseph Biden (D-DE)
<LI>Bob Smith (R-NH)
<LI>Harry Reid (D-NV)
<LI>Representatives Gerry Studds (D-MA)
<LI>Sam Farr (D-CA)
<LI>Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)
<LI>Richard Gephardt (D-MO)
<LI>Frank Pallone (D-NJ)
</UL>
Despite being vastly
outspent by opponents, primarily lobbyists for the Mexican and Venezuelan
fishing industries, their efforts proved the stronger in the waning days of the
Congress.<P>

H.R.2823/S.1420 was opposed by a coalition of over 85 environmental, trade,
labor, and animal welfare organizations, including:
<UL>
<LI>Earth Island Institute
<LI>Humane Society of the U.S.
<LI>Sierra Club
<LI>Defenders of Wildlife
<LI>Friends of the Earth
<LI>Fund for Animals
<LI>Ralph Nader's Public Citizen.
</UL>
Many prominent
scientists also expressed opposition to the provisions of S.1420, including
Captain Jacques Cousteau, Dr. Albert <A HREF="myrick.html">Myrick</A>,
and Dr. Roger <A HREF="payne.html">Payne</A>.<P>

"The Mexican government and the Clinton Administration badly miscalculated in
thinking they could re-define 'dolphin-safe' tuna," explained David Phillips. 
"They refused to back off the most egregious components of the Dolphin Death
Act.  Now that the bill is dead, it is time to go back and seek consensus on
ways to continue to protect dolphins, the marine environment, and encourage
tuna fishermen to fish in a truly dolphin-safe manner."<P>

Sens. Barbara Boxer and Joseph Biden and Reps. Gerry Studds and George Miller
offered compromise legislation, S.1460 and H.R.2856, which would have retained
the current strong definition of "dolphin safe" tuna, while encouraging foreign
fishermen by allowing them to sell their dolphin safe tuna on the U.S. market. 
Furthermore, Congressmembers Gerry Studds and Sam Farr offered amendments to
the Dolphin Death Act, rejected by the proponents, that would have required
live release of sea turtles from nets and reduction in non-target fish
"bycatch" in the nets.<P>

"More than 90% of the world's canned tuna markets are now 'dolphin safe',
according to figures from the United Nations," stated Phillips.  "The Mexican,
Venezuelan, and Colombian governments must realize that the technique of
setting nets on dolphins to catch tuna is cruel, unnecessary, and will never be
acceptable to the American public."<P>

Earth Island Institute is a nonprofit education and conservation organization
that has worked on dolphin protection since 1987.  The International Marine
Mammal Project of Earth Island Institute works to save dolphins, whales, and
other marine mammals around the world.  VIDEO AVAILABLE:  Earth Island
Institute has broadcast quality video available of the deadly effects of tuna

<TITLE>Ocean Alert - Summer/Fall 1996: Gray Whales under Threat</TITLE>

<H1>Gray Whales under Threat</H1>

<H2>Salt Mining in Gray Whale Habitat</H2>

<I>See also <A HREF="s96-1c.html#Update">Update from the IWC</A></I><P>
A giant, new salt-mining operation being promoted by <A HREF="mmpmits.html">Japan's Mitsubishi</A> Corp.
would threaten critical habitat for the gray whales in Mexico's <A HREF="baja.gif">Baja</A> peninsula
lagoons. According to an extensive report, <B>The Gray Zone</B>, published by the
Investigative Network, construction has already begun secretly on the massive
project.<P>

The salt extraction process would threaten gray whales that return to the
lagoons every breeding season, between December and March. The plant and
operations would cover 92 square miles at the north end of the lagoon. The
plant would include salt ponds, a mile-long steel pier, a loading facility for
cargo ships, and two saltwater pumping stations. Eight cargo ships a month
would dock at this facility. The salt evaporation process involves flooding dry
lake beds with seawater and then harvesting the salt deposits left when the
water evaporates. The San Ignacio plant would produce seven million tons of
salt per year, more than doubling ESSA's current production at the neighboring
Guerrero Negro lagoon, which is no longer used by gray whales for breeding. 
500 metric tons of saltwater would be pumped out of San Ignacio lagoon each
year , at the rate of 30,000 liters per second. The salt produced at San
Ignacio, like that now produced at neighboring Guerrero Negro, would be
exported for industrial uses such as de-icing.<P>

Proponents of the salt plant claim that it will bring some 250 jobs to boost
the region's depressed economy and seek to frame the issue as a jobs versus the
environment conflict. ESSA promotes the salt plant as an alternative to the
traditional fishing economy, which is suffering due to overfishing. However,
opponents point out that, even looking at the plant purely in economic terms,
the costs incurred by shifting the economy away from fishing and away from gray
whale tourism toward salt production will outweigh the benefits provided by the
new industry. Local residents point out that menial ESSA jobs are not so
attractive to them, considering that they can generally make as much in one day
of fishing as they project to make in one month of minimum wage employment at
ESSA.<P>

Opponents of ESSA's plan, led by the Mexican environmental organization, El
Grupo de los Cien, point out the fallacy of the jobs versus the environment
argument and the lack of market for the additional salt. If the additional salt
gluts the salt market, it may actually have a detrimental effect on ESSA's
finances. The Grupo de los Cien also points to the mystery surrounding the
source of the $120 million needed for the plant's construction. They argue that
the impact on the gray whales will be disastrous. There is currently no paved
road, which limits even tourist access. The huge 212,319 hectare development on
the lagoon would devastate the tranquility of the lagoon, alienating the
whales. The desalinization of the water pumped out of and back into the lagoon
will reduce the salinity of the lagoon's pools. This is significant for the
gray whales, which depend upon the high salinity to create the buoyancy ideal
for calving and nursing their calves. The pumping process is also expected to
lower the temperature of the lagoon's warm water. Adverse impact on sea
turtles, the black brant and other shorebirds, local fisheries, and the last
herd of pronghorn antelope in the preserve is expected as well.<P>

<A NAME="Update"><H2>Update from the IWC</H2>

At the June meetings of the international whaling  Commission (IWC) in
Scotland, a US proposal to allow the <A HREF="melders.html">Makah Tribe</A> in Washington state to kill
five gray whales per year for "subsistence" purposes was hastily withdrawn
under heavy pressure.<P>

Conservationists opposed the US proposal because of the dangerous precedent it
would have set by eliminating current requirements that any subsistence whaling
must have true "nutritional" need and a "continuous subsistence dependence" on
whales. The Makah Tribe has not conducted any whaling during the past 70
years.<P>

The US position, strongly encouraged by <A
HREF="mmumay.html#Whale">Norwegian</A> and <A HREF="warwhales.html">Japanese</A> whalers and
governments, was dealt a further blow when a group of Makahs arrived in
Scotland to represent some of the tribal elders and joined a united
non-governmental organization community to oppose the whaling proposal.<P>

The US delegation has promised to bring back the proposal for a resumption of
Makah whaling next year.<P>

<TITLE>Ocean Alert - Summer/Fall 1996: Sea Lions and Seals are Scapegoats for Fisheries Depletion.</TITLE>

<H1>Pinnipeds are Scapegoats for Fisheries Depletion.</H1>

<I>Pinniped: Aquatic mammals (as a seal or walrus) with all
four limbs modified into flippers.</I><P>

In what is now a worldwide phenomenon, marine mammals are becoming scapegoats
for human environmental destruction. The Ballard Locks in Seattle, Washington
is the site of controversy surrounding interactions between California sea
lions and an endangered population of winter-run steelhead trout. In a complex
ecological management tangle, species are being pitted against species. Fishers
and conservation agencies justify their attacks on sea lions based on the
pinnipeds' consumption of the endangered fish. Others point out that predation
by sea lions is not the reason the endangered fish continue to decline. The
depleted fish populations are clearly in need of protection, but data indicate
that the decline is the result of fisheries mismanagement and habitat
destruction, not surging marine mammal populations. In the Locks, for instance,
past removal of predatory sea lions has had no lasting impact on numbers of
returning fish.<P>

Numbers of steelhead returning to spawning streams through the  Locks have
plummeted from 2,000 a year in the early 1980's to 76 in 1994 and 137 in 1995.
As fish pass through the narrow Locks, they are easy prey for sea lions. For
the past decade, fishers and management agencies have pointed to the sea lions
as the culprits of the steelhead depletion. This strategy mirrors the
widespread trend toward blaming pinnipeds for competing with fish. The reality
is that sea lions killed only six, eleven, and zero steelhead, respectively, in
1994, 1995, and 1996,  but claims against them persist.<P>

In response to pinniped consumption of depleted fish stocks at the Locks and
elsewhere, Congress amended the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1994 to allow
"lethal taking of individually identifiable pinnipeds which are having a
significant negative impact on the decline or recovery of certain salmonid
fishery stocks." The stocks in question must meet one of the following three
conditions to justify pinniped take: be listed under the Endangered Species
Act, be approaching threatened or endangered species status, or "migrate
through the Ballard Locks at Seattle, Washington." This clause was invoked in
the planned removal of five sea lions from the Ballard Locks this year. Thus
far, three sea lions have been captured and relocated to Sea World, triggering
a lawsuit by a coalition of environmental groups  including EII.<P>

The Ballard Locks-Pinniped Fishery Task Force, a diverse group of fishers,
agency representatives, tribal representatives, independent biologists, and conservation groups, is working to resolve the problem.
According to Task Force member Toni Frohoff, "What is needed is to remedy fish
passage problems at the Locks as well as other factors which are primary causes
of the steelhead decline." Frohoff and many others point out that the real
cause of the steelhead population crisis is a combination of poor Locks design,
habitat degradation, and fisheries mismanagement.<P>

The Ballard Locks was built around 1916 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
allow ships to get into the Lake Washington watershed by controlling water flow
between the lake and the Puget Sound. The design of the Locks results in injury
to approximately 60% of the smolt passing through, due to barnacle-encrusted
plumbing that de-scales them. This is a major source of steelhead mortality.
The Corps has expressed willingness to redesign the Locks, but no action has
yet been taken. Deforestation along the streams has impinged on spawning
habitat by causing siltation, eliminating shade for the eggs, and removing
felled trees that block the water around the eggs. Fisheries management issues
include illegal fishing and competition with hatchery fish. Until recently,
government agencies released hatchery fish into Lake Washington, resulting in
direct competition with wild steelhead for habitat and genetic mixing of less
robust hatcheries stocks with wild stocks.<P>

The final word is not in on the Ballard Locks sea lions, though the gravity of
the steelhead's situation increases the likelihood that other causes of their
dwindling population will be addressed. Meanwhile, attacks on pinnipeds by
fishers are growing. The Fishermen's Alliance of Monterey Bay, CA, complaining
that sea lions are "stealing" some 80% of their catch, is currently circulating
a petition to further relax protection of the California sea lion. Japanese
fishers are killing Pacific white-sided dolphins, false killer whales, and
bottlenose dolphins because of perceived competition for fish stocks. Canadians
are killing 200,000 harp seals a year because of the collapse of cod stocks off
the Newfoundland coast. Nine of the world's seventeen major fisheries are in
major decline and the rest are approaching their limits. Killing  marine
mammals to ensure more availability of fish for human fishers is a strategy
that obfuscates the real, much more complex issues of fisheries mismanagement
and habitat destruction and victimizes marine mammals.<P>

<TITLE>Ocean Alert - Summer/Fall 1996: Showdown for the Dolphins</TITLE>

<H1>Showdown for the Dolphins</H1>

<IMG SRC="dolphin.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2>As the 104th congress careens towards adjournment in September,
environmentalists are fighting legislation that seeks to seriously weaken US
dolphin protection laws is soundly defeated.<P>

The Dolphin Death Act (H.R.2823 and S.1420) would allow dolphin-deadly tuna to
be imported and sold on US supermarket shelves. The act would also change the
federal definition of dolphin-safe tuna to allow the chase, encirclement,
capture, and injury of dolphins so long as no dolphins are observed to be
killed outright. EII and its allies charge that this new version of
"dolphin-safe" would constitute consumer fraud, as mounting evidence shows that
dolphins subjected to chase and capture are far from safe. Many dolphins die
unobserved in the nets or from injury and stress after release. The issue is
especially urgent because the targeted dolphin populations are seriously
depleted and show no signs of recovery even after four years of very low
observed kill rates.<P>

Dolphin advocates in Congress are working to stop proposed changes. Sens.
Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) and Reps. George Miller (D-CA) and
Gerry Studds (D-MA) have joined forces to block passage of the Dolphin Death
Act. They have introduced the Dolphin Protection Act (S.1460 and H.R.2856)
which retains the current U.S. dolphin-safe definition and the embargo on
dolphin-unsafe tuna while providing incentives for foreign fishing fleets to
adopt dolphin-safe practices. Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) has also proposed an
amendment that retains the current federal definition of dolphin-safe tuna.<P>

Notwithstanding Democratic and <A HREF="ddeath0801.html">Republican
efforts</A> to block and amend the bills, the Republican-controlled Congress
has pushed ahead. In May, the House Resources Committee, chaired by
environmental foe Rep. Don Young (R-AK), <A
HREF="ddeath0801.html">passed H.R.2823</A>. The Sen. Commerce
Committee similarly approved Sens. <A
HREF="mailto:Senator_Stevens@stevens.senate.gov">Ted Stevens</A>' (R-AK) and <A
HREF="mailto:senator@breaux.senate.gov">John Breaux</A>'s (D-LA) S.1420 by
voice vote in June. Democrats on both committees registered their objections,
contending that the Dolphin Death Act is unacceptable to the American public,
which wants truly dolphin-safe tuna.<P>

EII, working with the Dolphin Safe/Fair Trade Coalition, is challenging the
Dolphin Death Act on multiple fronts. Campaign strategies include lobbying
members of Congress, placing full-page advertisements in newspapers including
<B>The New York Times</B> and <B>The Washington Times</B>, appealing to grassroots members to
help spread the word, and promoting television PSA's featuring Pierce Brosnan
and Peter Coyote. Over 85 environmental, labor, trade, and animal welfare
organizations have joined EII in opposing the Dolphin Death Act. These groups
include:
<UL>
<LI>the Humane Society of the U.S.
<LI>Sierra Club
<LI>Defenders of Wildlife
<LI>Friends of the Earth
<LI>Public Citizen
<LI>ASPCA
<LI>Fund for Animals
<LI>American Oceans
Campaign
<LI>Community Nutrition Institute
<LI>International Brotherhood of
Teamsters
<LI>and the National Family Farm Coalition.
</UL>

Likewise, a host of celebrities are getting involved. Sixty-two celebrities,
including actor Pierce Brosnan, Academy-Award winners Tom Hanks and Nicolas
Cage, Sean Connery, Sharon Stone, and Director/Producer team Richard Donner and
Lauren Shuler Donner, have asked President Bill Clinton to reverse his
Administration's support for the Dolphin Death Act. In a letter delivered to
Clinton in June, they argue, "Weakening the definition of dolphin-safe tuna is
deadly for dolphins, penalizes the U.S. tuna industry, sets a dangerous
precedent for weakening environmental laws as a result of trade pressure from
Mexico, and is opposed by the U.S. consumers and the public."<P>

A number of scientists who have studied the tuna/dolphin issue have spoken out
against H.R.2823 and S.1420. <A HREF="myrick.html">Dr. Albert Myrick</A>, a specialist on the effects of
stress on dolphins, concluded, "Although these studies have not yet provided
definitive answers concerning the full extent to which dolphins have been and
continue to be affected, their results implicate fishery stress as being
associated with dolphin dental resorption, hypocalcemia, delayed sexual
maturity and reduced pregnancy rates, darkened adrenal cortices and
non-entanglement mortality, and enhanced analgesic behavior in the nets."<P>

<A HREF="payne.html">Dr. Roger Payne</A>, who has studied whales and dolphins around the world as
President of the Whale Conservation Institute, stated, "I feel strongly that
any legislation which fosters or legitimizes the practice of setting nets on
dolphins is wrong ... The new definition [of dolphin-safe tuna] ignores the
effects on dolphins of direct injuries, as well as the physiological effects
from stress of repeated capture."<P>

<A HREF="jhall.html">Dr. John Hall</A>, a marine mammal specialist and fisherman, disputed the claim
that setting nets on schools of dolphins would protect other species, "In order
to reduce bycatch of fish and sea turtles, we need to work to close those areas
of the Gulf of Panama to purse seining during that portion of the year when
small tuna are most prevalent there."<P>

A showdown is expected on the House and Senate floors. Congress adjourns for
the year at the end of September, and the Dolphin Death Act will be dead unless
it passes both houses of Congress before that time. Sens. Boxer, Biden and
Smith have vowed to filibuster S.1420 on the Senate floor, while Reps. Miller
and Studds have vowed to push amendments to H.R.2823 to protect dolphins on the
House floor.<P>

The final word on this attack on dolphin protection and any future threats is,
ultimately, up to the people. Your voice must be heard if dolphins are to live.<P>

<HR><P>

IMMP would like to recognize Pierce Brosnan and Keely Shaye Smith for their
dedication to the Save the Dolphins campaign<P>

<TITLE>Ocean Alert - Summer/Fall 1996: A message from David Phillips</TITLE>

<H1>A message from David Phillips</H1>

<IMG SRC="immp14-2.gif" ALIGN=Left 
VSPACE=10
HSPACE=10>A newspaper reporter recently asked,"Why doesn't Earth Island declare victory
for dolphins and just move on to other issues?"  After all, dolphin mortality
in the Eastern Tropical Pacific has been reduced by more than 96% in the past
six years as a result of the dolphin-safe campaign.  Isn't that enough?<P>

The answer is no.  When we set out ten years ago to confront the senseless
slaughter of dolphins by US and foreign tuna industry, our goal was to end the
use of a method of fishing that has been responsible for more marine mammal
killing than any other technique in history -- worse than all commercial
whaling combined.  Killing dolphins in tuna nets is hardly an "incidental"
occurrence.  Dolphin schools are targeted by helicopters, intentionally chased
to exhaustion by speedboats, corralled by explosives, and encircled in
mile-long nets.<P>

We have made great progress, but the fight for dolphins is more important now
than ever.  Proposed Congressional legislation would unravel the victories and
prompt a massive return to this dangerous fishing method.  Just when consumers
finally have confidence that tuna on our supermarket shelves is caught without
netting dolphins, the "dolphin-safe" label could be rendered meaningless.  Just
when the world's largest tuna companies have abided by strict rules, the
floodgates could be opened to dolphin-lethal tuna again.<P>

We can't let that happen, and we appreciate the help of members like you to
keep pressing Congress and the tuna industry until the oceans are safe for
dolphins.<P>

<TITLE>Ocean Alert - Summer/Fall 1996: International Monitoring Program Highlight</TITLE>

<H1>Monitor Highlight</H1>

Colombia's International Monitoring Program (IMP) Regional Coordinator Ana Maria Escobar  found an avenue for
pursuing her lifelong interest in animal protection after joining whale
scientists Drs. Jorge Reynolds and <A HREF="payne.html">Roger Payne</a> on a study of humpbacks off the
Colombian island of Gorgona in 1990.  This experience and later work with the
World Society for the Protection of Animals led Escobar to pursue a master's
degree for which she developed an environmental education program for the
conservation of dolphins in Colombia.<p>

In 1994, Escobar signed on with Earth Island Institute's International Monitoring Program (IMP)
to monitor the Colombian tuna fishing fleet and processors.<P>

She finds her work
for the IMP "very gratifying" but faces "frustration in knowing that there are
not enough measures to guarantee the safety of marine mammals in the oceans of
the world, where politics and economics play the most important roles." Escobar
acknowledges that the battle to make South America dolphin-safe will be
extremely difficult. However, this is a critical region in terms of the
international tuna trade.<P>

<TITLE>IMMP: Makah Elders Speak Out Against Whale Hunt</TITLE>

<H1>Makah Elders Speak Out Against Whale Hunt</H1>

<H2>Tribe's Eldest Residents Write Public Letter Published In Washington Newspaper.</H2>

In the June 16, Sunday edition of the Peninsula Daily News, several Makah
elders, including the eldest living Makah, spoke out in a one-half page ad
against the Makah Tribal Council's plan to kill five gray whales per year. The
Makah Tribal Council (MTC), the corporate representatives of the Makah Nation,
is petitioning the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for an annual quota
when it meets in Aberdeen, Scotland on June 24. The MTC has stated that it
retains an option to enter into commercial whaling, and may whale regardless of
the IWC decision.<P>

Will Anderson, working in the Advocacy Department of the Progressive Animal
Welfare Society (PAWS), traveled to the Makah village of Neah Bay after
requests by PAWS and several other organizations to meet with MTC officials and
representatives were met with silence for over a year. "After spending time in
Neah Bay, I discovered the whaling proposal is very controversial among the
Makah. When it became obvious that elders were among the opposition, PAWS
offered to coordinate the funding for a newspaper ad that the elders could use
whatever they wished. The words are theirs", stated Anderson.<P>

The nine organizations sponsoring the ad are: Animal Protection Institute,
Animal Welfare Institute, Cetacean Society International, Chicago Animal Rights
Coalition, Friends of Animals, The Humane Society of the US, International
Wildlife Coalition, Progressive Animal Welfare Society, and the Whale and
Dolphin Conservation Society.<P>

A pervious ad, Open Letter to the Makah Nation, requested the Makah to not
fulfill the 1855 Treaty that explains Makah whaling rights. It was signed by
240 organizations from around the world [including Earth Island Institute
International Marine Mammal Project]. The signature list has grown to be in
excess of 300 environmental and animal welfare groups.<P>

<H3>Whale Hunt Issue:</H3>

We are elders of the Makah Indian Nation (Ko-Ditch-ee-ot) which means People of
the Cape. We oppose this Whale hunt our tribe is going to do.<P>

The opposition is directly against our leaders, the Makah Tribal Council,
Tribal Staff, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which is an arm of the United
States Government.<P>

The Makah Indian Nation has been functioning without a quorum; two Councilmen
are off on sick leave for very serious reasons, cancer.<P>

How can any decision be legal when our by-laws state the Treasures shall be
present at every meeting? The Vice Chairman is the other man out.<P>

The Whale hunt issue has never been brought to the people to inform them and
there is no spiritual training going on. We believe they, the Council, will
just shoot the Whale, and we think the word "subsistence" is the wrong thing to
say when our people haven't used or had Whale meat/blubber since the early
1900's.<P>

For these reasons we believe the hunt is only for the money. They can't say
"Traditional, Spiritual and for Subsistence" in the same breath when no
training is going on, just talk.:<P>

Whale watching is an alternative we support.<P>

<TITLE>IMMP: Open Letter to the Makah Nation</TITLE>

<H1>Open Letter to the Makah Nation</H1>

The undersigned groups respectfully appeal to the Makah Nation to refrain from
the resumption of whaling.  People from many cultures worldwide hold whales to
be sacred and consider each species a sovereign nation unto itself, worthy of
respect and protection.  Grey whales migrate vast distances each year and bring
joy to many thousands of whale watchers.  They only briefly pass through Makah
waters.  The resumption of the slaughter of these benign and trusting beings
would bring to your nation swift and ongoing world-wide condemnation.<P>

We submit that important spiritual traditions must be observed in the context
of a planet whose wildlife are being destroyed by habitat reduction, human
overpopulation and exploitation, competition for food, and the proliferation of
toxic chemicals.  As global neighbors also committed to healing our spiritual
connection to the natural world, we appeal to you to work with us to pursue
creative alternatives to your planned whaling, avoiding a conflict that will
have no winners.<P>

Signed by over 300 concerned international organizations, including Earth
Island Institute, the Humane Society of the U.S., Cetacean Society
International, Progressive Animal Welfare Society, and Friends of Animals.

<TITLE>IMMP: Marine Mammal Update, June 1996</TITLE>

<H1>Marine Mammal Update, June 1996</H1>

<H2>Vaquita Porpoise on the Brink of Extinction</H2>

The vaquita, also called the Gulf of California harbor porpoise, is on the
brink of extinction.  These extremely rare cetaceans who live only in a small
area of the Sea of Cortez off Mexico's Baja California are rapidly decreasing
in number due to commercial gill net fishing.  The vaquita is not hunted as a
food source;  it is drowned incidentally in nets set to catch fish, such as the
totoaba, which is also endangered.  Gill nets are particularly deadly,
indiscriminately trapping sea life in mile-long  curtains of tightly-woven
invisible monofilament.  Gill nets have been said to "strip-mine" the ocean.<P>

If gill net fishing forces the vaquita to become extinct, it will be "the first
extinction of a cetacean species and only the second marine mammal to disappear
from the West Coast since the Stellar sea cow (a manatee-like animal) was
hunted to extinction in the 1700s." (<I>Sacramento Bee</I>) In 1993, a
sanctuary was created to protect the vaquita, but biologists assert that the
management plan does not remove gill net fishing from the vaquita's most vital
habitat.  As of 1993, there were only an estimated 225 vaquitas living;  at
least 35 are killed each year in the nets.  The Mexican government must take
immediate steps to save the vaquita from disappearing from the earth forever

<A NAME="Whale"><H2>Whale Hunting Season Begins in Norway</H2>

Norway's much-protested whalers have readied their exploding harpoons for the
start of hunting season on Monday, May 20.  They aim to kill 425 minke whales,
ignoring the International Whaling Commission's worldwide ban on commercial
whaling and almost doubling the kill quota from last year's 232 deaths.<P>

D. James Baker of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and U.S.
commissioner to the whaling commission said the United States "is deeply
opposed to commercial whaling, which has caused drastic declines in a number of
species and driven some stocks to near extinction." A bipartisan group of 23
members of the U.S. Congress has asked for trade sanctions to be  brought
against Norway if this year's expanded hunt proceeds as planned.<P>

<H2>Sea Lions: "Ship 'Em to Sea World," Vice Prez Says</H2>

The effort to save the sea lions at the Ballard Locks continues.  (Please see
IMMP's first report on this issue.)  The Humane Society of the U.S., Earth
Island Institute and the Progressive Animal Welfare Society are suing the
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for authorizing the Washington
Department of Fish & Wildlife to kill sea lions who have allegedly been eating
a declining population of steelhead trout at the Ballard Locks in Seattle.  The
groups contend that this would violate both the Marine Mammal Protection Act
and the National Environmental Policy Act. <P>

Vice President Al Gore recently stepped into the controversy and asked August
Busch, owner of Sea World, to offer to house the sea lions in Sea World's
captive display facility in Orlando, Florida.  Last week, the NMFS captured two
of the sea lions and plans to send them to Sea World as soon as a third animal
is captured.  The groups suing the NMFS are greatly concerned about permanently
removing sea lions from their natural habitat.  In addition, the NMFS has yet
to provide any legal basis for moving the animals to this private captive
facility.<P>

It is simply time to stop scapegoating marine mammals for worldwide fisheries
declines due to human-caused problems-- including poor fisheries management
practices, overfishing, faulty locks construction, and siltation of rivers
caused by clearcutting and other forms of environmental degradation.<P>

May 7, 1996<P>

On behalf of over 3 million members and constituents worldwide and nine
environmental/animal welfare organizations (listed below), comments on the
treatment of free-ranging and captive dolphins in the Bahamas are provided as
follows.  We acknowledge and applaud the efforts of the Bahamian Ministry to
begin the drafting of regulations governing the capture, importation, and
maintenance of captive dolphins in the Bahamas.  However, we are greatly
concerned that the drafting and implementation of these regulations has been
taking so long (over two years).  Moreover, we are greatly disturbed by oral
and written reports which we have recently received regarding the persistence
of deplorable conditions at captive facilities in the Bahamas, particularly
Treasure Island as well as Blue Lagoon.<P>

The movie "Flipper" will be released in the U.S. within a few days, featuring
captive dolphins maintained by Ludwig Meister, owner of Treasure Island and
Blue Lagoon.  A toll-free number will appear at the end of this movie which
will connect callers to the Flipper Foundation.  This Foundation is comprised
of individuals within several of the organizations listed below.  We anticipate
that this foundation will receive thousands of calls from around the world and
receive a tremendous amount of media attention.<P>

It would be preferable for all concerned that our communications with the
public and the media consist of positive reports of responsible government
management and protection of dolphins in the Bahamas.  However, currently we
cannot report that the Bahamian Government has adequately implemented nor
enforced standards necessary for the well-being of captive dolphins in the
Bahamas.  Neither can we report that the Bahamian Government has responded
appropriately to the many serious concerns expressed by both Bahamian and
American professionals who have reported persistent sub-standard conditions for
captive dolphins in the Bahamas.<P>

As you know, the plight of the killer whale "Keiko" used in the movie "Free
Willy" has received an astounding amount of public attention around the world. 
So far, we have already received indications from the press and media that the
dolphins used in the movie "Flipper" will receive similar attention. 
Consequently, the Bahamian Government, responsible for protecting the dolphins
used in the movie "Flipper", will likely also be in the worldwide spotlight.<P>

We ask that you immediately respond to the very serious problems which
currently exist at captive dolphin facilities in the Bahamas.  We also urge you
to immediately implement regulations designed to enhance the lives of
free-ranging and captive dolphins in the Bahamas.  Expedient attention is
required to prevent the unnecessary death and suffering of additional dolphins
owned by these captive facilities.  Your prompt response would enable us to
publicly herald the Bahamian government as a progressive and responsible entity
with regard to the protection of wildlife and natural environments.<P>

We sincerely thank you for your consideration of this issue and for your prompt
response.  As you know, while dolphins may reside within the boundaries of
human-created countries, they are  considered treasures to those around the
world; including, but not limited to, tourists who visit these countries.<P>

Kindly direct responses to Mark Berman at the address listed on this
letterhead. [Earth Island Institute, 300 Broadway Suite 28, San Francisco, CA

<TITLE>IMMP: San Francisco Bay Seal Project</TITLE>

<H1>San Francisco Bay Seal Project</H1>

The harbor seal (<I>Phoca vitulina</I>) is the last resident marine mammal species in San
Francisco Bay, breeding and feeding year-round in its waters. San Francisco Bay is actually not a
bay, but the largest estuary on the West Coast,  an enormous pool in which the waters of the Pacific
Ocean mix with the nutrient-rich fresh waters from California's Central Valley and western Sierra
Nevada mountains. An area of enormous biological productivity, the Bay was once home to harbor
seals, sea otters, and other marine mammals, yet fur hunting in the 1700s and 1800s decimated
local populations.  In this century, shoreline development has further reduced the number of
animals that could survive in the area.  There has been no growth in seal numbers in the Bay since
the first reliable counts were made in the early 1970s, despite a steady increase in harbor seal
population along the California coast after the implementation of the 1972 Marine Mammal
Protection Act. In 1991, there was a severe drop in seal numbers at the primary seal pupping site
in south San Francisco Bay and seal numbers have yet to fully recover in this area.<P>

The San Francisco Bay Seal Project (Seal Project), part of Earth Island Institute's International
Marine Mammal Project, combines biological research with conservation advocacy to protect the
Bay's last resident marine mammal population. In 1989,  the Harbor Seal Project began a
comprehensive study of San Francisco Bay's resident harbor seal population. Project work included
detailed observations at all primary seal haul-out sites. Specifically, the project engaged in
humane sampling of seal blood to determine both levels of toxic pollutants and the seals' general
health, surveyed food preferences by identifying fish bones in seal scat, and used radiotelemetry to
track seal movements, identify seal feeding areas and record haul-out patterns. The results of this
study form the basis for the conservation activities of the San Francisco Bay Seal Project. The Seal
Project's work includes the following:<P>

<UL>

<LI>Regular ground or aerial monitoring of seal activities and numbers at all San Francisco Bay
haul-out sites;<P>

<LI>Protection of existing Bay haul-out sites from development or other human disturbance; public
education on the presence of harbor seals in the Bay and their role in the estuarine ecosystem;
and<P>

<LI>Ongoing collection of data on the level and significance of environmental contaminants found in
the resident seals; dissemination of this information among regulatory agencies and non-profit
groups advocating a reduction in the discharge of environmental contaminants to the Bay.<P>

</UL>

<HR>

<H2>Natural History of Harbor Seals</H2>

<H3>Distribution and Threats</H3>

Harbor seals are found throughout the northern hemisphere in the nearshore waters of the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans. Their need to regularly haul out on land to rest and nurse pups ties them to
coastal feeding areas, which are often contaminated with industrial and municipal pollution. Studies
have indicated a host of harmful effects on the health of harbor seals living in the Waden Sea, north
of the Netherlands.  The Wadden Sea is polluted by Rhine River discharge containing a variety of
toxic contaminants, including PCBs, dioxins, and furans.  The effect of toxic pollution on harbor
seal health is a primary focus of the Seal Project.<P>

<H3>Haul-Out Sites</H3>

Harbor seals use a variety of "haul-out" sites for resting or pupping.  A haul-out site is a shoreline
region where seals congregate, primarily to rest or to nurse their pups. Haul-out sites may be
mudflats, sandflats, rocky outcroppings exposed only at low tide, or marshland covered with
wetland vegetation, but they all share two key characteristics:  isolation from predators or humans
and easy access to water.<P>

If left undisturbed, generation after generation of harbor seals uses the same haul-out site. The
Mowry Slough area, in the extreme southern tip of San Francisco Bay, has been a pupping site for
at least the last 100 years, as far back as records are available. Many other Bay haul-out areas
used in the past have been lost to shoreline development.<P>

Today there are seven primary haul-out or pupping sites along the Bay shoreline. An additional six
sites are used irregularly or by fewer than 10 seals at a time.<P>

<H3>Locomotion</H3>

Harbor seals are very graceful and swift in the water, propelling themselves forward by sweeping
their powerful hind flippers back and forth in a sculling motion. At low speeds, the foreflippers
steer the seal through the water; at high speeds, they are held close to the body, reducing drag.
Harbor seals may dive to depths of 1,500 feet (300 meters) when foraging. They may leap
completely out of the water (porpoising) or hold their upper body above the water for a better look
across the waves (spy-hopping).<P>

On land, harbor seals are quite awkward. While their flippers are the vestigial limbs of ancestral
land mammals, they are of limited use outside of the water. The long bones of terrestrial mammals
limbs are greatly shortened in pinnipeds and retained almost completely inside the seal's body.  The
harbor seal's foreflippers emerge from the body at the equivalent of the human elbow or knee,
preventing the seal from lifting its body off the ground. To move on land, seals lunge their upper
body forward.  Sea lions, by contrast, are much more agile on land, using their longer and more
flexible limbs to raise their bodies off the ground and waddle along the shore.<P>

Harbor seals' cumbersome movements on land contribute to their extreme sensitivity to
disturbance by impeding their escape from predators and humans. When humans or other threats
are sighted, the seals quickly respond by flushing into the safety of the water. Hauling out in herds
provides them greater protection since one individual can warn the entire group of danger.<P>

<H3>Movements</H3>

Unlike many other pinnipeds*, harbor seals do not migrate with the seasons.  Their numbers
appear to increase during the spring breeding season and summer molt when seals haul out more
frequently and for longer periods of time, increasing the land count. Seasonal movement between
preferred haul-out sites has been observed, with protected bays and estuaries used more for
pupping than are other areas. As the largest estuary on the West Coast, San Francisco Bay has the
resources to support a year-round resident population which lives, feeds and pups within the Bay's
waters.<P>

Harbor seals are aptly named, given their requirement to regularly seek a "harbor" in order to
haul out on land. In general, seals take advantage of the warmer daylight hours to come ashore. The
relatively warm air temperatures on land allow increased blood flow to the skin, speeding healing
of cuts and wounds, and nourishing hair growth during the seals' annual summer molt.<P>

[*There are three orders of marine mammals: cetaceans (whales and dolphins), pinnipeds (from
the Greek meaning "feather foot") including seals, sea lions and walruses, and sirenians (manatees
and the now-extinct sea-cows). Sea otters belong to the order Carnivora.]

<H3>Feeding and Predation</H3>

Harbor seals are primarily bottom feeders, eating a variety of fish and mollusks that live near the
ocean floor. Food preferences may vary among regions because they depend on what fish and
invertebrates are available and the foraging preferences of the seals' competitors. The study found
that the seals in San Francisco Bay feed primarily on plainfin midshipmen, yellowfin goby, white
croaker, Pacific staghorn sculpin and northern anchovy.<P>

Just as seals eat fish and squid in order to grow and raise their young, seals themselves are food to
other animals. Along the California coast, great white sharks feed on harbor seals and other
pinnipeds. In more northern areas, orcas rival the sharks as primary harbor seal predators.<P>

<H3>Breeding</H3>

In San Francisco Bay and along the central California coast, harbor seals pup from mid-March
through May. Females usually give birth to a single pup which they nurse for three to five weeks.
Nursing is only possible when the seals are hauled out on land. Lactation ends roughly one month
after birth.  The month-old pup must begin to catch fish and other prey on its own, guided only by
previous observations of its mother's foraging behavior.  The seal pup must live off blubber
reserves during this learning period. The nursing period, during which pups gain almost a pound a
day, is therefore crucial. Disturbance by humans or wild predators can disrupt feeding, thereby
reducing the milk intake and subsequent weight gain of the pup, ultimately threatening the pup's
chances of survival after weaning.<P>

Pups are able to swim within minutes after birth. They follow their mothers into the water when
the rising tide floods haul-out sites or when the females feed. Mothers are often spotted carrying
pups on their backs between foraging dives.  When their mothers dive, the pups generally remain
on the surface of the water.<P>

Harbor seal mothers are not adapted to defend their offspring from land-based dangers.  When
threatened, they flush into the safety of the water, sometimes leaving the slower pups onshore. The
females remain in the water watching the stranded pups until the danger passes. Females may also
leave defenseless pups onshore during brief feeding trips to nearby waters. Humans often mistake
solitary pups for abandonees because they do not understand that the mothers will return.
Interference in these situations can cause more harm than good. Never approach a pup or remove it
from a beach unless professionals have confirmed the pup is abandoned.  If you suspect a seal is
injured or abandoned in northern California, please call The Marine Mammal Center at (415)
289-7325.)<P>

Females breed immediately after their pups are weaned. Through delayed implantation of the
embryo, the fetus does not begin to develop for several months, ensuring that birth occurs during
the regular pupping season. Females mature and begin to breed successfully at 4-5 years of age,
males at 6-7 years.  Harbor seal lifespan ranges from 20 to 30 years in the wild.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Environmental Risk Factors</H2>

<H3>Environmental Contaminants</H3>

Harmful levels of certain toxic pollutants have been found in San Francisco Bay harbor seals.
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), industrial organic chemicals with a variety of uses, most
notably as insulators in electrical transformers, were found at extremely high levels in San
Francisco Bay harbor seals. The levels of PCBs found in the blood of resident seals actually exceed
those found in the highly contaminated seal population living along the north coast of Europe. Seals
from that area suffer reduced reproductive rates attributable to PCBs and related toxic organic
contaminants. Recent studies have also shown the same compounds responsible for damage to the
seals' immune systems. This chemical-induced suppression of the seals' ability to fight off disease
and infection has been implicated in the great seal epidemic that devastated the seal population in
the Wadden Sea and parts of the North Sea along the north coast of Europe in 1988, killing over
18,000 harbor seals.<P>

The research study also examined blood concentrations of selenium and toxic heavy metals in
addition to its analysis of organochlorine contaminants.  Selenium and mercury were found at
potentially harmful levels in San Francisco Bay harbor seals.<P>

<H3>Insulation and Oil Spills</H3> Harbor seal fur is not useful in insulating the harbor seal from
cold ocean waters. Though the fur is thick, it lacks the soft underfur which traps an insulating
layer of air next to the skin of sea otters and fur seals. Instead, harbor seals retain their body heat
with a thick layer of blubber and restricted blood flow to the skin and flippers. The insulating
blubber renders harbor seals less prone to hypothermia should oil coat their fur, but, like all
mammals, they are susceptible to the toxic effects of ingesting oil while feeding. Pups nursing from
oil-coated mothers are subject to amplified risk due to ingestion of oil on the mother's body.  Seals
also suffer the toxic effects of oil spills by inhaling the fumes from slicks.<P>

<H3>Redcoats</H3> Up to 40%of San Francisco Bay's resident seals develop red-colored fur on
their head, shoulders or entire body. Many of these "redcoat" seals, often those with the deepest red
color, develop abnormally short vibrissae (whiskers). Vibrissae are sensory organs used in
feeding; they guide seals to food by detecting the the waves created by passing fish. In studies of
captive seals, shortened vibrissae made it harder for seals to catch fish.  The potential link between
the redcoat phenomenon and environmental contaminants is currently under study.<P>

<TITLE>IMMP: Plan...to rescue, rehab.,release whale from "Free Willy"</TITLE>

<H1>Plan Launched to Rescue, Rehabilitate and Release Whale from "Free
Willy"</H1> 

INTERNATIONAL MARINE MAMMAL PROJECT<P>

<I>The Winter/Spring 1995 Ocean Alert (formerly the Dolphin Alert) is
an Earth Island Institute publication.</I><P>

<IMG SRC="immp2.gif"><P><I>Keiko, the orca which starred in the
1993 hit film, <B>Free Willy</B>, leaps in the air.<P></I>

MONDAY FEBRUARY  6,  1995, San Francisco, CA. Keiko, the orca whale who
starred in the Warner Bros. hit movie Free Willy, is finally on his way
toward a new home and eventual release back to the ocean.<P>

Today, at a press conference in Mexico City, David Phillips, Director
of the newly formed Free Willy Foundation announced final agreement
with the Mexico City theme park Reino Aventura under which Keiko will
be donated to the Foundation. Work will now begin on a state-of-the-art
two million gallon deep water pool at the Oregon Coast Aquarium in
Newport, Oregon.<P>

Phillips called the plan: "one of the most ambitious efforts ever
undertaken for any endangered species." He continued: "This is going to
be a great step for Keiko and for the rescue and rehabilitation of many
other dolphins and whales."<P>

Phillips continued: "We are out to break new ground for the whales and
dolphins of the world. Never before has a captive orca been
rehabilitated and returned to the wild. Keiko will be the only captive
orca whale that doesn't have to do shows or perform. Never before has
there been a dedicated deep-water pool solely for the rescue and
rehabilitation of dolphins and whales."<P>

Keiko, about 16 years old, was originally captured in Icelandic waters
when he was about two years old. He has lived in Mexico City since 1985
in a pool that is too small for his needs and in water that is often
too warm. Keiko also suffers from a viral skin condition which needs
treatment.<P>

Earth Island Institute, which established the Free Willy Foundation,
has been involved in marine mammal conservation for more than a decade
and has worked for more than a year to design a plan to help Keiko. The
Foundation's mission is to relocate , rehabilitate, and potential
release Keiko to the wild, and to operate the new facility as a center
for the rescue and rehabilitation of other dolphins and whales.<P>

The foundation received an initial donation of $2 million from Warner
Bros. and New Regency Productions (producers of "Free Willy"), and has
since received a matching $2 million grant from a anonymous donor. The
foundation has also begun a major fundraising campaign to raise the $10
million necessary to design and build the facility, relocate, treat and
release Keiko, and operate the center for rescue and rehabilitation of
whales.<P>

Phillips stated: "Ever since the movie "Free Willy" came out millions
of people have pressed for a plan to help Keiko. Finally, that is going
to happen."<P>

<TITLE>IMMP: Mitsubishi Action Alert</TITLE>



<H2>Mitsubishi Project to Sacrifice Gray Whales for Profits.

What's ours could be a MINE !</H2>



The Eastern Pacific gray whale holds great significance in the 

fight for endangered species preservation as a symbol of success.  

Once hunted to near extinction by commercial whalers, gray whale 

populations are only now regenerating to their original numbers.  

This recovery is a result of five decades of protective 

stewardship and joint cooperation by US, Mexican and Canadian 

groups and individuals.  While many people on the pacific coast 

refer to this species as the "California" gray, these migratory 

whales are in fact born in the Mexican lagoons of the Baja 

Peninsula.  It is here where the gray whale species is again 

threatened with potential extinction in a plan to destroy the most 

fertile of its' habitats.<P>



Mitsubishi Corporation and Mexican government owned Exportadora de 

Sal (ES), a salt export company of which Mitsubishi owns 49%, are 

threatening to expand salt mining operations in the <A HREF="mmpvezds.html">

Vezcaino Desert Reserve</A>, part of the UN's Biosphere Reserve 

Program.  Specifically this project would be ecologically 

devastating to the <A HREF="mmpsilag.html">San Ignacio Lagoon area</A>, the most pristine of 

four bays where migrating gray whales spend their winter months.  

<P>        



The Mitsubishi/ES project would directly sacrifice 21,000 acres of 

protected land surrounding the lagoon for an industrial complex.  

Plans call for the building of a mile long pier, located 12 miles 

from mouth of the lagoon, to facilitate a rotating flotilla of 

ocean going ships.  Damage to this pier from winter storms and 

summer hurricanes could necessitate the dredging of the lagoon 

itself in order to accommodate ship traffic.  Operation of the 

saltworks will demand the nonstop pumping of sea water from the 

lagoon at the rate of 6,600 gallons per second, adversely lowering 

the lagoon's temperature and salinity.  The surrounding network of 

roads needed to service the saltworks would, by the company's own 

admission, have a permanent physical impact on 86,000 acres of the 

Reserve.<P>

  

<H2>Temporary Stay of Execution</H2>



The National Ecology Institute of Mexico recently halted this 

project by rejecting the EIA submitted by ES.  The rejection cited 

the saltworks' incompatibility with the biosphere reserve and its 

proximity to the lagoon.  This temporary victory is largely a 

result of pressure from the Mexican environmental organization 

Grupo de los Cien (Group of 100).  Juan Ignacio Bremer, director 

of ES and coincidentally Mexico's Secretary of Commerce, has filed 

an appeal with the Mexican government regarding this decision.  

This issue will be heavily influenced, if not decided, by 

international public opinion.  We must take action!  This issue is 

crucial for gray whale protection as well as a critical test for 

the working partnership between the Mexican and US environmental 

communities.  The decision making powers in Mexico need to hear 

from you.  Don't let your silence send a counterproductive message! 

<P>

<TITLE>IMMP responds to Norwegian whaling claims</TITLE>

<H1>IMMP responds to Norwegian whaling claims</H1>



Because of the international pressures being put on Norway to end

it's yearly minke hunts, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 

has produced a pamphlet (Some Questions About Norwegian Minke 

Whaling) in which they make a number of claims to 

try and support the hunts:

<P>

<OL>

<LI>Norway claims that the Scientific Committee of the 

International Whaling Commission (IWC) has unanimously concluded 

that this stock (the minke whale) almost certainly numbers 

between 61,000 and 117,000 animals with the best available 

estimate being 87,000 animals.

<P>

IMMP notes that, not only have environmental groups questioned 

these figures, but members of the IWC have also questioned the 

figures.  The environmental community, and some IWC members, 

question the Norwegian whale population estimates because all 

research and calculations were done by Norwegian officials 

without any review from outside scientists.

<P>

<LI>Until recently, Norway has consistenly used the 87,000 number 

to justify its hunts.  They claimed that because of the figures 

it was clear that the stock was large enough to support a limited 

harvest.

<P>



IMMP reports, however, that startling new evidence has surfaced that Norway's

whale population estimates have, in fact, been grossly exaggerated and that its

formulas for calculating populations contain numerous errors.  A special

meeting of the IWC's Scientific Committee recently examined the data, and even

Norway's own scientists have been forced to admit the errors.  In April, the

Norwegian government reduced its estimate of the minke whale population by more

than 20 percent to 69,600.  Further review may show that even this estimate is

far too high.  Also, because of this revision, the Fisheries Ministry has

reduced this year's whale kill quota from 301 to 232 whales. In fact, only

30,000 whales may exist which would grant a <B>zero quota</B>.



<P>

<LI>Norway claims that it's whaling is carried out in accordance 

with the the international agreements that are relevent to 

whaling.  These are the Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 

International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which 

sets the framework for the activities of the IWC.  They go on to 

say that Norway plays a leading role in binding international 

cooperation on environmental protection and resource management.

<P>

IMMP points out, however, that they are in fact directly 

contradicting this claim as there has been, and still exists, a 

global moratorium on whaling.  Since the Norwegian government has 

allowed whale hunts for the past two years, they have in fact 

been violating an international environmental agreement.  Also, 

now that Norway has defied the international community on this 

issue, they have let the proverbial genie out of the bottle.  

Norwegian whalers now say that unless they recieve full financial 

compensation of $8,500 (1,565 kroner) per whale for the reduction 

in the planned quota, they will kill all 301 whales, in defiance 

of both the IWC ban and the Norwegian government limits.

<P>

<LI>Finally, Norway claims that the most important argument in 

favour of whaling is the principle that states have a right to 

utilize their renewable natural resources on a scientific basis.

<P>

Nations have a right to determine their own affairs, but not in 

violation of international treaties that they have signed on to.  

If Norway is permitted to violate the commercial whaling ban and 

base their catch on inaccurate whale population data, there will 

be little to prevent Japan, Iceland, and a host of other countries 

from doing the same.  This precedent could cause the entire IWC 

moratorium to crumble.  It would also set a dangerous precedent 

globally if countries are allowed to back out of environmental 

treaties and agreements if they just don't feel like honoring them 

anymore.

<TITLE>IMMP: Sea Lions To Be Slaughtered In Washington State</TITLE>

<H1>Sea Lions To Be Slaughtered In Washington State</H1>

California sea lions may be killed at the Ballard Locks in Seattle, Washington because of a misguided effort to save steelhead trout.
The majority of a task force recently voted to recommend the killing of sea lions. However, almost half of the Task Force members (including wildlife biologists, ecologist, and environmentalists) voted against the proposed kill. This could represent the first slaughter of marine mammals in US waters in over 20 years.<P>


Killing sea lions will not solve the problem. On the contrary, there is evidence that removal of sea lions will not be effective in saving the steelhead because other sea lions will take the place of the slaughtered animals. Other options to save the steelhead are much more likely to work in the short and long term.  Further, they could also save other declining fish populations in Lake Washington.<P>


Further, sea lion predation is neither the primary nor principal cause of the steelhead deadline. According to a 1993 government report (GAO), dams are considered to be the primary factors in the decline of the currently protected salmon runs. Further, Fraker (1994) stated "while marine mammal predation may be important locally, such as at the Chittenden locks, it does not appear to be great enough to explain the general decline". Coho, chinook, and sockeye populations are also crashing in Lake Washington, but sea lions are not considered responsible because they do not even typically eat these species at the locks. Government studies indicate that there are many areas in which sea lion and salmonid populations co-exist successfully: and they have done so for millennia. <p>

The decline of our fish populations is due to problems with people, not marine mammals. If we continue to avoid addressing the real cause of the decline, there is little reason to believe that our streams, oceans: or fishing industries will ever recover and a national treasure, the California Sea Lion, will have been slaughtered in vain.

<H2>What you Can Do:</H2>

<TITLE>Bluewater Network: Marine Ecosystems As Garbage Dumps</TITLE>

<H1>Marine Ecosystems As Garbage Dumps</H1>

For decades, the world's marine ecosystems have been used as the garbage dumps
for much of the world's human, military, and industrial waste. Billions of
pounds of toxic wastes and other pollutants are deposited into the world's
waterways every single year. The consequences are contaminated seafood, unsafe
drinking water, large-scale fish and mammal die-offs, beach closings, and other
health hazards. The effects of such flagrant pollution practices are
illuminated by the following facts:

<UL>

<LI>According to the EPA's 1994 Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress, 40%
of the nation's waterways are not fishable or swimmable by standards outlined
in the US Clean Water Act.<P>

<LI>A record 3,500 beach warnings or closings occurred in 1995 in the US due to
toxic and bacterial pollution levels in excess of acceptable national
standards.<P>

<LI>According to the FDA, up to 60,000 Americans are poisoned by contaminated
fish annually. Due to the alarming increases in such poisonings, the FDA has
proposed a testing and sampling process of fish similar to that of other
foods.<P>

<LI>Worldwide, dangerous pollution levels are anecdotally confirmed by sharply
increasing numbers of fish and mammal die-offs, including thousands of dolphins
and whales found with such high toxin levels that their carcasses have had to
be disposed of at hazardous waste dump sites. The causes of such die-offs are
generally attributed to impaired fish and mammal immune responses due to high
toxic exposures.<P>

<LI>One-third of US shellfish beds are closed or restricted as a consequence of
water pollution. Accordingly, the jobs of 1.5 million US fishers are
imperiled.<P>

<LI>A global epidemic of deadly red tides has killed millions of fish and
marine mammals in single episodes. Such events have occurred off all the
world's continents and are believed by scientists to be caused by the effects
of pollution.

<TITLE>Bluewater Network: The Two-stroke Motor</TITLE>

<H2>The Two-stroke Motor</H2>

There are thirteen-million two-stroke outboard motors in the US. There are no
plans by either government or the marine industry to institute scrappage
programs of these high emission engines. As a consequence, they will continue
to pollute for up to fifty years.<P>

US and worldwide growth in craft is at very high levels. In the US, there are
16.7 million recreational boats - one boat for every fifteen people. Currently,
there are approximately 33 million recreational craft worldwide, and
significantly more if commercial craft are included. New sales of the highly
polluting, "dirty" outboard motors and PWC's are close to one-million units a
year.<P>

The market penetration of two-strokes into Third World countries, such as
India, is increasing exponentially. As the speed of traditional village fishing
craft increases, the economic lives of these craft have fallen by 75%, water
<A HREF="pollute.html">pollution</A> has increased considerably, and forest resources have come under
massive pressures to meet the demands for more new boats. Globally, Bluewater
believes that up to 20 million traditional fishers are being targeted for sales
by <A HREF="industry.html">outboard manufacturers</A>.<P>


<H2>Two-stroke Damage</H2>

There are numerous studies corroborating the potentially frightening damages
that are wrought by pollution of the water's surface layer, where two-stroke
emissions residues reside. For example, in Washington State, Hardy, et al. find
up to 63 percent of fish embryos exposed to Puget Sound waters experienced
chromosomal abnormalities as a result of surface layer (microlayer) pollution.
Smith and Cameron note high deformations and mortalities for herring larvae
exposed to even 0.3 ppm of crude oil, and Widdows et al. note that only 0.03
ppm of oil contamination reduces food absorption, stunts growth, and kills
certain species. Bluewater believes that such
hydrocarbon levels exist on the surface microlayer of some US and foreign
waterways as a result of the high usage rates of two-stroke motors.

<TITLE>Bluewater Network: The Marine Motor Industry</TITLE>

<H2>The Marine Motor Industry</H2>

The marine motor industry is characterized by over 140 manufacturers around the
globe, most of which are engaged in the design and construction of inboard or
sterndrive motors. Inboard/sterndrive motors pollute magnitudes of order less
than their malignant counterparts, the modern two-stroke outboard or personal
watercraft engines  (PWC) colloquially known as jet skis. There are fourteen
major manufacturers of two-strokes. They are:

<UL>

<LI>Yamaha

<LI>OMC (Johnson, Evinrude)

<LI>Mercury (Mercury, Force)

<LI>Nissan

<LI>Suzuki

<LI>Tohatsu

<LI>Selva, the Italian manufacturer

<LI>A.H. Young Industries, the Korean manufacturer (Swallow, Maxxon)

<LI>Bombardier, Kawasaki, Polaris, Wetjet, Aquajet, and Arctco. These six are
PWC manufacturers.<P>

</UL>

Over the past several years, the EPA has negotiated with the manufacturers to
clean up the emission levels of the motors they produce. The final rulemaking
has been highly favorable to industry. While industry has anticipated a
potential ban on the sale of two-strokes for years, the new regulations only
require 75 percent improved hydrocarbon emissions characteristics for new
motors, phased-in by the year 2006; and a system of averaging, banking, and
trading of emission credits among manufacturers. This will permit certain
manufacturers who choose not to meet the new motor emissions regulations for
their new motors the lawful right to purchase credits from those who exceed the
EPA standards - for example, a PWC manufacturer such as Bombardier may choose
to continue their sales of "dirty" two-strokes and buy their emissions credits
from Honda.<P>

While the manufacturers are heralding the new rules as a vast improvement, SAIL
magazine claims they are breathing a collective sigh of relief that the EPA has
been so lenient. Some industry insiders believe that it is economically and
technically feasible to reduce two-stroke emissions by an absolute, unaveraged
standard of 95% instead of an averaged 75% - as Honda has already done by
shifting designs to four-stroke technology - but this is a solution which the
manufacturers strongly resisted in their negotiations with the EPA. Moreover,
Bluewater believes the industry is capable of shifting its entire production
line to the new technologies well before the year 2006 - without undue economic
hardship. Industry claims that such a rapid shift would reduce profits and
cause business failure, a controversial claim.<P>

In reality, the new regulations will only slow the damages from total
hydrocarbon emissions. For instance, one manufacturer may be able to purchase
emission credits indefinitely at lower cost than that entailed by retooling
their manufacturing operations. Others may find niche markets for the "dirty"
motors such as low-income buyers, who cannot afford a 15% higher cost for the
new, cleaner motors - despite the fact that tremendous fuel savings from
cleaner motors offset the higher purchase costs based on average usage. Other
manufacturers may elect to keep a portion of their PWC product lines as "dirty"
two-strokes due to mild performance advantages to the consumer (higher speeds,
lighter weights). Furthermore, the new averaging, banking, and trading
regulations effectively substitute one form of pollution for another, rather
than creating absolute emission standards, as some believe is required
according to the terms of the Clean Air Act.<P>

Anticipated new two-stroke sales over the next ten years are over ten million
units, representing many billions of gallons of hydrocarbon content. Such sales
growth will add tremendously to the pollution content of the world's waterways
and coastal areas.

<TITLE>Beyond the 'Scenic By-Ways'</TITLE>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Beyond the 'Scenic By-Ways'</H2><P>


The Southern Rockies, world-renowned for their scenic beauty and outstanding recreational opportunities, are in trouble.  Decades of impact from resource extraction such as logging, road-building, mining and grazing, has left a legacy of damage that poses serious threats to the region's ability to sustain wildlife and wild habitat.  While some pristine pockets of untouched wilderness remain, the fact is that just over the ridge from that spectacular view are clearcuts, badly-eroding roads, polluted streams and trampled vegetation.  The intact pieces that are left are insufficient to sustain the biological integrity of the region.  While the damage is extensive,  much of it can and must be healed if we are to prevent further deterioration of habitat quality, and the decline of numerous species of animal and plant life.

<P>


 Comprehensive watershed management offers the best chance of protecting, restoring and enhancing the region's watershed resources .  All concerned and affected parties must be brought together in a coordinated effort to develop and apply a long-term, sustainable strategy for watershed management which will address the problems of environmental degradation, habitat fragmentation, loss of biodiversity, declining local economies and quality of life.
<P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Healing the Damage</H2><P>

Restoring damaged ecosystems requires the coordinated efforts of a diverse group of people.  Local community members must team up with indiginous leaders, scientific experts and environmental activists to determine the needs of the land, and the most appropriate method of healing the damage.  The Southern Rockies Restoration Project is working to establish Watershed Councils in each of the regions watersheds, and to give them the tools necessary to plan and carry out effective restoration projects.<P>

<H1>Belonging to a Place</H1>

<P>by Joe Lamb, co-director of the Borneo Big Home Project</P>

<P>
  As we gather here today in Berkeley to celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day, 1994
events are occurring in Borneo which Native Americans will find chillingly
familiar. Borneo is the third largest island in the world. It is located in the
South Pacific between the Philippines and Indonesia. It is home to the world's
oldest rainforest and to many indigenous cultures which have tended that forest
for generations, living in what a native leader described as primitive
affluence. The native peoples of Borneo have rich and highly evolved cultures.
However, in the last twenty years, the history which Native Americans endured is
being repeated.</P>

<P>
 The indigenous people of Borneo are the rightful owners of one of the world's
greatest resources, a gigantic and unbelievably diverse rainforest. Recent
research into pharmaceuticals indicates that our future medicines exist
undiscovered in the genetic storehouse of rainforest plants. It is likely that
rainforests are also the repository of yet undeveloped food crops which may be
vital to future generations. What would disease resistant strains of rice be
worth to the planet? What would be the value of treatments for cancer and AIDS?</P>

<P>
 Unfortunately, their land is being plundered. The goose is being slaughtered to
get the single golden egg. What happened to Native Americans is being repeated;
an ecosystem of tremendous spiritual and economic significance is being stolen
and squandered. The rainforest is being clear cut and sold for megabucks and
almost none of the that money is benefiting the native peoples. It happened
(continues to happen) throughout North America: natural resources taken from
native peoples against their will and to their detriment. When your way of life,
your source of food, commerce, community and spirituality are tied to the
natural environment, it is not only an act of theft, but an assault on freedom
of religion, an assault on the right to one's own beliefs. When the buffalo were
destroyed, it was not just an act of economic oppression but an act against
freedom of religion.</P>

 Consider the words of Mutang Urud, a Kalabit tribesman from the interior of
Borneo:

<P>&quot;I say to my country and other developing countries, that
in our race to modernize we must respect the ancient cultures and traditions of
our peoples. We must not blindly follow that model of progress invented by
European wealth; but we must not forget that this wealth was bought at a very
high price. The rich world suffers from so much stress, pollution, violence,
poverty, and spiritual emptiness. The wealth of the indigenous communities lies
not in money or commodities, but in community, tradition, and a sense of
belonging to a special place.&quot;</P>
