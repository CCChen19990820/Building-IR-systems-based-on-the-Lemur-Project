Posted by Tyler on December 11, 1996 at 13:42:56:<p>
I would like to open a dialogue with anyone who is interested in defining what life is.  The knee-jerk response might be that the object in question must have consciousness, perception, and be able to copy itself.  Lately I’ve been cogitating over the idea that these parameters are too narrow.  We are biological forms issuing these parameters which, by the way are (of course) biological in nature.  Can we be so presumptuous?  It seems as though we are behaving as something that sets standards based upon itself.<p>As I mentioned in a previous posting, perhaps we ought to consider expanding the definition to include those things that evolve or change, and are cyclic.  Is it possible then that atoms be considered in the list, as they exist only as energy crystallizes (an evolvement).  Quantum Theory has a lot to say about indeterminacy at this level as well.  Niels Bohr and the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics show that particles seem to “know” where they ought to be if a measurement is made on its partner.<br>	What of the atmosphere.. surely it undergoes the seemingly timeless transformations of itself.  The planet?  It is clear that there is evolvement through geologic processes.  It even “speaks” via the sound of its wounds (‘quakes and volcanic activity) and its magnetosphere... ever see an aurora?  Heck, stars undergo, on a more massive scale, these same things.  I might even argue that the Universe is to be considered life, as there is continuous interchange between matter and energy as outlined in Special Relativity.<br>Consider this idea... I want to know your thoughts either way!

: I would like to open a dialogue with anyone who is interested in defining what life is.  The knee-jerk response might be that the object in question must have consciousness, perception, and be able to copy itself.  Lately I’ve been cogitating over the idea that these parameters are too narrow.  We are biological forms issuing these parameters which, by the way are (of course) biological in nature.  Can we be so presumptuous?  It seems as though we are behaving as something that sets standards based upon itself.

: As I mentioned in a previous posting, perhaps we ought to consider expanding the definition to include those things that evolve or change, and are cyclic.  Is it possible then that atoms be considered in the list, as they exist only as energy crystallizes (an evolvement).  Quantum Theory has a lot to say about indeterminacy at this level as well.  Niels Bohr and the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics show that particles seem to “know” where they ought to be if a measurement is made on its partner.
: 	What of the atmosphere.. surely it undergoes the seemingly timeless transformations of itself.  The planet?  It is clear that there is evolvement through geologic processes.  It even “speaks” via the sound of its wounds (‘quakes and volcanic activity) and its magnetosphere... ever see an aurora?  Heck, stars undergo, on a more massive scale, these same things.  I might even argue that the Universe is to be considered life, as there is continuous interchange between matter and energy as outlined in Special Relativity.
: Consider this idea... I want to know your thoughts either way!

: : Dear Tyler,

: : Of all the titles given to God, &quot;kitchen imp&quot; is a new one on me.  What the heck does that mean? (seriously, I'd like to know)  As a believer in the &quot;kitchen imp&quot;, I just wanted to say you are far more than a pathetically simple organism.  You are His most spectacular and most loved creation. 
: 	Well Lynn, I guess what I mean by my label is that far too many of the Christians that I’ve met claim to know what He is, wants, and has in store.  He is often used as justification, as well as a pragmatists tool.  In this way, many people misuse and/or misunderstand the concept and He is reduced to a household ornament without REAL meaning (perhaps imp was the incorrect term).
: 	I find it interesting that some think that we, being the limited beings that we are, can ever hope to understand, or even conceptualize what is purported to be permanent, infinite, absolutely abstract, uniquely and singularly everything yet abstruse.  
: 	I cannot consider myself any more unique or important in the universe than, say, a star or atom... each is sufficiently complex.  I also do not think it wise to limit the definition of life to biological terms.  Stars have a defined life cycle, atoms combine to form progeny with different properties than their own, and Mozart’s music lives and breathes even as he does not.  Interesting thing... humans defining life so arbitrarily as to use the criteria that fit us.  Philosophers call it a tautology- it is a tomato because it is!

Lars' seems to apply to the use of such logic in law which is probably what you were looking for. I don't know enough about logic (yet) to answer this - I've been battling with syllogisms for far too long. It's possible I suppose that the same term is used for two separate definitions or that Albrecht may not be correct when using "double standard" and "special pleading" synonomously. After reading Lars' posting it does seem to me that his definition fits the term more appropriately so I'd put your money on that. If I find any other info along my travels I shall let you know.

: : : &quot;The double standard fallacy operates by changing the descriptive system used from one case to another in order to invoke two different sets of values or judgements and to get the hearer to respond differently in two similar situations. A typical example concerns the corporate executive who lectures to the Rotary Club luncheon on one day about the evils of government intervention in free enterprise. The next day he vigorously lobbies for governement legislation to protect his products from &quot;unfair&quot; competition by foreign manufacturers, conveniently sidestepping the fact that American consumers will pay more for his products than for the foreign-made ones if the government grants his demands. What is sauce for the goose is definitely not sauce for the gander in the fallacy of the double standard, also known to logicians as the fallacy of special pleading. 
: : : A story concerning a small town preacher illustrates how the double standard attitude can backfire. He harangued the congregation with &quot;...and I say to you, if any man in this room has committed adultery, his tongue shall cleave to the woof of his mowf!&quot;
: : : Man, that's funny! 

: : Thanks. I understand the definition you gave but this is somewhat different
: : than the example Lars gave. Maybe logicians have other definitions for special
: : pleading. In Lars's example, special pleading is an appeal to emotion. In your
: : example, special pleading is when a person makes inconsistent or contradictory
: : claims. Is there some connection between the two definitions that I'm not
: : grasping?
: : - Jason

: I see your point. It appears that each definiton applies to a different situation. Lars' seems to apply to the use of such logic in law which is probably what you were looking for. I don't know enough about logic (yet) to answer this - I've been battling with syllogisms for far too long. It's possible I suppose that the same term is used for two separate definitions or that Albrecht may not be correct when using &quot;double standard&quot; and &quot;special pleading&quot; synonomously. After reading Lars' posting it does seem to me that his definition fits the term more appropriately so I'd put your money on that. If I find any other info along my travels I shall let you know.

Yet another subject I'm not "up" on.... I've been reading a dated book which mentions that our closest ancestor in the "Homo Sapiens" department is the Cro-Magnon Man and he was the fella responsible for the great cave art in France and surrouding areas. It also goes on to tell that in the "Homo" category but not "sapiens" there lies the Neanderthal Man and Heidelberg Man and it is obvious from common structures that we are related but the fossil evidence is not there and so that's where the "missing link" comes into the picture in this case. I thought I had read however in a more recent article that either the Cro-Magnon was no longer thought to be included in the "sapiens" species or that the Neanderthal was. According to this book Neanderthal came before Cro-Magnon but I also thought I remembered reading they are now though to have existed at the same time.

: Yet another subject I'm not &quot;up&quot; on.... I've been reading a dated book which mentions that our closest ancestor in the &quot;Homo Sapiens&quot; department is the Cro-Magnon Man and he was the fella responsible for the great cave art in France and surrouding areas. It also goes on to tell that in the &quot;Homo&quot; category but not &quot;sapiens&quot; there lies the Neanderthal Man and Heidelberg Man and it is obvious from common structures that we are related but the fossil evidence is not there and so that's where the &quot;missing link&quot; comes into the picture in this case. I thought I had read however in a more recent article that either the Cro-Magnon was no longer thought to be included in the &quot;sapiens&quot; species or that the Neanderthal was. According to this book Neanderthal came before Cro-Magnon but I also thought I remembered reading they are now though to have existed at the same time. I'm aware that the lines of descent aren't as straight or stop and go as what was once believed and that even in our existing species there are memebers who have &quot;odd&quot; ancestoral relics that the general population doesn't have but still I'm not up on the latest findings so thought someone here might clear the matter up for me. Also, does anyone know which of our closest ancestors was around during the dinosaur age - 60 million years ago I believe?

I don't think most of those Americans could tell you much about the God<br>they profess to believe in.

It would seem gloomy not to believe in good luck, so I<br>think most people would tell you they do.  But they aren't going to rely<br>on luck for any of their day to day needs.  The same holds true for<br>many "believers" in God.<p>We do, however, have a large minority of fundamentalist Christians,<br>especially in our Southern and Southwestern states, who do in fact<br>attend church, educate their children to believe in the Christian<br>God, and observe the tenets of their faith in a rigorous and<br>unbending manner.  My thought is that for some of them, their faith <br>is part and parcel of their American identity.  Historically, Christianity <br>in the States was a political force of democratization, not an oppressive <br>fist used by the nobility to enforce obedience among the rabble (as <br>somteimes was the case in Europe, I hear).  We have always had an <br>ideal of the clean-living, hard-working, Christian family.<p>Finally, as for those persons in America who have faith in the Christian<br>God, and believe they have some sort of personal contact or relationship <br>with that God, I guess we're just hard to explain.

Something that has always bothered me about a lot of subjects on the paranormal and on UFOs in particular is that there always this notion of a "government conspiracy".  It has been mentioned so many times over the years people seem to accept it as fact.  My question as a sceptic (a British skeptic) is what has a government got to gain by covering up the existence of UFOs (and by UFO I mean extra-terrestial, not just unidentified)?<p>It seems to me that, on the contrary, whenever anything remotely "alien" comes about governments try bring it to people's attention (face on Mars, Mars meteorite etc.) presumably for the PR value for their research programs.  Has anybody got any theories for me on what is to be gained by a government conspiracy?  Or is it, as I suspect, that we just like to feel that we are being conspired against by some hidden forces in government.

: : : I checked my Bartlett's.  It was written in Spanish by Francisco 
: : : Jose de Goya y Lucientes in his work &quot;Los Caprichos&quot; in 1799,
: : : translated by Hilda Harris.   In a footnote it says &quot;In plate
: : : 43 the artist rests, his head in his arms, on a desk inscribed
: : : with the Spanish line.  Behind him hover monstrous owls, bats, 
: : : and a great cat.  Goya's text for the plate:
: : : &quot;Imagination abandoned by Reason produces impossible monsters:
: : : united with he, she is the mother of the arts and the source of
: : : their wonders.&quot;

: : : Hope this helps
: : : Thank you Frederick Brenion. Most helpful. All the more pleased
:     to find it was Goya who said it as I have lived in his
: beautiful country of Spain for some twenty years. Thank you

Here I shall set forth what I believe to be a sensible argument against the possibility of an afterlife; a tenet that is so central to most/all religions.<p>First we need to clarify the sense as to what constitutes a person.  The historical view has been that there are two substances; the body and the soul.  Each lasts from day-to- day.  The difference between them is that though the body will cease to exist at some point, the soul transcends temporal limitations.  The part of this thinking which concerns the present life is most certainly false.  The body of now is not the same body of an hour ago, primarily due to the constant cycle of nutriment and wastage.  Also we now understand that matter and energy interchange, thus it is no longer sensible to say that the SAME atoms that constitute a person will always be so.  Thus, I'll assert that the body has continuity only through the rough approximation of appearance and behaviour.<p>Similarly with the mind.  Although we think, feel and act there is no evidence of a bare entity which experiences those things.  By entity, I mean that which may be localized.  Ever try to locate, in space, thoughts?  Temporal considerations seem to be a problem as well due to memory, shared experience, etc.  I'd say that a person's mental continuity is a collection of habit and memory.  If you think about yourself yesterday, what you are really doing is recalling certain mental occurrences, which are now remembered as part of the person who now exists.  All that constitutes a person are experiences connected by memory, and by those experiences which are similar enough to one another that we call them habit.<p>If we are to believe that one survives their own death, we are forced to conclude that the memories and habits follow the person into the new set of occurrences after death. (in religions that do not teach rebirth or reincarnation).  Since the brain, presumably the source of what we call thought, disintegrates at death, the electrochemical processes also must cease and therefore the thought and memory too.  All memory and thought is easily recognized in certain cerebral structures, yet not in others.  Our mental personality is thus tied to the health of the physical structures of the brain.<p>Now we all can pretty much agree that a person's state may be altered through electrical, chemical, or physical intervention.  Memory can be obliterated by an injury to the brain, a saintly person can be made mad by encephalitis, and an astute child turned into an idiot from iodine deficiency.  It therefore seems very improbable that the person/mind can survive the total destruction of the brain and its structures.<p>This is a VERY short summation of several arguments but, as always, I am interested in hearing other opinions!

: Here I shall set forth what I believe to be a sensible argument against the possibility of an afterlife; a tenet that is so central to most/all religions.

: First we need to clarify the sense as to what constitutes a person.  The historical view has been that there are two substances; the body and the soul.  Each lasts from day-to- day.  The difference between them is that though the body will cease to exist at some point, the soul transcends temporal limitations.  The part of this thinking which concerns the present life is most certainly false.  The body of now is not the same body of an hour ago, primarily due to the constant cycle of nutriment and wastage.  Also we now understand that matter and energy interchange, thus it is no longer sensible to say that the SAME atoms that constitute a person will always be so.  Thus, I'll assert that the body has continuity only through the rough approximation of appearance and behaviour.

: Similarly with the mind.  Although we think, feel and act there is no evidence of a bare entity which experiences those things.  By entity, I mean that which may be localized.  Ever try to locate, in space, thoughts?  Temporal considerations seem to be a problem as well due to memory, shared experience, etc.  I'd say that a person's mental continuity is a collection of habit and memory.  If you think about yourself yesterday, what you are really doing is recalling certain mental occurrences, which are now remembered as part of the person who now exists.  All that constitutes a person are experiences connected by memory, and by those experiences which are similar enough to one another that we call them habit.

: If we are to believe that one survives their own death, we are forced to conclude that the memories and habits follow the person into the new set of occurrences after death. (in religions that do not teach rebirth or reincarnation).  Since the brain, presumably the source of what we call thought, disintegrates at death, the electrochemical processes also must cease and therefore the thought and memory too.  All memory and thought is easily recognized in certain cerebral structures, yet not in others.  Our mental personality is thus tied to the health of the physical structures of the brain.

: Now we all can pretty much agree that a person's state may be altered through electrical, chemical, or physical intervention.  Memory can be obliterated by an injury to the brain, a saintly person can be made mad by encephalitis, and an astute child turned into an idiot from iodine deficiency.  It therefore seems very improbable that the person/mind can survive the total destruction of the brain and its structures.

: This is a VERY short summation of several arguments but, as always, I am interested in hearing other opinions!

: : : : Perhaps we skeptics don't take them seriously, but with junk like Strange Universe polluting the airwaves, I am prompted to think about the stories anyway.  I know there have been books published detailing many abduction stories which have common themes.  I wonder:  Is it common for the inter-planetary visitors to wear some sort of self-contained space suit, or do they go around molesting sleeping humans in a more unprotected state?  If the ETs are not in a fully enclosed suit, according to the accounts, is it not a good point to make to the deluded that any intelligent, extra-terrestial visitor would protect himself from micro-biotic invasion?  Duh, jus' wonderin'.<p>: : : Good point. But there seems to be a more fundamental problem, which is related to the speed of light.  Nothing can go faster than the speed of light (based on our current knowledge.)  The nearst star to our solar system is so far away that, were there a planet in the vicinity that supported intelligent life, these critters would be ancient before they got to planet earth.<p>: : Terry- Aliens would not be old when they got here. The fact is, that as their ship approaches the speed of light, the time it takes to travel these distances relative to the Aliens approaches zero. What seems to take 4 years from our point of view (if they were coming from Sirius), would be instaneous for them. Thats the whole point of relativity that change in position squared - change in normalized time squared is the same from any reference point. Its a fact that Aliens in UFOs have been zooming around the world for over 50 years, and that there presense has been ignored by words of pseudoscience coming from respectable scientists.<p>:  The question of protecting themselves from micro-biotic invasion or the aging process can be explained if these aliens are not biological, ie they are in fact androids.

: : : : : Perhaps we skeptics don't take them seriously, but with junk like Strange Universe polluting the airwaves, I am prompted to think about the stories anyway.  I know there have been books published detailing many abduction stories which have common themes.  I wonder:  Is it common for the inter-planetary visitors to wear some sort of self-contained space suit, or do they go around molesting sleeping humans in a more unprotected state?  If the ETs are not in a fully enclosed suit, according to the accounts, is it not a good point to make to the deluded that any intelligent, extra-terrestial visitor would protect himself from micro-biotic invasion?  Duh, jus' wonderin'.

: : : : Good point. But there seems to be a more fundamental problem, which is related to the speed of light.  Nothing can go faster than the speed of light (based on our current knowledge.)  The nearst star to our solar system is so far away that, were there a planet in the vicinity that supported intelligent life, these critters would be ancient before they got to planet earth.

: : : Terry- Aliens would not be old when they got here. The fact is, that as their ship approaches the speed of light, the time it takes to travel these distances relative to the Aliens approaches zero. What seems to take 4 years from our point of view (if they were coming from Sirius), would be instaneous for them. Thats the whole point of relativity that change in position squared - change in normalized time squared is the same from any reference point. Its a fact that Aliens in UFOs have been zooming around the world for over 50 years, and that there presense has been ignored by words of pseudoscience coming from respectable scientists.

: :  The question of protecting themselves from micro-biotic invasion or the aging process can be explained if these aliens are not biological, ie they are in fact androids. This could explain why they also show so much interest us humans as biological entities. I have written a piece of fiction centering around these ideas.

Hi, I'd been following the Hale-Bopp controversy on<br>another bulletin board (a pro-paranormal one) and trying<br>to inject some skepticism into the debate. I had pointed<br>out the usual stuff (the CCD explanation etc...), when<br>someone pointed out a picture I hadn't seen before. The<br>picture was a superimposition of Chuck Shramek's original<br>photo and a photo of HB and a "companion" taken by Jose<br>Alonso on the same night at a different time. Alonso's<br>photo is very similar to Shramek's. In it, the "companion"<br>is in the same position as in Shramek's picture and, <br>therefore, is also probably caused by the same phenomenon<br>(SAO 141894 being "bloomed up" by the CCD). <br>Anyways, a companion believer superimposed Shramek and<br>Alonso's photos, aligning the two of them with the stars<br>GSC 5086:367 and GSC 5086:161. This has the effect of <br>showing the "trail" of Hale-Bopp as it traveled through<br>the sky that night. What is interesting is that the <br>superimposition also seems to show the "companion" moving<br>with Hale-Bopp! Since the local newspapers don't have <br>headlines reading "GIANT SPACESHIP HEADED THIS WAY," I<br>think it's safe to assume that, through an optical trick,<br>the "bloomed up" SAO 141894 only appears to be moving.<br>My question is, what caused it to appear this way?<br>If you know anything about this, I would really appreciate<br>a reply, however, I should mention that I have no background<br>at all in astronomy or telescopes (I'm just a geeky college <br>student), so if you have any ideas, please state them in laymen's <br>terms. The page that the superimposition is found on is:<br>www.republic.net/~pparri.<br>Thanks, Mike.<br>P.S.

I've been hearing all over the news when ever some Republican or Evangelist comes on they keep talking about Christian family values and morals. Are these things any different than those for everyone else, or are Christians trying to claim that only they can have any of these values and morals in a positive way and that everyone else is automatically immoral and have no real values?<br>

: : I've been hearing all over the news when ever some Republican or Evangelist comes on they keep talking about Christian family values and morals. Are these things any different than those for everyone else, or are Christians trying to claim that only they can have any of these values and morals in a positive way and that everyone else is automatically immoral and have no real values?

: Of course there values are independent and distinct from everyone else's; obviously becaus
: all non christians are going to hell...(Just kidding)

I've read something about it, but I've pretty much chalked it up to marketing banter.  As the laser, which is not always red ( may also be blue-green), penetrates the plastic laminate on the CD, there is a small amount of refraction off slightly to the side.  This could set up a light piping effect along the plane of the plastic the same way fibre optics operate.  When it reaches the periphery of the CD, most would refract into the surrounding air, but there would be reflection back toward the centre of the CD.  I suppose that if this light were intense enough, it could interfere (both temporally and by being phase-shifted) with the original bean of light.  But alas, I really do think that the returned light in of such minimal intensity, if it exists at all, will not cause a problem in playback.  If it did I'd venture to guess that the music would sound MUCH worse rather than slightly worse because of the all-or-nothing code of digital signals.<p>

By the way, if your beliefs are in any way based on something you've read in the Bible, let me remind you that it "is not against flesh and blood that we struggle...".  You can't fight this with guns.  In fact, you are causing such fear that I feel the militia movement is going to be instrumental in the events that will lead to end time persecution.

: Hello Tim,

: I would love to know what evidence you have to support this.  As a Christian, I believe that one day the anti-christ will come and will have dominion over all nations.  The fact that we are moving quickly to a global society, and that it is entirely possible we may all come under the umbrella of one world body, seems to point to one possible way that a world dictator could take power, but I feel that people who make claims such as yours are doing a great deal to undermine the credibility of those who are genuinely concerned that America is sacrificing her autonomy in order to avoid having to make tough military decisions.  By the way, if your beliefs are in any way based on something you've read in the Bible, let me remind you that it &quot;is not against flesh and blood that we struggle...&quot;.  You can't fight this with guns.  In fact, you are causing such fear that I feel the militia movement is going to be instrumental in the events that will lead to end time persecution.

Supposedly these little guys are connected with all past generations throughout the entire evolution of life and will live on into the future through the coming generations - also, somehow scientists can actually study this. I have no idea what field of science this would fall in to but I'm wondering if anyone knows anything about it - what is it that can be studied? Very, very neat - ya gotta love science!

: Supposedly these little guys are connected with all past generations throughout the entire evolution of life and will live on into the future through the coming generations - also, somehow scientists can actually study this. I have no idea what field of science this would fall in to but I'm wondering if anyone knows anything about it - what is it that can be studied? Very, very neat - ya gotta love science!

I was in a discussion with a few other people about life and the universe the other day.  Someone brought up the idea of silicon-based life, an idea that I'm familiar with but cannot discuss it with any depth.  I need help and insight with this.  It seems to me that there are molecular-level problems with oxygen respiration.  HELP!

Here's a hot one.  In the latest edition of Ellen Bass' <br>and Laura Davis' famous/infamous incest survivors' <br>manual "The Courage to Heal" the authors' claim that <br>an archiologist from UCLA by the name of Gary Stickel <br>turned up forensic evididence of not only a burried <br>tunnel going from one class room to another but - hold <br>onto your hats - what looked for all the world like a <br>witch's cauldron to boot (page 520)!  That's a pretty<br>sensational claim and, if true, would seem to rebut an<br>awful lot of finely honed skeptcism.  So howcum I <br>haven't heard of Geroldo or some other responsible <br>bastion of our free and intrepid press ballyhoo this<br>discovery?  Any information would be greatly <br>appreciated.

It's been very interesting having these conversations with people with such a different worldview.  I think the only dissapointment is that most of you have only encountered the wild eyed six day creationist flat earth society types.  That's to bad.  Because a lot of us who believe and search for spiritual truth are certainly not close minded robots.  I have alway's been a skeptic if you define skeptic as one who questions.  I have alway's been Christian if you define  Christian as one who has his or her own reasons and  experiences with prayer and hope. Anyway,I came across this page and even though we have disagreed I have found the debate to be civil.  Keep searching.  We are not going to convert each other and I think thats O.K.  I'll still check back from time to time to see if yall (yeah I'm from the south and we say yall meaning plural.  Never you all.

Posted by <a href="mailto:rosa@ezlink.com">Linda Rosa</a> on December 25, 1996 at 01:03:55:<p>
REWRITING HISTORY -- KWANZAA FRAUD:  While helping my daughter with a school project on holidays, I recalled a particularly compeling passage from Frederick Douglass' 1845 autobiography on the slave holiday held the week between Christmas and New Year's Day.  It was distressing to find no mention of this episode in slave history and nothing of Douglass’ comments -- not in any literature on Zwanzaa (nor in several biographies of Douglass). Note that one of the guiding principles of Kwanzaa itself is to celebrate history.  From a book called "The Complete Kwanzaa:"  "Kwanzaa is an outgrowth of many customs, joined with ancient African tribal practices, that reconstruct our national history and culture." Frederick Douglass was a great man.  The experience of slavery and his analysis of it is extremely important history for all people everywhere.  It's sad to see it suppressed. I've posted this message on "Melanet." -- Linda Rosa (rosa@ezlink.com)<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The following is a passage from the unabridged "Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass" by Recorded Books 1191; first published in 1845.  <p>My term of actual service to Mr. Edward Covey ended on Christmas Day 1833.  The days between Christmas and New Year's Day are allowed as holidays, and accordingly, we weren't required to perform any labor more than to feed and take care of the stock.  <br>This time we regarded as our own, by the grace of our masters, and we therefore used or abused it as we pleased.  Those of us who had families at a distance, were generally allowed to spend the whole six days in their society.  This time, however, was spent in various ways.  The stayed, sober, thinking and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves in making corn brooms, mats and baskets.  And another class of us would spend the time in a hunting possums, hares and coons.  But by far, the larger part engaged in such sports and merriments as playing ball, wrestling, running foot races, fiddling, dancing and drinking whiskey.  And this latter mode of spending time was by far the most agreeable to the feelings of our masters.  As slave who would work during the holidays was considered by our masters as scarely deserving them.  He was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master.  It was deemed a disgrace not to get drunk at Christmas.  And he was regarded as lazy indeed who hadn't provided himself with the necessary means during the year to get whiskey enough to last him through Christmas.  From what I know of the effect of these holidays upon the slave,  I believe them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection.  Were the slaveholders at once to abandon this practice, I haven't a doubt it would lead to an immediate insurrection.  These holidays serve as conductors or safety valves to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity.  But for these, the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation, and woe betide the slaveholder the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of those conductors.  I warn him that, in such an event, a spirit will go forth in their midst more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake.  The holidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrong and inhumanity of slavery.  They are professedly a custom established by the benevolence of the slaveholders.  But I undertake to say, it is the result of selfishness and one of the grossest frauds committed upon the downtrodden slave.  They don't give the slaves this time because they wouldn't like to have their work during its continuence, but because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it. This will be seen by the fact that the slaveholders like to have their slaves spend those days in such as manner as to make them glad of their ending as their beginning.  Their object seems to be to disgust their slaves with freedom by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipation.  For instance, the slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his own accord, but will adopt various plans to make him drunk.  One plan is to make bets on their slaves as to who can drink the most whiskey without getting drunk.  And in this way they succeed in getting whole multitudes to drink to excess.  Thus, when the slave asks for virtuous freedom, the cunning slave owner, knowing his ignorance, cheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation, artfully labeled with the name of liberty.  The most of us used to drink it down, and the result was just what might be supposed.  Many of us were lead to think that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery.  We felt, and very properly too, that we had almost as well be slaves to men as to rum.  So, when the holidays ended, we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing, took a long breath and marched to the field, feeling upon the whole rather glad to go, from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery.  I have said that this mode of treatment is a part of the whole system of the fraud and inhumanity of slavery.  It is so.  The mode here adopted to disgust the slave with freedom, by allowing him to see only the abuse of it, is carried out in other things.  For instance, a slave loves molassas.   He steals some.  His master, in many cases, goes off to town and buys a large quantity.  He returns, takes his whip and commands the slave to eat the molassas until the poor fellow is made sick at the very mention of it.  The same mode is sometimes adopted to make slaves refrain from asking for more food than their regular allowance.  A slave runs through his  allowance and applies for more.  His master is enraged at him, but not willing to send him off without food, gives him more than is necessary and compels him to eat it within a given time.  Then if he complains that he cannot eat it, he is said to be satisfied neither full nor fasting and is whipped for being hard to please.  I have an abundance of such illustrations of the same principle drawn from my own observation but think the cases I have cited sufficient.  The practice is a very common one.

: REWRITING HISTORY -- KWANZAA FRAUD:  While helping my daughter with a school project on holidays, I recalled a particularly compeling passage from Frederick Douglass' 1845 autobiography on the slave holiday held the week between Christmas and New Year's Day.  It was distressing to find no mention of this episode in slave history and nothing of Douglass’ comments -- not in any literature on Zwanzaa (nor in several biographies of Douglass). Note that one of the guiding principles of Kwanzaa itself is to celebrate history.  From a book called &quot;The Complete Kwanzaa:&quot;  &quot;Kwanzaa is an outgrowth of many customs, joined with ancient African tribal practices, that reconstruct our national history and culture.&quot; Frederick Douglass was a great man.  The experience of slavery and his analysis of it is extremely important history for all people everywhere.  It's sad to see it suppressed. I've posted this message on &quot;Melanet.&quot; -- Linda Rosa (rosa@ezlink.com)
: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
: The following is a passage from the unabridged &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; by Recorded Books 1191; first published in 1845.  

: My term of actual service to Mr. Edward Covey ended on Christmas Day 1833.  The days between Christmas and New Year's Day are allowed as holidays, and accordingly, we weren't required to perform any labor more than to feed and take care of the stock.  
: This time we regarded as our own, by the grace of our masters, and we therefore used or abused it as we pleased.  Those of us who had families at a distance, were generally allowed to spend the whole six days in their society.  This time, however, was spent in various ways.  The stayed, sober, thinking and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves in making corn brooms, mats and baskets.  And another class of us would spend the time in a hunting possums, hares and coons.  But by far, the larger part engaged in such sports and merriments as playing ball, wrestling, running foot races, fiddling, dancing and drinking whiskey.  And this latter mode of spending time was by far the most agreeable to the feelings of our masters.  As slave who would work during the holidays was considered by our masters as scarely deserving them.  He was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master.  It was deemed a disgrace not to get drunk at Christmas.  And he was regarded as lazy indeed who hadn't provided himself with the necessary means during the year to get whiskey enough to last him through Christmas.  From what I know of the effect of these holidays upon the slave,  I believe them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection.  Were the slaveholders at once to abandon this practice, I haven't a doubt it would lead to an immediate insurrection.  These holidays serve as conductors or safety valves to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity.  But for these, the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation, and woe betide the slaveholder the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of those conductors.  I warn him that, in such an event, a spirit will go forth in their midst more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake.  The holidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrong and inhumanity of slavery.  They are professedly a custom established by the benevolence of the slaveholders.  But I undertake to say, it is the result of selfishness and one of the grossest frauds committed upon the downtrodden slave.  They don't give the slaves this time because they wouldn't like to have their work during its continuence, but because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it. This will be seen by the fact that the slaveholders like to have their slaves spend those days in such as manner as to make them glad of their ending as their beginning.  Their object seems to be to disgust their slaves with freedom by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipation.  For instance, the slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his own accord, but will adopt various plans to make him drunk.  One plan is to make bets on their slaves as to who can drink the most whiskey without getting drunk.  And in this way they succeed in getting whole multitudes to drink to excess.  Thus, when the slave asks for virtuous freedom, the cunning slave owner, knowing his ignorance, cheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation, artfully labeled with the name of liberty.  The most of us used to drink it down, and the result was just what might be supposed.  Many of us were lead to think that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery.  We felt, and very properly too, that we had almost as well be slaves to men as to rum.  So, when the holidays ended, we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing, took a long breath and marched to the field, feeling upon the whole rather glad to go, from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery.  I have said that this mode of treatment is a part of the whole system of the fraud and inhumanity of slavery.  It is so.  The mode here adopted to disgust the slave with freedom, by allowing him to see only the abuse of it, is carried out in other things.  For instance, a slave loves molassas.   He steals some.  His master, in many cases, goes off to town and buys a large quantity.  He returns, takes his whip and commands the slave to eat the molassas until the poor fellow is made sick at the very mention of it.  The same mode is sometimes adopted to make slaves refrain from asking for more food than their regular allowance.  A slave runs through his  allowance and applies for more.  His master is enraged at him, but not willing to send him off without food, gives him more than is necessary and compels him to eat it within a given time.  Then if he complains that he cannot eat it, he is said to be satisfied neither full nor fasting and is whipped for being hard to please.  I have an abundance of such illustrations of the same principle drawn from my own observation but think the cases I have cited sufficient.  The practice is a very common one.

First let me aplogise for my e mail being down right now.  As to my believing in life after death.  Just because I want to like chocolate cake does not mean it does not exist.  I have my own reasons and they are personal.  I want try to put them on anyone else.  But,wanting to believe something does not invalidate it.  Nor does it prove it.  As for reincarnation I have studied it and I think it's interesting.  Ian Stevenson a proffessor at the U. of Virg. has some really interesting work on it. One of you mentioned Jesus as if I would believe in reincarnation if I was not a Christian.  I did not say I was a fundlementalist.  Please you've watched to much T.B.N or conservative poloticians.  I have already stated I don't have the audacity to say that I know what happens at death to people of different faiths or no faith at all.  Finally,please don't belittle my intellect by talking about goblins and faries.  I don't think an honest search for spiritual truth can be dissmissed by intelligent people so flippantlly.  Hey,I also am sorry about the spelling and any typos.  Even though I have college and am a excellent reader I just never have been a good speller.  I do appreciate the two people who responded to my post.  I certainly don't think there is clear evidence for life after death.  But, I don't think you can say it's been disproved.  I know how frustrating that is.  And I agree you can't disprove  santa claus and the tooth fairy.  But please be a little more realistic.  There are reasons for why we are here.  Did we evolve.  Most likely.  Is the earth flat? no.  Do I believe in six day creation? No. Do I believe  it's all a cosmic mistake? No

I am glad to see someone besides the pompous cycops giving the other side of things on new age and other far out or supernatural topics.  I just want you to know that all of us who believe in someone higher than ourselfs are not flat earthers or creationists.  I am a christian but unlike fundlementalists I don't have the presumption to state that I know the mind of the Allmighty.  I know also that no person can really know what happens after death.  Or if anything happens after death.  But, I certainly hope that all the great people and loving personalitys that have walked the earth don't simply cease to exist. Thank you for the soapbox.  I'm not trying to convert anyone.  Just wanted to say that not all of us people of faith are kooks.

As an agnostic/humanist/skeptic, I certainly agree that religious belief is not an acid test for intelligence. I have some religious friends who are very intelligent people. The only difference between you and I is that you have arrived at theistic philosophical conclusions about reality and universe whereas I remain skeptical. Personally, I don't think big philosophical questions such as the truth or falsehood of religion should be dismissed like giving up Santa Claus. It's not an easy debate I can see why intelligent people can come down on different sides. My advice is to simply try to understand the best you can and that's all you can do. Also, keep in mind that nonreligious people can believe in really stupid things too. Skeptics, agnostics and atheists can be just as susceptible to bias and error as religious people can be. - Jason

Would appreciate any informed discussion about the controversy surrounding Francoise Gauguelin and the "Mars Effect."  Especially in light of Jim Lippart's analysis of the CSICOP mishandling of the issues, the CFPP's apparent mishandling, culminating in the recent Prometheus Book's publication on the subject.  I have just recently been downloading whatever I can find on the WEB about the subject.  If the re-evaluation of the Prometheus book by Suitbert Erte. and Denneth Irving, THE TENACIOUS MARS EFFECT correct, we have some serious rethinking to do!  What support, if any, would validation to the Mars Effect lend to traditional astrology.  Personally I hate to think of all that hoary stuff having any validity!

Hi there...<p><br>in about a week I'm giving a speech on why ghosts don't exist,<br>and I was wondering if anyone could point me to a good website<br>that might give me some strong arguments. Although I am utterly<br>convinced that ghosts are myths, obviously, me merely saying,<br>"Well I don't belive in them so they aren't real" isn't going to get me<br>high marks with my teacher. Thanks alot.

A better way of dealing with the question of the existence of ghosts is to argue that the burden of proof is on those who make extraordinary claims (like the existence of ghosts) and not on the non-believers. Skeptics often investigate and debunk specific claims but proving the negative is generally not possible in this domain. You might want to visit the CSICOP (Committe for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal) website at http://www.csicop.org.<br>If you have not already done so, you might read Carl Sagan's boof "The Demon-Haunted World.

We should look upon authentic and demythologized (or CONSCIOUSLY mythologized) religion as more like ART and MUSIC than as science or philosophy.  We do not usually think of a work of art as "true" or "false" or  that it is "making claims about the way things are."   Thus religious utterances, along with the attendant Ritual, Symbol and Myth should not be though of as making ANY cognitive claims whatsoever.  If we adopt this view towards religion, non-mystical as well as mystical, we shall, as the good Fibonacci says, be kept from all sorts of  serious foolishness.<p>Clay S.<p>PS:  Quotations taken from "Faces in the Clouds" by Stewart Guthrie, Oxford<br>

We do not usually think of a work of art as &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; or  that it is &quot;making claims about the way things are.&quot;   Thus religious utterances, along with the attendant Ritual, Symbol and Myth should not be though of as making ANY cognitive claims whatsoever.  If we adopt this view towards religion, non-mystical as well as mystical, we shall, as the good Fibonacci says, be kept from all sorts of  serious foolishness.

Dear Clay,<br>     I know that you prefer that these discussions take place in terms of science, but since your vocabulary and scientific knowledge far exceed mine.

The only knowledge I have is personal.<br>     I'm not at all suprised that the new age religion you were involved in left you in spiritual dissolution.  I am convinced that false religions exist for this very purpose, but I don't really want to get into the details right now because I know you're not interested.  I just want to make the point that you can't prove that there isn't a God anymore than I could prove to you that there is.  I only appeal to the "skeptic" in you to not make up your mind so completely as to the existence of the spiritual realm.  You say that man creates God in his own image because we are the center of our own universe.  You seem to indicate that man is limited in his knowledge and therefore should realize the folly of believing that a Creator would think us worthy of distinction...or even that there is a Creator.  Does man envision God with human attributes because that is what is familiar, or did God create us in His image as my religion teaches?  You say the egg came first, I say it's the chicken.<br>     Yes, there are destructive religions, and, yes, there are bad people within true religion (Judas was one of the original twelve ya' know), but I know from personal experience that when I do what the bible teaches and stay close to God, I make better choices that inevitably lead to blessings in my life.  When I stray from the path, I always find myself in turmoil and tears, not because God is punishing me, but because there is a spiritual law at work that is as true as the law of gravity.  If you try to break it, you only break yourself.

Toward the possible Causes of Cult Involvement, Religious Fantasies and Religious Delusions<p>Having been on a personal Cosmic Head Trip with  Spirituality for 15 plus years which involved, among other things, having the highly counterproductive need to induce all sorts of "wild and wacky" neurological experiences via meditation to the detriment of my physical and psychological health, I now have to ask myself  WHY I chose this particular dead end and WHY others choose paths just as fruitless and inimical to their psychological and/or physical health like the religious Cults??? <p>As a first approximation to the answer (and NOT the answer itself),  I make the following points:<p>(1)  Gross Superstition<p>Many persons today have all sorts of delusions about the occult, the paranormal, magic, astrology, aliens and alien abductions, and so on that DO NOT withstand logical and scientific scrutiny of ANY kind.  It might be of interest to note that 150 years of "psychical" research has turned up NOT ONE SHRED, ABSOLUTELY NONE, of hard scientific evidence that there is anything like ESP (See "Physics and Psychics" by Victor J. Stenger  and the journal "The Skeptical Inquirer").  Similar remarks hold good with respect to alleged encounters with, and visitations from, aliens and alleged alien abductions.   Some basic training in logic, science and philosophy would extinguish most or all tendencies toward credulity along these lines.<p>(2)  Ritual, Symbol and Myth as a Refined Smoke Screen for Spiritual & Mystical Metaphysical Agendas<p>One of my best friends (an Eastern Orthodox Priest), steeped in philosophy, literature, anthropology, sociology and so on, is always telling me that the human race’s very SURVIVAL depends,  critically,    upon  the affirmation of, and participation in, Ritual, Symbol and Myth.  Of course the Nazi’s had their Rituals, Symbols and Myths as did the former Soviet Union.  Moreover, all sorts of pathological religions have had the same as well, while countless crimes, atrocities, intolerance and persecutions have been carried out in the name of (equally) countless fanatical religious founders and religious ideologies.  I feel that my friend DOES NOT really appreciate this point about the "down side" of  Ritual, Symbol and Myth sufficiently.<p>Even if I grant, for the sake of the discussion, that Ritual, Symbol and Myth in some beneficent and unspecified  form is somehow desperately needed by the human race today, that leaves the implicit metaphysical beliefs, assumptions and claims BEHIND most of it unaddressed.   <p>Examples of SOME of these implicit views are as follows:<p>(a) A positive belief in some form of life after death with definite ideas about the nature of the alleged next life.  Examples include union with God or the Absolute, reuniting with friends and relatives in "heaven" at death, the Beatific Vision (the official Roman Catholic position), reincarnation into a better or worse existence, and so on.  <br>(b) The affirmation of life after death with COMPLETE AGNOSTICISM as to its nature.<br>(c) The belief that even though the mechanisms of meditation are wholly Cognitive, Behavioral and Neurobiological in nature, still in all, meditation and Spirituality will open up the "mystical" and metaphysical secrets of Reality and the cosmos to the diligent and gifted spiritual practitioner.<br>(d) Even while rejecting the paranormal and the supernatural, one can still feel that there is that "special and mystical" or vague and inarticulate something, over and above the world of space, time, matter and energy which makes religion, Spirituality and Mystical Experiences in, again,  some unspecified way or another very very "wonderful" and unique.  This was MY final view before completely repudiating Spirituality.<p>One of the basic problems with even SOPHISTICATED beliefs in life after death and "other & immaterial planes of being" is that all such beliefs have, usually,  four very negative aspects.  <p>The first negative aspect of these debilitating beliefs is that they PREVENT the individual from facing the harsh realities of life and PREVENT the coming to terms with the utter FINITUDE of human existence and the human condition - "Thou Art NOT That!!" <p>The second negative aspect is that such beliefs function as DISGUISED WAGERS of various sorts mostly to the effect that there is some "great pot of spiritual gold" to be had the "other side" of this life which a given Supernaturalist system of belief guarantees.  Not willing to be outdone by the non-mystical Supernaturalists, masters of obfuscation like Ken Wilber tell us that we don’t even have to wait around until the next life.  Not at all!  In fact, Ken tells us we ALREADY ARE, in our innermost being, Reality or the Godhead  itself!! Truly realize this in your present life and you will be reincarnated as the Kosmos itself in your "next" life.  Of course, the unbounded hubris and grandiosity of such views and claims is totally lost on Ken.  After all, he has loads of money to make out of the next zillion books he plans to write plus giving his cosmic ego-pump and extra push or twenty.  I must conclude, regrettably, that all these Supernaturalist Fantasies almost always have this end result:    instead of doing the hard work of education, psychological integration, works of charity and compassion, building for a better world and so on, in THIS life, the individual POSTPONES much or all of this and is lost in Supernaturalist reveries about what, allegedly, will come AFTERWARD. Or in the case of Ken, fantasies about the Eternal Now.<p>The third component is the silly anthropocentric view that God, the cosmos, or whatever, will obligingly project the human ego into an infinite and everlasting tomorrow. The ridiculous idea that humans are somehow central to the universe in some way, or "near to the heart of God," is a delusion that Science has long ago exposed - talk about cosmic hubris on the part of religionists!!  <p>The fourth, and last, negative aspect of such beliefs is that, one way or another, they are really forms of Cosmic Elitism.  Many persons who buy into some version of life after death, more often than not, feel themselves to be members of a "spiritual or mystical elite" or members of the "cosmically elect" - the cosmic power trip that beliefs like this can engender are manifold.<p>(3) Anthropomorphism as the ESSENCE of Religion and a major Source of Problems<p>Anthropormophism means the attribution of human characteristics to nonhuman things and events.  Why, though, the pervasive anthropomorphism with regard to God for example?  After all, the classical attributes of God (omnipresence, immutability, timelessness, impassability, absolute infinitude) are NOT IN THE LEAST compatible with personhood.  Nor, in fact, is the personalistic process philosophy view that God is some sort of Cosmic Mind in a state of perpetual flux compatible with human personhood (as I have argued elsewhere).  My claim, borrowed from Stewart Guthrie, is that God or the gods CONSISTS IN SEEING THE WORLD AS HUMANLIKE.  Why, though, do we have this inveterate tendency to see the world as humanlike in spite of the fact that stars, black holes, quasars, and quarks are NOT even remotely human?  In a phrase, why do we see "Faces in the Clouds"?  <p>The answer to these and similar questions is that we perceive the world in terms of our most VITAL interests which involve HUMANS.  The main explanation of anthropomorphism is that it is the result of a process that is mostly unconscious.  "We search everywhere, involuntarily and unknowingly, for human form and results of human action, and often seem to find them where they do not exist.  What we find is highly diverse, including a wide range both of human anatomy and of human artifacts.  Some of these perceptions prove well founded, while many others do not.  Finding mistakes does not discourage the search, however, nor prevent the systematic illusions…"  <p>The same account applies to certain cosmic, metaphysical and religious questions (and answers) about the origin and destiny of the individual and the universe:  where does the stuff of ourselves and the universe come from, why does the universe exist, and what is the human place in it?  "Against the background of our pervasive anthropomorphism such queries resemble the anthropomorphizing of Piaget’s children.  The very asking implies human experience and purpose.  The anthropocentrism of these questions is apparent, for example, even in our reluctance to accept infinite regress as an answer.  We usually posit instead some beginning cause, often a quite human one such as Plato’s Craftsman, or the God of the Abrahamic religions, or the many gods of tribal origin myths."<p>Now "all perception is interpretation and depends on our choice of schemata, or models, which in turn is ordered by our concerns.  Once we acknowledge that interests shape perception, we can see anthropomorphism … as the necessary occasional failure of a particular perceptual strategy.  Hence anthropomorphism is not unique but is simply one interpretation among others, THOUGH BY DEFINITION MISTAKEN.  Such a view lets us see all anthropomorphism, religious or not, as fitting nonhuman things or events to a human like template and as doing so  for the same reasons."<p>"Once we see religion as anthropomorphism, the question - Why does religion persist? - changes to, Why do humanlike models persist?  This question is easier to answer.  Humanlike models persist because they identify and account for the crucial components of our world:  HUMANS AND THEIR ACTIVITIES AND EFFECTS.  Because such models are vital, employing them is our first, our AUTOMATIC, and most powerful approach to the world.  In sum, religion arises and persists because the strategy from which it stems often succeeds in identifying phenomena - real humans and their actions - that are uniquely important."<p>MAJOR CONCLUSIONS:<p>The main failing of religion lies not so much in its naïve anthropomorphism, BUT IN THE ENSHRINING OF IT - OF THE VERY APOTHEOSIS OF IT!  Regarding religion’s ability do deal with the "ultimate questions" of life, I assert that it has done the poorest of jobs.  In Mysticism alone, Mystical Experiences are used to justify everything from the extreme monism of Shankara to the radical ontological pluralism of the Therevada Buddhists.  Finally,  I say that in the realms of philosophy and cosmology, anthropomorphism in ANY form, ranging from subtle to gross,  is totally misleading and a constitutes an absolute cognitive error.<br>  <p>(4) The Life-Long Romance with Meaning<p>With regard to this point, I can do no better than to borrow from the highly estimable Meister Fibonacci.

: Toward the possible Causes of Cult Involvement, Religious Fantasies and Religious Delusions

: Having been on a personal Cosmic Head Trip with  Spirituality for 15 plus years which involved, among other things, having the highly counterproductive need to induce all sorts of &quot;wild and wacky&quot; neurological experiences via meditation to the detriment of my physical and psychological health, I now have to ask myself  WHY I chose this particular dead end and WHY others choose paths just as fruitless and inimical to their psychological and/or physical health like the religious Cults??? 

: As a first approximation to the answer (and NOT the answer itself),  I make the following points:

: (1)  Gross Superstition

: Many persons today have all sorts of delusions about the occult, the paranormal, magic, astrology, aliens and alien abductions, and so on that DO NOT withstand logical and scientific scrutiny of ANY kind.  It might be of interest to note that 150 years of &quot;psychical&quot; research has turned up NOT ONE SHRED, ABSOLUTELY NONE, of hard scientific evidence that there is anything like ESP (See &quot;Physics and Psychics&quot; by Victor J. Stenger  and the journal &quot;The Skeptical Inquirer&quot;).  Similar remarks hold good with respect to alleged encounters with, and visitations from, aliens and alleged alien abductions.   Some basic training in logic, science and philosophy would extinguish most or all tendencies toward credulity along these lines.

: (2)  Ritual, Symbol and Myth as a Refined Smoke Screen for Spiritual & Mystical Metaphysical Agendas

: One of my best friends (an Eastern Orthodox Priest), steeped in philosophy, literature, anthropology, sociology and so on, is always telling me that the human race’s very SURVIVAL depends,  critically,    upon  the affirmation of, and participation in, Ritual, Symbol and Myth.  Of course the Nazi’s had their Rituals, Symbols and Myths as did the former Soviet Union.  Moreover, all sorts of pathological religions have had the same as well, while countless crimes, atrocities, intolerance and persecutions have been carried out in the name of (equally) countless fanatical religious founders and religious ideologies.  I feel that my friend DOES NOT really appreciate this point about the &quot;down side&quot; of  Ritual, Symbol and Myth sufficiently.

: Even if I grant, for the sake of the discussion, that Ritual, Symbol and Myth in some beneficent and unspecified  form is somehow desperately needed by the human race today, that leaves the implicit metaphysical beliefs, assumptions and claims BEHIND most of it unaddressed.   

: Examples of SOME of these implicit views are as follows:

: (a) A positive belief in some form of life after death with definite ideas about the nature of the alleged next life.  Examples include union with God or the Absolute, reuniting with friends and relatives in &quot;heaven&quot; at death, the Beatific Vision (the official Roman Catholic position), reincarnation into a better or worse existence, and so on.  
: (b) The affirmation of life after death with COMPLETE AGNOSTICISM as to its nature.
: (c) The belief that even though the mechanisms of meditation are wholly Cognitive, Behavioral and Neurobiological in nature, still in all, meditation and Spirituality will open up the &quot;mystical&quot; and metaphysical secrets of Reality and the cosmos to the diligent and gifted spiritual practitioner.
: (d) Even while rejecting the paranormal and the supernatural, one can still feel that there is that &quot;special and mystical&quot; or vague and inarticulate something, over and above the world of space, time, matter and energy which makes religion, Spirituality and Mystical Experiences in, again,  some unspecified way or another very very &quot;wonderful&quot; and unique.

Finally,  I say that in the realms of philosophy and cosmology, anthropomorphism in ANY form, ranging from subtle to gross,  is totally misleading and a constitutes an absolute cognitive error.

: With regard to this point, I can do no better than to borrow from the highly estimable Meister Fibonacci.  His basic point is that once we see that there are NO LITERAL SUPERNATURAL CORRELATES to our Rituals, Symbols, Myths and Myst

New Age Hedonism and New Age Narcissism<p>(adapted from The Unconscious Quantum by Victor J. Stenger)<p>A decade ago, Fritjof Capra, Marilyn Ferguson, Gary Zukav, and others had predicted that the 1980’s would be a revolutionary time "because the whole structure of our society does not correspond with the world-view of emerging scientific thought."  They blamed Classical Physics for all the ills of society and saw the New Physics, especially Quantum Mechanics, as a savior.<p>In her 1990 book, The Quantum Self, Danah Zohar asserts that "Cartesian philosophy wrenched human beings from their familiar social and religious context and thrust us headlong into…our I-centered culture, a culture dominated by egocentricity."   The New Holistic Physics was supposed to teach people to be less selfish, to recognize that they are part of a greater Whole, and to work cooperatively for the benefit of everyone.<p>That no great Holistic Revolution has occurred is the understatement of the millennium.  The facts indicate that even more than the 1970’s, which originally had the name, the 1980’s were much more the "Me Decade."  Far from recognizing that we are each an inseparable part of the Whole, and everyone pitching in to make the world a better place for its inhabitants, life in the 1980’s was characterized by an unprecedented level of individual self-absorption.  And the 1990’s, so far, show no sign of a change in this focus on self, as every element of our society is geared to provide maximal short-term self-gratification for its members, while those who fail to be gratified view themselves as victims.<p>Now some will argue that the ever-increasing fixation on self only reinforces the need for a Holistic Philosophy like that of Capra, Ferguson, and Zohar.  They will say that the problem is simply that Holistic Philosophy has not yet taken hold.  This is a fantastic and ludicrous claim and has been used by every religion and philosophy with social and/or political aspirations ever since the beginning of civilization.  In fact, no small portion of the blame for the current excessive self-absorption lies at the feet of the New Age Mysticism.  Anyone listening to New Age Gurus cannot miss the emphasis on the individual finding easy gratification ("COME ONE, COME ALL.  ‘FOLLOW YOUR BLISS’ TO INFINITE AND ETERNAL HAPPINESS!  IT’S BETTER THAN THE BEST SEX!!") rather than sacrificing and selflessly laboring for a better world.  Similar remarks hold good  regarding the views these Gurus propound about meditation, viz., that it’s all bliss and should make you feel wonderful.  If not, you are doing something wrong.  <p>This is in stark contrast to the truth:  profound and transfigurative meditation is exceedingly painful.

There is also the regrettable and wholly erroneous denigration of Classical Reductionist Physics and Scientific Materialism as wholly unspiritual and responsible for turning people into egotists.  The truth, however, is that Reductionist Classical Physics does not make people egoists.  People were egoists long before Classical Physics!  In fact, Classical and Quantum Physics have nothing to say about human beings except that they are material objects like rocks and trees, made of nothing more than the same atoms - just fantastically more complex and more cleverly organized by the impersonal forces of self-organization and evolution.  This is hardly a philosophical basis for narcissism!<p><br>This new Cosmythology, on the other hand, feeds our delusions of personal importance.  Quantum Holism tells us  that we are part of an Immortal Cosmic Mind with the power to perform miracles and, as actress Shirley MacLaine has said, to make our own reality.  Who needs God when we, ourselves, are God?  Thoughts of our participation in Cosmic Consciousness inflate our egos to the point where we can ignore our shortcomings and even forget our mortality.  <p>Yes indeed, New Age Religions mainly provide a means for escaping reality.  In the United States, where self-gratification has reached heights never dreamed of in ancient Rome, where self-esteem is more important than being able to read, and where self-help requires no more effort than popping in a cassette, the myth of  Quantum Consciousness is just what the therapist ordered.  <p>Quantum Consciousness is a grossly misapplied version of ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophy which were and are based on the notion that only by the complete rejection of the delusive sense-of-self can one find inner peace in this world of incessant flux, suffering, and hopelessness.  The literal meaning of Nirvana as Extinction has been completely obscured by The Cosmic Bliss Seekers of The New Age Superstitions. Far from attempting the painful dissolution of  the ego, as advocated by any form of Authentic Spirituality, New Age Holism puts it on a pedestal and proposes that it, or the Guru, or both, be worshipped.  Capra and his colleagues say they are putting a modern face on ancient Eastern philosophy.  But, on the contrary, they are  covering a Noble Edifice with hedonistic graffiti.  Where they see similarities between the new and the old mysticism’s, I see only contrasts.  Where they promote the new Cosmythology as an antidote for self-absorption, I assert that they are manufacturing a drug which <p>induces.

Posted by <a href="mailto:Emptiness@aol.com">Clay S.</a> on December 04, 1996 at 17:58:05:<p>
Susan Blackmore’s "Near Death Experience" had while ALIVE AND WELL<p><br>The Superstition propagated by those who have Near Death Experiences [NDE] while either CRITICALLY ILL or  NEAR DEATH is that they CANNOT happen under ANY OTHER CONDITIONS.  Such is NOT the case however, as Susan Blackmore relates:<br>"Under conditions of extreme tiredness and smoking hashish I had a NDE-type experience complete with tunnel and light, out-of-body travels, expansion and contraction of size, timelessness, a mystical experience and the decision to return; all occurring over a period of about two hours WHILE I WAS SITING UP AND QUITE ALIVE AND HEALTHY.  Hallucinogens such as LSD and the short-acting DMT can do the trick.<br>This much seems clear:  that ALL the NDE features have been reported from NON-NEAR-DEATH CONDITIONS."<p><br>UPSHOT:  Both Blackmore and myself have had many or most of these types of Mystical and/or NDE experiences and we come to RADICALLY DIFFERENT conclusions about their NATURE.  If these experiences can be induced by drugs and illness on the one hand, and manipulation of the nervous system via meditation on the other, it seems EXCEEDINGLY LIKELY that they have their basis SOLELY in NEUROBIOLOGY and not in some "Supernatural Realm(s)" and/or Anthropomorphic God.<p>Regards, Clay S.<p><br>SUSAN BLACKMORE ON NEAR DEATH AND MYSTICAL EXPERIENCES <p><br>1.  The Consistency Argument<p><br>The first argument for The After Life Hypothesis is The Consistency Argument.  This is that NDE’s are similar around the world and throughout history.  The only possible explanation for this, so the argument runs, is that NDE’s are just what they appear to be - a journey through a real tunnel to another world which awaits us after death.  Consistency, it is argued, amounts to evidence for an afterlife.  <br>The consistency is certainly there.  We have explored may different kinds of NDEs and seen that, although no two are the same, there are consistent patterns:  the joy and peace; the tunnel; the light; the out-of-body experience; the life review and the dissolution into timelessness; the return to life and the changes it brings.  The consistency is there but this does NOT mean there is an afterlife.<br>The joy and peace are consistent because of the natural opiates (endorphins and encephalins) released under stress.  The tunnel  +  light and noises are consistent because they depend on the structure of the brain’s cortex and what happens to it when it is deprived of oxygen or is affected by disinhibition and random activity.  The OBE [out-of-body experience] is consistent because it is the brain’s way of dealing with a breakdown in the body image and model of reality.  The life review is consistent because the endorphins and encephalins cause random activation and seizures in the temporal lobe and limbic system where memories are organized.  The same effect leads to the breakdown of time and its relationship to self.

Indeed, The Dying Brain Hypothesis accounts for it much better.<p><br>2.  The Reality Argument<p>The second argument I call The Reality Argument.  It is that NDE’s  FEEL so REAL that they must be  what they appear to be, a real journey to the next world. <br>By exploring the reasons why things seem real I have provided an alternative interpretation.  It is useful for us, as biological organisms, to separate what is real from what is not.  However, the distinction is largely artificial.  ALL we have is [the] model-building [capacity of the brain and nervous system] and we call some models "real" and some "imaginary."  The most STABLE and PERSISTENT ones, like those based on the senses, we call real.  The ones that affect the limbic system in certain ways we feel as "familiar" or "meaningful."  Mostly this works well, but during the NDE it leads us astray.  Stable tunnel forms in the cortex seem real.  An out-of-body perspective taken on in imagination seems real.  So the felt "realness" of the NDE’s is NO evidence that there is anyone to travel out of the body or any next world to go to.  The Dying Brain Hypothesis thus accounts better for why the experience seems so real and can also account for why obviously "unreal" things are seen in NDE’s as well.<p><br>3.  The Paranormal Argument<p>Third comes The Paranormal Argument.  That is that NDE’s involve paranormal events which cannot be explained by science.  Since they cannot be explained in any normal way they must be evidence that the NDE involves another dimension, another world, or the existence of a non-material spirit or soul.<br>This is NOT a good argument for The Afterlife Hypothesis for two reasons.  Firstly, I have cast considerable doubt on the evidence itself.  Many cases are simply very weak to start with, others become weaker the deeper you look into them and some have even been INVENTED altogether.  Secondly, even if the evidence were compelling, it could NOT be explained just by claiming that "There is an afterlife."  If the evidence changes in the future and truly convincing paranormal events are documented then certainly the theory I have proposed will have to be overthrown - along with a lot more of psychology, physics and biology - BUT THE AFTERLIFE THEORIES WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED HERE WILL NOT DO INSTEAD.<br>By contrast, The Dying Brain Hypothesis explains why people seek paranormal evidence to bolster their impression of realness and how the stories are passed on and elaborated.  By understanding the role of the limbic system and temporal lobe it accounts for the experiences of familiarity, insight and "deja vu" and for the increase in psychic-[seeming] experiences after the NDE.  I shall keep looking for evidence that might prove it wrong,, but for now The Dying Brain Hypothesis accounts better for what we know.<p><br>4.  The Transformation Argument<p>Finally, there is The Transformation Argument.  This is that people are changed by their NDE’s, sometimes dramatically for the better, becoming more spiritual and less materialistic.<br>The Afterlife Hypothesis attributes this to NDEers having a spiritual experience in another world.  IN FACT THIS DOES NOT REALLY EXPLAIN IT AT ALL.  THERE IS NO OBVIOUS REASON WHY AN AFTERLIFE SHOULD BE A BETTER ONE NOR WHY CONTACT WITH IT SHOULD MAKE PEOPLE WHO RETURN NICER.  THIS IS SIMPLY ASSUMED.<br>By contrast, The Dying Brain Hypothesis is compatible with two reasons for transformation.  One is simply that being made to THINK about death [concretely] can affect a person’s priorities deeply, whether it is their death or another’s and whether they have an NDE or not.  This alone can make them less selfish and more concerned for others.  The other is that coming close to death can provoke the insight that self was only a construction of the brain and nervous system;  that all the struggles, attachment and suffering of life depend on that artificial construction and that it can be let go.  There never was any SOLID SELF and there is no [substantial] self to die.  With this insight fear is left behind and life can be lived more directly and fully.  The Dying Brain Hypothesis accounts better  for the mystical insight of the NDE and  the changes it can bring about.<p><br>All things considered, I can see NO reason to adopt The Afterlife Hypothesis.  I am sure I shall remain in the minority for a long time to come, especially amongst NDErs, but for me the evidence and the arguments are overwhelming.  The Dying Brain Hypothesis, for all its shortcomings, does a better job of accounting for the experiences themselves.  And it reveals NOT a false hope of the self being perpetuated into an infinite and everlasting tomorrow by God (or whatever), BUT A GENUINE INSIGHT BEYOND THE SELF.<br>We are biological organisms, evolved in fascinating ways for NO purpose at all and with NO END in ANY MIND.  We are simply here and this is how it is.  I  have no [substantial] self and "I" own nothing.  There is NO ONE to die.  THERE IS JUST THIS MOEMENT, AND NOW THIS AND NOW THIS…<p><br>Regards, Clay S.<p>Material taken from "Dying to Live" by Susan Blackmore published by Prometheus Press<br>

: Susan Blackmore’s &quot;Near Death Experience&quot; had while ALIVE AND WELL

: 
: The Superstition propagated by those who have Near Death Experiences [NDE] while either CRITICALLY ILL or  NEAR DEATH is that they CANNOT happen under ANY OTHER CONDITIONS.  Such is NOT the case however, as Susan Blackmore relates:
: &quot;Under conditions of extreme tiredness and smoking hashish I had a NDE-type experience complete with tunnel and light, out-of-body travels, expansion and contraction of size, timelessness, a mystical experience and the decision to return; all occurring over a period of about two hours WHILE I WAS SITING UP AND QUITE ALIVE AND HEALTHY.  Hallucinogens such as LSD and the short-acting DMT can do the trick.
: This much seems clear:  that ALL the NDE features have been reported from NON-NEAR-DEATH CONDITIONS.&quot;

: 
: UPSHOT:  Both Blackmore and myself have had many or most of these types of Mystical and/or NDE experiences and we come to RADICALLY DIFFERENT conclusions about their NATURE.  If these experiences can be induced by drugs and illness on the one hand, and manipulation of the nervous system via meditation on the other, it seems EXCEEDINGLY LIKELY that they have their basis SOLELY in NEUROBIOLOGY and not in some &quot;Supernatural Realm(s)&quot; and/or Anthropomorphic God.

: Regards, Clay S.

: 
: SUSAN BLACKMORE ON NEAR DEATH AND MYSTICAL EXPERIENCES 

: 
: 1.  The Consistency Argument

: 
: The first argument for The After Life Hypothesis is The Consistency Argument.  This is that NDE’s are similar around the world and throughout history.  The only possible explanation for this, so the argument runs, is that NDE’s are just what they appear to be - a journey through a real tunnel to another world which awaits us after death.  Consistency, it is argued, amounts to evidence for an afterlife.  
: The consistency is certainly there.  We have explored may different kinds of NDEs and seen that, although no two are the same, there are consistent patterns:  the joy and peace; the tunnel; the light; the out-of-body experience; the life review and the dissolution into timelessness; the return to life and the changes it brings.  The consistency is there but this does NOT mean there is an afterlife.
: The joy and peace are consistent because of the natural opiates (endorphins and encephalins) released under stress.  The tunnel  +  light and noises are consistent because they depend on the structure of the brain’s cortex and what happens to it when it is deprived of oxygen or is affected by disinhibition and random activity.  The OBE [out-of-body experience] is consistent because it is the brain’s way of dealing with a breakdown in the body image and model of reality.  The life review is consistent because the endorphins and encephalins cause random activation and seizures in the temporal lobe and limbic system where memories are organized.  The same effect leads to the breakdown of time and its relationship to self.  And it is this dissolution of [the model of] self that accounts for the mystical experiences and aftereffects.
: NO Afterlife Hypothesis is required to account for the consistency of the NDE across times, peoples and cultures.  Indeed, The Dying Brain Hypothesis accounts for it much better.

: 
: 2.  The Reality Argument

: The second argument I call The Reality Argument.  It is that NDE’s  FEEL so REAL that they must be  what they appear to be, a real journey to the next world. 
: By exploring the reasons why things seem real I have provided an alternative interpretation.  It is useful for us, as biological organisms, to separate what is real from what is not.  However, the distinction is largely artificial.  ALL we have is [the] model-building [capacity of the brain and nervous system] and we call some models &quot;real&quot; and some &quot;imaginary.&quot;  The most STABLE and PERSISTENT ones, like those based on the senses, we call real.  The ones that affect the limbic system in certain ways we feel as &quot;familiar&quot; or &quot;meaningful.&quot;  Mostly this works well, but during the NDE it leads us astray.  Stable tunnel forms in the cortex seem real.  An out-of-body perspective taken on in imagination seems real.  So the felt &quot;realness&quot; of the NDE’s is NO evidence that there is anyone to travel out of the body or any next world to go to.  The Dying Brain Hypothesis thus accounts better for why the experience seems so real and can also account for why obviously &quot;unreal&quot; things are seen in NDE’s as well.

: 
: 3.  The Paranormal Argument

: Third comes The Paranormal Argument.  That is that NDE’s involve paranormal events which cannot be explained by science.  Since they cannot be explained in any normal way they must be evidence that the NDE involves another dimension, another world, or the existence of a non-material spirit or soul.
: This is NOT a good argument for The Afterlife Hypothesis for two reasons.  Firstly, I have cast considerable doubt on the evidence itself.  Many cases are simply very weak to start with, others become weaker the deeper you look into them and some have even been INVENTED altogether.  Secondly, even if the evidence were compelling, it could NOT be explained just by claiming that &quot;There is an afterlife.&quot;  If the evidence changes in the future and truly convincing paranormal events are documented then certainly the theory I have proposed will have to be overthrown - along with a lot more of psychology, physics and biology - BUT THE AFTERLIFE THEORIES WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED HERE WILL NOT DO INSTEAD.
: By contrast, The Dying Brain Hypothesis explains why people seek paranormal evidence to bolster their impression of realness and how the stories are passed on and elaborated.  By understanding the role of the limbic system and temporal lobe it accounts for the experiences of familiarity, insight and &quot;deja vu&quot; and for the increase in psychic-[seeming] experiences after the NDE.  I shall keep looking for evidence that might prove it wrong,, but for now The Dying Brain Hypothesis accounts better for what we know.

: 
: 4.  The Transformation Argument

: Finally, there is The Transformation Argument.  This is that people are changed by their NDE’s, sometimes dramatically for the better, becoming more spiritual and less materialistic.
: The Afterlife Hypothesis attributes this to NDEers having a spiritual experience in another world.  IN FACT THIS DOES NOT REALLY EXPLAIN IT AT ALL.  THERE IS NO OBVIOUS REASON WHY AN AFTERLIFE SHOULD BE A BETTER ONE NOR WHY CONTACT WITH IT SHOULD MAKE PEOPLE WHO RETURN NICER.  THIS IS SIMPLY ASSUMED.
: By contrast, The Dying Brain Hypothesis is compatible with two reasons for transformation.  One is simply that being made to THINK about death [concretely] can affect a person’s priorities deeply, whether it is their death or another’s and whether they have an NDE or not.  This alone can make them less selfish and more concerned for others.  The other is that coming close to death can provoke the insight that self was only a construction of the brain and nervous system;  that all the struggles, attachment and suffering of life depend on that artificial construction and that it can be let go.  There never was any SOLID SELF and there is no [substantial] self to die.  With this insight fear is left behind and life can be lived more directly and fully.  The Dying Brain Hypothesis accounts better  for the mystical insight of the NDE and  the changes it can bring about.

: 
: All things considered, I can see NO reason to adopt The Afterlife Hypothesis.

The Dying Brain Hypothesis, for all its shortcomings, does a better job of accounting for the experiences themselves.

: KUNDALINI AS THE NEW AGE DELUSION

: Dear Friends, 

: Please do not be fooled by &quot;Kundalini.&quot;  Not only do these weird symptoms NOT confirm Cult and New Age Doctrine, but, rather, a NATURALISTIC view of the human being and the human mind.  It's really nothing more than a very complex and many-faceted form of neurological destabilization! You can get much of the same effects from LSD, various systemic anesthetics and anoxia (lack of sufficient oxygen to the brain) in some Near Death Experiences.  Here are the symptoms which I have painfully experienced submitted below for your careful consideration.  Believe me, it's anything but pleasant; and I certainly wasn't piped revelations directly from the alleged Astral Planes, or &quot;hot off the Altar of God,&quot; during all this hell:

: Manifestations of &quot;Kundalini&quot; or Neurological Destabilization

: 
: (1)Affective Manifestations
: -panic attacks
: -objectless anxiety or free-floating anxiety
: -nightmares:  your worst and deepest fears actualized while dreaming (e.g. going to hell) 
: -rapid mood fluctuations
: -experience of emotional voids that need to be filled but are not
: -exceedingly powerful sense of cosmic meaninglessness and purposelessness
: -the feeling that one is dying inside, psychologically speaking

: 
: (ii)Physical Manifestations
: -rapid heart rate
: -asthma attacks
: -insomnia
: -chronic fatigue syndrome

: 
: (iii)Neurological Manifestations
: -feelings of heat in various parts of the body
: -hearing of loud popping noises much like the sound of a gun shot or a car backfiring  
: -small bursts of light like miniature stars exploding
: -luminous waves of light and other luminous geometric figures experienced
: -explosions of light
: -tunnels of light and a feeling of moving down them very rapidly experienced 
: -disinhibition of the cortex:  the experience of a pinpoint of light enlarging to fill one’s whole field of vision along with the concomitant experience of much heat in the area of the head during meditation
: -feeling that various energy blocks have &quot;opened&quot; with the simultaneous feeling than energy now flows freely through an area previously blocked
: -feeling of &quot;energy pressure&quot; at the crown of the head and/or in the middle of the forehead
: -feeling of powerful &quot;energy blockage&quot; and/or &quot;energy flows&quot; in the region of the heart
: -feeling of vibrations moving up and down the spine
: -various areas of the body &quot;breaking out&quot; in &quot;vibrations&quot; 
: -feeling of the free-flow of energy throughout the body
: -feeling of vibrations all over the body that others can often feel and very similar to what one experiences when connected up to a muscle stimulator but felt over large portions of the body
: -pervasive &quot;mental&quot; silences along with the stilling of much or most  &quot;mental&quot;  imagery

: 
: (iv)Cognitive Manifestations
: -alterations of sense-of-time
: -speech is experienced from less than fully meaningful, to meaningless, vibrations in the air
: -symbols (words, writing, mathematics) experienced as somewhat to totally arbitrary marks on paper
: -the collapse of the continuum of  time:  the feeling that one has no past or future and that there is only the present
: -being &quot;possessed&quot; by powerful visions and insights (of a philosophical, religious, psychological, or symbolic nature) that one has never had before
: -short bursts of creativity that one has never experienced before
: -prolonged outpourings of creativity that one has never experienced before

: 
: (v)Miscellaneous Manifestations
: -extremely rapid sequence of thoughts and internal imagery that is very difficult to stop
: -enormous magnification, for many years, of the sex drive with a precipitous decline when this phase runs its course.  There can also be oscillations between extreme sexual desire states and non-desire states as well.

: 
: May You find Love, true DISPASSION and TRUTH in the Moment.

WHY SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF NEUROLOGY VIS-À-VIS SPIRITUALITY<br>(quotation from "The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat" by Oliver Sacks)<p>Sometimes a man’s life may be  "…transformed by an organic disorder; and if so his story DOES require a physiological or neurological correlate.  This, of course, is so with all the patients here described."<br>"In this third section, the presenting feature IS reminiscence, altered perception, imagination, ‘dream.’  Such matters do not often come to neurological or medical notice.  Such ‘transports’  - often of poignant intensity, and shot through with personal feeling and meaning - tend to be seen, like dreams, as psychical [mental - he’s English]:  as a manifestation, perhaps, of unconscious or preconscious activity (or, in the mystically-minded, of something ‘spiritual’), NOT as something ‘medical,’ let alone ‘neurological.’  They have an intrinsic dramatic, or narrative, or personal ‘sense,’ and so are not apt to be seen as ‘symptoms.’  It may be in the nature of transports that they are more likely to be confided to psychoanalysts or confessors, to be seen as psychoses, or to be broadcast as religious revelations, rather than brought to physicians.  For it never occurs to us at first that a vision might be ‘medical;’ and if an organic basis is suspected or found, this may be felt to ‘devalue’ the vision."<br>Sacks goes on to say that an organic basis for these "visions" and "transports"  DOES NOT devalue them inasmuch as etiology as nothing to do with values.  As a strict philosophical point, he is totally correct.  However, pragmatically speaking, there is everything wrong with applying this sort of thinking to The New Age Inanity’s Cosmic Crocks!!  How many DIVERSE and MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE doctrines have been justified on this, or similar, bases?!?  How many CONTRADICTORY and UNINTELLIGIBLE "revelations" have we heard of from these Mystics and Gurus?  And what genuine and verifiable revelations, to paraphrase the physicist Victor J. Stenger,  have all these wacko Mystics and New Age Kooks EVER come up with?  NONE, of course.

: WHY SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF NEUROLOGY VIS-À-VIS SPIRITUALITY
: (quotation from &quot;The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat&quot; by Oliver Sacks)

: Sometimes a man’s life may be  &quot;…transformed by an organic disorder; and if so his story DOES require a physiological or neurological correlate.  This, of course, is so with all the patients here described.&quot;
: &quot;In this third section, the presenting feature IS reminiscence, altered perception, imagination, ‘dream.’  Such matters do not often come to neurological or medical notice.  Such ‘transports’  - often of poignant intensity, and shot through with personal feeling and meaning - tend to be seen, like dreams, as psychical [mental - he’s English]:  as a manifestation, perhaps, of unconscious or preconscious activity (or, in the mystically-minded, of something ‘spiritual’), NOT as something ‘medical,’ let alone ‘neurological.’  They have an intrinsic dramatic, or narrative, or personal ‘sense,’ and so are not apt to be seen as ‘symptoms.’  It may be in the nature of transports that they are more likely to be confided to psychoanalysts or confessors, to be seen as psychoses, or to be broadcast as religious revelations, rather than brought to physicians.  For it never occurs to us at first that a vision might be ‘medical;’ and if an organic basis is suspected or found, this may be felt to ‘devalue’ the vision.&quot;
: Sacks goes on to say that an organic basis for these &quot;visions&quot; and &quot;transports&quot;  DOES NOT devalue them inasmuch as etiology as nothing to do with values.  As a strict philosophical point, he is totally correct.  However, pragmatically speaking, there is everything wrong with applying this sort of thinking to The New Age Inanity’s Cosmic Crocks!!  How many DIVERSE and MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE doctrines have been justified on this, or similar, bases?!?  How many CONTRADICTORY and UNINTELLIGIBLE &quot;revelations&quot; have we heard of from these Mystics and Gurus?  And what genuine and verifiable revelations, to paraphrase the physicist Victor J. Stenger,  have all these wacko Mystics and New Age Kooks EVER come up with?  NONE, of course.  They’ve ALL turned out to be either (i) Delusions and Superstitions, or (ii) Variations on some well-known religio-philosophical theme(s).   

: Friends, we MUST eschew, to the highest possible degree, making religious utterances IMMUNE from verification or falsification by making these same cherished views a matter of religious metaphysics.  The true religious intellectual sophisticate can always AVOID verification or falsification by saying (when science comes to a point where it can make EMPIRICAL tests of what was previously a matter of religious metaphysics) &quot;Well I knew all along that all TALK about, and ALLEGED EXPERIENCES OF ‘X,’ pertained  to  purely natural phenomena.  However, this doesn’t change my views on ‘X’ at all since they are  part of my religious metaphysics.&quot; 
: One of my best friends has used the above argument on me for two years with regard to Life after Death.  Now that science can investigate, in great empirical detail using EEG’s, MRI’s and PET’s, the claims that Near Death Experiences are veridical visions of an actual after life, my friend says to me, when the arguments for The Dying Brain Hypothesis are presented, &quot;This just confirms what I already suspected, viz., that these visions are just purely natural processes and hallucinations.  However this has NO BEARING on Life after Death since it’s really a metaphysical issue after all.&quot;  Never mind the fact that the Catholic Church, almost from its inception, was OFFICIALLY looking for those who had a glimpse of the alleged &quot;afterlife;&quot; never mind the fact that so very many persons who have had these Near Death Visions BELIEVE that they are VERIDICAL; never mind the fact that my friend is a Priest BEHAVIORALLY REINFORCING the Life after Death belief every time he says the Liturgy and the Creeds of the Church which explicitly affirm &quot;the Life Eternal.&quot;     

: Every Crack Pot View can protect itself from verification or falsification by making its claims a matter of metaphysics.  Thus, pragmatically speaking, we MUST apply a Principle of Parsimony with regard to the use of metaphysics and keep the metaphysics down to an ABSOLUTE minimum in all matters religious!  
: This is a DIRECT CHALLENGE to all of you out there that affirm The New Age Vapidity and many other LESS QUESTIONABLE forms of Spirituality as well.

Posted by <a href="mailto:Emptiness@aol.com">Clay S.</a> on December 02, 1996 at 16:47:57:<p>
MYSTICAL RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY AS THE BIGGEST ILLUSION OF THEM ALL<p>Dear Friends,<p>After much discussion with some of you via E-mail and IM Chat, along with incredibly much reflection over the last six months, I have come to the conclusion that is embodied in the title of this essay, viz., that Mysticism and Spirituality are the biggest illusions of them all!  Why do I say this?  Well, it’s not because I got nothing out of my 15 years plus of meditation practice.  On the contrary, there were all sorts of (often very difficult and painful) "Wild, Wacky, and Weird" neurological experiences that still unfold to this very day.  And it is precisely BECAUSE so much has changed, for me, neurologically speaking, that I am taking the exceedingly critical view of Mysticism and Spirituality that I do.  So for those of you who fervently desire  to know  the TRUTH of Spirituality and Mysticism (aside from all the bogus teachings and abusive Gurus) and who are dedicated to the Truth above all else,  I offer to you, for your careful consideration,  the reflections below:<p>(1)  Cosmic Megalomania and Cosmic Egotism:  The Delusive Pursuit of  "The Supreme Identity"<p>(a)  Egregious Manifestations:  <br>Spirituality encourages us to forget about our mundane and this-worldly identities and pursue, instead,  The Supreme Identity, as the Pope of The New Age Obfuscation, Ken Wilber, would have it.  We all know what happens when the human ego is magnified to cosmic dimensions:  Religious Cults and Guru’s delusions of godhood and bogus claims to "paranormal powers," sexual exploitation and manipulation, and so on.  Given the outrageous abuses and unmitigated corruption [IN MY OPINION] of "enlightened sages" like Adi Da, Muktananda, Gurumayi and Sai Baba, we have exceedingly good reasons to suspect ANY form of Spirituality which replaces this-worldly identities with some vapid and homogeneous Cosmic Identity.  The potentials for abuse in this regard are legion. <p>(b)  More Subtle Manifestations:<br>Astute psychological observers will notice how COMPLETELY so very many persons who head up the non-abusive and non-problematic Spirituality Communities buy into the role of either their "godhood" on the one hand, or their "Cosmically Enlightened Status" on the other.  Almost always, in cases of this sort,  the individuals concerned are really good, decent, insightful and compassionate persons.  The essence of their problem is this:  they simply DO NOT SEE  how TOTALLY and COMPLETELY they’ve bought into the role of the "Enlightened Master" or "Cosmic Enlightenment."  Perhaps if they had a little more psychological insight in this most tricky and subtle area, they would see how really POMPOUS, INANE and terribly CONDESCENDING the "Cosmic" roles and affectations really are!!  After all, they are just ordinary human beings like the rest of us.  <p>(3)  The Mechanisms of Mystical Experiences <br>If one investigates Near Death Experiences, LSD Experiences, Epilepsy, Cortex Disinhibition (the random firing of neurons in the brain), Anoxia (lack of sufficient oxygen to the brain), Agnosia (loss of comprehension, to one degree or another, of emotive or expressive meaning), Aphasia (absence or impairment of the ability to understand the cognitive meaning of speech, writing or signs) and other things that damage the nervous system and brain, one finds that ALL the Mystical Experiences reported in the classical literature on the subject of  Mysticism are reproduced by these neurobiological disorders, hallucinogenic drugs, and so forth.  This makes the case of  New Age Supernaturalist’s like Ken Wilber look increasingly weak.<p>What, however, about the person who has NEVER had mystical experiences, totally LACKS any underlying neurological disorders, and then begins having them (Mystical Experiences) as a result of meditation?  Isn’t this the result of the activity of God, the Absolute, the "Intrinsically Enlightened Mind" or other unspecified immaterial realities on the "soul" or consciousness of the meditator?  <p>Before answering this question  three basic observations need to be made.   First, the dedicated meditation fanatic is heavily steeped in mystical literature like The Dhammapada, The Tao Te Ching, and The Ashtavakra Gita, or even the writings of St. John of the Cross, Rusybroeck, and Meister Eckhart.  Here, we see that cognition is being impacted in a major way by a complete assimilation of these classic texts and writings.

: MYSTICAL RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY AS THE BIGGEST ILLUSION OF THEM ALL

: Dear Friends,

: After much discussion with some of you via E-mail and IM Chat, along with incredibly much reflection over the last six months, I have come to the conclusion that is embodied in the title of this essay, viz., that Mysticism and Spirituality are the biggest illusions of them all!  Why do I say this?  Well, it’s not because I got nothing out of my 15 years plus of meditation practice.  On the contrary, there were all sorts of (often very difficult and painful) &quot;Wild, Wacky, and Weird&quot; neurological experiences that still unfold to this very day.  And it is precisely BECAUSE so much has changed, for me, neurologically speaking, that I am taking the exceedingly critical view of Mysticism and Spirituality that I do.  So for those of you who fervently desire  to know  the TRUTH of Spirituality and Mysticism (aside from all the bogus teachings and abusive Gurus) and who are dedicated to the Truth above all else,  I offer to you, for your careful consideration,  the reflections below:

: (1)  Cosmic Megalomania and Cosmic Egotism:  The Delusive Pursuit of  &quot;The Supreme Identity&quot;

: (a)  Egregious Manifestations:  
: Spirituality encourages us to forget about our mundane and this-worldly identities and pursue, instead,  The Supreme Identity, as the Pope of The New Age Obfuscation, Ken Wilber, would have it.  We all know what happens when the human ego is magnified to cosmic dimensions:  Religious Cults and Guru’s delusions of godhood and bogus claims to &quot;paranormal powers,&quot; sexual exploitation and manipulation, and so on.  Given the outrageous abuses and unmitigated corruption [IN MY OPINION] of &quot;enlightened sages&quot; like Adi Da, Muktananda, Gurumayi and Sai Baba, we have exceedingly good reasons to suspect ANY form of Spirituality which replaces this-worldly identities with some vapid and homogeneous Cosmic Identity.  The potentials for abuse in this regard are legion. 

: (b)  More Subtle Manifestations:
: Astute psychological observers will notice how COMPLETELY so very many persons who head up the non-abusive and non-problematic Spirituality Communities buy into the role of either their &quot;godhood&quot; on the one hand, or their &quot;Cosmically Enlightened Status&quot; on the other.  Almost always, in cases of this sort,  the individuals concerned are really good, decent, insightful and compassionate persons.  The essence of their problem is this:  they simply DO NOT SEE  how TOTALLY and COMPLETELY they’ve bought into the role of the &quot;Enlightened Master&quot; or &quot;Cosmic Enlightenment.&quot;  Perhaps if they had a little more psychological insight in this most tricky and subtle area, they would see how really POMPOUS, INANE and terribly CONDESCENDING the &quot;Cosmic&quot; roles and affectations really are!!  After all, they are just ordinary human beings like the rest of us.  

: (3)  The Mechanisms of Mystical Experiences 
: If one investigates Near Death Experiences, LSD Experiences, Epilepsy, Cortex Disinhibition (the random firing of neurons in the brain), Anoxia (lack of sufficient oxygen to the brain), Agnosia (loss of comprehension, to one degree or another, of emotive or expressive meaning), Aphasia (absence or impairment of the ability to understand the cognitive meaning of speech, writing or signs) and other things that damage the nervous system and brain, one finds that ALL the Mystical Experiences reported in the classical literature on the subject of  Mysticism are reproduced by these neurobiological disorders, hallucinogenic drugs, and so forth.  This makes the case of  New Age Supernaturalist’s like Ken Wilber look increasingly weak.

: What, however, about the person who has NEVER had mystical experiences, totally LACKS any underlying neurological disorders, and then begins having them (Mystical Experiences) as a result of meditation?  Isn’t this the result of the activity of God, the Absolute, the &quot;Intrinsically Enlightened Mind&quot; or other unspecified immaterial realities on the &quot;soul&quot; or consciousness of the meditator?  

: Before answering this question  three basic observations need to be made.   First, the dedicated meditation fanatic is heavily steeped in mystical literature like The Dhammapada, The Tao Te Ching, and The Ashtavakra Gita, or even the writings of St. John of the Cross, Rusybroeck, and Meister Eckhart.  Here, we see that cognition is being impacted in a major way by a complete assimilation of these classic texts and writings.  Second, the dedicated meditation fanatic practices, exceedingly carefully, observing MUCH bodily behavior OUTSIDE formal meditation practice.  Here we see that behavior is being impacted in a major way by the assiduous practice of meditation in ordinary life. Thirdly, the dedicated meditation fanatic sits around for hours per day for years manipulating his or her breath, attention and nervous system.  Moreover,  the meditation fanatic often goes on fasts which impacts the body in a major way as well.  Now in light of all this, I AM SURPRISED AS HELL that ANYONE can think that the mechanisms of action of meditation are ANYTHING BUT (i) Cognitive, (ii) Behavioral, and (iii) Neurological.  Where in all this is there room for the Supernaturalist Cosmic Crock of  Nonsense that is so pervasive in The New Age Stupidity today?

: What are the actual mechanisms of action of Mystical Experience?  They are as follows:

: THE MYSTICS LIGHTS AND LUMINOSITY’S:
: Intensive and protracted meditation  DESTABILIZES  and  DAMAGES the nervous system which results in self-induced epilepsy of various sorts along with the ability control and sustain Cortex Disinhibition (a form of sustained Epileptic Seizure). This, in turn, stimulates the visual cortex producing the &quot;Mystical Light Show.&quot;

: THE MYSTIC’S ALTERED SENSES OF MEANING AND EMOTION:
: In this case, the Mystic has a mix of agnosia and aphasia via anoxia, self-induced epilepsy and controlled cortical disinhibition affecting most or all modules of the brain.

: THE MYSTIC’S EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO CHANGE AND THE WORLD PROCESS:
: Constant low-level cortical and muscular disinhibition make the Mystic extremely sensitive to change and movement outside of  deep absorptive meditation.  Neurological defenses have been dismantled to such an extent that the Mystic is &quot;at the mercy,&quot; to one degree or another, of his or her internal and external world.  It is no wonder that the more &quot;meditatively advanced&quot; among them choose a life of solitude and teaching instead of engaging the TERRIBLY NOISY and CHAOTIC world.  Their experience of &quot;the world&quot; has become oppressive, indeed, due to the extreme sensitivity of the body to the subtlest changes.    

: &quot;THE ETERNAL NOW&quot; AS A FORM OF AMNESIA
: &quot;The Eternal Now,&quot; or life as happening in one grandiose PRESENT, is merely the result of a form of self-induced amnesia, somewhat like anterograde amnesia but somewhat less severe.  Bernadette Robert tells us that &quot;…the passing of each experience leaves nothing in its wake, hardly a footprint, and certainly not a vivid memory.  In a word, one learns to live without a past.&quot;

: THE MYSTICS PROFOUND INTERNAL SILENCES AND BODILY STILLNESS
: With regard to bodily stillness, the Mystic has so damaged his or her nervous system that ANY and ALL extraneous movement is experienced as from somewhat to very painful.  It is no wonder, here, that they are so very still with regard to NEEDLESS bodily movement.

: With regard to the enormous diminution of internal dialogue and internal imagery, this can be accounted for, partially,  on the basis of the neuro-epileptic mechanisms I mentioned above.  Another component of this is that one can CULTIVATE and DEVELOP an enormous measure of control over the process of &quot;talking to oneself&quot; and &quot;internal image production.&quot;  The final component to the Mystic’s silences is the enormous slowing down of the physiology, self-induced HYPOTENSION, and enormously slowed rate of the breath.  As an experiment, exhale all the air out of your lungs and hold for 10 seconds.  Can you think easily?  Of course not!!  Now the Mystic has so slowed his or her breathing rate that it frequently and almost stops OUTSIDE of meditation.  It is no wonder that thinking is so difficult and there is so much SILENCE.  

: 
: (5)  Given the sheer numbers of persons in Spirituality today on, engaging in, subscribing to, or suffering from  (a) spiritual head and ego trips, (b) power, money and status trips, (c) delusions of  &quot;godhood&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Enlightenment,&quot; (d) self-induced epilepsy plus self-induced muscular and cortical disinhibition, (e) bogus New Age &quot;Science,&quot; (f) groundless and/or unintelligible claims of &quot;Quantum Consciousness,&quot; (g) wacky and wrong interpretations of modern cosmology and quantum physics,  (f) outrageous Superstitions and wildly irrational beliefs in magic, the paranormal, the occult and the supernatural, (g) clinical depression and existential disillusionment, (h) wrong and/or superficial appropriations of the works of great philosophers and scientists, and so on AD NAUSEAM, there are the best of reasons WHY contemporary Spirituality has intrinsic and ineradicable ethical, cognitive and axiological difficulties.

: 
: CONCLUSION:  
: In light of all the above, we have incredibly cogent grounds for (i) staying as far away from the Cosmic Crock that is contemporary Spirituality as possible,  (ii) a total repudiation of purveyors of philosophical drivel and cognitive obfuscation like Ken Wilber,  (iii) thinking that the infrastructure of contemporary Spirituality is informed by BOGUS science plus manifold and egregious SUPERSTITIONS, (iv) seeking the help of professional neurologists and neuropsychiatrists if the neurological impact of intensive and risky meditation practices proves too much for the delicate human nervous system of a given individual.

: All in all, the whole pile of COSMIC CRAP that is Contemporary Spirituality is a totally failed religious, philosophical, social, cultural, and axiological venture.

 THERE IS NO PASSION AND RAGE<p>The absolute irony of all this is that the neurological changes I've been through have EFFACED much of my affective infrastructure.  True, I can still write AS IF I have a lot of passion.  But I do not feel any of this deeply.  Read (1)"The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" by Oliver Sacks and (2)"The Experience of No Self" by Bernadette Roberts in order to see for yourself what these neurological changes can do to one afectively speaking.  Of course, I DO NOT subscribe to Ms. Roberts Neoplatonist reading of her experiences!<p>Clay S.

:  THERE IS NO PASSION AND RAGE

: The absolute irony of all this is that the neurological changes I've been through have EFFACED much of my affective infrastructure.  True, I can still write AS IF I have a lot of passion.  But I do not feel any of this deeply.  Read (1)&quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot; by Oliver Sacks and (2)&quot;The Experience of No Self&quot; by Bernadette Roberts in order to see for yourself what these neurological changes can do to one afectively speaking.  Of course, I DO NOT subscribe to Ms. Roberts Neoplatonist reading of her experiences!

: Clay S.

Hi I live in MS.  The state next to us has a creationist governor who is in control of the school board.  The other day I saw a bumper sticker that read (along with two Confederate flags) "DON'T BLAME ME, I VOTED FOR JEFFERSON DAVIS."  I now beg all skeptics looking for a place to live to move here.  Perhaps "skeptic" is too picky, I'll be happy if mildly intelligent people move here.  I'd cite more specific examples, but it's really just the general nimbus of stupidity and intolerance that surrounds the state that bothers me.  Please send skeptic relief.<br>

Anyone who bases a society on the laws of natural selection is as religious as he who bases it on a holy book. Only the name of the god differs. A rationalist society, on the other hand, would not be very different from today's western world (as stated before in the thread). In northern Europe, where I live, we have largely the same celebrations as before christianity, only we (in some cases) call them by christian names and add a few christian stories to them. As regards humanitarian values, I reckon they are in no way opposed to a rational world-view, though the opposite might be said about some religious ones.<p>Humbly<p>

<br>: Ryan,<p>:     I guess you were right about two things in your reply:  There wasn't enough sacarsm in your original "help" statement and that being afraid of Satanism is like being afraid of being abducted by aliens.  I overeacted to the situation based on others circumstances.  Because she takes anti-deppressants for the last 4 years with little help I just wanted to ensure that she was not involved for the wrong reasons. Paganism and wicca WILL tend to attract some of the "wrong crowd" just from its bad connotations.  There are people willing to take advantage of others in all walks of life.<p>:                                  John<p>I take exception with the statement that there is nothing more to fear from satanists and newagers then there is to fear from aliens.  Aliens only exist in theory, whereas cult religions can do much harm.

: I have to write a paper for my philosophy class and I'm having trouble finding information on revolutionary science and normal science.  This is with reguards to Thomas S. Kuhn: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.  Can anyone help?  sfriese@helios.acomp.usf.edu<p><br>      <br>For your entertainment and perhaps dismay please check<br>http://www.weather.org/ The MOST important book ever written for<br>understanding (and forecasting) weather can be read online. Title:"The<br>Revolution in the Understanding of Weather".Library of Congress Card Number<br>83-90086. Author is former weather officer (Major) US AIRFORCE.<br>This book is THE LEADING EDGE of weather forecasting and has caused a<br>disturbance among those wedded to the "numerical equations" requiring the<br>use of the largest computers.<br>Unfortunately my book requires peer review by any individual who has<br>knowledge of high school geometry.

: : I have to write a paper for my philosophy class and I'm having trouble finding information on revolutionary science and normal science.  This is with reguards to Thomas S. Kuhn: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.  Can anyone help?  sfriese@helios.acomp.usf.edu

: 
:       
: For your entertainment and perhaps dismay please check
: http://www.weather.org/ The MOST important book ever written for
: understanding (and forecasting) weather can be read online. Title:&quot;The
: Revolution in the Understanding of Weather&quot;.Library of Congress Card Number
: 83-90086. Author is former weather officer (Major) US AIRFORCE.
: This book is THE LEADING EDGE of weather forecasting and has caused a
: disturbance among those wedded to the &quot;numerical equations&quot; requiring the
: use of the largest computers.
: Unfortunately my book requires peer review by any individual who has
: knowledge of high school geometry. Even without high school geometry,
: any literate adult will recognize the astonishing information being
: presented. The purveyors of the numerical procedures for weather
: forecasting have no inkling of how to use the forces exposed in this
: book.
: Unfortunately I must expose the flaws of peer review, since there has
: been a loss of tens of BILLIONS of dollars for weather research,for
: using obsolescent procedures for forecasting, and for the loss of higher
: quality forecasts since 1978. Thanks to the Internet I am now actively 
: spreading this information (and much more) throughout the entire world.
: Now for peer review, which should be properly called &quot;review by
: competitors&quot;.Everything must be reviewed by someone but don't give undue
: respect to the reviewers who in most cases are the competitors. How
: about IBM reviewing COMPAQ or APPLE computers and visa versa; and Ford
: reviewing General Motors or Honda; or AT&T reviewing MCI or Sprint; or
: Netscape reviewing Microsoft Explorer browser;or Lockheed reviewing
: Boeing;and I am sure you can add your list to run from the floor to the
: ceiling.
: The book was self published since the meteorological journals supported
: by tax funds would not publish the charts I presented.  Oops, I only have
: a B.S. degree in meteorology from The University of Chicago plus graduate 
: training at UCLA when in the Air Force plus over fifty years of research in how
: the weather works. The book was purchased by the US AIRFORCE,US NAVY,
: libraries of GM, DuPont,White Sands, The Hurricane Forecast Center (Miami),
: many universities, four weather centrals in Canada and many other foreign countries. 
: If anyone in  your office has had high school geometry you won't need anybody
: else to peer review what I am presenting.  I have much, much more astonishing
: information literally worth hundreds of BILLIONS throughout the world.
: All I request is that the laws of this country be obeyed and those responsible do the
: right thing as soon as possible, especially since there is a great brouhaha about 
: balancing the budget.

<H1><EM>Skeptic</EM> Magazine Interview With Robert Sternberg on <EM>The Bell Curve</EM></H1>
<H2><A HREF = "03.3.about-miele.html">Interview by Frank Miele</A></H2>

Even though it was written for the media, Herrnstein and Murray's book
has greatly increased public confusion and misconception about the
relationship between heritability and environment.

<P>Robert Sternberg's history with intelligence testing has been
described as a lifelong love-hate affair. In the 6th grade, suffering
from test anxiety, he performed so poorly on a standardized test the
school authorities made him take the test a second time with a group
of 5th graders. Feeling confident among that group, he did quite
well. (He describes the incident and its effect on him and his
subsequent research in more detail in the interview.)  By the 7th
grade he had developed his own intelligence test dubbed the STOMA-the
Sternberg Test of Mental Ability (he was certainly not lacking in
initiative). As an undergraduate, Sternberg majored in psychology at
Yale, and managed to get only a "C" in his introductory psych
course. Once again he proved that such early predictors are not all
they are cracked up to be. By the time he was a graduate student in
psychology at Stanford, his doctoral work earned him the Sidney Siegel
Memorial Award. He has worked at the Admissions Office and the
Institutional Research Office at Yale University, the Test Division of
the Psychological Corporation, and at the Educational Testing Service
(ETS).
<P>   Sternberg's early work built on the standard psychometric
conception of intelligence as a single, general trait (Spearman's
g). His Componential Theory broke g down into its underlying
information processing components.  But Sternberg found that even his
Componential Theory and the tests he developed to measure the
component processes still missed a lot. Individuals who scored highly
on Sternberg's early test still were not guaranteed success and many
individuals who did not score as well went on to have a better record
of real life accomplishments than did those who scored well on his or
on other traditional tests.
<P>   Sternberg has moved beyond the Componential Theory to what is now
known as the Triarchic Theory of Intelligence. In his view, the
Triarchic Theory does not disprove either g or his earlier
Componential Theory, but rather subsumes them under a larger
framework.
<P>   The Triarchic Theory posits three facets that make up what we call
intelligence (and for Sternberg that term, when properly defined and
measured, must translate into real life success). The three facets
are: (1) Analytical Intelligence, which is similar to the standard
psychometric definition of intelligence and corresponds to his earlier
Componential Intelligence. It is measured by analogies and puzzles and
reflects how an individual relates to his internal world; (2) Creative
Intelligence which involves insight, synthesis, and the ability to
react to novel stimuli and situations. This is the Experiential aspect
of intelligence and reflects how an individual connects the internal
world to external reality; (3) Practical Intelligence, which involves
the ability to grasp, understand, and solve real life problems in the
everyday jungle of life. This is the contextual aspect of
intelligence, and reflects how the individual relates to the external
world about him. In short, practical intelligence is "street smarts."
<P>   The Sternberg Multidimensional Abilities Test measures all three
(on separate scales). All three are important to success in life and
have been used to develop programs for children and to select business
managers. Together, the three measures provided more information than
just the analytical intelligence measured by standard IQ tests on
which, in Sternberg's view, our society has placed far too much
emphasis.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM> went to Professor Sternberg to get his view of the
controversial book <EM>The Bell Curve</EM> (see the interview with its
co-author Charles Murray in the previous issue of <EM>Skeptic</EM>). Having
first discovered, then grasped, and for years fondled its trunk,
Sternberg feels that the standard psychometric interpretation (on
which so much of <EM>The Bell Curve</EM> (is based) has mistaken the elephant
of intelligence for nothing more than a big and powerful snake.
<P>   Sternberg also strongly believes that all three aspects of
intelligence can not only be measured, but also developed. While he
sees this technology as still being in the infant stage, Sternberg
believes it (and not just measurement and selection) is the goal on
which society should focus.
<P>   In 1981, Sternberg received the Distinguished Scientist Award for
Early Contribution of Psychology. The citation read, in part, "He has
put intelligence into investigations of intellectual
abilities...combining experimental methods and theories of cognitive
psychology with traditional mental-testing ideas in analyzing
intelligent performance and individual differences...[and has]
cross-fertilized and infused vitality into studies of individual
differences and the experimental analysis of intellectual
performances." He is currently IBM Professor of Education and
Psychology at Yale and the author of <EM>The Triarchic Mind</EM>, and
<EM>Intelligence, Information Processing and Analogical Reasoning</EM>. He is
also the editor of <EM>The Encyclopedia of Intelligence</EM>, and on the
editorial board of Intelligence, the leading scientific journal in the
field of intelligence and mental ability.
<P>   Like Charles Murray, Robert Sternberg thinks that the study of
intelligence is vitally important to the health and survival of our
society, but oh how their diagnoses and prescriptions differ-to the
point of possible allegations of quackery and malpractice! Here then
is what "the Street Smart Psychologist" had to say about <EM>The Bell
Curve</EM>.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: At <EM>Skeptic</EM> magazine, we are interested in examining the
evidence for all claims. Herrnstein and Murray present what they
consider to be the consensus of scholars working in the field of
intelligence. Snyderman and Rothman (<EM>The IQ Controversy</EM>) present
similar data and there was a statement recently in the <EM>The Wall Street
Journal</EM>. You summarized this so-called consensus, if I can paraphrase,
in the following manner, "IQ exists, it's heritable, there are group
differences, and all this matters." But in your review of <EM>The Bell
Curve</EM> you say, "the lay public remains sadly uninformed.  Nothing
could be further from the truth." So as <EM>Skeptic</EM>s our question is, if
there is this much disagreement, is psychology even a science in the
same sense that physics is?

<P>Sternberg: There is disagreement in physics and there is disagreement
in biology. Active sciences always have disagreements within them. The
general public usually doesn't get the full sense of the amount of
disagreement because the information is filtered through the media and
what comes out is only a portion of what's actually going on in
science. Normally they would not even be aware of the disagreement in
psychology except that this book (<EM>The Bell Curve</EM>) was written for the
media. It was written with the purpose of stirring up this kind of
controversy. So the general public becomes aware of these types of
disagreements in psychology, but they exist in every active science.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Which then is a fairer description of your own position-(1)
there is a consensus on the topics that Herrnstein and Murray discuss,
or (2) yes, there is a consensus among psychometricians, but I (Robert
Sternberg) and others disagree with it?

<P>Sternberg: To the extent that there is a consensus it is certainly not
Herrnstein's and Murray's. You mentioned the statement that appeared
in the <EM>The Wall Street Journal</EM>, which a number of psychometricians
signed. This statement was not totally coincident with the views of
Herrnstein and Murray.  It certainly wasn't coincident with mine. I
would say that I don't think that consensus in science makes much
difference. Science isn't done by majority rule. There is a
misperception on the part of the public that even if you took a vote
and 51% of the scientists said, "I think this is true," that would
have any impact on whether it's really true or not. Science is not
politics. There could be one person who believes something and that
person might be right. In fact, most of the really important work in
science has been the result of one person saying, "You guys are all
wet, you're full of it!" and then proceeding to show that he is indeed
right. So I think the conception of science as taking a vote, and
whichever side gets 51% is right, is simply wrong. Science is not
politics, we're not electing anyone.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: OK. Let's go point by point through the earlier paraphrase of
what's in <EM>The Bell Curve</EM>. Let's take the concept of general mental
ability, which Herrnstein and Murray invoke, versus Gardner's "Seven
Intelligences" or your own "Triarchic Mind," which uses the concepts
of Analytical Intelligence, Creative Intelligence, and Practical
Intelligence. You once wrote in an article that, "We interpret the
preponderance of evidence as overwhelmingly supporting the existence
of some kind of general factor in human intelligence. Indeed, we are
unable to find any convincing evidence at all that militates against
this view." So how then is your approach different than the approach
of the g-theorists that Herrnstein and Murray invoke?

<P>Sternberg: That article was published in 1983, I believe, and was
based on work that I had done in the late 70s and early 80s. What I
found at that time was that if you use the kinds of tasks that are
used in intelligence tests, then you will get the g factor. That
statement reflected analyses we did that instead of using individual
difference analysis used process analysis. Even using process
analysis, we got a general factor. So if you were to ask me, "Do I
think that there is general factor in the kinds of tests that
psychometricians use?" I would say "Yes." That is a different question
from, "If you define intelligence, not just as IQ, but as involving
more than what the IQ tests in fact test, is there then a general
factor?" then I would say the answer is "No." So the way
psychometricians operationalize it, you get a g factor. But I think,
as do many other people, that is a narrow view of intelligence.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Would it be fair to say that your view is not that g does not
exist, but that it is one facet or one side of the picture?

<P>Sternberg: That's right, g is not quite as general as some
psychometricians make it out to be.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Let's turn to the heritability of IQ. Let's just look at
that, as you described it, narrow measure we call IQ score, within the
white population. Herrnstein and Murray repeat the same numbers that
we find in reviews of the literature by Erlenmeyer-Kimling and Jarvik,
Bouchard and others. Do you have any disagreement with or criticism of
their estimate of .40 to .80 as the heritability of IQ score within
the white population?

<P>Sternberg: I think that there is definitely some heritability of
intelligence in the White population. Almost every psychologist
believes there is some heritability of IQ and I agree. But the public
may not understand just what that means. If you accept the use of the
heritability statistic, about .5 is probably right.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Can you explain wherein the general public's conception or
the media's description of what is meant by heritability is wrong?

<P>Sternberg: The commonplace understanding of heritability often doesn't
realize that heritability is calculated within a range of
environments, at a given time, for a given population. So heritability
is not the same in every population. In fact there is wide variation
in populations over time and space. It is not a fixed statistic. The
value you obtain (for heritability) depends on the population, where
it is, and when it is. But the major misunderstanding relates to the
role of the environment and to the role of teachability. With respect
to teachability, even if heritability is fairly high, it does not mean
that we cannot modify intelligence.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: What exactly do you mean by that?

<P>Sternberg: What I mean is that there is absolutely no relation between
how heritable something is and the existence of a difference in group
means. The most common example is height. Height has a heritability of
greater than .9, but heights have increased quite dramatically in some
countries like Japan and have also increased in our own country over
the course of several generations. So despite the much higher
heritability of height than anyone believes of intelligence, we see
that height can increase. To take a more extreme example: there is a
disease known as Phenylketonuria (PKU), which is 100% heritable and
yet through an environmental intervention, namely withholding
Phenylalanine from the diets of infants from birth, you can either
reduce or eliminate the mental retardation that normally results. In
other words, even when heritability is 1.00, environmental
interventions still matter. There are different ways to look at
intelligence. One is to do heritability statistics, which I've never
found to be that helpful. Another way is to look at studies on
intervention. For example, Dennis did a large study in Iran where he
found that kids that were placed in Iranian orphanages, almost without
exception, were mentally retarded, whereas the children who were
quickly adopted before the age of two scored at normal levels on
intelligence tests, roughly a 50-point difference in obtained IQ.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Are such results repeatable?

<P>Sternberg: Yes. Obviously the environment of the Iranian orphanage was
pretty bad and that's why you got that level of retardation. But if
you look at the kinds of environments some of our least fortunate get,
even in the United States, in the inner cities, they are not so hot
either. Diamond performed studies on brain mass in rats and found that
if you give them an enriched environment, it affects the brain, which
becomes heavier and more convoluted.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: How is your more elaborate view of heritability and its
limitations different from what Herrnstein and Murray say in <EM>The Bell
Curve</EM>?  Sternberg: The way that book is written is to, I think, say X
on page 605 in sentence 8, with an appropriate caution, and then
invite the reader to a somewhat more extreme conclusion elsewhere. So
if you were to ask, "Is there anywhere in <EM>The Bell Curve</EM> that explains
what heritability truly is?" there probably is. If you were to ask,
"What inference do Herrnstein and Murray invite their readers to
draw?" they go beyond what they know. For example, with regard to race
differences, Herrnstein and Murray invite the reader to conclude that
race differences are due to genetics, even though they have no
evidence of that, and they know it.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: They do review studies that deal with race differences.

<P>Sternberg: Yes, but there is evidence that they do not review at
all. There is nothing in the book that suggests that race differences
are genetic. They even say that. But what they do say is that is what
we would infer given the data, even though probably somewhere else,
they would have one sentence to the effect that there is one
study. And they don't cite a number of studies that suggest that race
differences are not genetic.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Which studies don't Herrnstein and Murray cite?

<P>Sternberg: Well, one study that they cite and distort the results of
is the Scarr-Weinberg study. What Scarr-Weinberg and several people
have done is look at blood groups (associated with Whiteness or
Blackness), or skin color, and looked at the correlation with IQ. The
typical correlation is about .15, suggesting that you are accounting
for about 1-2% of the variance. And even that less than 2% could be
due to the way darker versus lighter people are treated. So when you
look at the studies that have been done, they counter-indicate the
conclusion that Herrnstein and Murray draw.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Which then is your position on the question of race
differences in IQ? We all see the 1 standard deviation difference in
mean IQ if we give the tests to groups of Blacks and Whites. Is that
mean difference the result of genetics, environment, both, or should
we say at this point that we just don't know?

<P>Sternberg: What we know is that almost any difference is some
interaction between heredity and environment. But in terms of
apportioning the difference, we have no idea. And I think that
Herrnstein and Murray know that as well as do other
psychologists. Like everyone else we don't like ambiguous situations,
so some jump to conclusions even though I think at this point we don't
have a very good idea of why we get that difference. Although we
recognize that it has generally been decreasing over time.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: You say that Herrnstein and Murray build their whole argument
on the (often wrong) interpretations of statistics. Can you be more
specific?

<P>Sternberg: One example is taking studies that show that within group
heritabilities have nothing to do with between group heritabilities
and then insinuating that they do. Another example is the issue of
causation and correlation. They know, and anyone who takes statistics
knows, you can't draw any real causal conclusions from correlational
data. Lots of things correlate with lots of things, IQ being one of
them. To draw causal inferences from correlational data, which is what
all their data are, is statistically incorrect. Another thing that
many may not realize is that virtually all their data are based on one
study, the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY), which was not
a study that was particularly representative of the United States
population.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: In what sense?

<P>Sternberg: The mean was low. I think the mean IQ in that group was
around 94 and the standard deviation was not 15 or 16. It was not a
typical US population. Another thing they do, in comparing
correlations, is that they don't take into account the reliability and
precision of the measures being used. For example, almost every
measure we use is a proxy for something else.  If you ask yourself,
"How good is 'number of years of schooling' for measuring how much
education a person has?" it's not a very good measure. Two people
could each have 16 years of schooling, but if you compare somebody who
was a straight A student in a really good college with someone who was
a D student in a really poor college, the number of years of education
will be the same but their educational attainments will be vastly
different. So as a measure of how much schooling you have really had,
years of education is extremely imprecise and it's not going to look
very good in correlational analyses. In contrast, IQ is a pretty good
measure of that narrow construct, compared to the other types of
measurement that we have. That will make IQ look more powerful than
the other measures because the other measures are such crude proxies
for the constructs that they are trying to measure.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Do we have better measures of what a person has accomplished?

<P>Sternberg: You could certainly measure their achievements with a
variety of kinds of tests. Those kinds of tests are
available. Herrnstein and Murray did not use them, but they are
available. I'm not saying that they are perfect, but what I am saying
is that the kinds of variables Herrnstein and Murray use, in contrast
to IQ, are generally not very reliable and not very good as proxies of
the constructs they are trying to measure. In terms of interpretation
another thing that I found strange was that the data suggest that IQs
generally have been going up (the Flynn Effect). Herrnstein and Murray
cite Flynn's work and they agree with it, but they then find
themselves in the awkward position of explaining why IQs are going up
when (according to Herrnstein and Murray), IQs should have been going
down. They then use very weak arguments to try to dismiss the Flynn
Effect, after making a big deal about its existence. In other words,
having committed themselves to a position, if the data are consistent
with their position, they cite them, and if the data are inconsistent,
they try to come up with what I think are fairly hare-brained
interpretations of how that could happen.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: You refer in your review to Binet's "Mental Orthopedics" and
also to the work of Lev Vygotsky. These seem to be part of a different
paradigm that sees intelligence as something that grows or forms in a
social setting, and that sort of interpretation makes sense to most of
us. You even mention that Herrnstein at one point developed one of the
better programs for helping to raise IQ. Can you explain that further?

<P>Sternberg: Some years back in the early 1980s the government of
Venezuela initiated a country-wide drive to improve the intellectual
abilities of the children. They invited a number of researchers from
Venezuela and abroad to come in. One program was initiated by Harvard,
and Herrnstein was the head of that program. It was successful. They
published the results in <EM>American Psychologist</EM>, which is a leading
psychological journal, showing that there had been significant and
impressive gains in IQ.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: How do you square that with, for example, Herman Spitz (who
signed the <EM>The Wall Street Journal</EM> statement) or even Zigler, who is
one of the gurus of Head Start, who says, "It does great things for
keeping children in school and out of jail, but IQ isn't something
that we can really move around a lot, we just don't know how to do
it." Again, there appears to be a contradiction between what the
authorities say.

<P>Sternberg: I don't think there would be that big a difference between
me and Zigler. You can get some increases. I don't think we know how
to get really large, long term increases. On the other hand, we're
talking about work that's been around for maybe 30 years. If you ask,
"how far had medicine gone in 30 years after its inception, say in
Ancient Greece in terms of curing illness," it wasn't that hot
either. We have just started on this kind of work. You can't expect
that in a fairly short amount of time we will have figured exactly
what to do. This field just isn't at that point yet.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Would you agree that the burden of proof should be on those
who claim, at this point, that they can raise IQ?

<P>Sternberg: Yes. And I think that it has been there. There have been
programs, Ramey's Carolina Abecedarian Project is another, that have
worked. I think it's hard to maintain the IQ gains. But if you think
environment is important in the development of intelligence, and you
put people in a really good program and you raise their IQ, and then
take them out of the program and put them back in the poor environment
in which they started, chances are you are going to lose a lot of the
beneficial effect. If you give someone antibiotics for a disease, cure
them, then put them back in the original septic environment, the
disease will return. We've seen this when we work with children with
parasitic infections. We can give them Albendazol and it will cure
their parasitic infection. But if you put them back in the environment
in which they acquired the infection, they will just acquire it again.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: In another quote from your article, you say, "How strange
that we have become a society that values what someone might do more
than what he has done." Isn't that what all science is about-trying to
predict in advance?  Isn't the final practical test whether it works
economically in the real world? Isn't that what physics, astronomy,
and chemistry, all strive for?

<P>Sternberg: No. And if you were to tell someone in physics that the
final test is whether it works economically in the real world, they
would tell you that that has nothing to do with truth at all. It's
totally irrelevant to what is scientifically true. There is a question
of what is true and then there is a question of how you use it. But I
don't think any physicist would believe that the ultimate test of
truth in physical science is economic exploitation or usefulness.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Do you agree that science tries to predict things?

<P>Sternberg: Sure, one of the goals of science is prediction.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Then is your quotation a criticism of psychometrics as a
science or of what we do with its results?

<P>Sternberg: My criticism has nothing to do with scientific truth. It
has a lot to do with what I see as a maladaptive oddity in our
society. We often seem to value the ability to do something more than
what people actually do, and there are lots of examples of that. We
are one of the few societies that place so much emphasis on
intelligence tests. In most societies there is more emphasis on what
people accomplish. I do think there is something to be said for
emphasizing what people actually do, rather than what they might or
might not do. We have gotten into the somewhat ridiculous situation of
even having constructs like "overachiever," which is talked about in
education. Most societies wouldn't have that construct. What does it
mean? An overachiever is somebody whose IQ is lower than their
achievement scores. The idea is that they are achieving too much and
that there is something wrong with them, and that they ought to be
pushed back to their own size.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: It seems logically impossible. 

<P>Sternberg: It is! So where do we get that idea? We got that idea from
valuing the predictive test more than the achievement. You get a lot
of people who work in admissions who will count SAT scores or IQ tests
or ACT tests more than they count actual individual accomplishment. I
think that that is a backward way of looking at things.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: The other side of the argument came out when I interviewed
Douglas Detterman, the editor of <EM>Intelligence</EM>. He reviewed for me the
work at Brooks Air Force Base where g proves to be far and away the
best predictor of pilot training and a whole host of other things. So
getting back to the question of economic reality, the Dallas Cowboys
want to know who's going to make the team before they go through
training (if possible). When I was in the Air Force we had big
problems with washouts from pilot training. It costs a huge amount of
money to put someone through that training. So isn't it just economic
good sense to use the best tests and measures for prediction?

<P>Sternberg: I am not disagreeing that IQ is predictive of a lot of
things. I'm not one of the extreme left-wingers who say that IQ tells
you absolutely nothing. I don't agree with that. So to the extent that
it predicts some level of success in pilot training, I don't have any
argument with that. But I do argue with the idea that IQ is the end of
the line. We have been working for about 10 years in the field of
practical intelligence, predicting, for example, the success of
managers and sales people, which are pretty practical occupations. We
actually did a study at Brooks AFB and found that our measures of
practical intelligence-that is, measures of how well you can go into
an environment and figure out what you need to succeed in that
environment and then actually do it-predict job success in managerial
jobs and in sales jobs at least as well and arguably better than IQ
tests.  Moreover they do not correlate with IQ tests, which means that
(a) IQ is not the only predictor, and (b) the kinds of predictors we
have are relatively independent of IQ. That's not to say that one is
important and the other is not. Rather, it says that both are
important and that there's more to predicting success than just using
IQs. If you want to predict success in jobs, I'm not saying that IQ is
worthless, but I am saying that it's not the only thing you can use.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Don't we find the situation in sports all the time where we
say, "Hey, this guy came in with great abilities-he runs fast, and so
on-but he just isn't a player, he just doesn't come through. And there
are in baseball, for example, these Billy Martin-type players, who you
think will never make the team, but they play their heart out on every
play. When it's the World Series I know who I want in my lineup. Is
that the sort of argument that you are making?

<P>Sternberg: I think you are talking about something slightly different.
Practical intelligence is different from academic intelligence, and
motivation is something different again. And motivation is also very
important.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: But what about those things in sports like knowing the game,
knowing the tricks of the trade?

<P>Sternberg: That's what I am talking about when I speak of practical
intelligence as opposed to academic intelligence.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Often the guys who aren't the best players are the best
managers because they've had to learn all this in order to stay in the
league.

<P>Sternberg: And some of them are good players too. You don't need
research to tell you that. We all know people who had very high scores
on SATs, GREs, and IQ tests, who don't seem to be able to translate it
into any kind of success in their lives. It's not to say that everyone
with a high IQ is going to fail. Obviously, that's not true. The other
thing is that a lot of what is said about prediction is, in my view,
somewhat shaded and one can even argue falsified, by the fact that we
have already been using IQ in our society in its various disguises to
create the truth of what is being predicted.  Imagine that we had
decided that in order for someone to succeed in college they had to be
over six feet tall and so you only accepted people who were over six
feet tall. Well, within a generation or two, you would find that most
of the people who were in the high paying jobs were over six feet
tall.  And you would note a correlation between success and being over
six feet tall. But why did you get that correlation? Because you
created a system to make that come true. We have created the kind of
system that Herrnstein and Murray talk about by using SATs for college
and GREs for graduate school, LSATs for law school, and GMATs for
business school. In other words, almost any access route to the
high-paying occupations requires you to do well on these tests. That
will artificially and spuriously create the correlation between high
scores and entering into top jobs. So what Herrnstein and Murray are
talking about when they describe the cognitive stratification of
modern America, is, in fact, an invention of our society.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: But haven't path analysis studies shown that even IQ measured
at an early age is a better predictor than a host of other things
measured later on?

<P>Sternberg: Early childhood IQs do not predict anything accurately. By
around the age of eight, when IQ becomes stable, you are predicting
about 50% of the variation in adult IQ.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: I'm referring to studies that show that childhood IQ predicts
adult earnings. In other words, IQ, rather than being reared in an
affluent home, led to higher adult earnings.

<P>Sternberg: Certainly IQ will be somewhat predictive of
earnings. That's not inconsistent with what I just said. If you have a
high IQ, even if you come from a not very affluent home, you are going
to be rewarded by our society for it. If you come from a poor home and
you do well on the SATs, Yale and Harvard and Princeton will all be
begging to have you so that they can claim diversity. That's the
ticket to success.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Yes. And wouldn't a lot of people say that that's all for the
better?  That it is extending opportunity in our society beyond what
it was 100 years ago, when everybody at Harvard came from a rich home?

<P>Sternberg: If you ask me, "Is it better to use family affluence or
IQ," I'd say that its better to use IQ. But if you were to ask me, "Is
it better to use IQ or demonstrated accomplishments?" I would say it
is better to use demonstrated accomplishments. My concern is not that
there will be people with high IQs who don't do so well. That's not
the problem. The bigger problem, in my view, is the people who don't
test particularly well, who are going to be screwed. I've seen a lot
of them, including me in my very early years of school.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Really?

<P>Sternberg: When I was very young, I did poorly on IQ tests because I
was test anxious. The result was that teachers had low expectations
for me and I wanted to please my teachers. So I met their low
expectations. They were happy and I was happy that they were
happy. I've been there and I've seen it happen to lots of people I
know. I got over my test anxiety and then did extremely well on
tests. All of a sudden the expectations were high. To a large extent
it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, either way. So when you tell me
that IQ predicts later success, sure it does. You get low scores on
your tests, everything starts to change in your life and you're on a
downhill slide. It's not a controlled experiment, because the very
score itself is having an effect on where you're going to be allowed
to go.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Do you think it's just as simple as you said, or were you
just citing one specific example?

<P>Sternberg: There are many, many examples of that. Anyone who has ever
worked in college or graduate school admissions, which I have, will
see cases of people who don't test well and therefore aren't
accepted. You can understand the constraints on them. If they let the
average scores go too low, they're going to start losing prestige and
their best students will go somewhere else. So there's pressure to
keep the scores up and there are lots and lots of people who don't
score well on those tests who can't get in anywhere. You don't even
have to do a scientific study to know that. Suppose you're very
creative but you don't test well. You're out of the game. (And no one
is arguing that those tests measure creativity.) So, some people who
are very creative or very good at practical intelligence are not
allowed access and don't make it through that kind of a system. Later
when they are not in such good occupations or making as high a salary,
someone will point out that there is a correlation between IQ and
salary and they will be right-we created it.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Let me turn briefly to Howard Gardner's "Multiple
Intelligences." In The Triarchic Mind, you say that they should
actually be referred to as talents, rather than intelligences. How is
your criticism of Gardner's model different from the g-theorists'
criticism of Gardner-namely that he is arguing for independence of
things we really wouldn't call intelligences?

<P>Sternberg: There is no absolute, agreed-on definition of
"intelligence." One of the battles in the field, arguably the battle,
even more than the heredity-environment issue, is what you include
under the definition of intelligence. There's no final answer to that
because God doesn't tell us what he means. To a large extent,
intelligence is our own creation. It is a creation to describe the
fact that in terms of adaptive skills, some people have more than
others. I think that you can argue that practical abilities are
adaptive. We showed that they are adaptive for everybody. Everybody
needs the ability to be able to work with other people, to be able to
figure out the environment that they are in. It doesn't matter who you
are. I'm supposedly in the ivory tower, but if you don't have
practical ability, you don't stay here very long. You also need
creative intelligence in the vast majority of jobs and in your life,
because you can't always use solutions that you or someone else came
up with before. Life just isn't that way, especially in very quickly
changing times such as those in which we live. To me, something is a
part of intelligence if it's necessary for adaptation.  What I argue
is that something like musical talent-or musical intelligence-is not
in the same class as practical intelligence. A talent to me is
something that is important in the lives of some people. If you want
to go into music, musical talent or musical intelligence is
important. But for my career even if I was totally tone deaf and never
played any music at all, it wouldn't make any difference to my life or
the life of anyone else.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: This is very similar to what Charles Murray told me when I
interviewed him and asked him about Gardner's work. He said, "g is the
only one that if you do badly enough on it, you end up in a home for
the retarded."

<P>Sternberg: I don't think it is true that g is the only one that if you
do badly, you are screwed in life.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: What other ones are there?

<P>Sternberg: I just told you. You get people who have very high g who
may not end up in a home for the retarded, but their lives don't
differ a whole lot.  They keep screwing up everything they do. And
I've seen them in my own field.  People who are very bitter because
they can't get along with anyone. All of a sudden they find that no
one is inviting them to give talks, they don't stay very long in a
job, no one wants their articles, they don't know how to communicate,
they don't know how to argue for a position effectively, and all the g
in the world doesn't save them.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Some would say that what you're focusing on are really
personality measures.

<P>Sternberg: Personality is very important for life too, but it's
different from our tests of tacit knowledge. The tests of tacit
knowledge that we use to measure practical intelligence measure what
you know. They do not measure your personality. Introversion and
extroversion are personality measures. The difference is that you can
be very successful in life as an introvert or an extrovert. You can be
successful in life being somewhat altruistic or not very
altruistic. You can't be successful in life if you lack practical
intelligence.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: We live in the computer and information age and although
there are individual differences in speed of learning, so what if it
takes John 100 trials to learn the alphabet but Mary only needs
15. When we were in school, the kid who took longer or who couldn't
throw a baseball as far was ridiculed and embarrassed. But computer
assisted, self-paced learning systems let you go at your own
rate. There's lots of time in childhood, so what's the problem?

<P>Sternberg: You're arguing with the wrong guy. I agree with you. I've
made the same point in some of my writings. Our society is a little
bit unusual in putting so much emphasis on speed.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: It seems to me that a lot of the things that you are
complaining about are the result of a social setting in which we teach
people instead of letting them go at their own rate. If they make a
mistake, they can try it again, but no one gets laughed at. So how
much of your own work has gone towards developing computer-assisted
training systems?

<P>Sternberg: I do a lot of work on training systems, but for the most
part they are not computerized. But the characteristics you're talking
about are not limited to computerized systems. You're talking about
values, not the necessity of using the computer as a medium. I think
the computer is a good medium, but there are other ones as well.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Turning to your own work, one of the criticisms would be,
"What have you added beyond what's in, say, John B. Carroll's
extensive factor analysis in the domain of abilities?" Or are we going
back to the earlier question in which you said that the practical
intelligence is an equal ability with g, and not just a personality
factor or "tricks of the trade" or just accumulated job knowledge? Are
your tests in fact just job knowledge, rather than a continuing
capacity of the individual?

<P>Sternberg: That criticism is simply false. If you look at the
correlation between tacit knowledge for being an academic researcher
and tacit knowledge for being an executive, the correlation was pretty
high-about .5 to .6. But in terms of teaching job knowledge, probably
no one who is a psychologist went to business school or vice
versa. Tacit knowledge is something you pick up from the
environment. I don't care what you call it. If you want to call it job
knowledge or the ability to use job knowledge or the ability to use
common sense knowledge that you pick up, the name isn't
important. What I'm saying is, whatever you want to call it, it's at
least as important as the academic sort of intelligence and it's not
the same thing as that. I don't need to argue about the name attached
to it.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Let me turn this around. Suppose that I do great on the SAT
and the GREs and the IQ tests, but I do terribly on Sternberg's
practical knowledge tests. Does that mean that I'm not going to be
allowed to go to graduate school, and instead just sit home and watch
quiz shows? What's your remedy or treatment for that?

<P>Sternberg: Well, I'll tell you what we did. In the program that we
have run for the past two summers here, based on my own model,
students were given my abilities test (which had analytical, creative,
and practical sections), and we admitted kids in the experimental
groups in one of four ways-either very high analytic, very high
creative, very high practical, or balanced. In other words, the model
is that very few people are going to be good in everything.  I wasn't
interested in taking an average. Rather, what I was interested in is
the fact that people have different patterns of strength. What you
want to do is to help them capitalize on whatever their pattern of
strength is. So, if you're very good in analytic, not so high in
practical, that's fine. That's an important kind of skill
too. Analytical skills should not have absolute preference over
creative or practical skills. I'm not saying that these other skills
should have absolute preference over analytical skills.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: Another criticism of your work-I think this was stated by
Messick of the Educational Testing Service-is that you are actually
invoking more explanatory entities than you are measuring, thereby
violating Occam's Razor.  In other words, you have come up with fewer
test measures than entities you have invoked to explain the
measurements you have.

<P>Sternberg: I've talked about analytical, creative, and practical
intelligence and I have measures of all three. If you look at the
Triarchic Theory and you look at all the constructs, for example,
metacomponents (higher order processes) like defining problems, or
setting up strategies to solve problems and you ask if I have a
measure that isolates every single one of those, I don't. Nor do I
particularly want to do what J.P. Guilford did in his career, which
was to spend his whole career filling in the blanks. That's the sign
of an uncreative career, at least in my view. If we talk about the
basic structure of the theory and the three parts of it, I have
measures for all of these, we've used them, and they work. The fact
that Messick works at the Educational Testing Service might give him a
certain vested interest in what ETS does.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: One of the criticisms of <EM>The Bell Curve</EM>, especially the now
infamous Chapter 13 on race differences that the popular press makes a
lot of, is that Herrnstein and Murray have cited the so-called
"Tainted Sources," particularly people who have been funded by the
Pioneer Fund. But some of the individuals funded by the Pioneer Fund
have articles in your own <EM>Encyclopedia of Intelligence</EM>. Do you want to
comment on their work?

<P>Sternberg: I have been offered funds by an organization and I didn't
take the funding because I didn't like the organization. That was my
personal choice.  If they funded my work, the fact that they funded it
doesn't mean that the work is therefore invalid. Work stands or falls
on its own, regardless of who funded it. For example, Messick is at
ETS, so I tend to be somewhat skeptical of people at ETS. But that
doesn't mean that because they're at ETS, what they say is wrong. It
just makes me think twice about what they say.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: The same thing could be turned around said about Sternberg or
Gardner. They have their vested interests.

<P>Sternberg: Absolutely. I agree with that. If you are coming from the
other point of view, you ought to say that I have a vested
interest. That's why I say arguments stand or fall on their own.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: In the <EM>Encyclopedia of Intelligence</EM> you do have articles and
I think even biographies of Arthur Jensen and Hans Eysenck and
others. So you must have some respect for the work they have done, at
least in specific areas.

<P>Sternberg: Even though I may not agree with a lot of what Jensen has
said, the importance of a person's contribution is not determined by
how much I agree with what they say. I think that he's made a
contribution. His work on race I utterly don't like, but I don't think
that that's where his scientific contribution lies. I think his
contribution is the work he's done on reaction time and intelligence.

<P><EM>Skeptic</EM>: If I can summarize, it seems that your main interest is in
the nature of intelligence rather than in the differences between
individuals and groups. Is that right?

<P>Sternberg: I'm interested in both. I just think that what has happened
is that a small part of the question has been treated as if it is the
entire story and it's not.

<H1>FOR WHOM THE BELL CURVE TOLLS</H1>
<H2>A Prelude to an Upcoming Special Issue of 
<EM>Skeptic</EM> (Volume 3, #3)</H2>

<H2>An Interview with the Author of <EM>The Bell 
Curve</EM></H2>

<H2>CHARLES MURRAY</H2>

<H2><A HREF = "03.2.about-miele.html">Interview by Frank Miele</A></H2>

Charles Murray has achieved the impossible, or at least the highly 
improbable. He has co-authored an 845-page book, filled with figures, 
tables, references, and appendices loaded with multiple regression 
analyses, that is also the most controversial book in America. It has 
been panned by many outside the intelligence testing community and by 
some within. Commentators from the left, right, and middle have taken 
their best shots, and leaders of both major political parties have rung 
in with scathing attacks, even while admitting they had not read the 
book. Despite the brouhaha, or perhaps because of it, <EM>The Bell Curve</EM> 
made it to the <EM>New York Times</EM> top-10 nonfiction best seller list. As 
Ted Koppel put it on <EM>Nightline</EM>, <EM>The Bell Curve</EM> will be like Clinton's 
health plan: no one will actually read it but everyone will form an 
opinion of it. 
<P>   Charles Murray is no stranger to controversy. His previous book, 
<EM>Losing Ground: American Social Policy, 1950-1980</EM>, argued that the Great 
Society programs of the 1960s not only did not help the poor, they often 
made things worse. Arguing that the welfare system should be abolished, 
the <EM>New York Times</EM> called <EM>Losing Ground</EM>, "The [Reagan] 
Administration's new 'bible.'" <EM>Losing Ground</EM> was but a prelude. 
<P>   In <EM>The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life</EM> 
(co-authored with the late Richard J. Herrnstein, author of the 
previously controversial <EM>IQ in the Meritocracy</EM>, and co-author with 
James Q. Wilson of <EM>Crime and Human Nature</EM>), Murray has pushed the 
envelope of public political discourse to its breaking point. He has now 
been dubbed by the <EM>New York Times Magazine</EM> "America's Most Dangerous 
Conservative."  When editor Andrew Sullivan ran an excerpt from <EM>The Bell 
Curve</EM> in <EM>The New Republic</EM>, its entire editorial board rose in revolt. 
But a group of leading researchers in the field of human intelligence 
published a statement in the <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> agreeing with the 
factual basis of <EM>The Bell Curve</EM>. 
<P>   Herrnstein and Murray argue that IQ is real; that it matters (ever so 
much more as society becomes more equitable and technological); that it 
is somewhere between 40% and 80% heritable; and that it relates to not 
only school performance, but to jobs, income, crime, and illegitimacy; 
and that it cannot be ignored in any meaningful look at America's future. 
But the most explosive of <EM>The Bell Curve</EM>'s arguments is that some of 
the difference in mean IQ scores between the white European population of 
the United States and the African-American population (one full standard 
deviation of 15 points) is probably attributable to genetic factors. No 
one in the field disputes this difference. The argument is over <EM>why</EM> the 
difference exists and, of course, whether and how it can be reduced. 
(Read the now-infamous Chapter 13 of <EM>The Bell Curve</EM> for yourself. It is 
a lot more tentative and nuanced than popular denunciations of the book 
may have led you to believe.)
<P>   Charles Murray is a graduate of Harvard with a Ph.D. in Political 
Science from MIT, and currently is a Bradley Fellow at the American 
Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C. The late Richard J. Herrnstein 
received a Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard, where he taught from 1958 
until his death last autumn. He held the Edgar Pierce Chair in Psychology 
(the oldest such chair in America).
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM> interviewed Charles Murray and found him to be as calm in 
explaining his positions as some of his critics have been apoplectic. If 
there was any trace of anger in Murray it was not for the underclass but 
for former colleagues who have, as he put it, "ran for the high hills," 
and for the Cognitive Elite, whom he feels have undermined the country 
that provided them the chance to rise to the top in the first place. 
<P>   The next issue of <EM>Skeptic</EM> will be a Special Issue on intelligence, 
I.Q., race, and class, and will feature in-depth reviews of <EM>The Bell 
Curve</EM> by leaders in the field, moving past the rhetoric and getting to 
the heart of the science behind the claims. In the first of what promises 
to be a regular interview feature in <EM>Skeptic</EM>, Contributing Editor Frank 
Miele was more than prepared for the Murray interview, having been 
published himself on the subject in <EM>Intelligence</EM>, the leading journal 
in the field. 
<P>   Here then is what "America's Most Dangerous Conservative" had to say 
to <EM>Skeptic</EM>.

<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: In your book you present a summary of the current 
evidence on I.Q. on pages 22 and 23. Snyderman and Rothman's on The I.Q. 
Controversy in 1991 surveyed expert in the field, and just yesterday the 
Wall Street Journal contained a 25-point statement by experts in 
intelligence. Based on those it seems your summary represents the 
consensus of experts in this field, even on the controversial issue of 
the involvement of genetics and the black-white difference in 
intelligence. As skeptics, we are skeptics of everything, including 
psychology. If we get this great a controversy over what looks like 
consensus, is psychology really a science in the same sense as physics?
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: I'm not comfortable with a blanket statement saying yes or 
no. But I think we can talk specifically about the basis for those 
statements in the Wall Street Journal and the book, which is certainly 
based on the kinds of methods that fall under the scientific method--
falsifiable hypotheses, the use of predictions, etc. A test is valid in 
so far as it predicts something of interest, or criteria measure, to use 
the jargon of the trade. More than most of the other social sciences, 
psychologists and psychometricians are prepared to have their results 
tested against classical statistical criterion of validity, reliability, 
and reproduceability.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: One of the arguments would be that most of the analyses 
you and psychometricians have done is correlation, as opposed to causal 
analysis that we do in physics. Does that mitigate against the strength 
of the scientific conclusions?
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: We do not have accessible to us the same kind of control 
over our phenomena that physicists often have. However, having said that, 
their remains a black box where the cause hides that we cannot open up 
and look at. But one can eliminate a number of alternative hypotheses and 
transform correlational statements into ones which certainly have some 
causal persuasiveness. Example: the use of regression analysis, which is 
the all-purpose tool of the behavioral and social sciences these days. 
Let's take an example from <EM>The Bell Curve</EM>. The dependent variable is 
whether a person is below the official poverty line. And you introduce as 
independent variables a variety of candidate causes. Chief among these 
being socio-economic background, education, race, occupation, and then 
you throw I.Q. into that. If after looking at a variety of these other 
things which both theory and common sense say should have some bering on 
whether a person ends up in poverty, but one ends up with a large, 
statistically independent role for I.Q., it seems to me to make a causal 
statement that I.Q. looks like its a cause of poverty, it is a reasonable 
thing to do.
<P>   By the way, when you actually read the book you will see that we 
typically word things in this cautious kind of way.  
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: But could not someone say that in correlational analysis 
it is not really proper that you are not randomly assigning people to 
socio-economic status groups, or racial background, or whatever; are you 
and Herrnstein doing anything different than what is the common procedure 
used in regression analysis in, say, voting behavior, or anything of this 
sort? 
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: The analyses we conduct in the book are garden-variety 
regression analyses. There is, however, also a body of work which does 
use randomly assigned experimental and control groups that reflects on a 
lot of the issues we talk about in the book, which then begins to look 
more like experiments done in the hard sciences.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Can you be more specific?
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Art Jensen's work with regard to reaction time. This is a 
matter of eliminating a lot of alternatives and trying to understand 
what's going on with I.Q. scores. This is where you have a situation with 
an apparatus with six buttons, and you have your finger on a button, and 
when a light goes on one of the other buttons you move to that button and 
push it. The reason why this kind of experiment is useful is (A) it gives 
us insight into something that has no known relationship to I.Q., in so 
far as you are simply asking someone to move his or her thumb to push a 
button. But it turns out that this reaction time is not only correlated 
with I.Q. scores, it is correlated with the general intelligence factor, 
g. 
<P>   The main point is this. You have now made some headway into trying to 
understand what is going on with this thing called an I.Q. score--does it 
have a physiological basis, etc. 
<P>   I'm not going to apologize for our use of regression analysis in the 
book. Everyone uses regression in the social sciences. If you want to say 
that social scientists are the astrologers of the 20th century and that 
they don't have the methods of science open to them and we thus can't 
take them seriously, fine, but unless you are prepared to make that 
argument the science in <EM>The Bell Curve</EM> using regression analysis is 
very much in the middle of the mainstream.  
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Stephen Jay Gould, in his New Yorker review, gives a 
four-point summary of your argument about intelligence: (1) it is a 
single number; (2) it is capable of ranking people in a linear order; (3) 
it is genetically based; (4) it is effectively immutable. Gould goes on 
to say that if any of these premises is false, the entire argument of 
<EM>The Bell Curve</EM> collapses, and he concludes that: "The central premise 
is false and most of the foundations are." Now, how do you square what 
Gould has said about this with your own summary of the book on pages 22-
23. One of you has got to be wrong. 
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Stephen Jay Gould is recycling the same argument that 
appeared in <EM>The Mismeasure of Man</EM> in 1981. It was a very influential 
book in terms of the lay population and lots of people out there have 
their opinions formed about intelligence by <EM>The Mismeasure of Man</EM>, 
which included two types of information, one considerably more useful 
than the other. The first type was a history of intelligence measurements 
in the 19th and early 20th centuries, in which people made mistakes. (I 
seem to recall that physicists used to believe in something called 
aether.) There were phrenologists and others to whom we can now look back 
at and poke fun at. Fine, the problem is that in the same way that 
physicists are not criticized now for something other physicists did in 
1910, so also has psychometrics made some strides since 1910 and 1900 and 
1890. 
<P>   The second thing is that Gould tried to make the same arguments for 
modern psychometrics, a lot of which were based on trying to demonstrate 
that the general mental factor g is a statistical artifact. The contrast 
I want to draw is between the attention that Gould's book got in the 
media and what happened in the scientific literature. Basically, there 
were a few perfunctory and rather derisive mentions of his treatment of 
factor analysis, and work went on without a break. 
<P>   To put it more specifically, factor analysis is subject to a variety 
of kinds of problems because you can make different assumptions about how 
to create the factors. One can even, for example, demand of the algorithm 
that it produce factors which do not load on a single dominent factor. 
The problem with this is, as Dick Herrnstein use to say, you can make <EM>g</EM> 
hide but you cannot make it go away.    
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Sounds rather like Joe Louis. Let me go back to Gould's 
four points. Is there any one of those that you think is not a fair and 
accurate statement of what you said?
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: All four of them.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: So you are not saying intelligence is a single number?
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: No. In The Bell Curve, we say of the I.Q. score, first, 
there have been a variety of ways to try to come up with independent 
mental factors. That has been a failure. On the other hand, there have 
been a variety of ways in which there are distinctions among different 
types of intelligence that are useful, such as the distinction between 
verbal, visual and spacial intelligence. And we talk about the different 
ways these different skills lead to success in occupations. And we talk, 
somewhat sympathetically, about the notion that there are, in Howard 
Gardner's words, multiple intelligences. We are a little dubious about 
applying the word "intelligence" to them, but we are very sympathetic 
that there are large domains of human talent that are not encompassed in 
the word "intelligence." 
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: One of the complaints about the Snyderman and Rothman 
survey, the Wall Street Journal survey, and your own survey of the 
literature, is that you are working in that standard psychometric 
paradigm, but that is yesterday's news. The real forefront is Sternberg's 
approach to practical intelligence and Gardner's seven intelligences. You 
are sticking with something that is a very small portion of the 
discussion, so naturally you are going to get concensus. 
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Let me make a couple of other points about intelligence. 
One, the general mental factor, <EM>g</EM>, is very robust. You can take all 
kinds of different ways of creating your factors, and you will always get 
g. It doesn't matter whether rotate the matrix orthogonally, or 
obliquely, or whatever else, you always get the same thing. The second 
major point is that when you try with factor analysis to produce a 
situation where you do not have a general mental factor <EM>g</EM>, guess what? 
All the factors are correlated. Which goes back to Spearman's initial 
insight, which is why are the different measures of mental ability so 
consistently correlated with each other? What's going on here? The answer 
is: there is an underlying general factor. That does not mean that it 
blocks out a whole territory of human talents or intelligence, and we say 
so in the book.
<P>   Gardner has made a variety of assertions about intelligence which, if 
true, are falsifiable. He is not only saying there are different talents, 
which Dick Herrnstein and I would agree with, he is also saying they are 
independent. With something like kinesthetic talent, which is quite 
physical, this is easy to say. It gets harder to say when he talks about 
interpersonal skills, versus verbal skills. If you are going to make that 
kind of statement, the next logical step is to come up with measures of 
these different talents and demonstrate that they are, in fact, 
independent. 
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: So you are saying that some of these disagreements are 
empirically testable?
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Yes, and Gardner has consistently been unwilling to 
subject his own work to that kind of empirical defense. He has stood 
apart from quantitative attempts to describe what he is doing and to 
enable other researchers to replicate it. Of all the different types of 
intelligence that Gardner wants to treat as co-equals, there is only one 
kind that will put you in the retarded class--namely the plain old 
fashion general mental ability. If you are kinesthetically challenged, 
teachers and guidance counselors do not get real worried about you. If 
you are kinesthetically challenged you may be the last person chosen for 
the baseball team, but you can go out and make a success of yourself in 
any number of ways. If you are intellectually challenged, however, you 
have a general disability that is pervasive over all kinds of ways.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: I read in a biography of Muhammad Ali that when he took 
his draft tests he had an I.Q. below 80. Now, if I make a mistake writing 
my spell-checker will fix it for me. If you make a mistake Stephen Jay 
Gould may beat you up in the press. If Muhammad Ali made a mistake he was 
flat on his back. This man was making split-second decisions of the first 
magnitude.
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: If you are five standard deviations out on the edge of the 
curve in kinesthetic ability to the right hand side, then certain 
possibilities open up to you. But if you are low in kinesthetic ability, 
it doesn't make much difference to you in life. If you are a Muhammad Ali 
and you possess extraordinary physical talent, you have other avenues 
that will open up to you. But this example illustrates another important 
point, which is that Muhammad Ali is not a blithering idiot. Yet there is 
nothing in his public utterances, his charm, his presence, his carisma, 
and all the rest of that, that is inconsistent with a measured I.Q. in 
the high 70s.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: One of the things that Gould takes you to task for is 
that you do not report the scatter on your regression lines, and that the 
r squared values do not appear in the body of the book, but in the 
appendix. Can you tell us what those terms mean and why he thinks they 
are so important? And what is the usual practice here--have you and 
Herrnstein done something different than what would be done in a book on, 
say, political voting behavior.
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Correlation is denoted by r, and in ordinary regression 
analysis r-square--the square of the correlation--reflects the proportion 
of the variation in the data that is explained by the set of independent 
variables that are in the regression analysis. 
<P>   Two points. First, the book is exemplary in opening up the section in 
which we present these regression analyses by explicitly pointing out in 
the body of the book that the r-square is small. That is in the very 
first pages of the whole presentation. It is also exemplary in a book 
aimed at a general audience that we specifically include an appendix with 
a print-out of every single analysis presented in a graph in the body of 
the book. This is something you will not find in most books aimed at a 
general audience, including The Mismeasure of Man. Dick and I presented 
far more statistical information than is ordinarly presented in a book 
such as this.  
<P>   Second, I don't know how much Gould knows about regression analysis. 
When you are using logistic regression analysis--in which the dependent 
variable is a nominal variable, in our case a dichotomous yes-no: Is the 
person below the poverty line, yes or no? Whenever you have a dichotomous 
dependent variable r-square becomes very difficult to interpret. 
Particularly with rare phenomena. For example, if you have a situation, 
as in the case of poverty where 87% of the population is not 
impoverished, you only permit two values in your dependent variable, you 
are going to get a lot of noise in the data, which means r-square becomes 
very difficult to interpret for technical reasons.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: One of the criticisms, then, would be that the I.Q. isn't 
that effective. There is a lot of noise, so why are you saying it is so 
important? 
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Let's use poverty as an example. For poverty the r-square 
is .10. So we can explain only 10% of the poverty, so obviously I.Q. 
cannot be very important, can it? Well, if you then go back and take a 
look at the chapter on poverty, and then you take the probability that a 
person is going to be in poverty if he has low I.Q., you find out that 
among whites, the probability of being in poverty if you are in the 
bottom 5% of I.Q. is 30%. The probability of being in poverty if you are 
in the top 5% of I.Q. is 2%. Furthermore, when you take into account 
education and socio-economic status, the magnitude of the difference in 
probability of being in poverty is not much attenuated. How can this be 
if you can only explain 10% of the variance? It goes back to the ways in 
which logistic regression equations in which r-squared is not nearly as 
interesting as the magnitude of the effect that I.Q. has on the 
probability of being in poverty. And this applies across the range of the 
analyses we report.   
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Let's try to cut this another way. If you get so much 
predictive value from using intelligence just in I.Q. score, how much do 
you add by getting these other measures of socio-economic status or 
whatever. I.e., what's the sequence? What's the biggest predictor, and 
how much do you add by cranking in the others? 
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: It depends on the phenomenon you are looking at. Once you 
introduce I.Q. the importance of socio-economic background is much 
attenuated. Often times the role of socio-economic background disappears 
altogether when I.Q. is in the equation. Conversely, introducing socio-
economic background into the equation often times attenuates the role of 
I.Q. by only a very small amount. 
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Let's talk about cognitive stratification you discuss in 
Part I of your book. Secretary of Labor Robert Reisch gave a speech on 
the "Anxious Class," where he says: "Contrary to some theorists our 
destinies do not reside in our genes. Study after study show that skills 
can be learned. Every year of education or job training beyond high 
school, whenever it occurs in life, increases average future earnings by 
6% to 12%. GNP is not simply a matter of DNA. Most Americans are on a 
downward slide not because of genetic deficiencies but because they lack 
the learnable skills to prosper in an economy convulsant with change."
<P>   But the picture Reisch paints is actually very similar to your own: a 
high-end cognitive class that is doing great, a bunch of worried people 
in the middle saying "where's that job my father had," and an underclass 
at the bottom that is falling downward in freefall.
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Yes, and we make a reference to Reisch's work and we point 
out that he is more optimistic about the role of education than we are, 
but there is great similarities.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: And on this subject of what society can do to bring up 
this underclass, you have been something of a godfather of the get-rid-
of-welfare movement before you got into talking about I.Q. Conservatives 
like Newt Gingrich, Buchannon, Kemp, and Bennett, have also talked about 
getting welfare, but they have rejected <EM>The Bell Curve</EM>'s analysis of 
I.Q. Does one of these follow from the other? 
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: You know, in all 845 pages of <EM>The Bell Curve</EM>, we talk 
about getting rid of welfare in one sentence. We have a single sentence 
in Chapter 22 in which we talk about the ways government should get out 
of the business of encouraging any group of women to have babies, whether 
they be smart or dumb. And we generally urge that policies that subsidize 
birth be ended. It is one sentence. A single sentence. And one does not 
follow from the other.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Even if there was no inheritability to intelligence, no 
racial difference in any of these things, you would still be in favor of 
getting rid of welfare.
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Yes, absolutely.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: One question we might ask about your book is: why this 
book now, and why the controversy that surrounds it? Is this a case of a 
bad economy, an anxious public, and so we are blaming the victims and 
scapegoating those least capable of defending themselves? 
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Why is it published now? A better question is: why was it 
not published in the last 30 years? There has been a collective 
intellectual cowardice about understanding the role of intelligence in 
understanding social problems. Let's take one example. Child neglect is 
one of the most rapidly growing social problems we have. How many 
thousands of people make their living either writing about problems of 
child neglect and abuse, and so are advocating for new laws, etc.? Well, 
as every parent knows without reading anything about I.Q., there is a 
plausible relationship between intelligence and child abuse. Which is to 
say, any parent knows if a child has had a fever for 24 hours and hasn't 
been taking in liquids, you make a calculation that this has gone on too 
long and we've got to get this kid to a doctor, etc. Any parent knows 
that child-proofing a home takes foresight and thoughtfulness--it takes a 
certain amount of I.Q. With that plausible relationship in mind, the 
failure of social science and politicians alike to confront the 
possibility that low I.Q. is an important risk factor in child neglect is 
scandalous. Every single bit of evidence that does bare on this says that 
I.Q. is a great big factor in child neglect. 
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Couldn't someone take your arguments and say "we need 
more redistribution programs, not less, because these people cannot help 
themselves"? Haven't you knocked the bottom out from the conservative 
pull-yourself-up-by-your-own-bootstraps ideology?  
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: You put your finger on something that Dick Herrnstein and 
I also thought about from the time we began working on the book. It is 
something that my friends on the right were concerned about. They said, 
"look, this type of material lends itself to all sorts of reasons to have 
a more interventionist state, and more welfare, and more redistribution, 
not less." We knew that. That is one of the major reasons for saying that 
it doesn't really hang together that this book was designed to foster a 
political agenda. It can be used by both sides. 
<P>   The other point is that you have just described why Dick and I open up 
Chapter 22 with seven or eight pages of political philosophy. We say to 
the reader very explicitly "what we have just described for you could 
play out in any number of ways politically. Therefore what we are going 
to do is describe to you our own political predispositions, which have 
nothing to do with I.Q., why we hold them, and having told you those 
predispositions, then we will tell you our strategic view of what ought 
to be done." 
<P>   Frank, I challenge readers of <EM>Skeptic</EM> magazine to go to any other 
book with policy recommendations by liberals which contain such an 
explicit, open, candid description of the author's political bias. 
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: I'd like to go further on that limb. One might argue that 
<EM>The Bell Curve</EM> challenges the whole tradition that many people identify 
as American--namely equality. Do you find that your conclusions better 
fit a pagen vision of the universe that sees humanity as continuous with 
the rest of existence rather than as created in the image of God, and the 
Goddess fortuna working her wiles through DNA?
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Our vision is Jeffersonian. Up until 30 years ago, in the 
early 1960s, Dick and I would have been describing a vision of America 
that everyone would have said, "of course." It is a vision in which we 
say that people bring different things to the table. The important thing 
is that everyone be given the opportunity to go as far as their own 
tempermanent, energy, characteristics, and intelligence will take them. 
The crucial factor in coming up with a harmonious society is not equal 
outcomes, it is abundance of opportunity. We are talking straight out of 
a tradition that until 30 years ago had virtually no intellectual 
challenge. It is only in the last 30 years that people have lost sight of 
those fundamental tenets of the American idea. And Thomas Jefferson would 
read <EM>The Bell Curve</EM> and, I like to think, nodding his head in approval. 
He believed there was a natural aristocracy that would make the 
republican experiment work. Personally I don't like the term "natural 
aristocracy" because I don't think the cognitive elite that we have now 
is all that great. 
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Along the these political lines, with your previous work 
in many circles you have been the intellectual darling of the 
conservative anti-welfare crowd. But now that your book has stirred 
things up, do you feel that your former allies and friends are now 
running away from you, and how do you feel about that behavior?
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: I assumed that when the book came out that a lot of people 
that used to think I was really neat would now say, "Charles Who?" 
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Has that happened?
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: I'm surprised at the extent that it has not. I thought 
that my political life would end. There seems to be a reflexive, almost 
deep inner panic, in an awful lot of people to be on the right side of 
<EM>The Bell Curve</EM> issue. And the right side is being perceived publically 
that you are shocked that these authors would suggest that intelligence 
has an important role in social problems; shock to think that anyone 
would still suggest there are differences among the races in 
intelligence. I've seen people, who I thought were both smart and honest, 
lie when it comes to the book.  
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Can you still be friends with these people?
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: No.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: As I've said, at <EM>Skeptic</EM> were are skeptical of 
everything. Given your experience do you think that the American 
political process can deal with the fact that Homo sapiens is a 
biological species, subject to the same laws of evolution and genetics as 
other animals? Can a democracy deal with the information in <EM>The Bell 
Curve</EM>?
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Actually, I'm optimistic on this score. This book has 
created in the news media a type of hysteria, where it has been denounced 
not just as wrong, but as evil and misguided. But there are now over 
400,000 copies of the book in print, and as my wife points out, correctly 
I think, people do not plunk down $30.00 to buy a pseudoscience, racist 
track. They just don't do that. They are reading the book and talking 
about it.
<P>   I think what has happened to American intellectual life is that we 
have undergone a temporary aberation--30 years, short as these things go-
-whereby we have tried to deny all sorts of realities about human 
biological characteristics. The best thing about this book is that these 
issues have been taken away from the ??chattering?? classes. They are now 
out there in public discourse in a way that is going to provide cover for 
a lot of good scholars who want to talk more openly about these issues 
but have been reluctant to. I'm Panglossian in my optimism.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: What happened the last 30 years? 
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: What happened in the 1960s, and now I'm citing from 
<EM>Losing Ground</EM>, was a fundamental change in the view of how society 
works and what individual responsiblity is, and this includes everything 
from education to law enforcement to the use of lawsuits, etc. It was a 
very widespread, but I think temporary, change that we are just now 
beginning to recover from and I think one of the lessons of this most 
recent election has nothing to do with people wanting a middle-class tax 
cut. It has to do with people wanting to return to a much more original 
view of how America is suppose to work.  
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Let me follow up on that. Hillary Rodham Clinton was in 
charge of the President's attempt to get a welfare reform, but it didn't 
go through. No one would say that was because she didn't have sufficient 
intelligence, energy, knowledge, whatever. When I see your idealistic 
vision of what you would like to have in America it doesn't seem 
realistic. You are being Panglossian.
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: I was Panglossian about these issues getting into the 
public dialogue. Now let me shift to being the pessimistic curmudgeon, of 
which I'm much more comfortable being! And that has to do with looking 
ahead to the long term. Hillary Rodham Clinton is the personification of 
what worried Dick Herrnstein and I about the cognitive elite. I'm sure 
she has a high I.Q. score. She, and for that matter her husband Bill, are 
both examples of people who by the age of 18 had been siphoned off into 
elite colleges and have spent the rest of their lives interacting with 
other people very much like them--the cognitive elite. And what happened 
in the Helm's bill [Frank: explain what this is] is a classic example of 
what happens when the cognitive elite has been talking to itself too 
long, and thinks it knows what's best for everyone. In this case, 
fortunately, they were derailled. 
<P>   In the longer term what scares me is that the cognitive elite is, 
indeed, a powerful enough force to continue to rig the rules of the game. 
We are in favor of deregulation and decentralization, but I'm afraid the 
cognitive elite are going to make these things very difficult to carry 
out. 
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: This bewilders me. You seem to say two different and 
possibly contradictory things. One, <EM>The Bell Curve</EM> finds the tremendous 
advantages that high I.Q. people have and which can be interpreted in a 
very elitist manner. Then, the libertarian Charles Murray emerges and 
says, well, the average Joe can run his life better than anyone else. How 
do you have it both ways? 
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Because running one's life is a matter of making all sorts 
of choices, and the satisfactions one achieves from running one's own 
life is inextricably linked with having been the person to make those 
choices. Someone with an income of $30,000 a year who made it himself I 
submit to you is a happier man than someone who got that same $30,000 
unearned, whether it comes from welfare or trust funds. People running 
their own lives, taking responsibility for their own actions, that's the 
way human beings are wired to live satisfying lives. 
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: So you really are a volunteerist on this. You are not a 
determinist. You are not saying everything is in the genes. You think 
free will is a meaningful concept. 
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Yes, and so did Dick Herrnstein, who was a student of B.F. 
Skinner.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Who didn't!
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: Yes, and Dick evolved a lot from his days as a 
behaviorist. One of the most difficult things to get across to people is 
that one may talk about genes playing an important role without being 
forced into anything resembling a determinist view of the world. But it 
is a contradiction only in this sense. The people who run their own lives 
are not necessarily going to make decisions that maximize anything in 
terms of some external source of comparison. In the Hillary Rodham 
Clinton world they might look at the things you have done or the choice 
you have made, and say, "no, no, if you would have done this other thing 
you would have had more money, you would have had more security, etc." 
I'm saying that a lot of the basis for deciding whether the decisions one 
makes in running one's life are right or wrong has nothing to do with 
these types of external criteria. 
<P>   You've asked very difficult questions that are hard to answer in a few 
sentences . . . but they are good questions.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Well, that's what we tend to do at <EM>Skeptic</EM>. Is there 
anything you would like to add in conclusion?
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: I've enjoyed the interview. The only thing I would add is 
my own unhappiness at the way that Dick Herrnstein's name has been 
eclipsed. As I've said to Susan Herrnstein, she would not be pleased to 
have Dick being called all the names I have been called over this issue.
<P>   <EM>Skeptic</EM>: Yes, but he seemed to give more than he got in his 
lifetime.
<P>   <EM>Murray</EM>: I have confidence that in five years from now, and 
thereafter, this book will be seen as a major accomplishment. I also want 
it to be known that this collaboration between a political scientist and 
a psychologist is something I'm immensly proud of. Working with Dick was 
this wonderful experience of dealing with a man who loved and respected 
data, and respected the scholarly ideal of getting it right, absolutely 
right. And we think we did.

EML provides access to comprehensive computer databases of all published 
data and archived samples from its current and historic environmental 
programs.  EML also operates and provides access to the Department of Energy's 
Human Subjects Research Database.

<P>
There are two unique EML databases which provide valuable atmospheric information.
</P>
<P>
TRACDAB, a database of stratospheric trace gases collected during Project AIRSTREAM, contains
information on more than 1000 samples.  Each sample was analyzed for at least one gas.  TRACDAB
is available on-line through DOE's 
<A HREF="http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov">Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)</A> at 
Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 filters were collected and analyzed for more
than 20 different radionuclides in the following projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Project ASHCAN (balloon) high-altitude radioactivity measurements from 1957-1983: 
Database maintained at EML
</LI>
<LI>Project STARDUST (aircraft) high-altitude radioactivity measurements from 1957-1967: 
Database maintained at EML
</LI>
<LI>Project AIRSTREAM (aircraft) high-altitude radioactivity measurements from 1967-1983: 
Database maintained at EML
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Radioactivity data from the above are also available in RANDAB, a database of the 
world's largest compilation of stratospheric and upper-tropospheric 
radionuclide data.  RANDAB will be available on-line within the next few months
through DOE's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

<P>
EML maintains an extensive library of samples associated with its research programs,
in some cases going back well over 40 years.  Sample types in the archive include: 
human bone, animal tissue and bone, vegetation, milk and food ash, soil, lake water
and sediment, seawater and aerosol filters.  Over 65,000 samples, including filters
obtained from altitudes ranging from sealevel to high in the stratosphere, are 
presently in this archive.  EML recently received into its archives over 893 soil
samples from a special study conducted by the Albuquerque Field Office in 1976 in
support of litigation involving the value of land contaminated by plutonium from
the Rocky Flats Plant.

<H3>A Performance Evaluation Program for Environmental Radiological
Analyses</H3>
<P>
See <A HREF="qapfat.htm">QAP fact sheet</A>.
<P>
The DOE QAP, administered by EML in New York City, is an external assessment
of the quality of environmental radiological measurements reported
by contractor laboratories to DOE.  Laboratories performing environmental
radiological analyses for the Office of Environmental Management
(DOE/EM) are required to participate in the QAP by a Secretarial Memorandum
(March 1993).  In addition,
the Office of Environment, Safety and Health (DOE/EH) mandated participation
in the program (under DOE Order 5400.1, Ch4.10C) for laboratories
that conduct analytical work in support of DOE environmental radiological
monitoring programs.  The attached <A HREF="qaplabs.gif">figure</A> 
shows the growth in
laboratory participation in the program since its inception in
1977.  QAP currently has 130 participants.
<P>
In QAP, natural matrix and synthetic samples, which have been
prepared and analyzed at EML for as many as 15 radionuclides are
distributed semiannually to DOE contractors and other participating
laboratories.  This program is unique in that it supplies multinuclide
samples.  Sample distributions are in March and September.  There
are no financial obligations for the participating laboratories.
<P>
Each laboratory receives samples consisting of soil, vegetation,
tissue, simulated air filters or spiked water samples.  The distribution
typically consists of:  a simulated air filter; 200g of soil;
100g of vegetation; and 500mL of spiked water.
 Participants can use any analytical method and need to analyze
only those matrices/nuclides which they routinely perform for
DOE.  For each nuclide, the participants are given a range of
expected concentrations in each matrix.  The participants must
report their results to EML within 90 days of sample distribution.
A summary of the reported results is made available to the participants
48 hours after the reporting deadline via an Internet or a modem connection
to EML's computer.  This rapid access to the data is another unique feature
of this DOE program.  The reported results are then compared with 
historically derived control limits.  A report is distributed
to the participants within 30 days; the results are not anonymous.  The 
QAP reports are issued in January and July.
<P>

<P>
TRACDAB, a database of stratospheric trace gases collected during Project AIRSTREAM, contains
information on more than 1000 samples.  Each sample was analyzed for at least one gas.  TRACDAB
is available on-line through DOE's 
<A HREF="http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov">Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)</A> at 
Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 filters were collected and analyzed for more
than 20 different radionuclides in the following projects:

EML maintains an extensive library of samples associated with its research programs,
in some cases going back well over 40 years.  Sample types in the archive include: 
human bone, animal tissue and bone, vegetation, milk and food ash, soil, lake water
and sediment, seawater and aerosol filters.  Over 65,000 samples, including filters
obtained from altitudes ranging from sealevel to high in the stratosphere, are 
presently in this archive.  EML recently received into its archives over 893 soil
samples from a special study conducted by the Albuquerque Field Office in 1976 in
support of litigation involving the value of land contaminated by plutonium from
the Rocky Flats Plant.

<H2>History</H2>

<P>
The Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML) is descended from
a small group involved in industrial hygiene-type activities associated
with the Manhattan Project at the end of World War II. It was
established in 1947 as the Medical Division, a small laboratory
of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. In 1949, the name of the
Laboratory was changed to the Health and Safety Division and in
1953 it became the Health and Safety Laboratory. When the Atomic
Energy Commission was abolished in 1975, the Health and Safety
Laboratory became part of the Energy Research and Development
Administration. In 1977, the Energy Research and Development Administration
was absorbed by the Department of Energy, and the Health and Safety
Laboratory changed its name to the Environmental Measurements
Laboratory.

<H2>Facilities</H2>

<H3><IMG SRC="chester.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> Rural Field Site </H3>

<P>
A field site at Chester in rural northwestern New Jersey serves
as a regional baseline monitoring station. In addition to the
collection of various environmental pollutant and meteorological
data in the support of research projects, this site is used for
intercomparisons and for testing new instrumentation under environmental
conditions. In cooperative programs, EML has provided space for
several other research organizations for the U.S. and abroad to
use this site for conducting their experiments, usually in collaboration
with EML scientists. 
<HR>

</P>
<H3><IMG SRC="cleanrm.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> Clean Room </H3>

<P>
The Quality Assurance and Metrology Division's Clean Room (Class
100) provides an atmospherically purified working environment.
The air in the room has been filtered to remove a significant
amount of air-borne particulate matter and is kept under positive
pressure to eliminate the intrusion of other air sources. Under
these controlled conditions, ultra low level analytical measurements
are performed using a variety of procedures and instrumental techniques.
Currently this room is being used for elemental separations in
preparation for accelerator mass spectrometric determinations
as part of the Arctic Research Programs. 
<HR>

</P>
<H3><IMG SRC="emlboat.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> Workboat for collection
of sediment samples</H3>

<P>
An 8.5 meter long outboard-powered research boat is used for the
collection of sediment samples from lakes and reservoirs. the
vessel can be transported to remote sites via trailer. It features
a large diameter (21cm) tripod-mounted coring device, capable
of collecting undisturbed sediment columns that are extruded for
analysis of trace substances, thus providing the watershed deposition
history. 
<HR>

</P>
<H3><IMG SRC="scan_mic.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> Scanning Electron
Microscope</H3>

<P>
Among EML's specialized instruments are a scanning electron microscope
coupled to a Si(Li) energy Dispersive Spectrometer and associated
microanalysis systems. These facilities are used to study particles
collected in the stratosphere and in remote regions of the troposphere
and to characterize laboratory generated aerosols. The microanalysis
system allows detailed chemical and size classifications of samples
collected in impactor substrates and various filter media. The
system is also used to examine samples of biological origin. 
<HR>

</P>
<H3><IMG SRC="newradon.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> Radon Calibration
Chamber</H3>

<P>
A large, state-of-the-art exposure chamber (25 usable cubic meters
internal volume), specially designed to provide improved performance
in radon decay-product experimentation was installed in late 1993.
</P>
<P>
One of only four internationally-recognized radon reference facilities
wordwide, this chamber provides well-controlled, simulated indoor
environmental conditions in which to conduct realistic tests and
experiments in radon and aerosol physics. 
<HR>

</P>
<H3><IMG SRC="mobillab.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> Mobile Laboratory
</H3>

<P>
A van based mobile laboratory is used for conducting radiation
measurements in the outdoor environment on local and cross-country
field trips. It features a motor generator for AC electrical supply,
lighting, climate control, and cargo and workspace areas. Various
instrumentation can be configured in roll-out equipment racks
to customize to the needs of a particular research project.

<H1>Environmental Radiation and Radioactivity</H1>

<P>
The objective of the research performed in this program area is
to provide fundamental data on natural and anthropogenic radionuclides
deposited on the earth's surface, which can be used to characterize,
quantify, and model environmental pathways, and to evaluate the
environmental and human health impacts on regional and global
scales. As part of this program, a rapid response capability is
maintained to support Department of Energy (DOE) activities in
radiation emergencies that arise within the U.S., and for assessing
releases that are international in scope.
<P>
A significant component of the work performed includes the operation
and maintenance of EML's global sampling network (see below) comprised
of over 115 sampling sites dispersed throughout the world. The
EML network is continuously poised to instantly respond to any
new introduction of radioactivity into the environment anywhere
in the world due to the planned, clandestine or accidental detonation
of a nuclear weapon, a nuclear reactor accident (for example the
Chernobyl tragedy), a transportation accident involving nuclear
materials, or a space satellite accident during launch or atmospheric
reentry involving a nuclear reactor or a radioactive thermal generator.

<H1>Radiation Transport and Dosimetry</H1>

<P>
In the Radiation Transport and Dosimetry Program, state of the
art analytical and experimental techniques are applied to the
determination of the basic physical properties of radiation fields
in the workplace and in the environment. Projects within this
program are often initiated in response to request to properly
evaluate occupational radiation exposure problems at DOE facilities
or to provide critical exposure assessments for DOE or other agencies.
 These situations usually involve complex radiation fields containing
neutrons and/or high-energy particles for which normal dosimetric
techniques are either inadequate or questionable in absence of
adequate validation.  We develop, use and provide reliable experimental
and theoretical/calculational tools to evaluate the nature, magnitude,
and potential health consequences of human exposure to such ionizing
radiation. To accomplish this, interactions are maintained with
ongoing Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) sponsored
radiation research programs and with other advanced dosimetry
research programs in the U.S. and in many other countries.  Progress
in this program contributes toward establishing a viable risk-based
system for radiation protection, one that will have a beneficial
impact on the conduct of DOE operations.

<H1>Environmental Radon, Thoron, and Related Aerosols Program
</H1>

<P>
EML has a history of over 40 years of research into the sources,
environmental behavior, and human health consequences of exposure
to radon, thoron and their progeny. These studies have encompassed
occupational residential, and ambient environmental settings,
requiring methodologies of progressively increased sensitivity
and detail. In recent years, EML's radon research has shifted
from the occupational to the residential environment.
<P>
The EML Radon Research Program consists of four major research
areas:
<P>
<EM>Quality Assurance:</EM> 
<P>
EML serves as a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) center
for the OHER Radon Research Program. EML is also one of four regional
reference laboratories in the International Intercalibration and
Intercomparison Program for Radon, Thoron, and Daughters Measuring
Equipment (IIIP)of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
serving as a regional intercomparison center for North American
radon, thoron and progeny measurements.  The IIIP is now part
of the IAEA International Radon Metrology Program (IRMP).
<P>
<EM>Instrument Development:</EM> 
<P>
Radon measurement technology at EML currently focuses on the development
of small and portable devices for indoor radon and thoron concentration
measurements, and on instrumentation for measuring very low levels
of radon gas.
<H5><IMG SRC="radomete.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> Radometer developed
at EML as a research tool for measuring levels of radon gas in
homes </H5>

<P>
<EM>Aerosol Physics:</EM> 
<P>
The aim of the aerosol physics project is to identify and quantify
the physics and chemistry processes that determine the particle
size spectra of indoor radon and thoron progeny aerosols. This
information is valuable to those who seek ways of reducing the
radiological dose to the human respiratory tract.
<P>
<EM>Exposure Studies:</EM> 
<P>
The differences in the exposure between modern homes and the old
uranium mines, especially those factors most significant in determining
the impact on human health from radon exposure has been the focus
of this research over the past years.

<H1>Environmental Management Programs</H1>

<P>
In its five year plan, the <A HREF="http://www.em.doe.gov">Office of Environmental Management (EM)</A>
specifies that policies be instituted to establish, assess and
maintain high quality analytical laboratories to provide the quality
data needed to fulfill the needs and requirements for the operation
of restoration and waste management at DOE sites. The Office of
Compliance and Site Coordination, through its Analytical Services
Division (EM-76), has designed and is implementing an Analytical
Services Program (ASP) to address these issues. Under the direction
of EM-76, EML is currently involved in three components of the
Quality Assurance (QA) Program elements of the ASP: the QA Guidance
and supporting documents, the Performance Evaluation Programs,
and the Assessment Program. The objective of the QA element of
the ASP is to develop, integrate and implement a comprehensive
QA program, including an assessment function that addresses the
full scope of a laboratory's performance from sampling through
analysis to data evaluation.
<P>
In addition to EML's core effort in EM-76's QA programs, described
above, other projects are undertaken on a fiscal year basis depending
on the needs of headquarters and staff availability. These activities
are of two types: (1) direct support to EM-76 in addressing issues
relevant to DOE's environmental needs and planning efforts through
participation in working groups, presentations and technical reviews;
and (2) technical activities to continually improve the analytical
capability of EML and DOE support contractors, and to introduce
improvements of additional samples/analytes to the ongoing performance
evaluation programs. For example, EML participates on the EM Environmental
Sampling and Analysis Coordinating Committee (ESACC), which is
a forum for issues of interest to EM program managers, is a member
of the review team for the DOE Methods Compendium, and pursued
several areas of analytical development utilizing liquid scintillation
techniques. Other activities which support EML's performance evaluation
programs include participation in round robins sponsored by standards
setting organizations (e.g., ASTM and IAEA).

EML is under contract to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to support the 
implementation of a rulemaking on new decommissioning criteria. EML's work has 
involved the development of the overall survey design, statistical tests and 
measurement methods that would be employed for final status surveys used to insure 
that release criteria have been met.  EML provides guidance, training and support 
for applying in situ spectrometry to measuring residual radioactivity during 
decommissioning surveys.  EML is represented on the committee preparing the 
Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM).  The manual 
will provide guidance for planning, conducting, evaluating, and documenting 
environmental radiological surveys for demonstrating compliance with proposed 
dose-based regulations for unrestricted release of sites.

<TITLE>USDOE Human Subjects Research Database 1995</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<H1>Department of Energy<BR>
Research Involving Human Subjects<BR>
Fiscal Year 1995</H1>

<P>
The DOE Human Subjects Research Database for FY1995 is maintained by the <A HREF="http://www.eml.doe.gov">Environmental Measurements Laboratory</A>.</P>
<P>The DOE Human Subjects Research <A HREF="#hsrdatabase">Database</A>
for Fiscal Year 1995 contains information relating to research
projects involving human subjects that are currently funded by
the <A HREF="http://www.doe.gov">Department of Energy (DOE)</A>,
or are performed at DOE facilities with support from other sponsors,
or performed by DOE personnel or DOE contractor personnel. This
database consists of a detailed description of each research project
and a section that summarizes the information <A HREF="hsrsums.htm">(USDOE Human Subject Research Database Summary)</A>
for quick referencing. For those interested we have compiled some
statistical information concerning this database <A HREF="#abridged">(Abridged Information on the 1995 Human Subjects Database)</A>.
Also, to assist the reader with unfamiliar terminology we have
included a <A HREF="hsrgloss.htm">glossary</A> of scientific terms.
</P>
<P>
By definition, &quot;research involving human subjects&quot; includes
a variety of activities ranging from actual experimentation using
human volunteers to gathering information using questionnaires.
Some projects involving human subjects are therapeutic in nature;
some include efforts to develop new instrumentation or techniques;
some involve the use of trace quantities of radioactive material
in imaging studies; others involve only the analysis of blood
or urine samples from volunteers; and still others involve follow-up
studies on workers previously employed at sites that stored or
used radioactive materials. A few research projects are epidemiological
in nature and involve only the analysis of medical records of
subjects to identify patterns of illness. As a result of looking
at thousands of anonymous records the total number of human subjects
in the database appears large. DOE supports these projects for
a number of reasons, including its legislative mandate to develop
new diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the area of nuclear
medicine. The epidemiological studies are funded by DOE as part
of its legislative mandate and its responsibility as an employer
to ensure the health of its work force. By reviewing occupational
histories and death certificates, investigators track the health
and mortality of current or former DOE and DOE contractor workers
at DOE's sites. Data on this epidemiological research have been
available on a separate database, the <A HREF="http://cedr.lbl.gov/">Comprehensive Epidemiology Data Resource</A>.
</P>
<P>
All the research involving human subjects that is funded by DOE
(or any other federal agency) and carried out at DOE facilities
must be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) located
at the research site. This local IRB is the cornerstone of the
system of protection of human subjects. No human subject research
may be initiated, and no ongoing research may continue in the
absence of IRB approval. The IRB is charged with meeting bioethical
standards and ensuring that all approved projects are in compliance
with the Federal Policy on Protection of Human Subjects. This
policy was drafted with DOE assistance in the 1980s and was adopted
by DOE and 16 other federal agencies (including the Department
of Health and Human Services) in July 1991. The policy provides
uniform guidelines for all involved in federally sponsored research.
Responsibility for the protection of human subjects at the DOE
resides in the Office of Energy Research. Other agencies also
fund research involving human subjects at DOE contractor laboratories,
which have a reputation as world class facilities with extensive
expertise in biology, medicine, and engineering.
</P>
<P>
This annual DOE human subjects database is a compendium of research
involving human subjects that was conducted in Fiscal Year 1995
(Oct. 1, 1994 - Sept. 30, 1995). However, a window of time of
approximately seven months was not captured by either the FY 1994
or FY 1995 databases. As a consequence if any projects began and
ended during this gap they will not appear in either database.
Future databases are designed to be continuous in time. In addition
to this database other DOE information tools regarding human subject
activities are available through the web sites for the DOE and
OHER (Office of Health and Environmental Research). To familiarize
the reader with the research reported in this database, project
summaries (abstracts) are included. To ensure that the database
is current, it will be updated regularly, both to add new information
and to correct existing data if warranted.

Subjects Database</A> </H1>

<P>
This section provides some statistical information concerning
this year's Human Subjects Database.
</P>
<P>
The number of reporting research facilities in the current database
is 35. Fourteen of these research facilities are DOE laboratories
and 21 are non-DOE laboratories (such as Hospitals and Universities).
Of the 35 reporting research facilities only one is located outside
the United States and that one is in Italy (Azienda Ospedaliera
Policlinico di Modena). The combined research facilities reported
225 projects that amounted to a budget of approximately $49,170,807.
The number of human subjects that participated in these studies
was approximately 31,502. Because epidemiological studies were
included in this database the total number of human subjects reported
is not representative of actual people participating but includes
a large number of records from human subjects. In fact, 28,934
human subjects were part of 81 research projects that relate to
epidemiological studies. The budget for these epidemiological
studies was $29,157,525. The 21 non-DOE facilities reported 28
projects that amounted to a budget of $23,804,438 and the participation
of 5,496 human volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two of the 225 projects listed in this database were not
supported by DOE grants. The reason these projects were listed
in the DOE's Human Subjects Database was because the research
was performed in DOE laboratories or by DOE employees. The budget
for these 62 projects was approximately $8,855,662 and they included
6,502 human volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two research projects reported this year received support
from both DOE and non-DOE grants. The budget for these projects
was approximately $9,093,557. The participation of human volunteers
in these research projects was 2,485.
</P>
<P>
Of the 35 research facilities listed in this database, Brookhaven
National Laboratory reported the most projects. They reported
46 research projects that amounted to $4,472,500 and 856 human
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Of the 225 projects listed in this database approximately 64 involved
human exposure to radiation. The nature of the exposure was therapeutic,
clinical, or occupational. The number of human volunteers participating
in these studies was 4,335, amounting to a budget of $23,907,408.
In all of the studies the radiation used was as a tracer to facilitate
imaging or other studies, or for diagnostic and/or therapeutic
reasons. DOE does NOT support any research in which the effect
of radiation upon humans per se is the object of study.
</P>
<P>
Additional information on individual studies is available in the
body of the database. Questions relating to projects may be directed
to the listed point of contact (POC).

<p>
<h1> About the EML Procedures Manual On-Line</h1><p>
<p>
Welcome to the on-line version of EML's Procedure Manual. The on-line versions differs in
presentation but not in content from the printed version.  Each highlighted phrase (in color and/or
underlined) is a hyperlink to another part of the document. Click on the highlighted phrase to
follow the information trail.<p>

This 28th edition of the EML Procedures Manual supersedes all other versions thus far issued. 
This Manual was originally issued in 1957 as  U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Report
(NYO-4700).  In 1972, substantive changes were made and the Health and Safety Laboratory
(HASL)
report designation became HASL-300.  When the laboratory's name was changed in 1977 to the
Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML), the manual was retitled to EML Procedures
Manual.<p>

<h2><b><center>OVERVIEW</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

The purpose of environmental sampling and analysis is to obtain data that describe a particular
site at a specific point in time from which an evaluation can be made as a basis for possible
action.  In this process, the collection of valid samples is the vital first step.  Sampling should be
done with the same care as the analysis, and both should be done with a rigor that is appropriate
for the project at hand.  In order for the data to be meaningful, sampling must be carried out with
a clear purpose and with an understanding of the problem to be solved and the physical
conditions that exist.<p>


At EML, environmental sampling is carried out for purposes such as inventorying a pollutant at a
specific point in time, calculating the pollutant transfer coefficients, reconstructing deposition
chronologies, and developing information on human exposure through ingestion.  Through these
long-term studies, experience has been gained in sampling radioactive fallout, air particulates and
gases, total and rate of deposition, and food products.  In this section, we describe the procedures
developed by EML for environmental sampling.  The corresponding
analytical procedures are presented later in this Manual.<p>


General guidance on collecting valid samples is given in Field Measurement
and Sampling:
<a href="qa06.html#QA06SEC2">Section 2 Techniques</a>.  Unlike chemical or radiometric
analyses, it is not possible to set down
step-by-step procedures for sampling.  For example, a variety of samples may be required for
the purpose of establishing relationships between concentrations in different matrices to further
the understanding of dynamic processes.  Also, the concentration of a particular pollutant in an
environmental matrix will change with time and location.<p>


Usually, the crucial decisions in planning a sampling program are how many sites should be
sampled and how often they should be sampled.  These decisions can only be made based on a
knowledge of the degree of variability due to these two factors.  Most sampling programs
require exploratory sampling so that the variability with time and location can be assessed in
comparison with the required uncertainty.  Experience has shown that statistical approaches
based on these exploratory samples usually lead to the taking of a smaller number of samples
than would have otherwise been predicted.  Another important consideration is that the number
of samples must be consistent with the available analytical facilities.<p>

Many times, the samples received in the laboratory may be representative of the particular
conditions to be evaluated, but are not in the proper physical form for analysis.  The samples
may require reduction in size, drying or some form of homogenizing before subsamples can be
taken for analysis.  Some general considerations concerning sample preparation are discussed
in Field Measurements and Sampling: <a href="qa06.html#QA06SEC3">Section 3 Preparation
and
Storage of Samples</a>.<p>


The philosophy at EML is usually to collect a sufficient amount of sample so that there is not
only enough to measure the constituent of interest, but also enough for re-analysis at a later
time.  Storage of samples for later analyses requires judgment in order to avoid loss of
constituents to be measured or to avoid undesirable decomposition.  EML maintains an
extensive library of samples associated with its research programs, in some cases going back
over 30 years (Klusek, 1989).<p>

<center><h2><b>OVERVIEW</b></h2><p>

</center>
<p>

Since about 1950, the Environmental Measurements Laboratory has carried out major research
programs directed at the study of ionizing radiation and natural and man-made radionuclides in
the working and in the public environment.  Among these studies have been: (1) the long-term
investigation of the atmospheric distribution and ground deposition of radionuclides from global
fallout generated by nuclear weapons tests; (2) the evaluation of the radiation exposure of human
populations from these nuclides as well as those deposited locally by the Nevada weapons tests,
those released from nuclear facilities (including the reactor accidents at Three Mile Island and
Chernobyl), and those normally present from natural sources; and (3) the determination of
radiation worker exposures at particle accelerators, nuclear reactors, and other nuclear facilities. 
An important component of these studies has been the development and improvement of
techniques for low-level radiation measurement and data interpretation.  In the following
sections, five highly generic measurement systems (<a href="rm02.htm" >ionization
chambers</a>, <a href="rm03.htm" >field gamma-ray
spectrometry</a>, <a href="rm04.htm" >remote gamma-ray spectrometry</a>, <a
href="rm05.htm" >thermoluminescence dosimetry</a> and bonner-
sphere <a href="rm06.htm">neutron spectrometry</a>) are described that have been developed
and/or refined at EML, and
that have found wide application in environmental radiation studies.  In each case, an essential
part of the system
is the methodology associated with detector calibration, measurement procedure(s), and data
analysis and interpretation.  The indicated references provide additional details and examples of
applications for the interested reader.<p>

<H2><b>OVERVIEW</b></h2><p>
<p>
This section describes current radionuclide measurement techniques in use at EML and their
associated data.  A radionuclide is identified by its three principal characteristics: half-life, type of
emission, and energy of the emission.  Sometimes overlooked in the process are progeny
radionuclides with their own particular characteristics.<p>

In the 1960s, routine measurements were being performed at EML for alpha, beta and gamma 
radionuclides.  Measurements in both the Frisch grid ion chamber and the solid-state surface
barrier detection systems were used to identify alpha energies in sources in properly calibrated
systems.  Contained in <a href="rd02.htm">Alpha</a> is a table of alpha emitters by energy,
especially linked to the charts of the naturally occurring radionuclides, which assists in
radionuclide identification in separated samples and in radionuclide purity checks.<p>

Routine measurement of beta emitters is performed on counters designed at EML.  These
counters have a very low background count rate due to anticoincidence counting techniques.  The
overall counting efficiencies are comparable to proportional counters.  Radiochemical purity is
typically assessed by decay measurements. <a href="rd03.htm">Beta</a> contains tables of beta
emitters by half-life and energy.<p>

Use of NaI(T1) gamma spectrometry detection systems provides poorly resolved spectra
compared with the Ge(Li) and intrinsic Ge systems presently in use.  The resolution of these
present systems require sophisticated computer algorithms to identify energies associated with
particular radionuclides.  It is most important that the energies and the branching ratios used at
any facility be documented and a table of gamma emitters in the environment is included in <a
href="rd04.htm">Gamma</a>.
<p>
Contained in the <a href="rd06.htm">Natural Decay Series</a> are charts of three natural
radionuclide series and the man-made americium series.  Pertinent data are included in these
charts.<p>

Seven major facilities that are used in research programs at EML are described.  Four of these are
stationary, and are located in EML's quarters in New York City (Radon Pulse Ionization
Chamber, Exposure Facility, 
Clean Room, Electron Microscope).  Two major on-site EML facilities are used for research on
Rn gas measurements, instruments, and methods (the pulse ionization chamber facility and the Rn,
Th, and progeny exposure facility).  

Two of the facilities are
mobile and are used in field sampling/ measurement work all over the U.S.(Mobile Laboratory,
Work Boat).  The seventh facility is an outdoor laboratory located in rural New Jersey (Chester
Regional Baseline Station).<p>

<p>

All seven facilities have been built up over a period of many years and we anticipate that they will
continue in operation for many additional years.  Although modifications to the facilities will be
made from time to time, the descriptions given here should remain substantially correct for years
to come.<p>

<P>
<HR>
The DOE Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML) administers for the Department of
Energy's <A HREF="http://www.em.doe.gov">Office of Environmental Management
(DOE/EM</A>) the Quality Assessment Program
(QAP) for environmental radiological analyses.  This program is also appropriate for evaluation of
radiological measurements for site survey and monitoring programs of DOE's <A HREF="http://www.eh.doe.gov">Office of
Environment, Safety and Health (DOE/EH)</A>.
<HR>
<A NAME="PE"></A></P>
<H2><B>Radiological Performance Evaluation Program</B></H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="QAP1.HTM">EML Quality Assessment Program (QAP)</A> is an external,
independent performance evaluation program designed to test the quality of environmental
radiological measurements reported by DOE contractor and sub-contractor laboratories.  The
program provides DOE with complex-wide comparability of environmental radiological analysis. 
Laboratories performing environmental radiological analyses for DOE/EM are required to
participate in QAP by a Secretarial memorandum (March 1993).  DOE/EH mandates participation
in the program (under DOE Order 5400.1, Ch4.10C) for laboratories that conduct analytical work
in support of DOE environmental radiological monitoring programs.
</P>
<P>
QAP provides four matrices.  The distribution typically consists of a simulated air filter, 200 g of
soil, 100 g of vegetation and 500 mL of spiked water.  These natural matrix and synthetic
samples, which have been prepared and analyzed at EML for as many as 15 radionuclides, are
distributed semi-annually to DOE contractors and other participating laboratories.  QAP is unique
in supplying multi-matrix, multi-nuclide samples.  Sample distributions are in March and
September without any financial obligations for the participating laboratories.
</P>
<P>
Participants can use any analytical method and are required to analyze only those
matrices/nuclides for which they contract to DOE.  Participants' results must be reported to EML
within 90 days.  A summary of the reported results is available to the participants 48 hours after
the reporting deadline via an Internet or modem connection to the EML computer.  This rapid
access to the data is another unique feature of QAP.  The reported results are then compared with
historically derived control limits.  An evaluation report is distributed to the participants within 30
days.  The participating laboratories and their reported results are identified.  QAP reports are
issued in July and January. 
<HR>
<A NAME="DBTR"></A></P>
<H2><B>Historical Database and Trend Reports</B></H2>
<P>
The QAP historical database is one of the most comprehensive environmental radiological data
sets in existence.  It contains data on some 48 radionuclide/matrix pairs from 1982 to the present. 
For any given radionuclide/ matrix there is a varying number of intercomparisons, levels of
activity , and number of reporting participants.  EML will, on request, supply participating
laboratories, QA personnel, or operational/project management with trend reports derived from
the historical database for any given laboratory.
<HR>
<A NAME="GAMMA"></A></P>
<H2><B>Gamma Spectrometry Data Validation Program</B></H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="gamma1.htm">Gamma Spectrometry Data Validation Program</A> provides DOE
with an assessment of the capabilities of the participating laboratories to perform routine
gamma-ray spectra analysis required for EM projects and site characterizations.  Previous studies
have
demonstrated that gamma-ray spectrometry software supplied by commercial manufacturers when
tested with complex spectra may provide spurious results.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the program receive a data disk or tape containing synthetic spectra designed
to test the sensitivity and capability of the spectrometry reduction system.  The disk/tape contains
sample spectra which the spectroscopist will be asked to accurately identify and quantify.  The
spectra will test both the gamma-ray spectrometry software and the ability of the user to properly
utilize the software.  Participants' results must be reported to EML within 60 days.  The expected
results will be distributed immediately after the reporting deadline.  An evaluation report is issued
within 90 days.
<HR>
<A NAME="TA"></A></P>
<H2><B>Technical Assistance</B></H2>
<P>
EML chemists provide technical assistance, on request, for any participating laboratory that
receives unsatisfactory evaluations.  This assistance may include, as appropriate, technical data
and document reviews, site visits, or providing off-cycle QAP samples for re-evaluation.   Data
and document reviews are the first step in determining whether the procedures and analytical
methods are technically accurate and appropriate for the sample, and if the analytical system is
biased.  If the document review indicates a need for further investigation, a visit to the laboratory
will be recommended.
</P>
<P>
The approach taken in the Technical Assistance Program is to identify analytical areas which are
contributing to poor performance.  The EML QAP is established as a performance-based
evaluation program, in contrast to performance programs with prescribed analytical methods. 
DOE's focus is on the quality of the analytical results independent of the analytical method. 
Performance based programs benefit the analytical community in that they promote better and
more efficient methods and state-of-the-art analytical technology.
<HR>
<A NAME="QCM"></A></P>
<H2><B>QC Materials</B></H2>
<P>
EML provides QC materials from its inventory of QAP samples and archive of environmental
samples for use in internal QA programs.  EML will also prepare
specialized samples on request.

</H2>
<P>EML's <SUP>222</SUP>Rn analyzers, deployed at the Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO; operated under the
auspices of the NOAA/ Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory) and at Bermuda (at the
Atmospheric/Ocean Chemistry Experiment Site at Tudor Hill, Bermuda), provide data used to
determine air mass provenance, specifically, the timing of continentally-derived air transported to
the mid-Atlantic and mid-Pacific.  Additionally, the <SUP>222</SUP>Rn data are used to better understand local
meteorological effects, as well as providing the scientific community a rare database used to
validate global transport models.  

</P>
<P>The databases can be viewed online if your browser supports tables, and can be downloaded in MS Excel 5.0 format or Adobe Acrobat PDF format. Each file contains one years data for one site.  Concentrations are in mBq m<SUP>-3</SUP>, with times listed being
the beginning of the sampling period.  For the MLO site, data are analyzed on a half-hour period, whereas at the Bermuda site data are analyzed on an hourly basis.

</P>
<P>For more information on the specifications and use of EML's <SUP>222</SUP>Rn analyzer, see Hutter et al.
(1995).

</P>
<P>The results of the first international intercomparison of atmospheric <SUP>222</SUP>Rn analyzers, including
EML's analyzer, was published in the <I>Journal of Geophysical Research</I> (Coll&#233; et al.).</P>
