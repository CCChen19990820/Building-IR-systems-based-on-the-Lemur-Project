<h1><center>The Karpeles Manuscript Library Creed</center></h1>
<p>As a child I remember a world filled with hope and pride.  Those who had pursued their goals, whether successfully or not,  reflected their pride and fulfillment.   One could feel their excitement in their desire to follow their new and future goals.  Those of us too young had hope and looked to the inspiration of our predecessors to give us purpose.<p>
The world is not longer so filled.   There is little hope and little pride.   Our children have no sense of purpose and few goals.  They make no commitments for fear that they will make mistakes and fail.  They see our mistakes but are blind to our accomplishments.  Their emptiness spreads over us all.<p><p>
I,  for one,  will not accept this.   I wish to renew that feeling I had as a child; that hope,  that pride,  that sense of purpose.    I believe that we learned those feelings by our exposure to the accomplishments of our predecessors.   We studied history;  we studied literature,  we studied government,  science,  philosophy,  art  and  music.   Our children have not.   They do not know who is Simon Bolivar,  Rudyard Kipling,  Immanuel Kant,  Franklin Pierce,  Sir Walter Raleigh,  Virginia Dare  or  Queen Isabella.  They are hardly aware of the Quest for the Indies,  the Origin of the Species, the discovery of vaccines,  the Reformation,  the Black Plague,  Esperanto,  the Peer Gynt Suites,  the Rubaiyat,  the Magna Carta.<p><p>
It is to cure this lack and thereby fulfill my own desire to renew the sense of purpose for our children and ourselves that the Karpeles Manuscript Library has been created.<p><p>

<center><h1>The Constitution of the Confederate States of America</h1><p>
In 1861,  after almost three-quarters of a century of use,  an opportunity arose to  analyze,  delete,  add to,  and alter  one of the greatest documents of all time; <p>

<h4>The United States Constitution </h4><p>
Given such test of time,  such opportunity of reflection,  how would some of the greatest legal minds change that great document? <p>
 
In answer to this question,  the prospective  forefathers met in Montgomery, Alabama,  early in the year 1861,  charged with this great task of surpassing the wisdom of James Madison,  George Washington,  Thomas Jefferson,  Benjamin Franklin,  John Adams  and George Mason.  The result of their 'reworking'  is embodied in one of the most fascinating documents in history.  The new Confederate Constitution would be patterned after the United States Constitution,  changed only in those clauses where any hint of weakness or limitation was determined. <p>

The first hint that the United States Constitution would stand as a model for the new Confederate States Constitution is evident in the first three words of that great new document,<p>

<h1>"We the People..."</h1><p>
As one reads through the draft of the new constitution,  some of the most interesting points are evident:<p>

Originally,  the right to vote was not limited to citizens!   Upon reflection, however,  such a restriction was included.<p>  

The number of representatives to Congress for each State was determined by a count of the population of that State......except that slaves would count as 3/5 of a person...and most Indians as 0!<p>

Of course,  the "Bill of Rights" which established freedom of speech,  of the press,  to peaceably assemble and  to petition the government,  etc.,  were all included in the main body of the text.<p>

No law denying the right of property in negro slaves could be passed.  However,  the importation of negroes of the African race,  from any foreign country . . . was forbidden!<p>   

The most interesting article is that of eligibility for president.  Anyone  (even foreign born)  who was a citizen of the Confederate States of America at the time of the adoption of the Constitution,  was eligible.  Also anyone who would become a citizen - but was born in the United States prior to December 20, 1860 was eligible.   In either case the person must have had fourteen years residency in the Confederate States of America.<p>





<I>We the people of the Confederate States,  each State acting (for itself,  and)  in its sovereign and independent character,   in order to form a permanent federal government,  establish justice,  insure domestic tranquility,  and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity - (to which ends we invoke) (invoking)   The favor and guidance of Almighty God - do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America...

<title>Ten Commandments description</title>

</head>

<body>

<h1> The Ten Commandmnents
</h1><p>
The first printing of the

The Ten Commandments

from the
The Gutenberg Bible<p>
(1450-1455)<br>

"Pause for a while,  for you look - and it may be for the first time - upon an actual page of the Gutenberg Bible,  the most precious piece of printing in the world"<br>



Prior to the 1450's,  the only written records.....and indeed the only written record of the Ten Commandments.....was a page handwritten by a scribe.  Such a page was beyond the affordability of the average person and in fact,  quite useless to the average person as such a person did not know how to read.    <br>


The Commandments are the obligations revealed by God to Moses on Mount Sinai and engraved on two stone tablets.<br>


Commandments 6 thru 9 are very short and concise ("Thou shall not murder"....."Thou shall not steal"...).  It is believed that the other commandments were originally as short, but later expanded for clarification.  The last commandments "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife.  You shall not set your desire on your neighbor's house."  was expanded slightly  (by Moses?!)  between the time God originally spoke them and the time Moses gave The Commandments to the people.   The phrase "Your neighbor's house."  was changed to "Your neighbor's house or land.",  presumably because the people were about to become landowners. <br>


The form of The Commandments are strikingly similar to international treaties written long before the birth of Moses.  Usually these treaties bound a weaker nation and it's king to a stronger nation and it's king, primarily for protection. <br>

<title><Bill of Rights></title>

</head>

<body>
<center><h1>THE</h1><p>
<h1>BILL OF RIGHTS</h1><p>
<h6>of the</h6><p>
<h3>UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION</h3><p>
<h6>Original manuscript draft submitted by Virginia, condensed and ratified as the first ten amendments to the<p>United States Constitution </h6></center><p>

<h3>The Bill of Rights,  the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution,  were instituted to protect individuals against abuse of power by their own government.<p> 
The first amendment,  most familiar to all,  guarantees;</h3><p>
<center>Freedom of religion<br>
Freedom of speech<br>
Freedom of the press<br>
Freedom of assembly</center><br>
<h3>These four are referred to as  "first amendment rights".<p>
Other amendments guarantee;</h3><p>
<center>The right to bear arms<br>
The protection against unreasonable searches and seizures<br>
The right to refuse to witness against ones self *<br>
The right to a speedy trial<br>
The right to trial by jury<br>
The protection against cruel and unusual punishment.<p>
</center>*(its use is called  "taking the 5th amendment")<p>

<h3>The original Constitution of the United States was ratified without a declaration of "Rights"</h3><p>

The fact that the inalienable rights embodied in the political philosophy of the Declaration of Independence was not included in the original text of the United States Constitution is at first a disturbing thought.   However,  the efforts to include these rights later in Congress,  and opposition to these efforts will explain the difficulties.<p>

The reasoning advanced by opponents of the inclusion of a declaration of Rights in the Constitution was that ......where no power had been granted there was no need of any protection against abuse of power.<p>

A further reason that the Constitutional Convention avoided a declaration of Rights was the expectation that it would declare that all men are born free!  Indeed the Declaration of Independence did state that all men were created equal,  that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights,  that among these are life,  liberty and the pursuit of happiness.   However,  as Charles Cotesworth Pinckney,  delegate to the Constitutional Convention from South Carolina pointed out.......a declaration of equality would be awkward when much of the property of South Carolinians consisted of men who were born slaves.<p>
According to James Madison's notes,  George Mason of Virginia proposed a Declaration of Rights on September 12, 1787,  prior to the close of the Constitutional Convention proceedings.   However,  The Convention failed to pass a declaration of Rights,  thus requiring its submission as a Bill after the Constitution's ratification by the States.<p>

<h3>Original Drafts of the Bill</h3><p>
At least three drafts of the proposed Bill of Rights exist;<p>
One draft,  in Madison's notes,  was just discovered(!) in the National Archives.<p>
The present draft, located in the Karpeles Manuscript Library,  is signed by the "President" of Virginia        and by the Secretary of the State Convention.<p>
A Third draft, similarly signed,  remains in the State of Virginia in private hands.<p>
The Joint Resolution of Congress submitting the amendments to the states and 11 state scribal copies of this document have also been preserved.  This resolution, containing 12 amendments, is kept in the National Archives and is considered the official copy. No final copy with the ratified 10 amendments was ever produced.<p>

<h3>Drafting of a Bill to add "Rights" to the approved Constitution.</h3><p> 
Once approved, the Constitution was sent to the States for ratification.  During the ratification conventions in each state,  amendments to the Constitution in the form of a Bill of Rights were discussed.  Six states--  Massachusetts,  South Carolina,  New Hampshire,  Virginia,  New York  and  North Carolina-- voted officially to submit proposals.   Of these,  the proposals of the State of Virginia evolved into the ten Amendments known as the Bill of Rights.<p>
The dominance of the powerful and leading state of Virginia in the framing of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is clear when one considers the Virginians involved:<p>
<B><h6>George Washington:  Delegate of Virginia.   President of the Constitutional Congress.<br>.....First President of the United States.<br>
James  Madison:  Delegate of Virginia.  "Father of the Constitution".<br>.....Submitted the proposed  Bill of Rights to Congress.  Fourth President of the United States.<br>
Thomas Jefferson:  Virginia.  Author of the Declaration of Independence.<br>.....Major advisor and policy former to the Constitutional Convention.  Third President of the United States.<br>
James Monroe:  Virginia.  Delegate to the Virginia ratifying convention.<br>.....Fifth President of the United States.<br>
George Mason:  Delegate of Virginia.  Formulated a Declaration in 1776 for the Virginia Constitution<br>.....which was used as the Virginia proposals to Congress in 1788<br>.....and evolved into the Bill of Rights of the United States.</B></h6><p>

<h3>Comparison of the Bill of Rights and its proposed draft.</h3><p>  
The final form of the Bill of Rights differs from its draft proposal in several interesting ways.   Of these,  three are worth special mention.<p>
First of all,  the draft submitted by Virginia contains twenty amendments.  Of these only twelve were approved by Congress to be submitted for ratification to the states.  Only ten of the twelve were ratified by the States.   Three States,  Massachusetts,  Connecticut and Georgia did not ratify the Bill of Rights until 1939, 150 years later.<p>
Secondly,  the order of listing the proposed amendments differed substantially;   in fact,  the "first Amendment" of the final Bill of Rights was originally proposed separately comprising proposed amendments numbered 15, 16 and 20.<p>
Finally,  the first Amendment in the proposed draft guaranteed the "Natural Rights" of life,  liberty and the pursuit of happiness and one other natural right.  The fact that the final Bill of Rights failed to include these natural rights, superfluous or not...redundant or not ... vague or not... withstanding the slavery question or not ... is indeed disparaging.   Equally interesting is the other natural right included in the proposed first amendment.  It is a "right" which may evoke debate today in opposition to so-called Human Rights.  The proposed first amendment contained four Natural Rights:  those of Life,  Liberty,  Possessing Property(!!)  and the Pursuit of Happiness.<p>

<title>Columbus description</title>

</head>

<body>

<h1>Columbus</h1><br>
The "Lettera Rarissima" 

is 

Columbus' Report

and published text of his letter

describing

His Last Voyage of

Discovery to The New World
in the year 1502-3 .<br>


Only one printed contemporary copy  (in the Marciana Library in Venice)
and one handwritten contemporary copy   (in the Karpeles Manuscript Library)
survive.<br>


In this letter,  Columbus describes,  for the first time,  the mainland coasts of the Americas....as his prior 3 visits reached only outlying islands.  He concludes with confidence that he has,  at last,  reached the Indies ......as China is clearly the next kingdom down the coast.<br>


Contrary to bright and cheery descriptions of the lush landscapes and the abundant fruit as described in 
 "The Columbus Letter",  the "Lettera Rarissima"   tells of  difficulties,  disasters and storms....reflecting the disappointment of Columbus in not getting proper recognition and rewards for his momentous discoveries.
The name "Lettera Rarissima"   is used in history books to describe this letter as only two copies survive.<br>

<center><h1>The Custer's Last Stand Treaty</h1><p></center>
<h1><i><center>See a high resolution picture<br>at the end of this description.</center></i></h3>
The Indian wars in the West started on August 17, 1862.<p>
  
The normally peaceful Sioux had already agreed to "civilized" lives  on a reservation in exchange for an annuity to cover certain needs, including food.<p>

<b>In 1862, </b> however,  the Federal Government found that it could not supply both these Sioux Indians and the needs of the troops in the new American Civil War. With no food coming from the federal government,  several young Indians decided to steal eggs from a local farmer.....inciting others....until over 600 settlers became victims.  392 Indians were captured and tried and 307 found guilty of rape and wounding women and children.<p>

  President Lincoln sent a  letter (also preserved at the Karpeles Manuscript Library)  to H. M. Rice,   first U. S. Senator from  Minnesota,  informing him that the Assistant Secretary of the Interior would personally oversee the peace negotiations.  The president reprieved all but 38 of the Indians,  who were then hanged in our country's largest execution.  Most of the Indians fled west spreading the news of the new found form of violent protest. <p>

The new Indian protests complicated the white man's  inevitable western migration.   Roads,  railroads,  and forts were being built on Indian land causing retaliatory attacks on the intruders.<p>

Some Indians  chose not to fight and accepted the (Unratified) Peace Treaty of 1866 (also preserved at the Karpeles Manuscript Library).   Others resisted  and fought a war to remove the white man from his lands.<p>

<b>In 1868, </b>  after two years of war,  the Sioux Indians,  under Chief Red Cloud,  succeeding in a negotiated defeat the United States!  A treaty was signed at Fort Laramie wherein the United States agreed to abandon the Boseman Trail,    remove all forts which were built in this Souix territory and guarantee the Souix fixed living boundaries and extended hunting boundaries.  Negotiations directly between Red Cloud and Congress,  in Washington,  later amended the meaning of the treaty to allow hunting parties to winter within the hunting boundaries.  (Even the United States Army had been forced to suspend operations and winter in camp during harsh weather.)<p>

The treaty was soon violated in 1874 by a survey party under General George A. Custer.  This trespass into the Black Hills living boundaries of the Sioux would not have been serious except that the survey party also discovered gold there.  The United States could not control the influx of fortune seekers that followed and,   indeed,  could use the financial gain to cure the economic recession of 1873.  First of all, the United States offered to purchase the lands in 1875,  but with no success.  A plan was then formulated to create a new war with the Sioux and to seize the gold lands.  The first step of the plan was to announce that any Indians found living within the hunting boundaries would be considered hostiles.  The Sioux pointed out that the treaty amendments specifically allowed for hunting parties to winter on those grounds.  The United States ignored those arguments and sent in the army to enforce the new policy.  By the time a sufficient force was amassed the next spring of 1876,  the Indians had sent massive reenforcements to join and protect their hunters.  Ironically,  the first attack was made by General Custer,  himself.  No one will know of his surprise at seeing the enormous reenforcements on June 24, 1876.....he and his men were massacred in a famous battle now known as<p>
 
Custer's last stand. <p> 

Custers's loss gave the government a better excuse than anyone in the administration had dreamed.  Even the news of the massacre arrived back East on the best possible moment,  July 4th, 1876,  the centennial of the Independence of the United States.  The public was easily swayed.  With little opposition from the public,  the government moved over 40% of its entire armed forces into the Black Hills area.  The Sioux had no choice than to agree to whatever demands were made by the United States government. <p> 

By the terms of the resulting agreement,  The Custer's Last Stand Treaty (also preserved at the Karpeles Manuscript Library),  the Sioux surrendered all claims and hunting rights,  as defined by the treaty of 1868,  to any country lying outside the boundaries of a new permanent "reserve".  The Government also would be given full possession the Black Hills.<p>

To be fair(!) and in consideration of these concessions,  the commissioners,  on behalf of the United States, agreed to furnish subsistence to the Sioux until such time as they shall become self-supporting by new means other than hunting.... the issue of rations was to be conditioned on the performance of labor by the Indians and the attendance of their children at school.<p>

The outrage of these actions by the United States was not addressed until 33 years later,  in 1910,  when the Sioux Nations sued in federal court.  The lawsuit lasted 70 years until,  in 1980,  the U.S. Supreme court ruled in favor of the Sioux,  awarding damages against the United States of $300,000,000.00.   It is said that the Sioux  have been unable to agree on how to use the funds.  It is reasonable to assume that they have invested the money in the meantime and that it could now have grown to total over a billion dollars.  <p>

<center>Quotes sent to Washington with the Custer's Last Stand Treaty.<br>
The quotes are from both sides;  the Indian negotiators (I)  and the Commissioner negotiators of the United States (C).<p></center>
 
"I am glad to see you,  you are our friends,  but I hear that you have come to move us.  Tell your people that since the Great Father promised that we should never be removed we have been moved five times.  I think you had better put the Indians on wheels and you can run them about wherever you wish."  (I)<p>

 "Our own people and the whole civilized world know that we are the aggressors."   (C)<p>

"(This war) has added to the cup of anguish which we have pressed to the lips of the Indian."  (C)<p>

"I tremble for my country when I remember that God is just."  (C)<p>

"We hardly know how to frame in words the feelings of shame and sorrow which fill our hearts as we recall the long record of the broken faith of our Government.....and that our Government has expended more money in this war than all the religious bodies of our country have spent in Indian missions since our existence as a nation."  (C)<p>

 "At times they told their story of wrongs with such impassioned earnestness that our cheeks crimsoned with shame.  In their speeches, the recital of the wrongs which their people had suffered at the hands of the whites, the arraignment of the Government for gross acts of injustice and fraud,  the description of treaties made only to be broken,  the doubts and distrusts of present professions of friendship and good-will,  were portrayed in colors so vivid and language so terse,  that admiration and surprise would have kept us silent had not shame and humiliation done so."  (C)<p>

"If the lands of the white man are taken,  civilization justifies him in resisting the invader.   If the Indian resists,  civilization,  with the Ten Commandments in one hand and the sword in the other,  demands his immediate extermination." <p>

"Wrongs are borne by the Indian in silence that never (would) fail to drive civilized men to deeds of violence."<p>

"Whenever you have found a white man who will tell the truth,  you may return,  and I shall be glad to see (negotiate with) you."   (I - Sitting Bull)<p>

"Give this pipe of peace to the Great Father.  When we give,  and another receives a pipe,  we regard it the same as when a white man swears on the Bible in court.  If they do not speak the truth, evil will happen."  (I)<p>

"We are not simply dealing with a poor perishing race;  we are dealing with God....We make it our boast that our country is the home of the oppressed of all lands.  Dare we forget that there are also those whom we have made homeless..."<p>

<h1>Darwin
</h1><p>
The Conclusion Page

of
Darwin's
Theory of Evolution
"Origin of Species"

Darwin's theory explains why humans and other animals look the way we do!  For example,  the reason why Giraffes have long necks is;

All giraffes with short necks couldn¹t reach the taller tree leaves.....so they died of starvation before they had babies!   Only the longer necked Giraffes lived long enough to have babies.  These babies all had long necks,  a feature that they inherited from their parents. 

Now,  a few of these babies had extra long necks....and in time,  there were only extra long necked giraffes (for the same reason given above). 

This is called ³Natural selection² or ³survival of the fittest².  Darwin said it like this:

"The facts . . . have convinced me. . . the Species have been modified,  during a long course of descent,  by the preservation or the natural selection of many successive slight favorable variations."
"Origin of Species";  Chapter XV;   Final Chapter;  Conclusion

He continues by insisting that the facts could not be explained except by the Theory of Natural Selection.

Darwin admits that no one knows yet the higher problem of the essence or origin of life.

<h1>The
Declaration
of
Allegiance

of the
American Indians

to the
United States</h1><p>

<h3>must rank as one of the five greatest documents in American history,  if not in world history.<br>
The others being;
<dd>The Declaration of Independence
of the United States, 
<dd>The United States Constitution, 
<dd>The Emancipation Proclamation 
and 
<dd>The Bill of Rights.<p></h3>


Although it marks the end of the sad conquest and assimilation into European-type society of the native Americans,  a fact which detracts from its greatness,   the document possesses many amazing attributes.<p>

First,  the document is signed by over 900 Chiefs,  far more leaders than any other document in world history.  These leaders represented 189 tribes who were at one time considered as independent Nations.<p>

Equally important,  these 189 tribes included every tribe in the United States with no exceptions.   It is the only document ever signed by all native American tribes in the United States.  The Declaration is the first voluntary acknowledgement of the sovereignty of the United States over all American Indian tribes.<p>

The fact that no tribe refused to sign and all tribes volunteered to sign may seem strange today,  but it was a special time of reconciliation even between Indian tribes.<p>

The birth of the concept of the Declaration of Allegiance dates back to September 1909,  the date of the last great Indian council,  participated in by eminent Indian Chiefs from nearly every tribe in the United States.  The dominant theme of the council was "peace"  between fellow Indians,  and all men.   The success of the Council led Congress and President Taft to pass a bill on December 8, 1911  for the erection of a National Indian Memorial  (in the harbor area of New York).   The dedication of the memorial was held on Washington's birthday in 1913,  attended by 32 Chiefs representing all Indian Nations.   It was here that the first page of the document was signed by the Chiefs and the President.   The consensus by the Chiefs was,  that for the first time they felt that they were part of this country.  It was then suggested that all the tribes be given the opportunity to sign the same pledge of loyalty.<p>

Mr. Rodman Wanamaker (of the Wanamaker Department store fame) initiated  an expedition of citizenship to all the tribes and was given the document by the government to proceed and obtain signatures from all who wished to sign.  The expedition took seven months,  covering 27,000 miles by train, boat,  stagecoach,  automobile, horseback and donkey.  Every tribe,  without exception,  signed.<p>

This document marked the beginning of a ten year movement to grant full citizenship rights to the American Indian,  finally given by the Act of Congress on  June 15, 1924.<p>

<h3>The History of Field Theory<br>
(³Olds and News of Field Theory²)<br>

By Albert Einstein </h3>   

 While physics wandered exclusively in the paths prepared by Newton, the following conception of physical reality prevailed:  Matter is real, and matter undergoes only those changes which we conceive as movements in space.  Motion, space and also time are real forms.  Every attempt to deny the physical reality of space collapses in face of the law of inertia.  For if acceleration is to be taken as real, then that space must also be real within which bodies are conceived as accelerated.  <p>

Newton saw this with perfect clarity and consequently he called space "absolute".  In his theoretical system, there was a third constituent of independent reality; the motive force acting between material particles, such forces being considered to depend only on the position of the particles.  These forces between particles were regarded as unconditionally associated with the particles themselves and as distributed spatially according to an unchanging law.<p>

The physicists of the nineteenth century considered that there existed two kinds of such matter, namely, ponderable matter and electricity.  The particles of ponderable matter were supposed to act on each other by gravitational forces under Newton's law, the particles of electrical matter by Coulomb forces also inversely proportional to the square of the distance.  No definite views prevailed regarding the nature of the forces acting between ponderable and electrical particles.<p>
<h3>The Old Theory of Space</h3>

Mere empty space was not admitted as a carrier for physical changes and processes. It was only, one might say, the stage on which the drama of material happenings was played.  Consequently Newton dealt with the fact that light is propagated in empty space by making the hypothesis that light also consists of material particles interacting with ponderable matter through special forces.  To this extend Newton's view of nature involved a third type of material particle, though this certainly had to have very different properties from the particles of the other forms of matter.  Light particles had, in fact, to be capable of being formed and of disappearing.  Moreover, even in the eighteenth century it was already clear from experience that light traveled in empty space with a definite velocity, a fact which obviously fitted badly into Newton's theoretical system, for why on earth should the light particles not be able to move through space with any arbitrary velocity?<p>

It need not, therefore, surprise us that this theoretical system, built up by Newton with his powerful and logical intellect, should have been overthrown precisely by a theory of light.  This was brought about by the Huygens-Young-Fresnel wave theory of light which the facts of interference and diffraction forced on stubbornly resisting physicists.  The great range of phenomena, which could be calculated and predicted to the finest detail by using this theory, delighted physicists and filled many fat and learned books.  No wonder then that the learned men failed to notice the crack which this theory made in the statue of their eternal goddess.  For, in fact, this theory upset the view that everything real can be conceived as the motion of particles in space.  Light waves, were, after all, nothing more than undulatory states of empty space, and space thus gave up its passive role as a mere stage for physical events.  The other hypothesis patched up the crack and made it invisible.<p>

The ether was invented, penetrating everything, filling the whole of space, and was admitted as a new kind of matter.  Thus it was overlooked that by this procedure space itself had been brought to life.  It is clear that this had really happened, since the ether was considered to be a sort of matter which could nowhere be removed.  It was thus to some degree identical with space itself; that is, something necessarily given with space.  Light was thus viewed as a dynamical process undergone, as it were by space itself.  In this way the field theory was born as an illegitimate child of Newtonian physics, though it was cleverly passed off a first as legitimate.  <p>

To become fully conscious of this change in outlook was a task for a highly original mind whose insight could go straight to essentials, a mind that never got stuck in formulas.  Faraday was this favored spirit.  His instinct revolted at the idea of forces acting directly at a distance which seemed contrary to every elementary observation.  If one electrified body attracts or repels a second body, this was for him brought about not by a direct action from the first body on the second, but through an intermediary action.  The first body brings the space immediately around it into a certain condition which spreads itself into more distant parts of space, according to a certain spatio-temporal law of propagation.  This condition of space was called "the electric field."  The second body experiences a force because it lies in the field of the first, and vice versa.  The "field" thus provided a conceptual apparatus which rendered unnecessary the idea of action at a distance.  Faraday also had the bold idea that under appropriate circumstances fields might detach themselves from the bodies producing them and speed away through space as free fields: this was his interpretation of light.<p>

Maxwell then discovered the wonderful group of formulae which seems so simple to us nowadays and which finally build the bridge between the theory of electro-magnetism and the theory of light. It appered that light consists of rapidly oscillating electro magnetic fields.<p>

After Hertz, in the '80s of the last century, had confirmed the existence of the electro-magnetic waves and displayed their identity with light by means of his wonderful experiments, the great intellectual revolution in physics gradually became complete.  People slowly accustomed themselves to the idea that the physical states of space itself were the final physical reality, especially after Lorentz had shown in his penetrating theoretical researches that even inside ponderable bodies the electro-magnetic fields are not to be regarded as states of the matter, but essentially as states of the empty space in which the material atoms are to be considered as loosely distributed.<p><h3>



Dissatisfied With Dual Theory</h3>

At the turn of the century physicists began to be dissatisfied with the dualism of a theory admitting two kinds of fundamental physical reality: on the one hand the field and on the other hand the material particles.  It is only natural that attempts were made to represent the material particles as structures in the field, that is, as places where the fields were exceptionally concentrated.  Any such representation of particles on the basis of the field theory would have been a great achievement, but in spite of all efforts of science it has not been accomplished.  It must even be admitted that this dualism is today sharper and more troublesome that it was ten years ago.  This fact is connected with the latest impetus to developments in quantum theory, where the theory of the continuum (field theory) and the essentially discontinuous interpretation of the elementary structures and processes are fighting for supremacy.<p>

We shall not here discuss questions concerning molecular theory, but shall describe the improvements made in the field theory during this century.<p>






<h3>[The Theory of Relativity]</h3>

These all arise from the theory of relativity, which has in the last six months entered its third stage of development.  Let us briefly examine the chief points of view belonging to these three stages and their relation to field theory.<p>

 <h3>[The Special Theory of Relativity]</h3>

The first stage, the special theory of relativity,  owes its origin principally to Maxwell's theory of the electro-magnetic field.  From this,  combined with the empirical fact that there does not exist any physically distinguishable state of motion which may be called "absolute rest",  arose a new theory of space and time.  It is well known that the theory discarded the absolute character of the conception of the simultaneity of two spatially separated events.  Well known is also the courage of despair with which some philosophers still defend themselves in a profusion of proud but empty words against this simple theory.<p>

On the other hand, the services tendered by the special theory of relativity to its parent,  Maxwell theory of the electro-magnetic field,  are less adequately recognized.  Up to that time the electric field and the magnetic field were regarded as existing separately even if a close causal correlation between the two types of field was provided by Maxwell's field equations.   But the special theory of relativity showed that this causal correlation corresponds to an essential identity of the two types of field.  In fact,  the same condition of space,  which in one coordinate system appears as a pure magnetic field,  appears simultaneously in another coordinate system in relative motion as an electric field,  and vice versa.  Relationship of this kind displaying an identity between different conceptions,  which therefore reduce the number of independent hypotheses and concepts of field theory and heighten its logical selfcontainedness are a characteristic feature of the theory of relativity.  For instance,  the special theory also indicated the essential identity of the conceptions' inertial mass and energy.  This is all generally known and is only mentioned here in order to emphasize the unitary tendency which dominates the whole development of the theory. <p><h3> 

[The General Theory of Relativity]</h3>

We now turn to the second stage in the development of the theory of relativity, the so-called general theory of relativity.  This theory also starts from a fact of experience which till then had received no satisfactory interpretation;  the equality of inertial and gravitational mass, or,  in other the words,  the fact known since the days of Galileo and Newton that all bodies fall with equal acceleration in the earth's gravitational field.  The theory uses a special theory as its basis and at the same time modifies it: the recognition that there is no state of motion whatever which is physically privileged - that is, that not only velocity but also acceleration are without absolute significance - forms the starting point of the theory.  It then compels a much more profound modification of the conceptions of space and time than were involved in the special theory.  For even if the special theory forced us to fuse space and time together to an invisible four-dimensional continuum, yet the Euclidean character of the continuum remained essentially intact in this theory.  In the general theory of relativity, this hypothesis regarding the Euclidean character of our space-time continuum had to be abandoned and the latter given the structure of a so-called Riemannian space.  Before we attempt to understand what these terms mean, let us recall what this theory accomplished.<p>

It furnished an exact field theory of gravitation and brought the latter into a fully determinate relationship to the metrical properties of the continuum.  The theory of gravitation, which until then had not advanced beyond Newton, was thus brought within Faraday's conception of the field in a necessary manner; that is, without any essential arbitrariness in the selection of the field laws.  At the same time gravitation and inertia were fused into an essential identity.  The confirmation which this theory has received in recent years through the measurement of the deflection of light rays in a gravitational field and the spectroscoptic examination of binary stars is well known.<p><h3>







[The Unitary Field Theory]</h3>

The characteristics which especially distinguish the general theory of relativity and even more the new third stage of the theory, the unitary field theory, from other physical theories are the degree of formal speculation, the slender empirical basis, the boldness in theoretical construction and, finally, the fundamental reliance on the uniformity of the secrets of natural law and their accessibility to the speculative intellect.  It is this feature which appears as a weakness to physicists who incline toward realism or positivism, but is especially attractive, nay, fascinating, to the  speculative mathematical mind.  Meyerson in his brilliant studies on the theory of knowledge justly draws a comparison of the intellectual attitude of the relativity theoretician with that of Descartes, or even of Hegel, without thereby implying the censure which a physicist would read into this.  However that may be in the end experience is the only competent judge.<p>

Yet in the meantime one thing may be said in defense of the theory.  Advance in scientific knowledge must bring about the result that an increase in formal simplicity can only be won at the cost of an increased distance or gap between the fundamental hypothesis of the theory on the one hand and the directly observed facts on the other hand.  Theory is compelled to pass more and more from the inductive to the deductive method, even though the most important demand to be made of every scientific theory will always remain: that it must fit the facts.<p>

We now reach the difficult task of giving to the reader an idea of the methods used in the mathematical construction which led to the general theory of relativity and to the new unitary field theory.<p><h3>



The Problem Stated</h3>

The general problem is:  Which are the simplest formal structures that can be attributed to a four-dimensional continuum and which are the simplest laws that may be conceived to govern these structures?  We then look for the mathematical expression of the physical fields in these formal structures and for the field laws of physics - already known to a certain approximation from earlier researches - in the simplest laws governing this structure. <p> 

The conceptions which are used in this connection can be explained just as well in a two-dimensional continuum (a surface) as in the four-dimensional continuum of space and time.  Imagine a piece of paper ruled in millimeter squares.  What does it mean if I say that the printed surface is two-dimensional?  If any point P  is marked on the paper, one can define its position by using two numbers.  Thus, starting from the bottom left-hand corner, move a pointer toward the right until the lower end of the vertical through the point P  is reached.  Suppose that in doing this one has passed the the lower ends of X  vertical (millimeter) lines.  Then move the pointer up to the point P  passing Y  horizontal lines.  The point P  is then described without ambiguity by the numbers X Y  (coordinates).  If one had used, instead of ruled millimeter paper, a piece which had been stretched or deformed the same determination could still be carried out: but in this case the lines passed would no longer be horizontals or verticals or even straight lines.  The same point would then, of course, yield different numbers, but the possibility of determining a point by means of two numbers (Gaussian coordinates) still remains.  Moreover, if P  and Q  are two points which lie very close to one another, then their coordinates differ only very slightly.  When a point can be described by two numbers in this way, we speak of a two-dimensional continuum (surface).<p><h3>



Riemannian Metric</h3>

Now consider two neighboring points P, Q,  on the surface and a little way off another pair of points P'  and Q' .  What does it mean  to say that the distance P Q is equal to the distance P' Q' ?  This statement only has a clear meaning when we have a small measuring rod which we can take from one pair of points to the other and if the result of the comparison is independent of the particular measuring rod selected.  If this is so, the magnitudes of the tracts P Q,  P' Q'  can be compared.  If a continuum is of this kind we say it has a metric.  Of course, the distance of the two points P Q  must depend on the coordinate differences (dx. dy).  But the form if this dependence is not known as a priori.  It is of the form:<p>

 ds2 = g11dx2  + 2 g11 g22 dx dy + g22 dy2<p>

Then it is called a Riemannian metric.  If it is possible to choose the coordinates so that this expression takes the form:  <p>                                                       ds2 = dx2 + dy2

(Pythagoras's theorem), then the continuum is Euclidean (a plane).<p>

Thus it is clear that the Euclidean continuum is a special case of the Riemannian.  Inversely, the Riemannian continuum is a metric continuum which is Euclidean in infinitely small regions,  but not in finite regions.  The quantities g11, g12, and g22  describe the metrical properties of the surface; that is, the metrical field.<p>

By making use of empirically known properties of space, especially the law of the propagation of light;  it is possible to show that the space - time continuum has a Riemannian metric.  The quantities g11, g12, and g22   , appertaining to it,  determine not only the metric of the continuum, but  also the gravitational field.  The law governing the gravitational field is found in answer to the question: Which are the simplest mathematical laws to which the metric (that is the  g11, g12, and g22) can be subjected?  The answer was given by the discovery of the field laws of gravitation, which have proved themselves more accurate than the Newtonian law.  This rough outline is intended only to give a general idea of the sense in which I have spoken of the "speculative" methods of the general theory of relativity.<p><h3>
Expanding the Theory.</h3>

This theory having brought together the metric and gravitation would have been completely satisfactory of the world had only gravitational fields and no electro-magnetic fields.  Not it is true that the latter can be included within the general theory of relativity by taking over and appropriately modifying Maxwell's equations of the electro-magnetic field, but they do not then appear like the gravitational fields as structural properties of the space - time continuum, but as logically independent constructions.  The two types of field are causally linked in this theory, but still not fused to an identity.  It can, however, scarcely be imagined that empty space has conditions or states of two essentially different kinds, and it is natural to suspect that this only appears to be so because the structure of the physical continuum is not completely described by the Riemannian metric.<p>

The new unitary field theory removes this fault by displaying both types of field as manifestations of one comprehensive type of spatial structure in the space-time continuum.  The stimulus to the new theory arose from the discovery that there exists a structure between the Riemannian space structure and the Euclidean, which is richer in formal relationships than the former but poorer than the latter.  Consider a two-dimension Riemannian space in the form of the surface of a hen's egg.  Since this surface is embedded in our (accurately enough) Euclidean space, it possesses a Riemannian metric.  In fact, it has a perfectly definite meaning to speak of the distance of two neighboring points P, Q on the surface.  Similarly it has, of course, a meaning to say of two such pairs of points (PQ) (P'Q'), at separate parts of the surface of the egg, that the distance PQ is equal to the distance P'Q'.  On the other hand, it is impossible now to compare the direction PQ with the direction P'Q'.  In particular it is meaningless to demand that P'Q' shall be chosen parallel to PQ.  In the corresponding Euclidean geometry of two dimensions, the Euclidean geometry of the plan, directions can be compared and the relationship of parallelism can exist between lines in regions of the plane at any distance from one another (distant parallelism).  To this extend the Euclidean continuum is richer in relationships than the Riemannian.<p><h3>


A Mathematical Discovery</h3>

The new unitary field theory is based on the following mathematical discovery:  There are continua with a Riemannian metric and distant parallelism which nevertheless are not Euclidean.  It is easy to show, for instance, in the case of three-dimensional space, how such a continuum differs from a Euclidean.<p>

First of all, in such a continuum there are lines whose elements are parallel to one another. We shall call those "straight lines".  It also has a definite meaning to speak of two parallel straight lines as in the Euclidean case.  Now choose two such parallels  E1L1  and E2L2   and mark on each a point P1, P2.<p>

On  E1L1 choose in addition a point Q1.  If we now draw through Q1 a straight line Q1-R      parallel to the straight line P1, P2, then in Euclidean geometry this will cut the straight line E2L2 ; in the geometry now used the line Q1-R and the line     do not in general cut one another.  To this extent the geometry now used is not only a specialization of the Riemannian but also a generalization of the Euclidean geometry.  My opinion is that our space-time continuum has a structure of the kind here outlined.<p>

The mathematical problem whose solution, in my view, leads to the correct field laws is to be formulated thus: which are the simplest and most natural conditions to which a continuum of this kind can be subjected?  The answer to this question which I have attempted to give in a new paper yields unitary field laws for gravitation and electro-magnetism.<p>

<h1>John Locke
</h1><p>


It would be difficult to overestimate the influence and importance of John Locke's life and writings on the subsequent history of the western world.<br>

Thomas Jefferson referred to Locke  as one of "the three greatest men that have ever lived,  without any exception."  In writing the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson drew heavily on the doctrines concerning the general principles of liberty and the rights of man which Locke set forth in his work; Of Civil Government.  In particular, in the first draft of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson copied Locke's words, "Life, liberty and property" which were subsequently changed to "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." <br>
Locke's influence is easily perceived in the work of not only Jefferson, but Alexander Hamilton, Jonathan Edwards, Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Leibnitz (as an opponent) and Kant. <br>

Locke's influence and importance are succinctly and accurately summed up by R.I. Aaron, Professor of Philosophy, University of Wales, who hailed him as the 
initiator of the age of enlightenment and reason
and
an inspirer of the Constitution
...and more than a quarter of a millennium after his death, still a powerful influence on the life and thought of the West.<p>

<center>The Essay concerning
Human Understanding</center><p>

The key to Locke's prominence in
 'bringing the world out of the dark ages'
is his treatise
³Essay concerning Human Understanding².
  This work stands as one of the greatest advancements in world history.

In this monumental work,  Locke examines many topics of human existence and thought;   God, the soul, knowledge, freedom,  will,  ideas,  liberty of thought,  power, identity,  morals,  etc..<br>


Locke's outline of the sections of his chapter on freedom and will  gives a sense of the direction he follows; (Document #71593)<br>

28.  Volition is the ordering of some action by 	thought.<br>

29.  Uneasiness determines the will.<br>

30.  Will must be distinguished from desire.<br>
31.  The greater good in view barely consider'd 	determines not the will.   The joys of 	heaven are often neglected.<br>

32.  Desire determines the will.<br>

33.  Desire is an uneasiness.<br>

34.  The greatest present uneasiness usually 	determines the will,  as is evident in 	experience. <br>

35.  Because uneasiness being a part of 	unhappiness which is first to be
	removed in our way to happiness.<br>

36.  Because uneasiness alone is present.<br>

37.  The uneasiness of other passions have their 	share with desire.<br>

38.  Happiness alone moves the desire.<br>

39.  All absent good not desired, because not 	necessary to our happiness.<br>

40.  The greatest uneasiness does not always 	determine the will, we can suspend the 	execution of our desires.<p>
		
Locke's major hypothesis is that
man is born with no knowledge,
like a clear blackboard....
Knowledge is gained by the input from the five senses-and the experiences so entered fill the blackboard and create the knowledge.<p>


Most of Locke's reasoning is very difficult to analyze,  even now, 300 years later,  but the importance in his work is the fact that no one had ever before propounded such a subject of consideration.  As he himself put it; (Document #32893)

". . . My notions in this treatise has run me . . . far out of the common road and practice. . ."<br>


As an example,  in one letter Locke begins, "Thought can never begin to be", referring to the fact experiences must enter through the senses in order to formulate thought.  This particular passage then proceeds through a complex path of reasoning and finally concludes (!!) that;  God must therefore be spiritual and not material; (Document #10292/3)<br>


Thought can never begin to be:  for it is impossible to conceive that matter; either with or without motion, could have originally in and from itself sense, perception, and knowledge, as is evident from hence, that sense, perception and knowledge must then be a property eternally inseparable from matter, and every particle of it.  Not to add, that though our general or specific conception of matter makes us speak of it as one thing, yet really all matter is not one individual thing, neither is there any such thing existing as one material being or one body, that we know or can conceive.  And therefore, if matter were the eternal first cogitative being, there would not be one eternal infinite cogitative being; but an infinite number of finite cogitative beings, independent one of another, of limited force and distinct thoughts, which could never produce that order, harmony and beauty as to be found in nature.  Since therefore whatsoever is the first eternal being must necessarily be cogitative; and whatsoever is first of all things . . . higher degree, it necessarily follows, that the eternal first being cannot be matter".<br>





Locke also discusses,  in detail,  the difference between an object and the idea representing the object.

<img  align=left src="luther.GIF">
<h1> Martin Luther
</h1><p>

(1532)

Marking
the
Recognition
of the
Protestant Movement<p>

Luther approves the proposed terms of a treaty between Emperor Charles V and the Protestants.<br>

In 1529,  the withdrawal of the concessions given at the Imperial Diet at Speyer had provoked the protest of the minority of evangelical princes and of 14 imperial cities,  which earned the protesters the title of Protestants.   By 1532,  the Protestant movement had grown to the extent that various Protestant Princes and States formed the  "Schmalkaldic League"   and threatened war on the Emperor.  At the same time the powerful Turkish armies were also advancing on Rome.<br>

Emperor Charles V proposed a treaty which would exchange recognition of the Protestant movement for the Protestant support against the Turks*.   The treaty also marked the first time in history that the Protestants had ever formally signed any agreement with the Catholic Church.  Indeed,  it was the first time that they were recognized as an independent religious/political power. <br>

In this letter,  written to influence the Leader of the League,  the Prince of Saxony,  to support the treaty during the negotiations to avert the imminent war,  Luther argues that disapproval of the terms would result in "letting in the Turks" and the possible destruction of the Empire along with both religions and everything else.  Both sides agreed and signed the Treaty of Nurnberg in July 1532.<br>

 
*and Protestant support in electing Charles V's brother,  the future Emperor Ferdinand I,  as Roman King.

<title>Roget's Thesaurus</title>
<h1><i>See a high resolution picture<br>at the end of the description</h1></i>
</head>

<body>
<center><h1>Roget's Thesaurus</h1>
<i>"The man is not wholly evil-
he has a Thesaurus in his cabin"</i><br>
(quote from the J. M. Barrie's children's book;  "Peter Pan" 
in his description of  "Captain Hook".)<p>
Dr. Peter Mark Roget<br>
(1779-1869)<br>

philologist,  scientist,  physician<br>


The name Roget could soon become a virtual synonym for the word "synonym".<br>


For those who use
Roget's Thesaurus 
it is one of the three most important books ever printed...along with The Bible  and Webster's Dictionary.<br>


In order to communicate one's exact intention...or one's precise meaning,  the Thesaurus,  being a list of synonyms or verbal equivalents,  is a necessary tool.<br>
 

The first draft of the Thesaurus was written in 1805,  two years before Webster started on his dictionary.  However for a period of 47 years Dr. Roget used his manuscript as his personal,  secret,  treasure trove.  Not until he was 73 years old did he decide to reveal and publish this great manuscript.  <br>


____________________



Since 1852,  Roget's Thesaurus  has never been out of print.  In fact,  each succeeding edition has increased the popularity of the work.  The original 15,000 words included in the 1805 manuscript  has increased to over a quarter  of a million in the 1992 edition (the tenth printing).  With such an increase in size,  it is encouraging to notice that the basic content still remains intact..... for example,  
where the 1805 Thesaurus traces the word:  <br>


existence:  "Ens, entity, being, existence, essence...",  the 1992 Thesaurus contains<br>


existence:  "existence, being, entity, ens,...essence..."<br>

________________

The
Karpeles Manuscript Library
also preserves a small archive of Dr. Roget's manuscripts including 
 the complete original manuscript 
of
Roget's Thesaurus<br>


Among the other items preserved in the Roget archive is his autobiography,  his doctoral diploma and his birth certificate.<br>

From the Preface to the first edition of Roget's Thesaurus,  he states:<br>


"It is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded.  Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.  I had often during that long interval found this little collection, scanty and imperfect though it was, of much use to me in literary composition, and often contemplated its extension and improvement; but a sense of the magnitude of the task, amidst a multiple of other avocations, deterred me from the attempt.  Since my retirement from the duties of Secretary to the Royal Society, however, finding myself possessed of more leisure, and believing that a repertory of which I had myself experienced the advantage might, when amplified, prove useful to others, I resolved to embark in an undertaking which, for the last three or four years, has given me incessant occupation . . .

<title>Webster's Dictionary</title>
<h1><i>See a high resolution picture<br>at the end of the description</h1></i>
</head>

<body>
<center><h1>Webster's Dictionary</h1>


Noah Webster<br>
(1758-1843)<br>

lexicographer,  teacher,  journalist, essayist, lecturer  and  patriot<p>


The name Webster has become a virtual synonym for the word Dictionary.<br>


  Noah Webster led a very active life.  He served in the Revolutionary War and attended Yale College (graduating in the class of 1778).  Webster went on to teach school,  do clerical work,  study law, and   in 1781,  was admitted to the bar.<br>


  While teaching,  Webster became dissatisfied with the texts for children that ignored American culture and began his life-long effort to promote a distinctively American education.  One of his first efforts was The American Spelling Book (1783);  the famed "Blue Backed Speller" which has never been out of print and has had a total sales volume estimated at 100,000,000 copies.<br>


  In 1806, Webster published his Compendious Dictionary of the English Language.  Although it was no more than preparation for his later dictionary,  it contained 5,000 more words than Samuel Johnson's 1755 dictionary and also a number of innovations including the first separation of i and j, and v and u, as alphabetical entities.  In addition to the compiling of The Dictionary,  Webster wrote on many subjects including politics, medicine, economics and science.<br>



One hundred years after Webster
published his
American Dictionary 
of the
English Language 
it was hailed as

the most significant contribution to the growth of English lexicography 
 
a view that is still true today.<br>



The
American
Dictionary
of the
English
Language

was first published in 1828 and set the standard for all succeeding works that were to follow. <br>
 

  Webster's Dictionary contained over 70,000  entries,  with 35,000 to 40,000 of those definitions never having been in any earlier dictionary. <br>


  Webster's emphasis was on American pronunciation and usage as distinguished from British forms.   His dictionary was also noted for its clear and complete definitions and the inclusion of non-literary words and technical terms from the arts and sciences.....Perhaps its strongest new feature.<br>


  Unfortunately, the American Dictionary was relatively unprofitable and the 1841 revision unsuccessful.<br>


  After Webster's death in 1843, the rights to the dictionary were purchased by George and Charles Merriam. The new company and its  successors continued the work with many subsequent revisions.<br>

<title>Wedding March description</title>

</head>

<body>

<center><h1>Wedding March<br>Processional<br>(³Here Comes the Bride²)

</h1>
from the opera 
<h1>"Lohengren"</h1>

The idea for "Lohengren"  came to Wagner in Paris while searching for new material.  He had read a contemporary version of the the story of Tannhauser. This set him to work tracing to its source,  the connection of this story with that of the Wartberg song contest.  Thus he came to read  "Der Wartbergkrieg", which introduces the story of Lohengren.  When Wagner finished this research he said,  ".... an entirely new world of poetical matter opened up before me...." .   He began making sketches for his books on "Lohengren"   while still working on his production of "Tannhauser".
It is from "Lohengren"   that one of the most famous passages in music history originates...commonly known as as "Here Comes The Bride"  or  "The Wedding March"  or just  "The Bridal Chorus".  It has been a favorite since being introduced as the processional in a wedding during Civil War days. 
The original draft of processional "The Wedding March" is preserved at the Karpeles Manuscript Library.<br>
__________________________<p>
Also preserved at the Karpeles Manuscript Library is the manuscript of
<h1>The Wedding March</h1>
<h2>recessional</h2>
from<br>
<h2>Felix Mendelssohn's<br>
A Midsummer Night's Dream</h2>

The fashion for playing the Wedding March recessional at weddings originates from a performance of this piece at the wedding of the English Princess Royal after Mendelssohn's death in 1858.<p>

<title><Bill of Rights</title>

</head>

<body>
<center><h1>The</h1><p>
<h1>Olive Branch Petition</h1>
<img  align=left src="oliveb.gif"></p>
The humble petition of Congress,  1775<p>

This document has the distinction,  owing to its outstanding importance,  of having been given a special designation by historians..... much in the same way as we speak of Magna Charta  or the Declaration .....and is referred to generally as the Olive Branch.  The reason is not hard to see,  for it represents the final effort of the American Colonists to have their conditions ameliorated and the differences between themselves and the Mother Country settled amicably.  This in spite of the fact that hostilities had already opened,  and action had been initiated at Concord,  Lexington and Bunker Hill. <br>
 

Certain of the representatives were in favor of a conciliation and were not prepared to follow the majority in a declaration of independence.  In order to obtain unanimous action,  the majority agreed with the minority to present this petition,  evidently believing that if it was turned down or ignored by the King,  the minority would be willing to agree with the majority and declare for independence. <br>
 
The document is in the form of a petition to King George III,  and was adopted and two originals signed by members of the Continental Congress in July,  1775.  Among the signatures are those of John Hancock,  Benjamin Franklin,  Samuel Adams,  John Adams,  Thomas Jefferson,  Patrick Henry,  John Jay,  Roger Sherman,  Lewis Morris,  and many other founding fathers.  In John Adams' record,  it is said that "a petition was sent yesterday by Mr. Richard Penn in one ship and a duplicate goes in another ship this day."   Richard Penn and Arthur Lee were deputed to take it to England,  and on August 21, 1775,  they had a working copy written and sent to Lord Dartmouth,  Secretary of State for the Colonies,  and named August 23rd as the date for the formal presentation of the original. <br>
 
Lord Dartmouth received the original from Penn on September 1st,  but the King would not see him  On being pressed for a reply,  Lord Dartmouth said: "As His Majesty did not receive the petition on the throne,  no answer will be given."   As a result of this action,  and the cold shoulder given to the petition,  the way was cleared for the Declaration of Independence
in 1776,.........and the Revolution went on to  its successful conclusion. <br>
 
Only two originals, signed by the Congressional delegates, and one working copy of the Petition  are known:  one original in the Public Record Office,  London;  the second in the New York Public Library.  The working copy is preserved in the Karpeles Manuscript Library,  in Santa Barbara,  as well as the original report on the missions failure. <br>

 On September 2, 1775,  Penn and Lee reported back to Congress: <br>
 
"On the 21 st of  last month,  we sent to the Secretary of State for America,  a copy of the Petition from the general Congress;  and yesterday,  the first moment that was permitted us,  we presented to him the Original,   which his lordship promised to deliver to his Majesty.<br>

We thought it our duty to press his Lordship to obtain an answer;  but we were told that his Majesty did not receive it on the throne,  no answer would be given.<br>

yr most faithful Servants<br>
Rich.d  Penn<br>
Arthur Lee"<br>

<TITLE>Santa Barbara, The Local Way</TITLE>
Tour Santa Barbara, The Local Way<P>			-Scott Padrick<P>
	Santa Barbara was founded in 1782 by Franciscan monks from Spain and Mexico. The city has often 
been described as the riveira of the pacific, because of its Spanish charm and tropical climate. Only 90 miles 
from Los Angeles its no wonder many celebertys homes and vacation get aways are hidden in the many 
communities of the city. Sundays are the best day to visit the city as you will get to partake in the many 
outdoor festivals and lower prices. Coming north on the 101, as you approach the county line, you will come 
upon the communities of Carpenteria, Summerland and Montecito.<P>
	Carpenteria is known for its farming and agriculture industries, most popular of the products grown 
here are the world renown flowers used in many pageants and the rose parade. In this community you will also 
see Santa Claus village (to your left) marked by a statue of Santa, there are shops and restaurants here. In the 
community of Summerland you will find many quaint restaurants, country inns and collectable shops, this is a 
good place to stop and take in some of Santa Barbarous culinary delight, and be sure to visit the Nugget 
restaurant where president Clinton jammed with locals on a recent visit. Traveling through Montecito you will 
get a look at the fabulous architecture of Santa Barbara, this town is home to many celebrates, and the elite of 
the city. There are many vast properties which house many of the countries most prestigious restaurants and 
clubs, among these is Westmont Collage. While touring the community you might notice many of the 
residences have been used in movies of the past.<P>
	After passing through Montecito you will come upon the City of Santa Barbara, turning off at HOT 
SPRINGS exit, you will begin your impromptu tour of Santa Barbara. Take a left and under the Freeway onto 
Cabrillo Boulevard. On your right you will see the The Andre Clark Bird Refuge, home to some 100 species 
of birds and aquatic life. Continuing down Cabrillo Boulevard you will see to your left, East Beach, which 
plays host to many recreational and professional volleyball tournaments during the year. Coming upon Ninos 
Drive (on your right), home of the Santa Barbara Zoological gardens. The Zoo is home to over five hundred 
animals as well as botanical life. Still traveling north on Cabrillo boulevard you will come upon the many 
hotels of the city, among these is The Fess Parkers Red Lion Resort. Traveling on to the right you will come 
upon the chamber of commerce, this is the original building transported here in the '80, here you can find 
many tourist maps and brochures about the city. If you are here on Sunday you might want to park in this lot 
and visit the seaside festival on the right side of Cabrillo boulevard. This festival offers the best of  Santa 
Barbara souvenirs and crafts. Going further down Cabrillo Boulevard to the left you will see Sterns Wharf. 
Built in  1872 by a enterprising railroad owner this is now home to many restaurants and shops. At the foot of 
the wharf is the dolphin statue given to the city by our sister city Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. This is a good 
place to find a parking place(don't park on the wharf it cost to much, see above for parking) and take a walking 
tour of the beach, wharf and lower downtown shops or rent a cruiser biker or roller blades and take them on  
the beach walk. You can also join a trolley tour of the city at the foot of the wharf. Further down Cabrillo 
Boulevard you will come upon the harbor to your left and the carriage museum to your right. The Harbor is 
home to many Yachts as well as commercial fishing vessels, if you have time this is a good place to take in a 
whale watching tour, leaving every two hours or just take a walk to the end of the breakwater , to view the city 
as well as the islands on a clear day. Down Castillo Boulevard (right) you will find the Carriage museum, the 
museum is only open Sundays from 2 to 4 PM and home to many Victorian and Spanish house carriages of 
historic Santa Barbara, as well as a fire pump.  Continuing on take a left down Cliff Drive you will come 
upon Santa Barbara City Collage to your left. Santa Barbara city collage overlooks the ocean in one of most 
beautiful campuses of any educational institute. Going further down cliff drive about 1 1/2 miles, through 
many residential zones  you will come to Arroyo Burro Beach, a good place to spend the day taking in the 
waves, or go to the cliffs adjacent the beach and watch the hang gliders take off and land(providing its windy 
enough). Coming further down Cliff Drive it will turn into Las Palmas Drive this road will take you past 
many homes and estates, some belonging to celebrates, in the community of Hope Ranch. After winding your 
way through the homes Las Palmas road will turn into La Cumbre Road. On the right you will see the La 
Cumbre Plaza one of the many shopping resorts of the city. Continue on La Cumbre road until you reach 
Foothill Road take a right here and continue on about 2 miles through more residential zones.  When you 
reach the stop sign you can either turn right and go on with the tour or go strait and visit the botanical gardens. 
If you have the time I highly recommend the botanical gardens. Going strait you will come to a fire station, 
here you will continue up Mission Canyon and following the signs you will wind up a mountainous road and 
eventually end up at The Botanical gardens, home to over 1000 species of botanical life, as well as many 
endangered species of plants. Continuing on with our tour, at the stop sign you will go right down Mission 
Canyon Road(or left if you went to the gardens). Traveling south down this road you will come to Sycamore 
Canyon Road (on your right)at the end of this road resides the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History.  
The museum offers many presentations on past life in Santa Barbara, exhibits include a blue whale skeleton, a 
planetarium and a Indian hall as well as many others. Going back down Mission Canyon Road you will come 
to the Santa Barbara Mission. The queen of the mission, Santa Barbara Mission is one of the most beautiful 
missions in the California Mission Chain, tours are offered daily from the gift shop. Further down Mission 
Road  take a left on State Street. This is the towns main street, down the street about one mile lies the 
downtown shopping district. Here you will find the Arlington Theater and a block down the Granada Theater, 
Offering nightly entertainment. Go left on Victoria Street  and then right on Anacapa Street. You should 
park now for the ladder part of the tour is better to walk. Down Anacapa street one block is the Santa Barbara 
Court House. The court house offers daily tours or self guided tours. Across the street from the court house is 
the library, which leads through a court yard and back to  State Street. Again depending on your time you will 
want to explore the many fine restaurants on this street or you might want to go shopping. If you plan to attend 
a theatrical event at either of the theaters you might want to purchase your tickets now to assure better seating, 
shows usually begin at 8:00 p.m., there are also many other movie complexes further down the street. On the 
corner of Anapumu and State you will find the Museum of Art, housing many of the worlds finest traveling art 
exhibits. Traveling down the street you will see a vast array of shopping pleasures and eateries, some of  the 
better stores are World of Magic, Comics On Parade , Rudys Mexican Food, The Earthling Book shop and 
many more. Down about 4 blocks on the left side of the street lies the Paseo Nuevo, this mall simulates the 
streets of Spain with many specialty shops and restaurants. Across from the Paseo Nuevo you will come to De 
La Guerra Street  if you travel down this street a block you will come to the Santa Barbara Historical 
Museum and Santa Barbara Presidio. These museums offer a glimpse of what life was like for early Santa 
Barbarans and solders. When your day is over (or you are seeing a show) travel back up State Street, when you 
come to the Granada Theater, start looking for the alley way . When you find the alley walk through to the 
parking lot in the rear, this is where you are parked. When you are ready to go back to Los Angeles travel 
down Anacapa Street  until you get to Haley Street talk a left here, get in the right lane.
Travel down this street about 3 blocks to Garden Street take a right and go under the freeway and get in the 
left turn lane, (to get on the freeway). Go Southbound on the 101 until you get back to your destination.<P>

<TITLE>San Marcos High School Performing Arts Department</TITLE>
<H4>San Marcos High School Performing Arts Department</H4><H6>San Marcos High School (SMHS) is the unoffical 'performing arts high school' in the city of Santa Barbara. SMHS has been known for giving the community quality entertainment for minimal cash. In a time of school closures and budget cuts SMHS urges you the community to support its performing arts productions, so it can keep the quality education and productions it has since been known for in the entertainment industry.</H6><P>
<BR>
<H3>SMHS Performing Arts Department Proudly Presents:</H3>
<H1>Kiss Me Kate</H1>
<P>
<P>
<HR>
<I>If you enjoyed the production you saw, SMHS urges you to write the school board and let them know, the Santa Barbara school district has taken drastic cuts to the department in the past years, and while we keep turning out quality productions, our budgets keep getting smaller and smaller. With the decaying facilitys and equiptment we have to work with we do not know how much longer we can provide this. SMHS is the only high school in the district still using a 1940's style dimming board along with aging
 lighting instruments. SMHS Performing Arts Department Boasts 100's of graduates working in the entertainment field, so many they have a performing arts 'hall of fame' along with a ceremony each year for new inductees. Your help is always greatly appreciated, to keep SMHS performing arts alive for future generations.<P>

Prayer for Busy People<BR>
While the spiritual life has never been easy, living in a society moving at a high speed has made it even more difficult. The problem of chronic fear is another obstacle. How can we find ways to pray in a climate of anxiety, distraction and hurry? Through Jim's involvement with great teachers of the spiritual life and from his own practice, he has learned many lessons about prayer and meditation which are easy to use and which he enjoys sharing with others.<BR>

Sensory Awareness<BR>
This workshop involves practical experimentation: more quiet of mind, unforced functioning in movement and breathing, and fuller presence in whatever we do. In our personal contacts, our choices, our actions, our sense of aliveness in the changing moment, we rediscover the clarity and depth of perception on which the quality of life depends. As we learn to trust our senses, we begin to feel more and more secure in ourselves and in the world.<BR>

SEPTEMBER 7<BR>
The Creative Couple<BR>
We have experienced, as teachers and as a couple, that between two people, sincerely committed to each other, a very special spirit comes alive. This spirit can find expression, form, and voice through art. We would like to give an opportunity to couples to draw and move in the service of their spirit and to help them find its meaning.<BR>
Michael Geis, MD, psychiatrist<BR>
Annette Guionnet Geis, dance therapist - $40<P>

Nancy Fierro, CSJ, lecturer, scholar,concert pianist - $40<P>

OCTOBER 12<BR>
Writing As Meditation<BR>
In this non-writers retreat-style workshop, you will experience creative writing as an avenue to self-discovery and personal change. Responding to the natural power and pleasure of language, you will learn ways to address emotional or creative blocks, shape memories into artistic expressions, and open new pathways to spiritual growth. Alternating simple techniques for fiction, poetry and other literary genre with reflection, relaxation, and silence, we will explore the meditative value of writing.<BR>
Terre Ouwehand, teacher, author, lecturer - $40<P>

NOVEMBER 2<BR>
The Way of Meditation<BR>
A day of prayer, silence, and exploration of some practical guidelines in the practice of meditation. An emphasis will be given to sitting still, breath awareness, and other fundamental aspects of meditation practice as being a path of self transformation. Insights will be drawn from Meister Eckhart, John of the Cross, the Zen masters and related sources.<BR>
James Finley, PhD, author, retreat presenter - $40<P>

NOVEMBER 9<BR>
Inner Visions<BR>
Everyone of us has an inner source of oracular wisdom. Our attachment to familiar beliefs and judgments can prevent our access to this powerful way of knowing. There are specific techniques and images that liberate us from our limiting views and reconnect us to innocent intuitive wisdom. Our self-esteem then increases and we trust ourselves more readily. Exploring the Jungian archetype of wisdom, this retreat day combines learning and experiential work to help you release your own unique truth about your own unique next step on your spiritual journey.<BR>
Dave Richo, PhD, MFCT - $40<P>

NOVEMBER 23<BR>

JANUARY 25 Sacred Clowns, Holy Fools<BR>
'Who are sacred clowns? holy fools? They're forever standing on their heads asking the non-rational questions. They see continuity in ruptures and contradictions in harmony.' (From Altman's Franciscan Fool) Perhaps in this time of shatterings and eruptions we are called to imitate the sacred clowns and holy fools, to take enormous risks for the enlightenment of all beings. This program is an exploration of the unknown in ourselves, an opportunity to go beyond our limits.<BR>
Gene Knudsen Hoffman - $40<P>

WEDNESDAY RETREAT DAYS<P>

9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Times of quiet and times of sharing are part of each retreat day. There is no fee for the day; donations are appreciated. Retreat day lunch is available for $8 (reservations required), or you may bring your own. Please let us know if you are coming.<P>

Warren Nielson, M.Div., pastor of Bethel Lutheran Church, Templeton.<P>

OCTOBER 23<BR>
Making and Finding Friendship in Our Daily Lives<BR>
We will begin by watching together a prize-winning short film produced by the Canadian Film Board, 'Strangers in Good Company.' That should provide us with ample common ground from which to reflect on what makes for peace and friendship in our daily lives.<BR>
Helen Kelley, IHM, former president of Immaculate Heart Community &amp; Immaculate Heart College<P>

NOVEMBER 20<BR>
The Art and Practice of Christian Healing<BR>
Have you ever met a medical doctor who takes a pen and prescribes prayer three times daily as a common medicinal treatment? Daniel Benor, medical doctor and psychiatrist practicing in England, has made the following statement: 'If spiritual healing were a drug, they'd have put it out there on the market long ago. There's more evidence of its effectiveness than there is of all other complimentary therapies together....' Interested in hearing more? Come, listen, learn and experience.<BR>
Abbot David Geraets, OSB, Monastery of the Risen Christ, San Luis Obispo<P>

JANUARY 22<BR>
Reuniting Our Bodies, Minds and Souls<BR>
Our culture encourages us to treat our bodies, minds and souls as separate, disconnected and unrelated entities. This false picture of ourselves creates physical, emotional, mental and spiritual 'dis-ease.' Utilizing insights, meditation practices and rituals from a variety of religious traditions, this retreat will provide participants an opportunity to rediscover the original unity of their bodies, minds and souls and to begin experiencing a healing of their inner divisions.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>DIRECTOR'S CORNER</H2></CENTER>

<BR>
	Each person that comes to La Casa de Maria contributes to our sacred space.
We who work here are indeed blessed by all of you.  This year we&quot;ve had
some special blessings that I&quot;d like to share with you.  <BR>
	The first is the striking marble statue, located near Casa Regina, called
&quot;Transformation through Forgiveness.&quot;  The monument poignantly
captures the moment of truth in the transformation of man evolving into higher
self,  &quot;the eagle,&quot; a symbol of freedom recognized by peoples of
all nations.  The monument, carved by Frances Jansen, is eventually to be
located at the National Tribal Memorial Park at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.
Frances speaks, with gratitude and great respect, of the great honor and
privilege involved in the opportunity to give back to the earth and its people.
Our hope is that the monument will have a ceremonial pilgrimage across the
country to its permanent home.  Donations to the project are welcome.  Inquire
at La Casa for more details. <BR>
	The second blessing was our La Casa Invitational in May.  It was called
&quot;A Matter of Life and Death.&quot;  We gathered over sixty people from
around the world to help our host, Robert W. Muller, answer the questions: Why
are we born and why do we die?  Scientists, medical personnel, theologians,
philosophers, educators, visionaries, etc., shared for four days their
insights.  Their findings are not easily put into words and I&quot;ll not
attempt to give an easy simple answer here.  We do have available for ten
dollars, though, a talk by Robert Muller that is outstanding.  Robert is
chancellor of the University of Peace in Costa Rica and for over 30 years was
the Assistant Secretary General to the United Nations.  He is a true Global
Citizen.  We have established a &quot;Bench of Dreams&quot; in honor of
Robert and invite you to add your dream to his when you are here.<BR>
	The third blessing is in process of  being established here.  August 6, the
50th anniversary of Hiroshima, begins our summer peace retreat entitled
&quot;From Hiroshima to Hope.&quot;  We will be dedicating a stone garden
 area called &quot;Dream of Peace.&quot;  We invite you to
join us in working for a world of peace and justice, and when you are at our
retreat center, to visit our three new areas of prayer and dreams.<BR>
	One additional piece of news is that on October 23-25 we will be hosting and
participating in a teleconference titled, &quot;Culture in Search of
Spirituality.&quot;  Staffs of retreat centers in Southern California will
join us here and link with twenty other sites across North America.  The event
is sponsored by Retreats International and hopefully will challenge us all as
our centers continue the soul work.  Speaking of soul work, I hope that you
will find our programs to your liking, and if we can assist you in any way,
please ask.  La Casa de Maria, the House of Mary, is here for you.<BR>
<BR>
In Peace &amp; Justice,<BR>

<h2><center><p>
<i>ER</i>
</p></center></h2> 

<h3><center><p>
<i>Economic Rights</i> are what this site is about. 
</p></center></h3>

<h4>
<ul>

<li>
<i>ER</i> begins with the right to a job or self-employment
... as an <i> enforceable</i> right ... with no less teeth 
than the right to own private property or to vote, speak 
your mind, or worship as you choose.  
<br><br>

<li> 
How would you enforce the right to a job or self-employment? 
... By having, if you're looking for work, the right to a 
government loan (or loan guarantee) -- whose proceeds would
be a fair wage advance for you, to be repaid by your employer,
(or by you, if you're self-employed.)
<br><br>

<li>
This sounds fine for you and me. But what about <i>other 
people?</i> ... Should <i>they</i> be entitled to the same wage
advance? ... And, if "Yes", where will the money come from?
<br><br>

<li>
Questions like these are answered on this <i>ER</i> site.
You are invited to comment and improve on all of them. 
In that way, your answers and mine, together, may 
eventually bring <i>full employment</i> and an end 
to <i>poverty.</i>
<br><br>

<li>
You are invited to do this by <i>Feedback</i> to this site, 
(see the bottom of every page.) ... And you are also invited
to keep <i>ER</i> pages on your site -- written to suit yourself,
and linked to this site, if our agendas have enough in common.
<br><br>

WHERE WILL THE MONEY COME FROM?
</p></center></h2> 

<h3><center><p>
Too Much Money = Inflation<br>
Not Enough Money = Unemployment<br>
Just Enough Money = Full Employment
</p></center></h3> 

<h4>
<ul>

<li>
To keep just enough money working the system, we pump 
microloans down to roots that run dry ... and, afterward,
soak up any excess money with tax exempt, inflation protected,
<i>saving</i>. ... We abandon the unholy use of unemployment 
as a tool to prevent inflation. 
<br><br>

<li>
<i>Economic Rights</i> are within reach of a modern industrial
economy if its voting citizens recognize that <i>fear</i> of 
unemployment is as out of date as <i>fear</i> of debtor's prison
... and that the <i>cost</i> of the current <i>unemployment system</i>
is more than we can bear.
<br><br>

<li>
In outline, <i>ER's</i> full employment system has four 
elements:<br><br>

<ol>
<li>
<i>Keynesian Money</i> ... to pay for national needs as we would
pay for weapons in time of war. ... Our national needs are
great, and they include environmental needs, infrastructure,
education, health care, and need for all those public assets that
have run down or failed to be built over decades of inattention.
<br><br>

<li>
<i>Microloans</i> ... for jobs and self-employment to end poverty 
and unemployment forever.
<br><br>

<li>
<i>Automation</i> and <i>Robotics</i> ... to raise the minimum 
standard of living--and make the workplace safe.
<br><br>

<li>
Pro-growth, anti-inflation, <i>Tax</i> and <i>Trade</i> reform. ...
Tax simplification and focus on how to prevent inflation. ...
Trade rationalization, to ensure production for national defense 
and for individual and social security.
<br><br>
</ol>

<li>
These elements are discussed at length in the following pages.
They may not be as quick to read as possible ... but they are
important ... You owe it to yourself, your family and your
neighbors, to master an understanding of the global economy, 
and then vote to make it work. ... Do this before other nations
and people eat your lunch again.
<br><br>

<li>
<i>ER</i> asks us to focus on production of the things that money can 
buy ... then produce them ... and not allow that <i>success</i> to be
killed by <i>inadequate purchasing power</i>, and wrong-headed ideas on
<i>money, interest, taxes</i> and <i>jobs.</i>
<br><br>

<li>
<i>Where will the money come from?</i> ... It will come from 
producing the things that money can buy!
<br><br>
</ul></h4>

<h2><center><p>
<i>KEYNESIAN MONEY:</i><br>
HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE ? 
</p></center></h2> 
 
<h3><center><p>
Enough to Cure <i>Deflation</i>. No More than <i>Inflation</i>
Allows.
</p></h3></center> 

<h4>
<ul>

<li>
<i>Keynesian Money</i> results if a sovereign nation
spends and lends more than it taxes and borrows. It is
issued, to cover action by the national congress,
by the latter's central bank ... and it is backed by 
national bonds the bank then holds or sells. 
<br><br>

<li>
<i>John Maynard Keynes</i>, who wrote "The General 
Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" -- in the midst
of the Great Depression -- gives it its name.
(But among expert Keynesian economists there is no
consensus in support of this site or any other
pragmatic agenda derived from his work. Such agendas 
are eagerly sought and may be linked 
to this site -- in time.)
<br><br>

<li>  
<i>Keynesian Money</i> adds to demand for things money
can buy. Its purpose is to stimulate consumption and 
production of goods and services to satisfy critical 
unmet individual and public needs ... needs that
ordinary market activity (and related taxes) will 
not satisfy. 
<br><br>

<li>
Public needs are those for national defense, the 
environment, infrastructure, health care, education, 
public safety, public recreation, etc., all of which,
when satisfied in this way, may turn out to be extremely 
cost effective -- if they stimulate us to reach new 
heights of efficiency through science, technology,
freedom, and economies of scale.
<br><br>

<li>
If, however, <i>Keynesian Money</i> results mainly in price
inflation, its further use will be counter productive.  
<br><br>

<li>
Because the quantity of <i>Keynesian Money</i> required 
to stimulate economic growth, eliminate unemployment, 
and satisfy individual and public needs, is always unknown,
more may be introduced than necessary. And if that happens, 
the excess must be withdrawn by savings and tax programs 
to reduce disruptive demand.
<br><br>

<li> 
The legislative will to use <i>Keynesian Money</i> is 
always present in war. The skill to use it in peacetime 
is rare. 
<br><br>

<li> 
Much depends on its use within a <i>system</i> that effectively
employs -- automation and robotics (to keep production abreast
of demand); savings to rescue it all (if money floods the 
market in a rush to hold goods instead of cash); and a full 
employment engine (like mocroloans) as a relatively cheap 
and direct way to buy full employment -- even if automation 
and robots replace old jobs at a rapid rate. 
<br><br>

<li>
<i>ER</i> has four elements: <i>Keynesian Money</> was the
first. <i>Microloans</i> are next. Then <i>Automation.</i>
And at the end ... <i>Tax</i> reform to provide essential saving
(to permit stimulated economic growth as discussed above),
and <i>Trade</i> reform to protect production from the 
ravages of predatory industrial nations who by accident or 
design turn trading partners into low value-added supplier 
colonies, almost overnight.
<br><br>

<h2><center><p>
MICROLOANS: A FUNDAMENTAL STEP<br>
AWAY FROM WELFARE AND INTO WORK
</p></center></h2> 

<h3><center><p>
Before There Was Welfare There Were<br>
Grubstake Loans to Keep You Working.<br>
It's Time to Bring Them Back.
</p></h3></center> 

<h4>
<ul>

<li>
Advanced industrial nations do not let their unemployed 
and poor actually starve to death. A <i>safety net</i> is installed
to pay them to stay alive  -- not by putting them to work --
but, in a sense, to keep them from stealing my job and
your's by offering to do it for less money.
<br><br>

<li>
The safety net -- but <i>no job</i> -- was based on belief that 
there would not be enough goods produced if everyone getting
a welfare payment were paid the higher amount that goes with a 
job . ... That is to say, inflation, in the price of necessities,
would accompany full employment because the extra production 
required to avoid it was not possible to achieve.
<br><br>

<li>
Under this view, the net result of full employment would 
be no less poverty than we have with unemployment -- 
and perhaps even more, as a result of disrupting something 
that worked fairly well as it is.
<br><br>

<li>
Automation and robotics change this view of the <i>system.</i>
For one thing, they permit virtually unlimited production
of most necessities. ... For another, automation and 
robotics tend to take jobs away from huge numbers of 
people, thus making job guarantees essential -- if prosperity
is to reward all those automated producers.
<br><br>

<li>
Microloans can put people to work immediately. People can
work for an employer who wants to expand, (and will not
fire other workers to make room new employees), or they
can work for themselves in self-employment.
<br><br>

<li>
How much should a wage advance be? ... High enough to
avoid poverty. Low enough so that people prefer private 
jobs over work supported by microloans.
<br><br>

<li> 
Should microloan supported workers be <i>unionized</i>? ... Yes.
... To avoid government <i>dictating</i> what it would 
claim is a reasonable wage advance, the amount of microloan
wage advances should be determined by <i>collective bargaining</i>
... and if bargaining fails, then, by <i>independent 
comnpulsory arbitration.</i>
<br><br> 

<li>
What if people quit private jobs en masse and apply for
government microloans? ... Preparation to prevent such
quitting is essential. ... It would rely on categorical 
entitlement so that specific categories of entitled
persons could have their entitlement stopped because
it was conditioned on the fact that they did not quit
work and that they remained ready to go back to work.
<br><br>

<li> Individual wage advance microloans have not yet 
been tried anywhere. For that reason a <i>pilot</I> 
program for a single category of entitled persons is 
called for. ... One such category might be <i>military 
veterans.</i>
<br><br>

<li>
The test would not be to prove how many loans were
paid back. ... The test would be whether <i>inflation
were avoided</i> and whether <i> massive quitting</i> 
were avoided.  If the test was a success, new categories
would be added every year, until there was no more
unemployment.

<h2><center><p>
AUTOMATION
</p></center></h2> 

<h3><center><p>
Without It, the Production of Necessities<br>
to Prevent Inflation, when Welfare Payments<br>
are Replaced by Higher Wage Payments,<br>
May Not be Possible. 
</p></h3></center> 

<h4>
<ul>

<li>
Full employment without automation can spell hyper-inflation, 
which in time can destroy a democratic political-economy. 
This is because the pay offered for the least productive workers 
will compete for necessities in the marketplace that may be in
short supply. If they are, prices will rise. Then wages will 
rise because there will be no slack in the labor market. An 
inflationary spiral may result.
<br><br>

<li>
Automation without full employment can spell rapid
deflation and recession. Overproduction may bring about low
prices, losses and plant closures.
<br><br>

<li>
Automation, together with full employment, are a
perfectly matched pair of goals. Full employment, guaranteed
with federal credit, will keep purchasing power up while
automation produces the things to be purchased at a
profit to the producers.
<br><br>

<li>
What will ensure the quality goods and services if the
discipline of failure and bankruptcy is not policing
production?  Hold on -- who said failure and bankruptcy
would stop at firm level?
<br><br>

<li>
Failure and bankruptcy <i>will be</i> policing the system. 
In fact bankruptcy may be more likely than today, because 
there will be more opportunity for small business to compete 
against entrenched producers than ever before -- credit will 
be abundant for that purpose.
<br><br>

<li>
However, suppose this rosy picture does not come to pass? 
Suppose quality drops off and workers and managers get lazy and
arrogant because they know they can fail and afterward live on 
borrowed money? ... Well, if that happens, we would have to return 
to a system closer to the one we now have ...
Credit would have to be curtailed. Unemployment would return. 
<br><br>

<li>
But our experience in wartime was favorable. Full
employment and fully funded profitable opportunity tended
to result in higer quality than ever before.
<br><br>

<li>
Because ER represents a risk, its elements
should be introduced gradually. The guarantee of a job or
self-employment should be tried out on one category of persons
after another. 
<br><br>

<li>
And, credit to producers to automate and ramp up
production of houses, water, food, health care, education,
training, recreational facilities, etc., 
should be undertaken cautiously -- keeping in mind the ever
present threats of waste, fraud and abuse whenever government
contracts are used to drive economic growth.

<h2><center><p>
TAXES - I
</p></center></h2> 

<h3><center><p>
Nothing is so Misunderstood as the Fact -- that<br>
(1) Government's Authority to Create Money, and<br>
(2) Its authority to Collect Taxes, -- are<br>
Two Sides of the Same Coin:<br>
</p></center></h3>

<h4>
<ul>


<li>
Taxes are necessary only to prevent high rates of
inflation: That is, the monopoly supplier of paper
money is required to tax some of it back, (to be 
kept out of circulation), only to prevent private 
spending from creating demand so far in excess of
supply that it triggers inflation instead of a 
reasonable profit.
<br><br>

<li>
If to avoid taxes, we could save in an <i>inflation
protected</i> account with the IRS, and inflation
didn't happen, <i>no tax at all</i> would have to be
collected from YOU and ME. After all, we own the 
Country. Why pay ourselves cash now when such deferred
IRS accounts may be needed for our personal spending
when inventories are high and prosperity depends on
spending -- not saving?
<br><br>

<li>
Modern money replaced gold and silver with a government
promise to pay paper money for paper bonds. As long as
people prefer government paper to a commercial IOU, 
the system will work. ... And people will prefer government
paper money to commercial paper if money is scarce
enough to seem "real".
<br><br>

<li>
Modern money is made "scarce" by taxes or forced <i>saving</i>
to avoid taxes.
<br><br>

<li>
But money should not be scarcer than goods and services offered
for it. If it is scarcer, profit cannot be earned in ordinary 
business -- and social pathologies follow.
<br><br>

<li> 
Still, government cannot just "deal out" money as in a game of 
"Monopoly". But it can <i>spend</i> money, (as it creates it), on
defense, infrastructure, environment, education, health care,
and public amenities. These expenditures can prime the commercial
pump. 
<br><br>

<li>
Government's suppliers will then circulate the money government
spends. The private sector will be the engine of production
to match government as the financial engine of last resort 
to maintain society in a healthy state.
<br><br>

<li>
Private banks will also be engines of finance.
The two engines work well together -- like those ahead of, and
behind, a train climbing a steep grade.
<br><br>

<li>
Why are we presently using only the comercial engine -- and
allowing the train to stall on the grade?  For no reason at all.
... If you know of one, send it to me. If it's valid, this whole page
will recognize it and be changed to agree with you.

<h2><center><p>
TAXES - II
</p></center></h2> 

<h3><center><p>
The <i>Income Tax</i> Ought to be<br>
Transformed into a <i>Consumption Tax</i><br>
</p></center></h3>

<h4>
<ul>
<li>
Extremely high personal wealth can balance the power of 
political Office ... but it ought to be heavily taxed if
it is used for personal consumption. 
<br><br>

<li>
Taxes on income, itself, are counter productive if they
take such income out of the private sector -- preventing
its reinvestment in the economy to produce items of necessity 
to be used or consumed by ordinary people.
<br><br>

<li> 
Taxes on income can avoid being counter productive if
saving and reinvestment of income in the public interest,
as defined by law, is excluded from the tax. ... Such an
exclusion of income is one way of enacting a <i> consumption
tax.</i>
<br><br>

<center>WHAT-IF'S</center>
<br><br>

<li>
Suppose Congress went along with the ideas in Taxes-I and
and Taxes-II, and inflation still followed?
<br><br>

<ol>
<li>
If that happened it would be because Congress spent too much
too fast for the private sector to respond with production
of personal necessities.
<br><br>

Congress would then have to spend less and lend
more to the private sector -- to gin up production of
private homes, food, and related necessities of life.
<br><br>

<li>
Suppose people all quit trying to make it in the private
sector and just hung around waiting for a government contract?
<br><br>

Congress would have to make the private sector more attractive
than the public sector -- by making private enterprise easy to
get into and likely to be profitable for capable entrants.
<br><br>

<li>
Suppose all that spending by Congress tempted its members to
chase after bribes?
<br><br>

The Attorney General would have to try to put the bribe-takers
in jail.
<br>

<title>Vickrey Paper</title>
</head>

<body>

<h4><center>
This is a copy of a paper, given out at a conference in 1993<br>
by the late Professor William Vickrey, winner (along with<br>
James Mirlees) of the 1996 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.<br>
</center></h4>

<h2>
WE NEED A BIGGER "DEFICIT"<br>
<p></p>
William Vickrey<br>
</h2>

<h4>
Professor of Economics, emeritus, Columbia University;<br>
President of the American Economic Association, 1992<br>
<p></p>
August 6, 1993<br>
</h4>
<p></p>
</center>

<pre>

</pre>

<h3>

<p><center>
THE SO-CALLED "DEFICIT"<br>
</center></p>

<p>
We are not going to get out of the economic doldrums as long as
we continue to be obsessed with the unreasoned ideological goal
of reducing the so-called deficit.<br>
</p>

<p>
The "deficit" is not an economic sin but an economic necessity.<br>
</p>

<p>
Its most important function is to be the means whereby purchasing
power not spent on consumption, nor recycled into income by the
private creation of net capital, is recycled into purchasing power
by government borrowing and spending.  Purchasing power not so recycled
becomes non-purchase, non-sales, non-production, and unemployment.<br>
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><center>
A PRIVATE CAPITAL APPROACH<br>
TO FULL EMPLOYMENT<br>
</center></p>

<p>
We have not had a satisfactory approach to full employment, except in
wartime, since 1926.  Over much of this century trends in the ratio of
profitable private capital to national product have been downward, as a
result of capital-saving innovation such as fiber optics, the trend to
light industry away from steel mills and other heavy industry, and the
increasing importance of services.  Prospects are that for the
foreseeable future the capacity of private industry to find profitable
use for private capital will be not much greater than two years of gross
domestic product.<br>
</p>

<p>
On the other hand aspirations of individuals to acquire assets to provide
for retirement and other purposes have been growing, due to longer life
expectancy, higher retirement aspiration levels, the loosening of family
ties, the development of expensive medical technologies, and other factors.
Current aspirations appear to be moving towards three years or more of
gross domestic product.  This leaves a gap to be filled by government debt
of about one year of gross domestic product.<br>
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><center>
GOVERNMENT DEBT TO FILL THE GAP<br>
THE PRIVATE SECTOR CANNOT FILL<br>
</center></p>

<p>
If we aspire to a satisfactory level of full employment by 1998, whereby
anyone not too finicky about the type of work could find a job at a living
wage within 48 hours, this will, if we assume inflation to average about
3%, call for a gross domestic product of about 10 trillion dollars.  To
fill the gap between the asset aspirations of individuals at this level of
income and the ability of the private sector to provide assets, the supply
of government securities would have to rise to 10 trillion dollars,
implying a level of income recycling by governments of about one trillion a
year on the average over the next five years.<br>
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><center>
PAYING FOR THE DEBT<br>
THAT FILLS THE GAP<br>
</center></p>

<p>
Once this level is reached, to continue in equilibrium the supply of
government securities will need to grow pari passu with the gross domestic
product, to correspond to the gap between the demand of the population for
assets and the provision of assets by the private sector.  Whatever
interest charges on the debt are not financed out of this growth in the
debt can more than be met out of savings in unemployment insurance
payments, and the increased tax revenues derived from the larger national
product at rates no greater than at present.  A 10 trillion debt with a
full employment economy will be far easier to deal with than a 5 trillion
debt with an economy in the doldrums.<br>
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><center>
WHAT IF THE GAP IS NOT FILLED?
</center></p>

<p>
If governments fail to fill the gap and meet the demand for assets by
issuing an adequate volume of securities, the attempt by individuals to
acquire assets by non-spending will cause a reduction in sales, temporary
investment in excess inventories, cutbacks in orders, unemployment, and
reduced national income and product.  This may be partially offset by the
bidding up of asset values, leading to a certain amount of additional
spending out of capital gains, but the "saving" imbedded in these capital
gains does not involve the creation of new capital or the employment of
individuals in construction.  The reduction in interest rates could in
principle increase "deepening" types of investment in labor-saving
technology, but after the initial stimulus the effect on employment tends
to be negative.  Little "widening" investment is likely to take place
regardless of reduced interest rates if the market for the product is not
there.  There is a serious danger that the bidding up of asset prices could
create a bubble of unsustainable values that is likely to collapse
disastrously, as occurred in 1929 after the budget surplusses of the
preceding years.  Sooner or later a reduction in production and national
income will set in until the reduction in income reduces the demand for
assets to conform to the supply.<br>
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><center>
TANGIBLE REAL EFFECTS<br>
</center></p>

<p>
Reducing the "deficit" may reduce the debt of the government, but it also
reduces the supply of assets people want to acquire to take care of their
security needs.  Reducing the "deficit" does not improve the real heritage
left for the future, rather it impairs that heritage by leaving a legacy of
inexperienced workers, impaired infrastructure, and reduced investment in
plants because of reduced demand for the products, to say nothing of the
impact of unemployment on health, delinquency, crime, and broken homes.<br>
</p>

<p>
The "deficit" is not even calculated on a businesslike basis.  It makes no
distinction between current account and capital account items.  If GM,
AT&amp;T, and the nation's households had been compelled to "balance their
budget" calculated in the way the federal budget is calculated, we would
now have many fewer automobiles, telephones, and houses.<br>
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><center>
INDIVIDUAL SAVING<br>
(ABSENT STRONG DEMAND)<br>
IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE<br>
</center></p>

<p>
Urging individuals to save more is counterproductive.  Individual saving
does not mean that funds are created out of thin air to put into savings
accounts or the capital market; for most individuals savings is
non-spending which becomes the non-income and reduced savings of the
vendor.  Funds are transferred from the bank acount of the vendor to the
account of the saver, there is no increase in total money in the bank, and
no facilitation of investment, while reduced market demand will actually
discourage investment.  Savings are neither a prerequisite nor an
inducement for investment.  Rather, non-spending by reducing market demand
lowers incentives to invest.<br>
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><center>
PROFITABLE INVESTMENT<br>
AND SAVING<br>
</center></p>

<p>
On the other hand if a businessman can show good prospects for profitable
investment he can nearly always get credit and proceed with the investment,
which will constitute an increase in someone's wealth which is ipso facto
savings.  Supply does not create its own demand as soon as some of the
income generated is saved, but investment does create its own savings, and
more.<br>
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><center>
INFLATION AND FULL EMPLOYMENT<br>
</center></p>

<p>
Eventually, in all likelihood, we will have to find some way of dealing
with the threat of an unacceptably high rate of inflation that does not
involve the maintenance of what Marxists used to call "the reserve army of
the unemployed."  For the moment, however, that threat seems sufficiently
remote that we could proceed with the first steps towards full employment
and deal with that bridge when we come to it.  There has been no dearth of
plans for controlling inflation in ways that preserve the essence of free
markets.<br>
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><center>
WE HAVE THE RESOURCES<br>
BUT REFRAIN FROM USING THEM<br>
</center></p>

<p>
The administration is trying to bring the Titanic into harbor with a canoe
paddle, while Congress is arguing over whether to use an oar or a paddle,
and the Perot's and budget balancers seem eager to lash the helm
hard-a-starboard towards the iceberg.  Some of the argument seems to be
over which foot is the better one to shoot ourselves in.  We have the
resources in terms of idle manpower and idle plants to do so much, while
the preachers of austerity, most of whom are in little danger of themselves
suffering any serious consequences, keep telling us to tighten our belts
and refrain from using the resources that lie idle all around us.<br>
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><center>
ALEXANDER HAMILTON,<br>
WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN<br>
</center></p>

<p>
Alexander Hamilton once wrote "A national debt, if it be not excessive,
would be for us a national treasure."  William Jennings Bryan used to
declaim, "You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold."  Today's
cross is not made of gold, but is concocted of a web of obfuscatory
financial rectitude from which human values have been expunged.<br>

Boskin Report
</title></head> 

<body>

<pre>
  Date: Tue, 10 Dec 1996
  From: John Gelles
  To: Post Keynesian Thought (An E-mail Economics Forum)
  Subject: Wage/Pension Increases
<b>

                      THE BOSKIN REPORT AND
 
	           WAGE AND PENSION INCREASES 
	           AND THE STANDARD OF LIVING


	Every worker and pensioner has a different set of
	recurring expenditures (excluding any element of 
	saving that may result from the purchase of things
	that can be resold in the future). 

	It follows that both inflation and the price effect
	of economies of scale hit each spender differently. 
	The Congress, to protect people from inflation, seeks
	to address an average effect not the actual effect. 
	And that average is itself aimed at average spenders
	not the poorest or the richest. 

	Accordingly, the COLA correction cannot be accurate 
	or fair for the individual. But it can be accurate 
	on average in theory. In practice there will be 
	some error.

	All of which brings one to the purpose of the
	protection that Congress wants to extend. Is it
	to protect people covered by protective COLA's
	from losing out to people not so protected?

	Or vice versa?  Or is it to promote the well
	being of BOTH groups as a tool based on Keynesian
	theories of production, consumption and growth
	in real output for favorable effect on the 
	minimum standard of living?

	If the purpose is the last mentioned, what serves
	the standard of living of both COLA protected 
	persons and COLA deprived persons best?

	      A COLA that is HIGHER than accurate or 
	LOWER than accurate, (assuming the difference 
	between them is respectably small and not 
	something that only a "creative" accountant 
	would love)?

	The answer to this question is largely political:

	     If you vote for the HIGH because you're a 
	liberal Keynesian, the standard of living will 
	not necessarily improve.  It will improve only
	if business, labor and government get their act 
	together and Mother Nature cooperates.

	     If you vote for the LOW because you're a 
	conservative member of the Concord Coalition, 
	the standard of living for the poor and middle
	class will not necessarily improve.  Again, for
	improvement to happen, as a result of economies
	of scale reaching the price of the things the
	poor and middle class buy, will require that
	business, labor and government get their act
	together and Mother Nature cooperates.

	Assuming that both liberals and conservatives
	are, nonetheless, compulsive seekers of 
	accuracy in statistics, Congress should use
	protective laws that are neither HIGH nor LOW
	in their design:

	     The Boskin Report is trying to LOW BALL 
	the game and it stinks. 

	     As always, politics trumps science, and 
	power is trump in politics. 

	     Join a union before both tenure and 
	COLA's are stolen. Join the AARP and hope
	they don't betray you. 

	     But don't join the Marxists, they go  
	after solutions that are NOT likely to work.
	They just don't get the Keynesian compromise
	between money and politics.

 o</b>  Vigdor rightly warns against balkanization of activism
    on the web. Like a Tower of Babel, every voice is
    carried and none are heard. The same concern is present
    for CMD (Coherent Managed Dialog).
<b>
 o</b>  Nevertheless, if we would focus Cyber-Soc on goals, an
    agenda and specific campaigns involving money raising,
    public advertising, or million-man marches, etc., (call
    that last one, "publicity"), we will have to KISS (Keep
    it Short and Simple).
<b>
 o</b>  My WEB echo of CMD allows black boarddiscussion to be
    recorded for reference after the board is erased. It
    takes advantage of the democracy of the WEB. And we may,
    at this time, invent a way for it to avoid the Tower
    of Babel, by being horizontal, not vertical, and by 
    recruiting at linked websites, brains to come up with
    "content addressable reform" open to every voter 
    according to individual interest.
<b>
 o</b>  Curtiss recommended as a goal more harmony and less
    litagation and confrontation. I want to add a similar
    concept:  
               RECOGNIZING REALITY WITH "ETC."
 
    .  Avoiding the triumph of form over substance.
    .  Avoiding a Mandarin mindset in favor of Ombudsmen.
    .  Promoting equitable principles over legal obfuscation.
    .  Capturing reality in text by always including "etc."

  [So far, I'm including this and Curtiss' addition under
   the goal of Pragmatic and Equitable Reform in my restate-
   ment of CMD proceedings.]

         IN SEARCH OF COMMON KEYNESIAN GOALS</b>
             Saturday, 21 September 1996

 <b>o</b> If comprehension of Marx has failed to bury us
   in material comfort and egalitarian brotherhood,
   and comprehension of Freud has done no better
   trying to spread profound understanding of our 
   needs, motives and behavior, what has "social 
   science" achieved in this century?

 <b>o</b> Stephen Toulmin, philosopher, finds Max Weber's
   wisdom, that bureaucracy easily becomes a beast
   embodying materialistic operational codes empty
   of ordinary concience, to be one of our century's
   nuggets of bleak understanding. Conspiracy
   takes two people -- bureaucracy takes three?

 <b>o</b> Toulmin comes down on the side of pragmatism
   as the final answer. Learning as an element
   of doing, unending, built on moral sensibility,
   that if it cannot be defined in material detail,
   is not unrecognizable up close--in your face?

 <b>o</b> Has anyone read his "Cosmopolis"?  I think it
   may be necessary for unraveling the paradox
   of "minimum axiom" thinking in a world of ad
   hoc success.

 <b>o</b> "Concise is nice", say our ground rules. That's
   right. It presupposes a map of post Keynesian
   thought addressable at the edges or anywhere
   inside them. And with the map a wall-size screen.

 <b>o</b> If we had it, this piece would be near the left
   edge, looking for the least disturbing path
   to an effective social science for the goals
   held in common by every Pkt'r.

            CONSERVATIVE, LIBERAL AND RADICAL
                    ECONOMIC AGENDAS</b>
                   September 20, 1996

   Economic science seeks the theory behind an agenda.
   Economic pragmatism seeks the agenda to reach a
   goal.

   Agendas assume mechanism, (and not more complex
   theory), as they go from original to revised
   versions, learning as they go (heuristically),
   like an inventor of mechanical things that
   seem to work.

   Who does not have an agenda assumes none is needed:

             If strong economic laws dictate necessary
   outcomes it is only required to discover them. You
   can call this a "discovery agenda", but it is not
   the same as a moral agenda pursuing prosperity for
   ordinary people against nature's cruel beginnings:
   Fleas, flies, bacteria, greed, poison, murder, and
   ten thousand wounds that flesh is heir to.

   If there are three elementary agendas -- conserva-
   tive, liberal and radical, their differences would
   be noticeable in relation to where a nation had
   arrived in historical terms. 

             No nation is wholly without order and 
   prosperity of sorts for some of its actors. The
   conservative agenda will preserve such order and
   prosperity and seek to better all lives by mar-
   ginal change that little rocks the boat.

   A liberal agenda will latch on to one or more
   promising engines for more rapid improvement of
   all lives and pursue these promises at some small
   risk of opposition by conservatives.

   A radical agenda will decapitate conservatives
   and demand a furious rate of change that always
   ends in war -- civil and sometimes wider.

   Today's promising engines for a liberal agenda
   are science, technology, free elections and 
   managed fiat money.

   When history has bestowed sovereignity on consumer
   spending and common voting, a liberal would be
   foolish to dispute them. Perfect them, but do not
   disparage them.

   What then is "managed fiat money" other than what we
   use today as managed by central and other banks and
   firms that have a lot of it?

   It is one thing more: It is money that every person
   has "as a matter of right when they have no other".

             It is lent so they can work. It is lent in
   an amount for the least wealthy to live better from
   year to year as law and order prevail. It is lent
   by the same agency that manages revenue collection
   for the fiat money issuing nation involved.

   How risky is such an agenda?  Risky enough to sug-
   gest all the elements listed below for starters.
   Each is or will be discussed at length in comments 
   related to this one on the Economic Rights Website.

                    A LIBERAL AGENDA

  1. Keynesian tax-free saving to fight inflation.
  2. Keynesian fiat money to meet public priorities.
  3. Microloans for a civil right to self-employment.
  4. Automation for a high minimum standard of living.
  5. Rescue-loans if automation overproduces.
  6. Tax exemption for qualified investments.
  7. Anti-hoarding anti-inflation laws in reserve.
  8. Trade protection for national security.
  9. Foreign loans instead of certain imports.
 10. Traceable money to fight crime and corruption.
 11. Price and wage controls, if necessary.
 12. Excess profits tax, if necessary.

      POWER RIDES A SEESAW, WASHINGTON ON ONE SIDE
                WALL STREET ON THE OTHER</b>
                   September 15, 1996

   Fortunate enough to have had Adolph Berle as a
   professor, I listened as he told, "Power moves
   from Washington to Wall Street and back, as
   crises come and go."  The process is like a
   seesaw, with no click-stop in the middle to
   help achieve a balance. 

       (Berle co-authored with Means, "The Modern
   Corporation and Private Property", a critique
   in the Thirties of corporate power serving 
   narrow private interests -- when it had been
   designed in the first place for the broadest
   public interest, like building the Erie Canal.)
 
   The wholesale abandonment of Washington's economic
   engine in 1946, (with its inconveniences of wage
   and price control and rationing and its gargantuan
   programs to serve a nation at war), in favor of a
   conventional economy that would seem to be simpler
   but turned out otherwise, is today at the root of 
   poverty, pollution and most things ugly out there.
  
             We never cleared the slums or guaranteed
   full employment. The result of looking to laissez-
   faire for such results was general anxiety that
   forced people to cling to inefficiency and im-
   morality just to be sure they had work.

   Why does every voice that matters claim the nation
   has no money for the national interest?  Because
   they forgot where that kind of money comes from.
   It doesn't come from Wall Street. It comes from
   Washington. But not when the government in 
   Washington fails to do its duty.

   Can the seesaw be made to balance, with enough
   power in a Washington "not for sale" to force
   Wall Street to appreciate fiat money profits as
   far superior to its accustomed profits?  Can it
   stay in balance long enough to educate voters
   of what they lose when they abandon the only
   financial engine that can afford to end pollution 
   and poverty while making ordinary people secure,
   as well as healthier and in control?

   Maybe not. Berle thought it could not. The fact
   is--it has not. The seesaw tips only in crises.
   And the riders at both ends never learn.

<b>
         BABY BOOMER RIGHTS AND EXPECTATIONS</b>
 
  I'm father to three boomers. My generation, not 
  their's, were children of the depression. Our 
  parents were wrecked by their own failure to know 
  the Keynesian solution before The General Theory 
  was published. Perhaps they can be forgiven on 
  account of that tragic timing.

  In my generation, Keynesian ideas financed victory
  over facism and, with lesser implementation, over 
  communism 45 years later.

  But for more than 20 years the retreat from full 
  employment principles and from money as an instru-
  ment for growth, equity and economic security, has 
  plagued us all. And much of the physical inherit-
  ance from their parents to our boomers is now 
  at risk.
  
  Yet you still have the resources, training, and 
  organization to permit early retirement, paid up 
  health care, and total comfort for every baby 
  boomer alive. And you have the votes to pull 
  it off.
 
  When I tell my kids this, they ask, "Who in our 
  generation is responsible for bringing Keynesian 
  solutions to life -- to protect boomers even better 
  than the GI Bill and FHA and cold war Keynesianism, 
  protected you?"
           (Better, because of the advances in tech-
  nology which we all brought into being in this 
  century.)

  I answer, "The damned economists among your 
  boomer peers."
  
  What a liar today's Keynesians make me. You are 
  unable to inform 78 million boomers of the facts 
  of life: Of how we went from wooden rifles to B29's 
  in four years, using Keynesian money. Of how all 
  this nonsense about housing shortages, health care 
  shortages, money shortages, etc., is but a function 
  of liberal economist fragmentation.

  There is no divide and conquer here -- Congress and 
  its federal reserve system have not divided Keynes-
  ian scholars to make them impotent. They did it to 
  themselves. They have let down their whole 
  generation and the next.

  OK. Dole is one of us. As are all the old veterans 
  still active in Congress. So we have a lot to 
  answer for. But Kid, we are about to die.

  You boomers have to take Ben Franklin seriously -- 
  you will hang together on a Keynesian line, or you
  will hang separately, repeating the mistakes of my 
  father's generation as though Keynes had never 
  been born.
  
  A generation can afford anything it can produce, 
  including surpluses to support the standard of 
  living in retirement they vote for and produce -- 
  a standard my generation has known and my father's
  did not.
 
  What about my children's?

          John Gelles

       AN  ECONOMIC PLAN  IN  PLAIN  ENGLISH
 
      The American economy in the Second World War 
 did not adopt socialism or abandon its basic demo-
 cratic private enterprise system. It became the 
 arsenal of democracy under rules that suspended un-
 necessary civilian consumption in favor of war pro-
 duction. In the process, it defeated poverty at home 
 and facism abroad. It doubled industrial capacity
 to produce civilian needs for the peace it won.
 
      A half century later, a cold war has been fought 
 with deficit spending for military weapons and forces.
 These military investments, coupled with similar ones 
 for the race in space, spawned the information or 
 silicon based economy into which the world is heading.
 
      Yet, after defeating facism and holding off com-
 munism until the present period, which some prophets 
 optimistically claim is the beginning of an era in
 which democracy and free enterprise will spread, we
 see and hear in America that the people are fed up
 with Congress and the rest of government, because
 it seems to many that nothing works.
 
      What doesn't work?  The hours of work are long.
 Take-home pay buys less than it should. The company 
 is afraid of insolvency; downsizing is the order of
 the day.  Moms who would rather be home feel pressed
 to earn money today and be prepared if Dad is out of 
 work tomorrow. Urban blight and rural poverty remain. 
 Earth, air and water are sick. Drugs are everywhere.
 Nobody's happy anymore.  The economy is as dismal as
 the science that comprehends it.
 
      Enter now, an economic plan in plain English to
 promise more than the Contract for America. It begins
 with a promise of MONEY where everyone says there's
 none.
 
      Common sense tells us paper money has value 
 provided there isn't too much of it offered at once 
 for things you can own like houses, cars, food and 
 income producing business.
 
      And we also know that most money is held on 
 deposit in banks and not kept as paper at home. Since
 banks are allowed to lend a lot more money than they
 keep in reserve (in the form of federal debt), the 
 problem of maintaining a high value on money, as it
 motivates high production of civilian necessities,
 is exceedingly complicated:
 
 That is to say:
 
        IF money is drawn AWAY from purchasing and 
 projects (that raise material wealth), and TOWARD 
 saving and pay-back of federal debt, BY high 
 interest rates and taxes,
 
        THEN an economy can regress to a stage of 
 very slow or even NO growth, with unemployment and 
 poverty firmly rooted in the nation whose money
 it is.
 
        BUT, IF money is drawn AWAY from savings 
 (and taxes are reduced), and TOWARD purchasing, and 
 projects to increase material wealth, BY low 
 interest and tax rates
 
        THEN an economy can grow so rapidly, and make 
 demand on so much labor and material, that the value
 of things exchanged for money rises sharply and 
 money, itself, suffers devaluation.  Money owed as 
 fair debt can even become worthless
 
      Faced with the necessity to protect the economic
 system from inflation so high that money won't work 
 and only barter will, we must, nevertheless  AVOID  
 slow or lesser growth because the total of all eco-
 nomic output now produced is not nearly enough to 
 lift a major segment of American adults and children 
 out of poverty and near-poverty.

      When asked to grow the economy at the appropri-
 ate rate to accomplish reasonable national priori-
 ties, (say, one-half percent per month), we are first
 told by liberals and conservatives, alike, that we 
 have not the money to do it.

      What your neighbors mean by that answer is that
 if we create the money to do it, we will likely 
 create too much, and suffer the consequences of very 
 high inflation, as stated above.

      Your neighbors may be right.  But they will
 have to do something or they invite more of the same
 they're complaining about. They invite by morbid 
 neglect violence at home and abroad -- war at the 
 extreme.
 
      It, therefore, goes without saying, that plans
 to create the money necessary to grow the economy at
 the appropriate rate, employing, especially, a full
 automation and full employment strategy, to attend to
 the supply of goods that alone can take a real bite 
 out of poverty -- that such plans must have controls 
 built in to suck into savings, (rather than taxes), 
 excess money in circulation, whenever supply of 
 necessities cannot keep up with demand.
 
      The following points, then, taking cognizance of
 all the above, are proposed. They find the money we 
 need. They lend the money to those who will use it
 wisely for problems money can solve. They spur auto-
 mation, fight deflation as necessary, reform the tax
 structure, prepare for severe inflation (as a precau-
 tion), and move money out of the role it now occu-
 pies as the favorite partner of those who do crime 
 for a living.
 

                 THE PLAN IN BRIEF
  
  1. Creating More Money than Marketable Debt does:

         Money is created in expectation of trade, 
 debt, and reuse of it for more trade. In the process, 
 there may be less money created than high growth re-
 quires. To provide the extra money, central banks 
 must be instructed to create it, backed by bonds not 
 offered for sale in the market until desired growth 
 has been achieved and the effect of public purchase 
 of the bonds can be withstood -- this effect tends
 to diminish entrepreneurial investment and cause 
 the central government to owe additional interest.
 
         Such money is one of the tools that built an
 arsenal of democracy in the Second World War.  The 
 other tools, i.e., savings bond drives, income tax,
 wage and price control, and resource allocation, are 
 not called for at this time.
 
  2. Building and Rebuilding Infrastructure and doing
     similar Major National Programs for Environment,
     National Defense, and Related National Priorities:

         The money created in 1, above, is credited 
 to the United States on the books of the central 
 bank. The money is then loaned to states, regional 
 authorities made up of several states, counties, 
 cities, etc., as well as government corporations 
 owned jointly with private firms, to do required 
 work.  Call them MACROLOANS, for short.
 
  3. Achieving Full Employment:
 
         To avoid idleness, MICROLOANS can then be 
 offered as the employer of last resort. Instead of 
 welfare, people in need of work may borrow money 
 directly to become self-employed, or they may assign
 the right to borrow to an employer who will assume 
 the sole obligation to repay the loan, as he or she 
 hires the person looking for work.

  4.  Automation:

         Federal taxes and subsidy policy shall 
 encourage automation of every task related to higher
 output of necessities.

  5.  Rescue of Proven Producers As Necessary:

         Since this plan depends primarily on avoid-
 ing inflation, proven producers who have made that 
 possible, if faced with deflation, shall be lent 
 money against reasonable plans to produce necessary
 items in short supply.

  6. Replacing Income Tax with Progressive Rate
     Consumption Tax and Turnover Taxes:

         Since income saved or reinvested in business 
 to supply goods and services that prevent inflation
 is the name of the game, and tax on income is count-
 er-productive, and it ought to be repealed.

         Money used for consumption above a threshhold
 amount ought to be taxed via an aggregate consumption 
 tax, at rates high enough to ensure that private 
 enterprise remains the engine of growth.

         To further avoid inflation (and pay for smal-
 ler government staff), turnover taxes ought to be
 employed. They should not apply to items of necessity.

   7. Anti-Hoarding and Related Law for possible
      Inflation Emergency:

        Although this plan should be phased in slowly,
 and should be stopped if it doesn't work, it is pos-
 sible that it will work at first and later lead to
 an inflation emergency.  Laws should be in place to 
 prevent damage in that event.

   8. Traceable Money and Accounts:

         Credit cards, checks and ordinary bank 
 accounts appear to be best to remove money from its
 role as an incentive to crime. New electronic moneys
 will also be acceptable. Secret accounts and paper 
 or bearer money should not be offered by government. 
 These things invite crime and corruption. In their 
 absence, the private sector will provide the best
 substitute it can; but government ought to get out
 of the business. 

             ----- end of plan -----

        SKETCH OF AN EMAIL BASED POLITICAL PARTY

    ================================================
      A virtual political party,  firmly anchored to
    members seated at its base.  It has three rules:

    (1)  Representatives, seated at higher echelons,
    must  know and be known  personally, by everyone
    who votes for or against them.

    (2)  Members must support  Freedom of Speech and
    Religion, and Freedom from Want and Fear.

    (3)  Members must support the purposes set forth
    in the  Preamble  to  the  Constitution  of  the
    United States to secure the Blessings of Liberty
    to ourselves and our posterity.
    ================================================

            TABLES AT THE BASE OF THE PYRAMID

 Initially, all members of the party sit at virtual 
 round tables with room for no more than ten at each. 
 When a tenth member is invited that table must divide
 into two tables within one month after seating the 
 tenth member. Neither of the two new tables may have
 less than five members.

 (Who actually sits or is invited to sit at a particu-
 lar table is discussed below. Seating is based on 
 computer matched interests, with final agreement 
 reserved to the individuals involved.)

 By majority vote, each table will elect one represen-
 tative to sit at a table one echelon above the base.

 Echelon 1 tables will be composed solely of represen-
 tatives from tables at the base. The number of mem-
 bers at any Echelon 1 table shall be governed by the
 same rules that apply to the base.

 Representatives will serve for a period of one calen-
 dar quarter, beginning the first day of the quarter
 and ending on the last. They may be recalled by a 
 four-fifths majority vote at any time, after which a
 new representative shall be immediately elected to
 fill the unexpired term. There shall be no limit to
 the number of quarters a representative may serve.

 Echelon 1 tables will elect echelon 2 representatives
 to serve and create the next higher echelon the same 
 way echelon 1 was formed.

 An ever ascending formation of echelons shall con-
 tinue until a top echelon is reached. The top echelon
 would normally consist of one table with from one to 
 nine representatives from the next-to-highest echelon.

 However the highest echelon table will have nine 
 representatives. The next-to-highest echelon will 
 elect the missing members. Each member of the next-
 to-highest echelon will have one vote. They may vote
 for any member from any echelon. The seats at the 
 highest echelon table will be filled by persons re-
 ceiving the highest numbers of votes. (In event of a 
 tie, another vote will be taken after seating those 
 elected without a tie, until exactly nine representa-
 tives are elected.

 Each representative remains an official member of all
 tables from which elected to a higher table. Each 
 must vote at the highest table to which elected but 
 may only vote at lower tables to break a tie.

 Every table is entitled to read the proceedings of 
 any other table. Each table will be numbered serial-
 ly, with its echelon as prefix. The base prefix will 
 be 0- and the top echelon will have the highest pre-
 fix number. All unelected member tables form the 
 base. Higher echelons are forced into existence by 
 electing representatives to it and the seats per 
 table limit of nine.

 If the party reaches approximately 1 million members, 
 there will be six echelons. The sixth echelon will
 have one table with 8 seats, raised to nine by the 
 top echelon rule. Every new table added to the base
 elects one representative. As more tables of rep-
 resentatives are elected, new echelons are formed.
 
 Number   Number of Tables at Each Required Echelon
   of     -----------------------------------------
 Members   Base      1       2      3     4    5  6
 -------  -----  -------  ------  ----   ---  -- --
     7 M    1 M      140      20     3     1
   100 M   14 M    2,000     300    40     6   1
 1,000 M  140 M   20,000   3,000   400    60   8  1

 It can be seen that it will not be possible for any
 one table to read proceedings of every other table.
 So how can a "good idea" from any table be found? 
 It must "percolate" up to the top echelon or top 
 few echelons, where the number of tables is within
 the reading capacity of all other tables.

 The percolating process consists of voting a "good 
 idea" up from the base to the top. If your represen-
 tative table in echelon 1 likes it, the idea will 
 move up to echelon 2, etc.

 An idea can be "stopped" at any echelon in line above
 any table. If this happens, all members who have 
 "signed" on to the idea at a lower level, can lobby
 any individual table by direct one-to-one email. They
 will not be permitted to "broadcast" ideas. "Broad-
 cast" of ideas down to the base will be the job of 
 the top three echelons.

 The network software that builds this system must 
 provide two sophisticated features:

  ===================================================
         Feature 1, The People Matching Engine
  ===================================================

 The base seat matching engine, to assign people to 
 tables where they are most likely to be willing to
 remain. In the final month of any quarter, any member
 may call on the engine to find a "better" table, one 
 that best matches what members say they want.

 Assignment and reassignment will be based on computer 
 matching of people who request that they sit with 
 others of similar interest, opposite interest, or 
 random interest, as determined by a list of interests
 (which will cover attitudes and emotional factors, 
 as well). People may also insist they sit together
 with named individuals, but not more than nine.

 Any table of five or more people may refuse to 
 accept another member.

 People not matched in initial iterations of the 
 assignment engine will be requested to modify their 
 application so they may sit somewhere for the coming 
 quarter.

 People who are not matched may not sit at any table 
 until five people are willing to sit together.


 ====================================================
          Feature 2, The Issue Locator Engine
 ====================================================

 The task of any table at the base of the pyramid is 
 to frame and vote, up or down, issues of public 
 interest.

 The task of tables higher up is to vote, up or down, 
 any issue voted up from any lower table represented 
 by the higher table. In addition, every table above
 the base has the same perogatives as the base to
 vote, up or down, issues of public interest which 
 they originate.

 Each table will have an active archive of issues it
 has voted up or down. The table may edit or amend the 
 archive at will at any time by majority vote.

 All tables will have access to the issue locator 
 engine (ILE), whose initial task will be to reframe
 issues voted up, (which are substantially the same), 
 into identical words.

 The ILE will prioritize issues to reflect the number 
 of members interested in them and the priorities of
 the top few echelons.

 The ILE will maintain a tally of people in favor of 
 identically worded issues. Its most demanding task
 will be to design and develop graphical display 
 locators, to allow any table to find where support

     "SANTA BARBARA" PLAN FOR
     FULL FUNDING OF NATIONAL
     PRIORITIES  (SBP)  (1/19/95)
     ---------------------------------------------
     An agenda for Accelerated Economic Growth,
     based on increased Real Output, to pay for
     Defense Modernization, Infrastructure Renewal,
     Environmental Care, and Job Opportunity,
     in a Low Tax, Low Interest, High Output,
     Free Market Economy
     ---------------------------------------------

              REASONS FOR THE PLAN

      America has priorities  AND  the physical
 resources to accomplish them:  We can invoke the full
 funding mechanisms of the Second World War, (without
 high taxes, rationing or wage and price control).

      Continued failure to meet our priorities will hurt
 everyone and force further decline in already depressed
 areas and markets.  This decline is a root cause of condi-
 tions most voters deplore. The Nation owes itself the
 "Freedom from Want" for which so many died in World War II.


              ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN

      Congress shall establish a bank to guarantee, or
 directly make, macroloans, to fully fund national priori-
 ties, (with the principle in mind, that necessary economic
 output, WITHIN environmental constraints, shall determine
 the rate of growth of the American economy and its mandated
 debt repayment system, i.e., money).

 Macroloans shall be guaranteed or made:

   o  To industry, to ensure the base for our common defense

   o  To agriculture, to protect family farming and ensure an
      ample low cost food supply

   o  For automation, to prevent inflation

   o  To rescue proven high volume producers, acting in the
      public interest, who shall continue high volume produc-
      tion of items in short supply, in the public interest.

   o  To federal instrumentalities to supply priority needs
      of the public, industry, agriculture, infrastructure,
      environment, or other needs recognized by Congress.

   o  To political subdividions of the United States, its
      regions, states, counties, parishes, cities, towns,
      villages, and the like, for needs defined by Congress.


      Congress shall establish a second bank to finance and
 find jobs in the general economy for people looking for work.
 (Its responsibility shall include databanks for job search
 and placement.)  As a financing agency it shall guarantee,
 or directly make, microloans, to ensure that every willing
 worker, not otherwise employed by market or government
 capital, has a job or is self-employed. Direct loans shall
 be made using Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accounts.

      The databank service of the bank shall employ modern
 job search and placement methods and may duplicate services
 provided by state and private agencies. (Freedom of choice
 to rely on duplicative agencies in the quest to earn a
 living is of fundamental value in a free society.)

      Interim loans to persons looking for work shall be made
 to protect families, creditors and communities from avoidable
 economic loss. Such loans shall be made from the first week
 of looking for work until a person has a job or is otherwise
 self-employed as provided for below. The amount loaned
 directly to jobseekers on his or her IRS account shall be
 their customary weekly wage not to exceed the community
 average.


       Microloans shall be guaranteed or made, (in coord-
 ination with databank placement effort), as follows:

   o  To credit-worthy employers, for wages advanced to
      persons over a two year period from time of hire of an
      unemployed person.

   o  To self-employers, as wage advances, (in amounts equal
      to their proved customary earnings or the minimum wage,
      whichever is higher, but not in excess of the community
      average), based on a work plan in the public interest.


      Congress shall index the minimum wage to keep pace with
 inflation AND with growing economic output, to avoid defla-
 tion, decline of local economies, aggrevated disparity in
 living standards between citizens obliged equally to defend
 this Nation with their life, or default in its Constitutional
 responsibility to promote the general welfare.

      Congress shall exempt from income tax all gains and
 earnings that are reinvested in savings institutions or
 investments defined by the Internal Revenue Service as in
 the public interest and to prevent inflation.

      Congress shall raise the standard personal deduction
 applicable to income tax, to twice the median income of the
 prior year.

      Congress shall set marginal rates on upper incomes high
 enough to encourage savings and certain investments that
 provide private capital growth in productive activity aimed
 at the prevention of inflation in the prices of essential
 goods and services. When growth and inflation control
 objectives have been met, marginal rates shall be reduced to
 their lowest possible levels.

      Congress shall provide a standard deduction for small
 busineses that shall not be less than two times the standard
 personal deduction multiplied by the number of full-time
 employees to whom they have paid the minimum annual wage
 (or more) within the taxable year. The deduction shall be
 pro-rated for operations over less than a full year.

      Congress shall enact a turnover tax, exempting all
 food and medicine, to pay the cost of government operatons
 not covered by other taxes or revenue sources. The rates used
 by this tax shall vary with the need to control inflation;
 and in any period of prolonged deflation, the tax rate shall
 be reduced to or set at zero.

      To reduce inflation, drug and other crimes, and
 political corruption, and, in particular, abuse of this plan,
 Congress shall enact laws to make all money transactions
 traceable by law enforcement. Congress shall end the use of
 federal paper or bearer notes as legal tender.

<P>Cheap Whitewater Journalism Infecting Local Newspapers
<P>
<I><font color="#0000ff">Letter to the Associated Press, February 24, 1996, from Jane Wardlow Prettyman. <BR>CC: to Santa Barbara <I>News-Press</I>
Publisher Steven Ainsley, Exec. Editor Allen Parsons, 
Editorial Page Editor John Lankford, Staff Editor Kathryn Van Sant</CENTER></I>
</font color="#0000ff">




<PRE>    </PRE>
<font size=7>D</font size=5>ear Editors of the Associated Press,
<P>
Kelly P. Kissel of the Associated Press wrote a story that appeared in
Feb 24, 1996 Santa Barbara <I>News-Press</I> on the front page above the fold.
<P>
The <I>News-Press</I> front-page headline ran "Starr Probe Expanded to
Clinton Donations." The inside header read "Wider Whitewater
Probe Will Include Clinton Donations."
<P>
Sounds like sinister news about Clinton--and boy, it must be
important because it's on the front page above the fold.
<P>
This AP story drummed a steady build-up of suspensful implications through 11 full paragraphs, all about an "expanded investigation," as "the special prosecutor...won broader jurisdiction...to look for obstruction of justice"  in "newly unsealed documents...(which) gave Starr permission to...examine some campaign contributions [made by Mr. Branscum and Mr. Hill] during Clinton's run for president." The expanded probe "can look for obstruction of justice, perjury, destruction of evidence, intimidation of witnesses or conspiracies among them" [on the part of whom?] "...Seven paragraphs remain sealed." This last sentence is repeated twice, ensuring the story will continue in breathless installments to come.
<P>
Sounds perfectly horrendous in juxtaposition to President Clinton's name.
<P>
The AP reporter made no mention of who granted the "expanded probe." Was it the same 3-judge panel (including Sen. Faircloth's darling Judge Sentelle) that selected the partisan Republican special prosecutor Kenneth Starr? (See March 96 <I>Washington Monthly</I> article by George Clifford, <A HREF="sentelle.htm">
"Judge Sentelle and Sen. Faircloth: Where's the Story?"</A>).
<P>
Finally, as we labor through this AP story into the back pages, comes the dramatic statement: "The Branscum-Hill indictment
is the first Whitewater accusation to mention Clinton by name." This
is really saying something, since for over three years of
"investigation," Clinton has never once been charged with
wrongdoing. Surely, this time it is <I>serious, wow, </I>with the actual mention of Clinton's name! Turn to the inside page, catch those ads
for Thomasville Home Furnishings, Digital Satellite Installation.....
keep on reading............
<P>
<I>But wait a minute!</I>
<P>
The reader gets down to the 12th paragraph deep on an inside page,
only to find out....guess what?  "It was legal for Hill to give Clinton
the $7000 and for Clinton to accept it. The indictment only alleges
that Branscum and Hill raised the money illegally." Clinton's name
was mentioned merely because he was the one they gave their
allegedly ill-gotten money to.  No allegation Clinton knew it was
ill-gotten.
<P>
Oh.
<P>
The headline should have read: "Indictment Names Clinton
Despite No Allegation of Wrongdoing" or "Is Starr Probe Objective
or $30 Million Witch Hunt?"
<P>
Branscum's attorney Dan Guthrie asked a good question, "Why
would the indictment mention Clinton?  It's an outrageous attempt
to influence...the 1996 presidential election....It's a very calculated
move to bring the president into the case." But who's going to listen
to Guthrie? He's an interested party. The AP and the <I>News-Press,</I> one
assumes, are not interested parties.
<P>
In turn, for the <I>News-Press</I> to run this piece of junk on the front page
above the fold--whether calculated or not--had the effect of making news consumers
press their quarters into the newsstand slot (above the fold makes
the headline visible through the glass) and heighten this worthless
story's import to titillate readers to wander into the inside ad pages, 
facilitated by AP's holding off the "Oh" punchline until after the ads 
had gone under the reader's eyes.
<P>							
This is only one of dozens of examples over the last three years of a
situation in which AP and other news feeds are--whether calculated or not--effectively in  commercial collusion with local papers throughout the nation to heighten circulation and advertising sales. The usually innocuous bottom-line truth is buried so deep in back pages in low paragraphs that many readers never read that far. Misleading leads provide artfully contorted misinformation. Exculpatory quotes are placed in the mouths of questionably credible parties, all at the expense of the reputation of the President of the United States (any President) and the institution of the Presidency.
<P>
Some in the newspaper business would simply call this a harmless "teaser." It's certainly front-loaded to tease the reader's worst instincts. Whether teasing is harmless I leave to another discusssion. But this example is a form of journalistic assassination for commercial gain that gives a whole new meaning to the term "lost leader."
<P>
I say "whether calculated or not" to the <I>News Press</I> first because I'm not the paranoid type and would not like to think it's calculated. If it appeared to be calculated, I'd have to quit my job and go to the barricades. Instead, it's a far more helpless situation because I've been told by a high-level <I>News Press</I> editor that inexperienced low-level staffers are responsible for throwing together the front page. There are no editorial meetings to decide what runs where and how feed material is featured. There is no editorial overview. There is no news page editor responsible for deciding questions such as I have raised in this letter. It's simply thrown together on the basis of "what's hot on the newswire"--meaning usually the AP newswire--because there's not enough budget to afford anything better. 
<P>
Although, if my information from the <I>News Press</I> is truthful, the AP carries the lion's share of culpability in generating junky news, I find it unbelieveable that the sole daily newspaper of a thriving mid-size town like Santa Barbara is so hard up that it can't afford to think about the quality of content it's publishing. Such an enterprise, carrying the responsibility to inform the public, should not be in business.
<P>
<I>News-Press</I> Editorial Page John Lankford's amiable fallback excuse, "We're just trying to make money like everybody else," won't wash. Where's your journalistic spine, sir? What's the use of being a newspaper editor unless you are a newspaper <I>editor</I>?
<P>
Try another philosophy that could be just as exciting, get you some
respect and thereby just as many quarters in the newsstand. Try the
credo of Robert McNeil's editor when he was a young reporter:
<P>
"Don't make us money. Make us proud--and the money will come."
<PRE>    </PRE>
Sincerely,
<P>
Jane Wardlow Prettyman

GETTING MEDIA-ACTIVE:</CENTER></font color="#ff0000"></H2>
<P>
<H4><IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Keep a Media Watch Diary: Make yourself aware of the media. Make notes on what you observe in broadcast and print. Have your kids do the same. Make it fun. Discuss what you see. Exchange positions and argue the other's point of view.  Listen to others. Read a lot. Do research. Ask questions. Think for yourself.
<P>
For just one of many examples, make note of the "teasers" employed by newscasters that lead up to the commercials, "when we come back..." Study those suggestive little questions they ask. Do they really have answers, or are their questions designed to be unanswerable so we have to come back to see what happens? We have to "come back" so that we see the commercials in the meantime, or hear their words and music in the other room while we go to the kitchen).  The newscaster doesn't need a break. The advertiser needs the break to show his wares. So the questions, the teasers, the build-ups are for the commercials. 
<P>
Then ask, well, what about the actual <I>effects</I> of those questions and teasers and build-ups? Do they make us doubt? How do they condition us? Do they make us cynical? Do they disillusion us? Certainly there are appearances that deserve doubting and illusions that deserve disillusioning, but as a repeated technique, over and over, what effects do you notice? Etc, etc. Just break it all down and look at what you're seeing in this and dozens of other media techniques. 
<P>
Makes notes in your Media Watch Diary to share with others when you discuss media issues--across broadcast, print and Internet--at least once a week in whatever ongoing fashion you design.
<P>
<H4><IMG SRC="green_dk.gif">  Get your kids to be active as reporters for a family & relatives & neighbors newsletter you can put together on your computer. You can be a reporter too. The point here is to create your own media and be active rather than passive in relation to "news."  Research the "news" yourself and re-report it in your own words. Have your kids interview their grandparents and other relatives or neighbors, get oral histories, draw pictures, take photos for the family/neighborhood newsletter. Use e-mail to get reports from distant relatives and friends. 
<P>
<H4><IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Try to stretch beyond the family unit to neighbors and people in town. Meet new people, different people. Consider learning another language. Broaden your horizons. Read <A HREF="putnamtv1.htm">Robert Putnam's essays.</A> Involve yourselves in civic activities and report on their happenings. Photograph them. Evoke their spirit.
<P>
<H4><IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Send your best stories and photos to your local newspaper, those made as a group and those you make   yourself. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Report not only on "what's happening" but on what your family, friends and neighbors are <I>thinking</I> about things. What are their thoughts? What are their memories? What are their ideas? What are their inventions? What is valuable to them? What are their hopes? What are their worries? What are their beliefs?
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Each child can write his or her own regular "column" which can include any sorts of thoughts and reflections as well as reviews/critiques on TV programs, movies, sports events and other happenings locally & anywhere else.
<P>
When I was 7 or 8, my father made me write "reviews" on each movie I saw. I had to describe the content, the plot, the characters, and then I had to analyze it as a work of culture. I had to reflect on the world around me through the story of the film. I had to analogize, compare, contrast, criticize. I had to think.
<P>I grumbled. I hated doing those damned reports. But the effect was that I watched movies in a different way. I began to notice things. When that happened, it made me want to write.
<P>
By the time I was 14, I was publishing a little mimeographed newsletter--my own media--and Ive been writing ever since. Which means I've been <I>actively thinking</I> ever since, for better or for worse. From mimeograph to the World Wide Web--wow--that's a technological marvel. And yet it's all the same. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Your family, friends and neighbors can collaborate on a Web page--<I>and</I> a newsletter. Good idea to keep one foot on the earth in print on paper, even if it costs a few trees. Only one person at a time can sit in front of a computer, it's a bit isolating, whereas scouting around, reporting, talking, listening, gathering news, and finally working as a bunch at a table putting together a newsletter or a video document is a more social activity.
<P>
The computer is just a tool, and not a very social one in the sense I'm speaking of here.
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Form a Media Salon (discussion group) of your friends and neighbors to discuss media and current affairs on a regular basis. Oddly enough, media as a central topic of discussion is rare, so most people welcome the opportunity. I moderate a Media Salon that meets monthly (see <A HREF="activism.htm"> Part 1</A>).  Bring your Media Watch Diaries. Bring articles or tapes of radio and TV programs to analyze as a group. Bring delicious food to share. Politics are bound to come up. Let them. If there are severe cross-currents of political disagreement, use the Native American talking stick method and stick to "I statements" wherever you can. Avoid saying "you"--especially in disagreements--which can make your addressee defensive and hostile.
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif">  Take time on a regular basis (like weekly) to discuss media and current affairs in a reflective way within your own family. Select one of your least favorite TV programs and when that program airs, sit down for a serious inquiry into the real news. Think of it as counter-programming. Scheduling helps, whereas when we feel like it falls apart. Be your own newscast, your own analysts of current affairs.
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Engage the media. Speak up. Be vocal. Don't hesitate. Don't wait for others to do it. Call talk shows. Call or fax C-SPAN. Your Media Watch Diary will remind you of specifics. 
<P>
Jump in and meet the media head on, even non-commercial media that tout themselves as "objective" or "fair-minded." For example, ask Brian Lamb why he uses the same polarized format of left/right opinionaters employed by commercial news media when they portray politicians. In fact, he employs journalists from commercial media to present political positions (the hyper-conservative <I>Washington Times</I> is over-represented on C-SPAN's journalist roundtables, ever notice?). What's going on, Brian? Ask Ken Bode what's going on. Ask Jim Lehrer. Ask Ted Koppel. Look at the journalists and newscasters you consider the best and challenge them to be <I>better</I>. Be reasonable, not angry. Be persistent. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif">  Write letters/faxes/postcards  (preferably) or make calls to:
<P>
 * Newspaper and magazine reporters, editors & publishers 
<BR> * TV and radio hosts
<BR> * Broadcast station managers
<BR> * Advertising sponsors
<BR> * Copy your letters to the <A HREF="bordform.htm"> Media Discussion Center</A> to encourage others.
<BR> * A couple of sample letters are given below
<P>Develop a full list of addresses, phones and FAX numbers. Faxing from your computer is fabulous.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000"> Succinct well-written hard-copy letters have the best effect.  </font color="#FF0000"> (E-mail is too ephemeral).
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Write to Congress, Justice Department and FCC on media and communications issues. For example, regarding the ridiculous <A HREF="http://www.cpsr.org/dox/home.html"> Communications Decency Act</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.cpsr.org/dox/home.html"> Hyde Amendment</A> restricting certain forms of speech related to abortion. A recent panel of Federal judges has knocked down the CDA as unconstitutional, but it won't be over until it gets to  the Supreme Court.
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Consider boycotting commercial sponsors and <I>let media management know</I> the specific advertisers you plan to boycott. Let the advertisers themselves know, too. Make media and their commercial sponsors sweat. Make 'em realize there are real consequences.
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif">  Universities and colleges usually have some form of media education. Some schools have courses like The Sociology of Media. Become a student of media. Intellectually grab the whole phenomenon, shake it up, see what falls out of the pockets.
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif">  See the <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~cml/">  The Center for Media Literacy:</A>  Chock full of high-quality resources for teachers, parents and anyone concerned about commercial media's influence on society. This non-profit Los Angeles-based group published the famed <I>Media & Values</I> which is now called <I>Connect</I>. They offer seminars & workshops in media literacy and media issues. Membership (including the quarterly <I>Connect</I>) is $35 annually and worth every penny. Check out their Web site here. Also see <A HREF="http://www.kqed.org/fromKQED/Cell/ml/home.html"> Strategies for Media Literacy</A> for several other sources.  
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> If youre not already involved, get involved in civic activity. Attend city/county council/school board/PTA meetings. Attend candidate forums and town halls. Volunteer for a civic association. Clean up your street, your park. Build a barn. Do a mitvah for someone once a week (at least). Encourage your friends to do the same. Harvards <A HREF="putnmtv1.htm">Robert Putnam</A> (Bowling Alone) notes that TV tends to "atomize" and isolate families, whereas beyond-the-family civic involvement increases participation in the political process as it governs our society. Civic activity is an important antidote to media because were invested in the community that the media cover. 
<P>
But how can we know or love our world if we haven't been out in the middle of it? That means being in the town. The scale is important. Human scale. The scale at the level of the height of human beings, the decible level of human voices murmering on a summer night over a table of cheese and cool drinks. We can take our freedom back into our view, into our choices, in our own voices.
<P>
Remember the media are merely a collection of technologies that exist for our convenience as we live together, thrive and enjoy ourselves as a society. We do not exist for the media's convenience. As captains of our own society, it is <I>our</I> responsibility to insist that media serve human life.
<P>
Enjoy.

<P>
<font size=5">A</font size=5">ll the time we hear the term "inter-active." Sounds like a two-way street, doesn't it?  Back and forth. Give and take, going both ways. Inter-active this, inter-active that. It's a phrase designed to make us feel active in relation to our technology, and that's fine. 
<P>
But in some ways it's an illusion.
<P>
Actually, when it comes to inter-active media, more often than not we experience "inter-active TV" <I>passively</I>. This passive mood prevails all across media--in the news, in sports, in educational programs. There is, in some ways and in some households, an appearance of excitement and a reality of supressed energy, suppressed freedom. 
<P>
I'm surprised that libertarians haven't made a fuss about this pathology in our freedom. The media miasma is so subtle and complex, so difficult to <I>see</I>, to <I>grasp</I>, to <I>assess</I>, to make the best use of for human life. 
<P>
One tip-off to the lopsided relationship between active and passive is that the figure on the other side of the TV screen is doing all the work, all the talking, all the thinking--or apparent thinking--despite the fact that <I>you</I> are doing all the yes-ing-and-no-ing and squealing. The squealing is excited but reactive, passive. 
<P>
You'll notice this most dramatically on the shopping channel. It's supposedly "inter-active" because we push a button on our remote to select merchandise. We can "participate" in the program. There's some light banter (over the phone, another form of media). An ooze of feelgoody narrative is endless for hours and hours while watches and Zirconian diamonds turn on little lazy susans, glinting under lights. A few pleasantries are exchanged about what an exquisite teak duck we just bought--but are we being active? Or are we simply on a one-way street, being parted from our money with more than the usual willingness? 
<P>
Think of it: all of this is going on within the beautiful seduction of commercial promotional imagery. 
<P>
Now there's nothing in the world wrong with spending money and lord knows we love to veg out. But we must take care not to kid ourselves about inter-active media.
<P>
We think we're getting our TV programming virtually free. This is part of the problem because this means we don't give media value, which means we don't give media our best attention. There's a cost to us our lack of attention to media. It's not free. TV and most of the rest of media may be costing us everything. 
<P>
We are conducting our national conversation through the miasma of commercial media. A miasma, according the Webster's, is a befogging vapor that poisons the air. 
<P>
Let's shift around the words "inter-active media," drop "inter," and add one of those "-ism" things, give the expression a bit of dynamic flair from our point of view, from the consumer's view, the buyer's view. The news buyer has a voice.  
<P>
<STRONG>MEDIA ACTIVISM:</STRONG> Aha! Now there's a robust phrase! Simply turn it around and instead of describing media, we're decribing <I>our activism.</I> Now the street is going both ways and we're on it, <I>engaging</I> the media, <I>meeting</I> the media, <I>talking back</I> to the media, <I>writing</I> to the media (remember they're plural), <I>walking into</I> the offices of the media, <I>questioning</I> the media, <I>creating</I> our own media, <I>turning the media off</I> once in a while. More than once in a while, <I>we are the media.</I>
<P>
The thing that is needed first is <I>to look again</I>, not to watch the media but to <I>study</I> the media.
<P> 
The thing that is needed is to <I>be serious</I> and to use our minds as if our thoughts had consequences.
<P>
Thinking can be an immense pleasure and even a great help, when done right. Reading and listening and questioning ourselves. Wanting the best for our friends, for our children, for our town. Meeting together and talking together in the drawing rooms of homes. 
<P>
If you read <A HREF="putnmtv1.htm">Robert Putnam's essay</A>, you'll notice the rise of television coincided with the decline of American civic life and decline in voting.  Civic associations may be an antidote to media.  They are a media of their own form, live, something humanly simple and informal that was once a popular form in earlier centuries. In some circles, this is what we did before we had media technology. We were involved and accountable for our opinions because we faced each other within a foot or two, eye to eye. We spoke up. It's even better now that women and children and every variety of person can speak up, too.
<P>
In the Open Mind Salon on media and current affairs (which I moderate in Santa Barbara), we introduce ourselves not by our age but by the year we were born. This snaps in the history. We discuss media in light of history, society, personality, technology, literature, art, analogy, mythology, psychology. We break open the corporate commercial problem and lay it out and get to know--as best we can--the environment of sales (among other things) that surrounds us. We try to discern the ecology. We say hard things. We laugh. We're like a jazz band. 
<P>
We're not socialists (some of us are Republicans) but we're very interested in our society. We care about our city. We write, we appear in the paper. We do a lot of thinking in and about the life of the world. <I>We do what we wish the media would do.</I> We inform each other from our best sources and, unlike the "free press," we freely reveal our sources because, here in the salon or the group or the kitchen table, our sources are the education we give others with our information. Our sources are memory and history and human perspective, whereas in media there is little historical memory. 
<P>
The natural progression of the salon is the council of sages (You can create one in your town to advise your city council).
<P>
It's not outrageous to say that commercialism--the sale--stops time and makes the past want to be scarce. We lose a great deal in that transaction. The media rely on Newness and Now, everything focused in the present, on the unique without memory, at the point of purchase, the point of instantaneous choice without reflection, the flash, the hook, the appeal. The arrangement works for advertisers to create an effortless flow, so that continual change can occur, so that artificial distinctions can be made, so that one product can be distinguished from another, so that a sale can be made.  Has the "world made safe for democracy" become the "world made safe for sales"?   
<P>
The interests of commercialism are sometimes in conflict with the interests of human beings. Media's technology is allowing us to get ahead of ourselves without reflection on what we're doing. [See Elaine de Beauport's <A HREF="newstory.htm"> Matters of Consequence</A> about the "limbic-feeling" part of the brain being as important as the "thinking" part. Indeed, our feelings are another form of intelligence, thus far not very well educated, while "thinking" technology is having a field day]. We have "information hunger" but not much getting of wisdom. 
<P>
The overall media effect is hypnotic. Cher slapped Nicolas Cage in "Moonstruck" and yells "Snap out of it!"--we're in love. We're seduced. We're in it hook, line and sinker. How do we break through the media trance while preserving the media's best features for service to our society and our political process?
<P>
Media activism is truly <I>active</I>. It's involved with, yet independent of, the media. It's a force of nature come home to its rightful place in the livingroom. It's all sorts of things you will discover as soon as you rise up out of the languid passivity of commercial media--and take a few vigorous steps toward media activism . . . . </H4>

<H4><font size=5>M</font size=5>y fellow Americans: In recent weeks I have begun a conversation with the American people about
our fate and our duty to prepare our nation not only to meet the new century, but to live and lead in a
world transformed to a degree seldom seen in all of our history. Much of this change is good, but it is
not all good, and all of us are affected by it. Therefore, we must reach beyond our fears and our
divisions to a new time of great and common purpose. 
<P>
Our challenge is twofold: first, to restore the American dream of opportunity and the American value
of responsibility; and second, to bring our country together amid all our diversity into a stronger
community, so that we can find common ground and move forward as one. 
<P>
More than ever these two endeavors are inseparable. I am absolutely convinced we cannot restore
economic opportunity or solve our social problems unless we find a way to bring the American
people together. To bring our people together we must openly and honestly deal with the issues that
divide us. Today I want to discuss one of those issues: affirmative action. 
<P>
It is, in a way, ironic that this issue should be divisive today, because affirmative action was begun 25
years ago by a Republican president with bipartisan support. It began simply as a means to an end of
enduring national purpose equal opportunity for all Americans. 
<P>
So let us today trace the roots of affirmative action in our never ending search for equal opportunity.
Let us determine what it is and what it isnt. Let us see where its worked and where it hasnt, and
ask ourselves what we need to do now. Along the way, let us remember always that finding common
ground as we move toward the 21st century depends fundamentally on our shared commitment to
equal opportunity for all Americans. It is a moral imperative, a constitutional mandate, and a legal
necessity. 
<P>
There could be no better place for this discussion than the National Archives, for within these walls
are Americas bedrocks of our common ground: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution,
the Bill of Rights. No paper is as lasting as the words these documents contain. So we put them in
these special cases to protect the parchment from the elements. No building is as solid as the
principles these documents embody, but we sure tried to build one with these metal doors 11 inches
thick to keep them safe, for these documents are Americas only crown jewels. But the best place of
all to hold these words and these principles is the one place in which they can never fade and never
grow old in the stronger chambers of our hearts. 
<P>
Beyond all else, our country is a set of convictions: We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all
men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
<P>
Our whole history can be seen first as an effort to preserve these rights, and then as an effort to
make them real in the lives of all our citizens. We know that from the beginning, there was a great
gap between the plain meaning of our creed and the meaner reality of our daily lives. Back then, only
white male property-owners could vote. Black slaves were not even counted as whole people, and
Native Americans were regarded as little more than an obstacle to our great national progress. No
wonder Thomas Jefferson, reflecting on slavery, said he trembled to think God is just. 
<P>
On the 200th anniversary of our great Constitution, Justice Thurgood Marshall, the grandson of a
slave, said, "The government our founders devised was defective from the start, requiring several
amendments, a civil war, and momentous social transformation to attain the system of constitutional
government and its respect for the individual freedoms and human rights we hold as fundamental
today." 
<P>
Emancipation, womens suffrage, civil rights, voting rights, equal rights, the struggle for the rights of
the disabled all these and other struggles are milestones on Americas often rocky, but fundamentally
righteous journey to close the gap between the ideals enshrined in these treasures here in the
National Archives and the reality of our daily lives. 
<P>
I first came to this very spot where Im standing today 32 years ago this month. I was a 16 year old
delegate to the American Legion Boys Nation. Now, that summer was a high water mark for our
national journey. That was the summer that President Kennedy ordered Alabama National
Guardsmen to enforce a court order to allow two young blacks to enter the University of Alabama.
As he told our nation, "Every American ought to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be
treated; as one would wish his children to be treated." 
<P>
Later that same summer, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Martin Luther King told Americans
of his dream that one day the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners would sit
down together at the table of brotherhood; that one day his four little children would be judged not
by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. His words captured the hearts and
steeled the wills of millions of Americans. Some of them sang with him in the hot sun that day.
Millions more like me listened and wept in the privacy of their homes. 
<P>
Its hard to believe where we were just three decades ago. When I came up here to Boys Nation
and we had this mock congressional session, I was one of only three or four southerners who would
even vote for the civil rights plank. Thats largely because of my family. My grandfather had a grade
school education and ran a grocery store across the street from the cemetery in Hope, Arkansas,
where my parents and my grandparents are buried. Most of his customers were black, were poor,
and were working people. As a child in that store I saw that people of different races could treat
each other with respect and dignity. 
<P>
But I also saw that the black neighborhood across the street was the only one in town where the
streets werent paved. And when I returned to that neighborhood in the late 60s to see a woman
who had cared for me as a toddler, the streets still werent paved. A lot of you know that I am an
ardent movie goer. As a child I never went to a movie where I could sit next to a black American.
They were always sitting upstairs. 
<P>
In the 1960s, believe it or not, there were still a few courthouse squares in my state where the rest
rooms were marked "white" and "colored." I graduated from a segregated high school seven years
after President Eisenhower integrated Little Rock Central High School. And when President
Kennedy barely carried my home state in 1960, the poll tax system was still alive and well there. 
<P>
Even though my grandparents were in a minority, being poor, Southern whites who were pro-civil
rights, I think most other people knew better than to think the way they did. And those who were
smart enough to act differently, discovered a lesson that we ought to remember today: Discrimination
is not just morally wrong, it hurts everybody. 
<P>
In 1960, Atlanta, Georgia, in reaction to all the things that were going on all across the South,
adopted the motto, "The city too busy to hate." And however imperfectly over the years, they tried
to live by it. I am convinced that Atlantas success--partly because it now is home to more foreign corporations than
any other American city, and one year from today it will begin to host the Olympics--that success
all began when people got too busy to hate. 
<P>
The lesson we learned was a hard one. When we allow people to pit us against one another or
spend energy denying opportunity based on our differences, everyone is held back. But when we
give all Americans a chance to develop and use their talents, to be full partners in our common
enterprise, then everybody is pushed forward. 
<P>
My experiences with discrimination are rooted in the South and in the legacy slavery left. I also lived
with a working mother and a working grandmother when womens work was far rarer and far more
circumscribed than it is today. But we all know there are millions of other stories those of Hispanics,
Asian Americans, Native Americans, people with disabilities, others against whom fingers have been
pointed. Many of you have your own stories, and thats why youre here toda people who were
denied the right to develop and use their full human potential. And their progress, too, is a part of our
journey to make the reality of America consistent with the principles just behind me here. 
<P>
Thirty years ago in this city, you didnt see many people of color or women making their way to
work in the morning in business clothes, or serving in substantial numbers in powerful positions in
Congress or at the White House, or making executive decisions every day in businesses. In fact,
even the employment want ads were divided, men on one side and women on the other. 
<P>
It was extraordinary then to see women or people of color as television news anchors, or, believe it
or not, even in college sports. There were far fewer women or minorities as job supervisors, or
firefighters, or police officers, or doctors, or lawyers, or college professors, or in many other jobs
that offer stability and honor and integrity to family life. 
<P>
A lot has changed, and it did not happen as some sort of random evolutionary drift. It took hard
work and sacrifices and countless acts of courage and conscience by millions of Americans. It took
the political courage and statesmanship of Democrats and Republicans alike, the vigilance and
compassion of courts and advocates in and out of government committed to the Constitution and to
equal protection and to equal opportunity. It took the leadership of people in business who knew
that in the end we would all be better. It took the leadership of people in labor unions who knew that
working people had to be reconciled. 
<P>
Some people, like Congressman Lewis there, put their lives on the line. Other people lost their lives.
And millions of Americans changed their own lives and put hate behind them. As a result, today all
our lives are better. Women have become a major force in business and political life, and far more
able to contribute to their families incomes. A true and growing black middle class has emerged.
Higher education has literally been revolutionized, with women and racial and ethnic minorities
attending once overwhelmingly white and sometimes all male schools. 
<P>
In communities across our nation police departments now better reflect the make up of those whom
they protect. A generation of professionals now serve as role models for young women and minority
youth. Hispanics and newer immigrant populations are succeeding in making America stronger. 
<P>
For an example of where the best of our future lies just think about our space program and the
stunning hook up with the Russian space station this month. Lets remember that that program, the
worlds finest, began with heroes like Alan Shepard and Senator John Glenn, but today its had
American heroes like Sally Ride, Ellen Ochoa, Leroy Child, Guy Bluford and other outstanding,
completely qualified women and minorities. 
<P>
How did this happen? Fundamentally, because we opened our hearts and minds and changed our
ways. But not without pressure the pressure of court decisions, legislation, executive action, and the
power of examples in the public and private sector. Along the way we learned that laws alone do not
change society; that old habits and thinking patterns are deeply ingrained and die hard; that more is
required to really open the doors of opportunity. Our search to find ways to move more quickly to
equal opportunity led to the development of what we now call affirmative action. 
<P>
<CENTER>______________________________________________________________

<H2><font color="#0000ff">"With affirmative action, a middle ground was <BR>developed that would change an inequitable status quo <BR>gradually, but firmly ..." </font color="#0000ff"></H2>
________________________________________________________________</CENTER>
<P>
The purpose of affirmative action is to give our nation a way to finally address the systemic exclusion
of individuals of talent on the basis of their gender or race from opportunities to develop, perform,
achieve and contribute. Affirmative action is an effort to develop a systematic approach to open the
doors of education, employment and business development opportunities to qualified individuals who
happen to be members of groups that have experienced longstanding and persistent discrimination. 
<P>
It is a policy that grew out of many years of trying to navigate between two unacceptable pasts. One
was to say simply that we declared discrimination illegal and thats enough. We saw that that way
still relegated blacks with college degrees to jobs as railroad porters, and kept women with degrees
under a glass ceiling with a lower paycheck. 
<P>
The other path was simply to try to impose change by leveling draconian penalties on employers who
didnt meet certain imposed, ultimately arbitrary, and sometimes unachievable quotas. That, too, was
rejected out of a sense of fairness. 
<P>
So with affirmative action a middle ground was developed that would change an inequitable status quo gradually, but firmly,
by building the pool of qualified applicants for college, for contracts, for jobs, and giving more
people the chance to learn, work and earn. When affirmative action is done right, it is flexible, it is
fair, and it works. 
<P>
I know some people are honestly concerned about the times affirmative action doesnt work, when
its done in the wrong way. And I know there are times when some employers dont use it in the
right way. They may cut corners and treat a flexible goal as a quota. They may give opportunities to
people who are unqualified instead of those who deserve it. They may, in so doing, allow a different
kind of discrimination. When this happens, it is also wrong. But it isnt affirmative action, and it is not
legal. 
<P>
So when our administration finds cases of that sort, we will enforce the law aggressively. The Justice
Department files hundreds of cases every year, attacking discrimination in employment, including
suits on behalf of white males. Most of these suits, however, affect women and minorities for a
simple reason because the vast majority of discrimination in America is still discrimination against
them. But the law does require fairness for everyone and we are determined to see that that is
exactly what the law delivers. 
<P>
Let me be clear about what affirmative action must not mean and what I wont allow it to be. It does
not mean the unjustified preference of the unqualified over the qualified of any race
or gender. It doesnt mean numerical quotas. It doesnt mean and I dont favor
rejection or selection of any employee or student solely on the basis of race or gender without regard
to merit. 
<P>
Like many business executives and public servants, I owe it to you to say that my views on this
subject are, more than anything else, the product of my personal experience. I have had experience
with affirmative action, nearly 20 years of it now, and I know it works. 
<P>
When I was Attorney General of my home state, I hired a record number of women and African
American lawyers every one clearly qualified and exceptionally hardworking. As Governor, I
appointed more women to my Cabinet and state boards than any other governor in the states
history, and more African Americans than all the governors in the states history combined. And no
one ever questioned their qualifications or performance. And our state was better and stronger
because of their service. 
<P>
As President, I am proud to have the most diverse administration in history in my Cabinet, my
agencies and my staff. And I must say, I have been surprised at the criticism I have received from
some quarters in my determination to achieve this. 
<P>
In the last two and a half years, the most outstanding example of affirmative action in the United
States, the Pentagon, has opened 260,000 positions for women who serve in our Armed Forces. I
have appointed more women and minorities to the federal bench than any other president, more than
the last two combined. And yet, far more of our judicial appointments have received the highest
rating from the American Bar Association than any other administration since those ratings have been
given. 
<P>
In our administration many government agencies are doing more business with qualified firms run by
minorities and women. The Small Business Administration has reduced its budget by 40 percent,
doubled its loan outputs, dramatically increased the number of loans to women and minority small
business people, without reducing the number of loans to white businessowners who happen to be
male, and without changing the loan standards for a single, solitary application. Quality and diversity
can go hand in hand, and they must. 
<P>
Let me say that affirmative action has also done more than just open the doors of opportunity to
individual Americans. Most economists who study it agree that affirmative action has also been an
important part of closing gaps in economic opportunity in our society, thereby strengthening the
entire economy. 
<P>
A group of distinguished business leaders told me just a couple of days ago that their companies are
stronger and their profits are larger because of the diversity and the excellence of their work forces
achieved through intelligent and fair affirmative action programs. And they said we have gone far
beyond anything the government might require us to do because managing diversity and individual
opportunity and being fair to everybody is the key to our future economic success in the global
marketplace.

<P>

<P>
Now, there are those who say, my fellow Americans, that even good affirmative action programs are
no longer needed; that it should be enough to resort to the courts or the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission in cases of actual, provable, individual discrimination because there is no
longer any systematic discrimination in our society. In deciding how to answer that let us consider the
facts. 
<P>
The unemployment rate for African Americans remains about twice that of whites. The Hispanic rate
is still much higher. Women have narrowed the earnings gap, but still make only 72 percent as much
as men do for comparable jobs. The average income for an Hispanic woman with a college degree is
still less than the average income of a white man with a high school diploma. 
<P>
According to the recently completed Glass Ceiling Report, sponsored by Republican members of
Congress, in the nations largest companies only six tenths of one percent of senior management
positions are held by African Americans, four tenths of a percent by Hispanic Americans, three
tenths of a percent by Asian Americans; women hold between three and five percent of these
positions. White males make up 43 percent of our work force, but hold 95 percent of these jobs. 
<P>
Just last week, the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank reported that black home loan applicants are
more than twice as likely to be denied credit as whites with the same qualifications; and that Hispanic
applicants are more than one and a half times as likely to be denied loans as whites with the same
qualifications. 
<P>
Last year alone the federal government received more than 90,000 complaints of employment
discrimination based on race, ethnicity or gender. Less than three percent were for reverse
discrimination. 
<P>
Evidence abounds in other ways of the persistence of the kind of bigotry that can affect the way we
think even if were not conscious of it, in hiring and promotion and business and educational
decisions. 
<P>
Crimes and violence based on hate against Asians, Hispanics, African Americans and other
minorities are still with us. And, Im sorry to say, that the worst and most recent evidence of this
involves a recent report of federal law enforcement officials in Tennessee attending an event literally
overflowing with racism a sickening reminder of just how pervasive these kinds of attitudes still are. 
<P>
By the way, I want to tell you that I am committed to finding the truth about what happened there
and to taking appropriate action. And I want to say that if anybody who works in federal law
enforcement thinks that that kind of behavior is acceptable, they ought to think about working
someplace else. 
<P>
Now, lets get to the other side of the argument. If affirmative action has worked and if there is
evidence that discrimination still exists on a wide scale in ways that are conscious and unconscious,
then why should we get rid of it as many people are urging? Some question the effectiveness or the
fairness of particular affirmative action programs. I say to all of you, those are fair questions, and
they prompted the review of our affirmative action programs, about which I will talk in a few
moments. 
<P>
Some question the fundamental purpose of the effort. There are people who honestly believe that
affirmative action always amounts to group preferences over individual merit; that affirmative action
always leads to reverse discrimination; that ultimately, therefore, it demeans those who benefit from it
and discriminates against those who are not helped by it. 
<P>
I just have to tell you that all of you have to decide how you feel about that, and all of our fellow
countrymen and women have to decide as well. But I believe if there are no quotas, if we give no
opportunities to unqualified people, if we have no reverse discrimination, and if, when the problem
ends, the program ends, that criticism is wrong. Thats what I believe. But we should have this
debate and everyone should ask the question.

<font size=5>N</font size=5>ow lets deal with what I really think is behind so much of this debate today. There are a lot of
people who oppose affirmative action today who supported it for a very long time. I believe they are
responding to the sea change in the experiences that most Americans have in the world in which we
live. 
<P>
If you say now youre against affirmative action because the government is using its power or the
private sector is using its power to help minorities at the expense of the majority, that gives you a
way of explaining away the economic distress that a majority of Americans honestly feel. It gives you
a way of turning their resentment against the minorities or against a particular government program,
instead of having an honest debate about how we all got into the fix were in and what were all
going to do together to get out of it. 
<P>
That explanation, the affirmative action explanation for the fix were in is just wrong. It is just wrong.
Affirmative action did not cause the great economic problems of the American middle class. And
because most minorities or women are either members of that middle class or people who are poor
who are struggling to get into it, we must also admit that affirmative action alone wont solve the
problems of minorities and women who seek to be a part of the American Dream. To do that, we
have to have an economic strategy that reverses the decline in wages and the growth of poverty
among working people. Without that, women, minorities, and white males will all be in trouble in the
future. 
<P>
But it is wrong to use misunderstandings about affirmative action to stir up anxieties of the middle class to divert the American people from the real
causes of their economic distress the sweeping historic changes taking all the globe in its path, and
the specific policies or lack of them in our own country which have aggravated those challenges. It is
simply wrong to play politics with the issue of affirmative action and divide our country at a time
when, if were really going to change things, we have to be united. 
<P>

<P>
<CENTER>______________________________________________________________

<H2><font color="#0000ff">"It is wrong to use misunderstandings about <BR>affirmative action to stir up anxieties of the middle class and divert the American people from the real causes<BR> of their economic distress..."  </font color="#0000ff"></H2>
________________________________________________________________</CENTER>
<P>

I must say, I think it is ironic that some of those not all, but some of those who call for an end to
affirmative action also advocate policies which will make the real economic problems of the anxious
middle class even worse. They talk about opportunity and being for equal opportunity for everyone,
and then they reduce investment in equal opportunity on an evenhanded basis. For example, if the
real goal is economic opportunity for all Americans, why in the world would we reduce our
investment in education from Head Start to affordable college loans? Why dont we make college
loans available to every American instead? 
<P>
If the real goal is empowering all middle class Americans and empowering poor people to work their
way into the middle class without regard to race or gender, why in the world would the people who
advocate that turn around and raise taxes on our poorest working families, or reduce the money
available for education and training when they lose their jobs or theyre living on poverty wages, or
increase the cost of housing for lower income, working people with children? 
<P>
Why would we do that? If were going to empower America, we have to do more than talk about it,
we have to do it. And we surely have learned that we cannot empower all Americans by a simple
strategy of taking opportunity away from some Americans. 
<P>
So to those who use this as a political strategy to divide us, we must say, no. We must say, no. But
to those who raise legitimate questions about the way affirmative action works, or who raise the
larger question about the genuine problems and anxieties of all the American people and their sense
of being left behind and treated unfairly, we must say, yes, you are entitled to answers to your
questions. We must say yes to that. 
<P>
Now, thats why I ordered this review of all of our affirmative action programs; a review to look at
the facts, not the politics of affirmative action. This review concluded that affirmative action remains a
useful tool for widening economic and educational opportunity. The model used by the military, the
Army in particular and Im delighted to have the Commanding General of the Army here today
because he set such a fine example has been especially successful because it emphasizes education
and training, ensuring that it has a wide pool of qualified candidates for every level of promotion.
That approach has given us the most racially diverse and best qualified military in our history. There
are more opportunities for women and minorities there than ever before. And now there are over 50
generals and admirals who are Hispanic, Asian or African Americans. 
<P>
We found that the Education Department had programs targeted on under-represented minorities
that do a great deal of good with the tiniest of investments. We found that these programs comprised
40 cents of every $1,000 in the Education Departments budget. 
<P>
Now, college presidents will tell you that the education their schools offer actually benefit from
diversity; colleges where young people get the education and make the personal and professional
contacts that will shape their lives. If their colleges look like the world theyre going to live and work
in, and they learn from all different kinds of people things that they cant learn in books, our systems
of higher education are stronger. 
<P>
Still, I believe every child needs the chance to go to college. Every child. That means every child has
to have a chance to get affordable and repayable college loans, Pell Grants for poor kids and a
chance to do things like join AmeriCorps and work their way through school. Every child is entitled
to that. That is not an argument against affirmative action, its an argument for more opportunity for
more Americans until everyone is reached. 
<P>
As I said a moment ago, the review found that the Small Business Administration last year increased
loans to minorities by over two thirds, loans to women by over 80 percent, did not decrease loans to
white men, and not a single loan went to a unqualified person. People who never had a chance
before to be part of the American system of free enterprise now have it. No one was hurt in the
process. That made America stronger. 
<P>
This review also found that the executive order on employment practices of large federal contractors
also has helped to bring more fairness and inclusion into the work force. 
<P>
Since President Nixon was here in my job, America has used goals and timetables to preserve
opportunity and to prevent discrimination, to urge businesses to set higher expectations for
themselves and to realize those expectations. But we did not and we will not use rigid quotas to
mandate outcomes. 
<P>
We also looked at the way we award procurement contracts under the programs known as set
asides. Theres no question that these programs have helped to build up firms owned by minorities
and women, who historically had been excluded from the old boy networks in these areas. It has
helped a new generation of entrepreneurs to flourish, opening new paths to self reliance and an
economic growth in which all of us ultimately share. Because of the set asides, businesses ready to
compete have had a chance to compete, a chance they would not have otherwise had. 
<P>
But as with any government program, set asides can be misapplied, misused, even intentionally
abused. There are critics who exploit that fact as an excuse to abolish all these programs, regardless
of their effects. I believe they are wrong, but I also believe, based on our factual review, we clearly
need some reform. So first, we should crack down on those who take advantage of everyone else
through fraud and abuse. We must crack down on fronts and pass throughs, people who pretend to
be eligible for these programs and arent. That is wrong. 
<P>
We also, in offering new businesses a leg up, must make sure that the set asides go to businesses that
need them most. We must really look and make sure that our standard for eligibility is fair and
defensible. We have to tighten the requirement to move businesses out of programs once theyve
had a fair opportunity to compete. The graduation requirement must mean something--it must mean
graduation. There should be no permanent set aside for any company. 
<P>
Second, we must, and we will, comply with the Supreme Courts Adarand decision of last month.
Now, in particular, that means focusing set aside programs on particular regions and business sectors
where the problems of discrimination or exclusion are provable and are clearly requiring affirmative
action. I have directed the Attorney General and the agencies to move forward with compliance with
Adarand expeditiously. 
<P>
But I also want to emphasize that the Adarand decision did not dismantle affirmative action and did
not dismantle set asides. In fact, while setting stricter standards to mandate reform of affirmative
action, it actually reaffirmed the need for affirmative action and reaffirmed the continuing existence of
systematic discrimination in the United States. 
<P>
What the Supreme Court ordered the federal government to do was to meet the same more rigorous
standard for affirmative action programs that state and local governments were ordered to meet
several years ago. And the best set aside programs under that standard have been challenged and
have survived. 
<P>
Third, beyond discrimination we need to do more to help disadvantaged people and distressed
communities, no matter what their race or gender. There are places in our country where the free
enterprise system simply doesnt reach. It simply isnt working to provide jobs and opportunity.
Disproportionately, these areas in urban and rural America are highly populated by racial minorities,
but not entirely. To make this initiative work, I believe the government must become a better partner
for people in places in urban and rural America that are caught in a cycle of poverty. And I believe
we have to find ways to get the private sector to assume their rightful role as a driver of economic
growth. 

<P>

<P>


It has always amazed me that we have given incentives to our business people to help to develop
poor economies in other parts of the world, our neighbors in the Caribbean, our neighbors in other
parts of the world I have supported this when not subject to their own abuses but we ignore the
biggest source of economic growth available to the American economy, the poor economies isolated
within the United States of America. 
<P>
There are those who say, well, even if we made the jobs available people wouldnt work. They
havent tried. Most of the people in disadvantaged communities work today, and most of them who
dont work have a very strong desire to do so. In central Harlem, 14 people apply for every single
minimum wage job opening. Think how many more would apply if there were good jobs with a good
future. Our job is to connect disadvantaged people and disadvantaged communities to economic
opportunity so that everybody who wants to work can do so. 
<P>
Weve been working at this through our empowerment zones and community develop banks,
through the initiatives of Secretary Cisneros of the Housing and Urban Development Department and
many other things that we have tried to do to put capital where it is needed. And now I have asked
Vice President Gore to develop a proposal to use our contracting to support businesses that locate
themselves in these distressed areas or hire a large percentage of their workers from these areas not
to substitute for what were doing in affirmative action, but to supplement it, to go beyond it, to do
something that will help to deal with the economic crisis of America. We want to make our
procurement system more responsive to people in these areas who need help. 
<P>
My fellow Americans, affirmative action has to be made consistent with our highest ideals of
personal responsibility and merit, and our urgent need to find common ground, and to prepare all
Americans to compete in the global economy of the next century. 
<P>

Today, I am directing all our agencies to comply with the Supreme Courts Adarand decision, and
also to apply the four standards of fairness to all our affirmative action programs that I have already
articulated: No quotas in theory or practice; no illegal discrimination of any kind, including reverse
discrimination; no preference for people who are not qualified for any job or other opportunity; and
as soon as a program has succeeded, it must be retired. Any program that doesnt meet these four
principles must be eliminated or reformed to meet them. 
<P>
But let me be clear: Affirmative action has been good for America. 
<P>
Affirmative action has not always been perfect, and affirmative action should not go on forever. It
should be changed now to take care of those things that are wrong, and it should be retired when its
job is done. I am resolved that that day will come. But the evidence suggests, indeed, screams that
that day has not yet come. 
<P>
The job of ending discrimination in this country is not over. That should not be surprising. We had
slavery for centuries before the passage of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments. We waited another
hundred years for the civil rights legislation. Women have had the vote less than a hundred years. We
have always had difficulty with these things, as most societies do. But we are making more progress
than many people. 
<P>
Based on the evidence, the job is not done. So here is what I think we should do. We should
reaffirm the principle of affirmative action and fix the practices. We should mend it, but dont end it. 


<P>
Let me ask all Americans, whether they agree or disagree with what I have said today, to see this
issue in the larger context of our times. President Lincoln said, we cannot escape our history. We
cannot escape our future, either. And that future must be one in which every American has the
chance to live up to his or her God given capacities. 
<P>
The new technology, the instant communications, the explosion of global commerce have created
enormous opportunities and enormous anxieties for Americans. In the last two and a half years, we
have seen seven million new jobs, more millionaires and new businesses than ever before, high
corporate profits, and a booming stock market. Yet, most Americans are working harder for the
same or lower pay. And they feel more insecurity about their jobs, their retirement, their health care,
and their childrens eduation. Too many of our children are clearly exposed to poverty and welfare,
violence and drugs. 
<P>
These are the great challenges for our whole country on the homefront at the dawn of the 21st
century. Weve got to find the wisdom and the will to create family wage jobs for all the people who
want to work; to open the door of college to all Americans; to strengthen families and reduce the
awful problems to which our children are exposed; to move poor Americans from welfare to work. 
<P>

________________________________________________________________</CENTER>
<P>
This is the work of our administration to give the people the tools they need to make the most of
their own lives, to give families and communities the tools they need to solve their own problems. But
let us not forget affirmative action didnt cause these problems. And getting rid of affirmative action
certainly wont solve them. 
<P>
If properly done, affirmative action can help us come together, go forward and grow together. It is in
our moral, legal and practical interest to see that every person can make the most of his life. In the
fight for the future, we need all hands on deck and some of those hands still need a helping hand. 
<P>
In our national community were all different, were all the same. We want liberty and freedom. We
want the embrace of family and community. We want to make the most of our own lives and were
determined to give our children a better one. Today there are voices of division who would say
forget all that. Dont you dare. Remember were still closing the gap between our founders ideals and
our reality. But every step along the way has made us richer, stronger and better. And the best is yet
to come. 
<P>
Thank you very much, and God bless you.

<BLOCKQUOTE><H4>From The Associated Press, December 27, 1996 </CENTER>
<P>
ATLANTA (AP)--Internal memos show that lawyers advised Newt Gingrich not to
involve tax-exempt foundations in political projects, although the House
Speaker told a congressional subcommittee he didn't seek legal advice on the
matter until later, a newspaper reported today. 
<P>
The memos from Gingrich's Republican fund-raising committee, GOPAC, show that
lawyers as early as 1990 advised against or urged caution in involving
charitable or educational foundations in political projects, according to the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
<P>
Last week, as part of a settlement with a House ethics subcommittee, Gingrich
said he ``was wrong'' to not seek legal opinions on a college course and
other projects that led to an ethics complaint against him. 
<P>
The newspaper also said that documents obtained from Kennesaw State College
through a Freedom of Information request in 1993 show that while Gingrich was
organizing a course there called ``Renewing American Civilization,'' he
continued to consult one of the attorneys who advised him three years earlier
against such projects. 
<P>
In a memo to a Kennesaw State dean five months before he began teaching the
course, Gingrich stated: ``Gordon Strauss will be my lawyer for all finance,
ethics and legal questions, so he needs to be involved also.'' 
<P>
Strauss, who the Journal-Constitution said was paid by GOPAC, was the author
of a memo delivered to GOPAC in 1990 noting that charitable and educational
groups were barred under tax laws from engaging in political activity. 
<P>
The ethics subcommittee last week found that Gingrich violated House rules by
providing the panel with false information and by failing to seek the
appropriate legal advice on the college course. 
<P>
The course started at Kennesaw State but was moved to the private Reinhardt
College in north Georgia after the state Board of Regents passed a rule
banning politicians from teaching at public colleges. 
<P>
Tax-exempt organizations, such as charities and educational foundations, are
barred from partisan activities. From the beginning, Democrats attacked the
course as being political and receiving financial help from GOPAC. 
<P>
Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley said the legal memos cited by the
Journal-Constitution were not relevant to the ethics subcommittee's findings.
<P>

``He did talk to lawyers, but apparently not the lawyers that the
subcommittee thought he should have,'' Blankley told the newspaper. ``He
never claimed he did not consult lawyers. But the subcommittee report said he
did not consult the right lawyers at the right time.''

<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> FAIR's CounterSpin reporter Janine Jackson reports (thank you) on an extraordinary <A HREF="counter5.htm">under-reported story that every American should hear: </A>
<P>
The "champion of inclusiveness" Jack Kemp had a high-level campaign adviser in his 1988 Presidential race named Thomas Ellis who once presided over the Pioneer Fund which financed research trying to prove that blacks are genetically inferior to whites. Ellis also "advised" Steve Forbes during this year's primaries--see my essay here under "Missing Stories":<A HREF="forbes.htm"> Gentlemen's Agreement</A>. Another close Kemp campaign adviser in 1988, Tim LeHaye, was forced to resign when reporters publicized some of Mr. LeHaye's anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic writings. 
<P>
Jack Kemp, thought of by many as the soul of the Republican Party, may not himself be a bigot, but his tolerance of intolerance--casual as it is in the course of business as usual--is one thing that allows bigotry to persist and flourish. 
<P>
Both Kemp and Forbes have some explaining to do. Keep an eye on this ball. It's getting Orwellian.
<P>
Every American now so enchanted with Jack Kemp should know the facts about him, whatever they are. If the facts matter to you, don't rely on the media. Research them yourself by looking up information on, for example, who is involved in Kemp's Empower America Foundation. One good source is the Center for Public Integrity, the group that exposed Pat Buchanan's campaign co-chairman Larry Pratt's close association with paramilitias and racists. Write (with $5 to 1634 "I" St, Wash., DC 20006; e-mail MishiEb@aol.com) to obtain CPI's study on campaign finances of both major parties. This booklet includes extensive material on the complex network of political operatives surrounding Kemp and Forbes as well as Clinton and Gore.

<P>
<H4> <IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Attending the (above) forum at the Univ. of London, Mark Wood (Editor-in-Chief of Reuter) reported that a Reuter story on Cambodia had suffered an "Internet interception." A Reuter e-mail dispatch was intercepted, one sentence was added, the format was kept exactly as if it were a Reuter story, and the transmission was sent on its way. The single sentence caused holy havoc and a Reuter apology to the Cambodian government. An editorial virus injected into the news wire? Yikes!

<PRE>    </PRE>
<CENTER>______________________________________________________<CENTER>"The good news is the advertising. That's what it's about, <BR>and the bad news--the dead guys and the crime--<BR>is to get the suckers into the tent."</CENTER>
______________________________________________________________</CENTER

Lewis Lapham, Editor of <I>Harper's</I> Magazine, has a long and distinguished history in journalism and writing, a graduate of Yale University and Cambridge University.  He's the author of four books, with a fifth on the way.  Over the years he's written for most if not all of our most influential and prestigious newspapers and magazines and has won numerous awards; most recently, he won the 1995 National Magazine Award for Best Essayist. In the July 1995 issue of <I>Harpers</I> he wrote an essay (worth looking up) that critiqued the media's performance in covering the Oklahoma City bombing.

<PRE>   </PRE>

<I>Mr. Laphams Opening Remarks: </I><BR>
<P>
As recently as 1960, there was something called the press, there was something called literature, there was something called drama, and there was something called the movies; and they were all different.  They were distinct. People brought to each one of those forms a different set of standards and expectations.
<P>
Somewhere in the mid 1960's, certainly by the end of the 60's, these various forms fused into what we now know as the media--a plural group of entities often referred to in a singular way. 
<P>
The media is based on personality, it's based on celebrity, and it's based on a world that never was. At least to me, most of what is presented as television news is very much like the America that you see at Disneys Epcot Center.  Its Tomorrow Land or Frontier Land or War Land, or whatever they happen to be selling that week.
<P>
This was made very clear during the Oklahoma bombing coverage. For a few days, as a story, it managed to take the top few seconds on CNN away from the O.J. Simpson trial.  But it was presented in a conventional form, so that to the sophisticated viewer, which includes nearly all of us of all ages, the rest of the OK City narrative could almost be inferred. You knew what the concerned journalist was going to say, standing in front of the ruin of the Murrah Building.  You knew exactly what the sages in Washington were going to worry about in terms of what's become of this great country of ours, and so forth, and you knew that within three or four days, the story would disappear, which it did.
<P>
We are now accustomed to looking at news as entertainment, as pure spectacle. If we don't have the bombing in Oklahoma City, we'll have the war in Bosnia, and if we don't have the war in Bosnia, we'll have the invasion of Haiti, and if we don't have the invasion of Haiti, we'll have a race riot in Los Angeles, and somebody will constantly come up with a new diversion. 
<P>
In the midst of all this, how do you talk to your audience, and what is it that you try to say? I assume that's the question that all of you as public radio news directors address every morning.  Certainly it's the one that I address at <I>Harper's</I> Magazine, and I'm just curious to know among the people here, how do you propose to carry on the struggle against the Disney Company?  So, that's my own question...
<P>
<I>Comments and questions from the audience:</I>
<P>
<I>Gordon Bassham</I> with KMUW in Wichita: I'm wondering if you would speak to the American public's skepticism toward the media and the media's cynicism or skepticism toward events we report on.
<P>
<I>Lewis Lapham:</I>
<P>
Okay, the skepticism toward the media is traditional. When I was a young person, even in the 40's and during World War II--the high watermark of American patriotism and so on--I was  brought up on the premise that one simply did not believe what one read in the newspapers.
<P>
Journalism as a source of high mindedness, or the truth and so on, is a canard. I'm surprised that the press has any credibility today. In the public opinion polls, I think the press rates something like 19% of the public confidence. I approach the media with a good deal of, not cynicism but skepticism. How can you come up with the so called truth on the kind of deadlines that newspapers work on or that television broadcasts work on, or radio programs work on?  So, the press is a best guess.  It's the best that can be done in the time or space allowed.
<P>
I think the American press is very sentimental. I don't think it's cynical at all.  I mean, look at what sells.  What sells is <I>People</I> Magazine or Barbara Walters or Entertainment Tonight or Oprah Winfrey or The <I>National Enquirer</I> or the <I>Reader's Digest.</I> This is the American media. Its not cynical, its sentimental. The stories are about the little blind boy who finds God or the person who was cured of AIDS or the drunk who finds true love. This is what the American media, 90% of it, is like: Hollywood movies.  And the combination with Disney is a match made in heaven as far as I can see.  The truly cynical reporter wouldn't keep a job for twenty minutes in present-day Washington.
<P>
<I>Gordon Bassham:</I> If I could follow up on that, journalists are not thought of very highly because we're always reporting bad news.  I mean, I try to defend the fact that news is news; it's neither good nor bad, it is simply the news; but seemingly, the perception of the American public is that we do nothing but report bad news....
<P>
<I>Lewis Lapham:</I> Well, in large part, you do. Heres something underneath it all thats extremely cynical, its really dark. Average viewers wont like to hear it and idealistic reporters will grit their teeth, but here goes: The bad news is what sells the good news.  In other words, the way it works--and McLuhan makes this point brilliantly in <I>Understanding Media</I> in 1964--most television is good news.  The good news is the advertising. That's what it's about, and the bad news--the dead guys and the crime--is to get the suckers into the tent, get up the emotional pitch to set up the advertising.
<P>
The formula works like this:  The evening news--you start with some bodies being brought out in a body bag--and this is the New York local news.  You know, five people have been killed in Harlem, there's a train wreck, there's a fire, there's war in Bosnia, there's the O.J. Simpson trial and that's the first five minutes, and then we go to the commercial...and the commercial is American Airlines is going to take you to paradise or you're going to ride to heaven on the American Express Card... 
<P>
First they give you the vision of hell, which is what scares the person, the audience, the viewer. This is what sets up the good news, which is the advertising, which is the way the game is played.  So the idea that the media as a whole does bad news is just not true at all.  It's part of the pitch. It's the freak show in order to sell the snow cones. My remarks are tongue in cheek, but you get what I mean.
<P>
<I>Dale Harrison:</I>  I'm Dale Harrison.  I'm with Northwest Public Radio out of Pullman, Washington.  Can you comment on your perspective of how the Information Super Highway, the Internet, the Web sites, all the ways of bypassing the mainstream media and all the other sorts of filtered means of communications where folks can form their own interest groups and their own agitation and all the other things that are attributed to this phenomenon in society; how does that affect or make irrelevant what happens to the mainstream media?  I mean, for instance, so what if the big guys own everything if I can get my little group of people together on the Net, can't we just kind of bypass that or any of the permeations of that?
<P>
<I>Lewis Lapham:</I>  Yes, we can, and the big guys are going to be wanting to shut down those possibilities as quickly as they can. They're starting already with the notion of trying to regulate pornography on the Internet and other controls are on the way. The big guys have got no interest in the Internet at all unless they can control it, and there are several bills in Congress.  They're not part of the bill that was passed yesterday but they are seeking to control the Internet.
<P>
It's like the American West.  I mean, the American West in the first 50 years, say circa 1810-1860, really after the Civil War, the West was full of odd characters and mountain men and trappers and people of very eccentric views expressing themselves very freely, and then once capital began to settle the West after the Civil War, it became railroads. And the individuals--the cowboys--were gone in twenty years.  In 1890, you have almost all the Western lands owned by large corporations or the government. But the corporations have no public interest at heart and no individual interest at heart. Now we have present day Robber Barons. The equivalents of the railroad guys in the late 19th century are people like John Malone or Ray Smith or Disneys Michael Eisner.  It's the same frontier scene.
<P>
Remember, even a year ago, there was some talk about interactive, about how you get to talk back to your television set. That's gone.  I mean, it depends how they set up the system.  If they build the system with a certain kind of circuitry, you're never going to be able to talk back to your cable.  They don't want you to talk, they want to sell you things.  There's now a device--Time Warner's got a wonderful new thing where you get a video cassette and you rent it from your local store.  They know who you are, of course, particularly when you connect it to a telephone company and they have your telephone records, they will know a great deal about you as a consumer, which is what they're interested in.  They're not interested in you as a citizen, they're interested in you as a consumer.
<P>
We can watch the movie, and we're two scenes into the movie and the light comes on, right?  And you stop and the program says, "Do you want Demi Moore's dress?"  "Do you want Michael Douglas' haircut?" "Do you want the dog?" "Do you want the chair?"  Anything in this picture is for sale, you go through the menus and they give you the circle of stores that are prepared to deliver, even in the dead of night.  That's not very interactive.
<P>
They've also got a technique set up so that you can bet, again all on your cable bill, up until four seconds before face off, tip off, kick off, whatever it is, you can bet by hitting a button, just like ordering a movie in a hotel room. But even a year ago in magazines like <I>Wired,</I> the hip information highway magazines, we were talking a lot about interactive, and it's gone. It's gone as far as cable is concerned; that's out of the question. And <I>Wired</I> completely missed this point Im making here. These magazines are hip but spiritually speaking, theyre owned by Disney, too.
<P>
The vision of the reactionary right is very clear.  It's a safe suburb surrounded by a high wall and private police force and a beautiful golf course and lots of speeches about American initiative, and the rich know what to do with money and the poor don't.  I mean, the argument about welfare is absurd. First of all, the amount of money that's given to the poor in this country is very small compared to the amount of money that's given to the defense industries and the farmers and people just being able to take deductions on their mortgages. 
<P>
But the notion that somehow money in the hands of the poor corrupts them, but money in the hands of the rich enobles them is, on it's face, foolish. But this rhetoric is being sold, just like a product. So, my point is that the vision on the right is clear.  They have an idea of what they want America to look like, and it is like a well-defended suburb with a lot of rules about how high you can grow your trees and what color you can paint your garage and what names you can give your dog, and so on.
<P>
The people on the left--there isn't any left anymore--but the people of a more liberal turn of mind have yet to articulate what it is that they're working toward, what is it that you want, what do you believe in, what do you see.  There's no vision among the Democrats, and there really hasn't been for twenty years as far as I can see.  So, if we don't mount a counter--you can't beat something with nothing.  And the right makes fun of people like me and properly so because where is our vision, what are we going toward, what do we want?
<P>
<I>Larry Abramson:</I>  I'm Larry Abramson from National Public Radio. I have to wonder whether the logic that you're articulating here really isn't telling people that, well, the big guys are going to push all of these choices down our throats and we don't really have any choice, so there's really nothing we can do. Doesnt your argument call for a kind of passivity rather than saying that individual resistence and expression really are important and people should seize these choices?
<P>
<I>Lewis Lapham:</I> Yes, I'm sorry I've given the wrong impression. Yes, of course you have a lot of choice, and you have to be active about it. The advertising business does work, the Disney Land technique does work.  So, it is a formidable force. In order to combat it, in order to say, I won't have a television in the house or you can't look at that show or I choose not to believe what I read in the <I>New York Times</I> and instead I will believe what I read in <I>The Nation</I> or <I>The Progressive</I> or <I>Harper's</I> Magazine, or I can talk back to the <I>Times</I> or <I>The Nation,</I> I can write them letters, I can speak up, or I can set up media literacy classes in schools and teach people how to watch media actively instead of passively, teach independent thinking--all this requires an act of intelligence and an act of decision. 

I agree with you, that's our only hope. That's what I'm counting on as the editor of <I>Harper's</I> Magazine.  That's what I assume the news directors in this room count on, but it's a minority and it's a minority that's not supported very well by our society. You find individuals here and there. They need to be excited and encouraged to pay attention. It's hard to bring people up to that attention point.  I utterly agree with your faith in the individual act of refusal or expression or however you want to define it.  I think that those kinds of people and those kinds of acts have to be encouraged.

If Martin Luther King were to reappear by my side today and give us a report card on the last 25 years, what would he say?  "You did a good job," he would say, "voting for and electing people who formerly were not electable because of the color of their skin." He would say, "You have more political power and that is good.  You did a good job," he would say, "letting people who have the ability to do so live wherever they want to live, go wherever they want to go in this great country." He would say, "You did a good job elevating people of color up the ranks of the US armed forces to the very top and into top levels of the US government.  You did a good job," he would say, "creating a black middle class of people who are really doing well.  You did a good job opening up opportunity."
<P>
"But," he would say, "I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed.  I did not live and die to see 13-year-old boys get automatic weapons and gun down 9-year-olds just for the kick of it.  I did not live and die to see people destroy their own lives with drugs and build drug fortunes destroying the lives of others.  That is not what I came here to do.  I fought for freedom," he would say, "but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandon, not for the freedom of children to impregnate each other with babies and then abandon them, nor for the freedom of adult fathers of children to walk away from the children they created and abandon them, as if they didn't amount to anything." 
<P>
He would say, "This is not what I lived and died for.  I fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people.  I did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people on a daily basis."
<P>
The other day, the mayor of Baltimore, a dear friend of mine, told me a story of visiting the family of an 18-year-old young man who had been killed on Halloween.  He had a bunch of little kids along with him.  He always went out with the little-bitty ones so they could trick or treat safely.  And across the street from where they were walking on Halloween, a 14-year-old boy gave a 13-year-old boy a gun and dared him to shoot the 18-year-old my friend was walking with--and he shot him dead.
<P>
Elsewhere, right here in Washington DC--the symbol of freedom throughout the world--look at how that freedom is being exercised.  The <I>Washington Post</I> had a story about an 11-year-old child planning her own funeral.  "These are the hymns I want sung.  This is the dress I want to wear in my coffin.  I know I'm not going to live very long." 
<P>
That is not freedom--the freedom to die before you're a teenager is not what Martin Luther King lived and died for.  If you had told anybody who was here in this church--where Martin Luther King gave his last speech before he was assassinated--that we would have abused our freedom this way, they would have found it hard to believe.  
<P>
And I tell you it is our moral duty to turn this around.
<P>
There are changes we can make from the outside in--those are the job of the President of the United States and the Congress and the governors and state legislators and mayors, raising standards, community policing.  And there is something each of us here can do--from the inside out--and in the spirit of my faith I count myself as one of you to turn this thing around from the inside out as well as the outside in.  Otherwise the outside changes won't matter.  
<P>
Sometimes, there are no answers from the outside in.  Sometimes, the answers have to come from the values and the love and the stirrings and the voices that speak to us from within.  
<P>
Here, you as the respected leaders and ministers of your faith, play a crucial role.
<P>
From the outside, we're doing our best, but I do not believe we can repair the basic fabric of society until people who are willing to work <I>have</I> work.  Work organizes life.  It gives structure and discipline to life.  It gives meaning and self-esteem to people who are parents.  It gives a role model to children.... We cannot repair the American community and restore the American family until we have the structure, the values, the discipline, and the reward that work gives us....
<P>
... We have to make a partnership--all the government agencies, all the business folks.  But where there are no families, where there is no order, where we have lost jobs because we had to reduce the size of the armed forces after the end of the cold war, who will be there to give structure, role-modeling, discipline, love, and hope to these children? 
<P>
You must do that and we will help you.
<P>
The Scripture says, "You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world," that "if your light shines before men, they will give glory to the Father in Heaven." That is what we must do.  That is what we must do.  And I will work with you.

<P>

Editors Note: The <I>New York Times</I> editorial regarding this speech quickly jumped beyond the President's most important point--his call to ministers in community leadership to lead from the inside out, "otherwise the outside changes wont matter." The editorial pompously insisted on having absolute specifics of "outside" programs, made no mention of the inspirational import of the speech in the face of an intractable problem, and did not seem to realize who the President was talking to. 
<P>
Despite the sour editorial, at least the <I>Times</I> ran extended excerpts of the Memphis speech, the only newspaper to do so. The concept of the speech did not lend itself to the technological restrictions of sound-bite news and so not even sound bites were broadcast. There is reason to believe that if President Clinton's words had been more widely reported, some of the wind might have been taken out of the sails of Louis Farrakhan.
<P> 
There is a question here: If we pay the President a large salary to do such things as lead the nation by means of exortation in responsible speeches, are we not being shortchanged if the media is incapable of reporting on his work comprehensively?
<P>
Much to the credit of the rank-and-file Timesman, the same day the <I>Times</I> editorial appeared Douglas Jehl in the straight news section of the paper covered the speech this way:
<P>
"In Memphis today President Clinton broke out of the pattern of political speeches, of the expected and the calculated.  He spoke from within himself, responding in emotional terms to the appalling reality of violence in this country today.  The response he got shows that one thing Americans want a President to do is to speak out about wrongs, not always to have a 10-point plan or a graph but to <I>speak.</I> No one person can solve our problems of social decay but this President has made us face them. 
<P>
A tree falls in the forest.....?

... <font size=5>I</font size=5> would like to say something to the paramilitary groups and to others who
believe the greatest threat to America comes not from terrorists from within our country or beyond
our borders, but from our own government.
<P>
I want to say this to the militias and to others who believe this, to those nearby and those far away: I
am well aware that most of you have never violated the law of the land. I welcome the comments
that some of you have made recently condemning the bombing in Oklahoma City. I believe you have
every right, indeed you have the responsibility, to question our government when you disagree with
its policies. And I will do everything in my power to protect your right to do so.
<P>
But I also know there have been law-breakers among those who espouse your philosophy. I know
from painful personal experience as a governor of a state who lived through the cold-blooded killing
of a young sheriff and a young African-American state trooper who were friends of mine by people
who espouse the view that the government was the biggest problem in America and that peopole
had a right to take violence into their own hands.
<P>
So I ask you to hear me now. It is one thing to believe that the federal government has too much
power and to work within the law to reduce it. It is quite another to break the law of the land and
threaten to shoot officers of the law if all they do is their duty to uphold it.
<P>
It is one thing to believe we are taxed too much and work to reduce the tax burden. It is quite
another to refuse to pay your taxes, though your neighbor pays his. It is one thing to believe we are
over-regulated and to work to lessen the burden of regulation. It is quite another to slander our
dedicated public servants, our brave police officers, even our rescue workers who have been called
a hostile army of occupation.
<P>
This is a very free country. Those of you in the militia movements have broader rights here than you
would in any other country in the entire world. 
<P>
Do people who work for the government sometimes make mistakes? Of course they do. They are
human. Almost every American has some experience with this--a rude tax collector, an arbitrary
regulator, an insensitive social worker, an abusive law officer. As long as human beings make up our
government there will be mistakes. But our Constitution was established by Americans determined
to limit those abuses. And think of the limits--the Bill of Rights, the separation of powers, access to
the courts, the right to take your case to the country through the media, and the right to vote people
in or out of office on a regular basis.
<P>
But there is no right to resort to violence when you don't get your way. There is no right to kill
people who are doing their duty, or minding their own
business, or children who are innocent in every way. Those are the people who perished in
Oklahoma City. And those who claim such rights are wrong and un-American. 
<P>
Whenever in our history people have believed that violence is a legitimate extension of politics they
have been wrong. In the 1960s, many good things happened and
there was much turmoil. But the Weathermen of the radical left who resorted to violence in the
1960s were wrong. Today, the gang members who use life on the mean streets of America, as
terrible as it is, to justify taking the law into their own hands and taking innocent life are wrong. The
people who came to the United States to bomb the World Trade Center were wrong.
<P>
Freedom of political speech will never justify violence--never. Our founding fathers created a
system of laws in which reason could prevail over fear. Without respect for this law there is no
freedom. 
<P>
So I say this to the militias and all others who believe that the greatest threat to freedom comes from
the government instead of from those who would take away our freedom: If you say violence is an
acceptable way to make change, you are wrong. If you say that government is in a conspiracy to
take your freedom away, you are just plain wrong. 
<P>
If you treat law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line for your safety every day like
some kind of enemy army to be suspected, derided and, if they should enforce the law against you,
to be shot, you are wrong.  If you appropriate our sacred symbols for paranoid
purposes and compare yourselves to colonial militias who fought for the democracy you now rail
against, you are wrong. 
<P>
How dare you suggest that we in the freest nation on Earth live in tyranny. How dare you call
yourselves patriots and heroes.
<P>
I say to you, all of you, the members of the Class of 1995, there is nothing patriotic about hating
your country, or pretending that you can love your country but despise your government. There is
nothing heroic about turning your back on America, or ignoring your own responsibilities. If you
want to preserve your own freedom, you must stand up for the freedom of others with whom you
disagree. But you also must stand up for the rule of law. You cannot have one without the other.
<P>
The real American heroes today are the citizens who get up every morning and have the courage to
work hard and play by the rules--the mother who stays up the extra half hour after a long day's
work to read her child a story; the rescue worker who digs with his hands in the rubble as the
building crumbles about him; the neighbor who lives side-by-side with people different from himself;
the government worker who quietly and efficiently labors to see to it that the programs we depend
on are honestly and properly carried out; most of all, the parent who works long years for modest
pay and sacrifices so that his or her children can have the education that you have had, and the
chances you are going to have. 
<P>
I ask you never to forget that . . . .

     The 29-year-old currently works for Senator Lauch Faircloth. 
Previously, he served as the national youth director in Senator
Robert Dole's 1988 presidential campaign. In 1992, he became the
executive director of Floyd Brown's Presidential Victory Committee
which produced an ad and a 1-800 number with recordings of Gennifer
Flowers' alleged conversations with Bill Clinton.  Floyd Brown also
worked on Dole's 1988 campaign as the Midwest political director
but is most famous for creating the Willie Horton commercial that
helped sink the Dukakis campaign. In May 1994, Bossie claimed to be
working sixteen hours a day on Whitewater.  <P>
<HR>
<h4><center><B>Additional Information on David
Bossie</B></center></h4>
<HR>
<B>Bossie held August 1994 impeachment press conference with
Howard Phillips.</b> On August 10, 1994 David Bossie -- who
was identified as "Director of Government Relations and
Communications for Citizens United" along with Howard Phillips
chairman of the Conservative Caucus held a press conference
addressing the "Latest Whitewater Developments, Impeachment
Possibility."<br>
<I>
Citizens United press release, 8/10/94</I><P>

At the press conference, Bossie said he would present Jack
Brooks, the House Judiciary Committee chairman with petitions
with 10,000 signatures calling for impeachment hearings. Phillips
said he would present Brooks with 26,000 petitions calling for
Clinton's impeachment. Bossie was also highly critical of Robert
Fiske at this press conference.<br>

<I>Gannett News, 8/10/94     </I><P>

<B>Columbia Journalism Review described Bossie in May
1994.</B> In May 1994, Trudy Lieberman, a senior editor at
Consumer Reports wrote: "Bossie, the twenty-eight-year-old
political director for Citizens United, a conservative Republican
operation, runs an information factory whose Whitewater
production lines turn out a steady stream of tips, tidbits,
documents, factoids, suspicions, and story ideas for the nation's
press and for Republicans on Capitol Hill.  Journalists and Hill
Republicans have recycled much of the information provided by
Citizens United into stories that have cast a shadow on the
Clinton presidency."<br>

<I> Columbia Journalism Review, May/June 1994</I><P>

The article also described him as a "source par excellence to
journalists dredging the Whitewater swamp" who claims to get
eighteen calls an hour.<br>

<I>Columbia Journalism Review, May/June1994</I><P>

<B>In 1992 Brown & Bossie harassed the family of a suicide
victim.</B> In April, 1992, 30 news organizations received "an
anonymous and
untraceable letter" by fax "claiming Clinton had had an affair
with a former law student who committed suicide 15 years ago."
Floyd Brown attempted to link Clinton to the 1977 suicide of
this, "emotionally distraught young woman, seven-months
pregnant," Susan Coleman.<br>

<I> CBS Evening News, 7/13/92</I><P>

Brown's associates "repeatedly contacted the woman's family in an
unsuccessful attempt to confirm the charges." <br>

<I>San Francisco Chronicle, 7/28/92; "CBS Evening News,"
7/13/92</I><P>

Bossie and ex-DC police officer Jim Murphy questioned Susan
Coleman's mother and her husband as well as her friends. They
even tried to find out what was in Susan's suicide note. 
<br>
<I>"CBS Evening News," 7/13/92</I><P>

Bossie and Murphy followed Susan's mother to an Army hospital in
Augusta, GA where her husband was being treated for a stroke.
They "burst into the sick man's room and began questioning the
shaken mother about her daughter's suicide."<br>

<I>CBS Evening News, 7/13/92</I><P>

 <B>Bossie & NBC executive producer chased Schaffer around
Fayetteville.</B>  In January 1994, Brown's associate, David Bossie
was seen with
NBC network producer Ira Silverman attempting to interview former
Arkansas state Banking Commissioner Beverly
Bassett 
Schaffer. Silverman admitted using Bossie for background
information, but
denied working together on the interview. Schaffer's husband said
the two "jumped out from behind [a] car... [and] chased her
through the streets." <br>

<I>Chicago Tribune, 3/27/94; Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,
1/20/94</I><P>

Beverly Bassett Schaffer said she was "ambushed" and then
"stalked" around Fayetteville by Bossie and Silverman. Schaffer
said that her car was rushed twice by Silverman, an NBC camera
crew, and Bossie.<br>

<I> The Fayetteville Morning News, 1/15/92</I><P>
         
Silverman said, "I talk to them [Brown and Bossie] along with
everyone else. Back in October and November it was difficult to
develop sources." <br>

<I>Columbia Journalism Review, 5-6/94</I><P>

<B>Bossie claimed to be fueling Whitewater.</B> In May
1994, Bossie said that "Citizens United" had provided Whitewater
information to "the top fifty major publications, networks, and
editorial boards... We've provided the same material on the Hill
both on the House and Senate side." Bossie also claimed that he
would have gladly provided documents to Democrats, but they
haven't asked.<br>
 
<I>Columbia Journalism Review, May/June 1994</I><P>

<B>Bossie praised Brown... called politics a "full contact
sport."</B>  In 1994, Brown claimed that he was harsher and
meaner than most in politics and Bossie said, "That's right,
Stick and jab. Stick and jab and keep on moving. Politics. It's
definitely a
full-contact sport."<br>

<I>New York Times, 4/24/94  </I><P>

<B> Chicago Tribune described Bossie in March 1994.</B>
In March 1994, Carol Jouzaitis of the Chicago Tribune wrote of
Bossie, "The researcher, David Bossie, harvests tales of alleged
wrongdoings from a network of Clinton enemies, then peddles them
to Capitol Hill and media contacts in hopes of prompting
scandalous stories."<br>

<I>Chicago Tribune, 3/27/94</I><P>

<B>Time described Bossie's dirt-digging in January 1994.</B>  
 In January 1994, Time magazine wrote, "Brown's associate,
David Bossie has been to Little Rock several times digging for
dirt. Evidently some Whitewater tale tellers prefer to deal with
Brown & Co., figuring Brown can be trusted to protect their
sources.<br>

<I>Time, 1/24/94</I><P>

In mid-January Time reported that Floyd Brown was covertly
feeding information and "hard-to-find" documents to reporters and
Hill Republicans looking into Whitewater. Time said that David
Bossie had been to Little Rock several times "digging for dirt."
Evidently, some Whitewater "tale tellers" prefer to deal with
Brown and Bossie "figuring Brown can be trusted to protect their
sources."<br>

 <PRE>    </PRE>
<font size=5>I</font size=5>n the flap over Larry Pratt and other unsavory characters
associated with the Patrick Buchanan campaign, journalists have
typically framed the question: Is Buchanan linked to extremists and
bigots?  But there is a more basic question journalists should ask:
Is Patrick Buchanan himself an extremist and bigot? 
 <P>
Here is a sampling of Buchanan's views:  <PRE>    </PRE>

ON AFRICAN-AMERICANS :
 <P>
On race relations in the late 1940s and early 1950s: "There were no
politics to polarize us then, to magnify every slight. The
'negroes' of Washington had their public schools, restaurants,
bars, movie houses, playgrounds and churches; and we had ours."
(<I>Right from the Beginning,</I> Buchanan's 1988 autobiography, p. 131) 
 <P>
In a column sympathetic to ex-Klansman David Duke, Buchanan chided the Republican Party for overreacting to Duke and his Nazi
"costume": "Take a hard look at Duke's portfolio of winning issues
and expropriate those not in conflict with GOP principles, [such
as] reverse discrimination against white folks." (syndicated
column, 2/25/89)
<P>
Buchanan, who opposed virtually every civil rights law and court
decision of the last 30 years, published FBI smears of Martin
Luther King Jr. as his own editorials in the <I>St. Louis Globe
Democrat</I> in the mid-1960s. "We were among Hoover's conduits to the American people," he boasted (<I>Right from the Beginning,</I> p. 283). <P> 
White House advisor Buchanan urged President Nixon in an April 1969 memo not to visit "the Widow King" on the first anniversary of
Martin Luther King's assassination, warning that a visit would
"outrage many, many people who believe Dr. King was a fraud and a
demagogue and perhaps worse.... Others consider him the Devil
incarnate. Dr. King is one of the most divisive men in contemporary
history." (<I>New York Daily News,</I> 10/1/90)
 <P>
In a memo to President Nixon, Buchanan suggested that "integration
of blacks and whites -- but even more so, poor and well-to-do -- is
less likely to result in accommodation than it is in perpetual
friction, as the incapable are placed consciously by government 
side by side with the capable." (<I>Washington Post,</I> 1/5/92)
 <P>
In another memo from Buchanan to Nixon: "There is a legitimate
grievance, in my view, of white working-class people that every time,
on every issue,  the black militants loud-mouth it, we come up
with more money.... If we can give 50 Phantoms [jet fighters] to
the Jews, and a multi-billion dollar welfare program for the
blacks...why not help the Catholics save their collapsing school
system?" (<I>Boston Globe,</I> 1/4/92)
 <P>
Buchanan has repeatedly insisted that President Reagan did so much
for African-Americans that civil rights groups have no reason to
exist: "George Bush should have told the [NAACP convention] that
black America has grown up; that the NAACP should close up shop,
that its members should go home and reflect on JFK's admonition:
'Ask not what your country can do for you, but rather ask what you
can do for your country.'" (syndicated column, 7/26/88) 
 <P>
Trying to justify apartheid in South Africa, he denounced the
notion that "white rule of a black majority is inherently wrong.
Where did we get that idea?  The Founding Fathers did not believe
this." (syndicated column, 2/7/90) He referred admiringly to the
apartheid regime as the "Boer Republic": "Why are Americans
collaborating in a U.N. conspiracy to ruin her with sanctions?"
(syndicated column, 9/17/89)
 <P>
After Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun blocked a federal patent for a
Confederate flag insignia, Buchanan wrote that she was "putting on
an act" by associating the Confederacy with slavery: "The War
Between the States was about independence, about self-
determination, about the right of a people to break free of a
government to which they could no longer give allegiance," Buchanan asserted.  "How long is this endless groveling before every cry of 'racism' going to continue before the whole country collectively throws up?" (syndicated column, 7/28/93)
<PRE>    </PRE>
ON IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR:
 <P>
Buchanan on affirmative action: "How, then, can the Feds justify
favoring sons of Hispanics over sons of white Americans who fought 
in World War II or Vietnam?" (syndicated column, 1/23/95)
 <P>
In a September 1993 speech to the Christian Coalition, Buchanan
described multiculturalism as "an across-the-board assault on our
Anglo-American heritage."
 <P>
"If we had to take a million immigrants in, say Zulus, next year,
or Englishmen, and put them up in Virginia, what group would be
easier to assimilate and would cause less problems for the people
of Virginia?" ("This Week With David Brinkley," 1/8/91) 

<PRE>   </PRE>                         
ON JEWS:
 <P>
Writing of "group fantasies of martyrdom," Buchanan challenged the
historical record that thousands of Jews were gassed to death by
diesel exhaust at Treblinka: "Diesel engines do not emit enough
carbon monoxide to kill anybody." (<I>New Republic,</I> 10/22/90)
Buchanan's columns have run in the <A HREF="carto.htm">Liberty Lobby's <I>Spotlight,</I></A> the
<I>German-American National PAC Newsletter</I> and other publications that claim Nazi death camps are a Zionist concoction.
 <P>
In a 1977 column, Buchanan said that despite Hitler's anti-Semitic
and genocidal tendencies, he was "an individual of great
courage...Hitler's success was not based on his extraordinary gifts
alone. His genius was an intuitive sense of the mushiness, the
character flaws, the weakness masquerading as morality that was in
the hearts of the statesmen who stood in his path." (<I>The Guardian,</I>
1/14/92)
<P>
Buchanan referred to Capitol Hill as "Israeli-occupied territory."
(<I>St. Louis Post Dispatch,</I> 10/20/90)
 <P>
During the Gulf crisis: "There are only two groups that are beating
the drums for war in the Middle East--the Israeli defense
ministry and its 'amen corner' in the United States." ("McLaughlin
Group," 8/26/90) 
 <P>
Buchanan called for closing the U.S. Justice Department's Office of
Special Investigations, which prosecuted Nazi war criminals,
because it was "running down 70-year-old camp guards." (<I>New York
Times,</I> 4/21/87)
 <P>
Buchanan was vehement in pushing President Reagan--despite
protests--to visit Germany's Bitburg cemetery, where Nazi SS
troops were buried.  At a White House meeting, Buchanan reportedly
reminded Jewish leaders that they were "Americans first"--and
repeatedly scrawled the phrase "Succumbing to the pressure of the
Jews" in his notebook.  Buchanan was credited with crafting Ronald
Reagan's line that the SS troops buried at Bitburg were "victims
just as surely as the victims in the concentration camps." (<I>New
York Times</I>, 5/16/85; <I>New Republic,</I> 1/22/96)
 <P>
After Cardinal O'Connor criticized anti-Semitism during the
controversy over construction of a convent near Auschwitz, Buchanan wrote: "If U.S. Jewry takes the clucking appeasement of the
Catholic cardinalate as indicative of our submission, it is
mistaken. When Cardinal O'Connor of New York seeks to soothe the
always irate Elie Wiesel by reassuring him 'there are many
Catholics who are anti-Semitic'...he speaks for himself. Be not
afraid, Your Eminence; just step aside, there are bishops and
priests ready to assume the role of defender of the faith." (<I>New
Republic,</I> 10/22/90)
 <P>
In his September 1993 speech to the Christian Coalition, Buchanan
declared: "Our culture is superior.  Our culture is superior
because our religion is Christianity and that is the truth that
makes men free." (<I>ADL Report,</I> 1994)
<P>
The Buchanan '96 campaign's World Wide Web site included an article blaming the death of White House aide Vincent Foster on the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad--and alleging that Foster and Hillary Clinton were Mossad spies. (The campaign removed the article in mid-February 1996 after its existence was reported.)
  <PRE>     </PRE>
ON GAYS: 
 <P>
In a 1972 memo to Richard Nixon, Buchanan referred to one of George McGovern's leading financial contributors as a "screaming fairy."  (<I>Newsday,</I> 2/8/89)  Buchanan has repeatedly used the term "sodomites," and has referred to gays as "the pederast proletariat." (<I>Washington Post,</I> 2/9/92)
 <P>
 
In a 1977 column urging a "thrashing" of gay groups, Buchanan
wrote: "Homosexuality is not a civil right.  Its rise almost always
is accompanied, as in the Weimar Republic, with a decay of society
and a collapse of its basic cinder block, the family." (<I>New
Republic,</I> 3/30/92) 
 <P>
"Gay rights activists seek to substitute, for laws rooted in Judeo-
Christian morality, laws rooted in the secular humanist belief that
all consensual sexual acts are morally equal.  That belief is anti-
biblical and amoral; to codify it into law is to codify a lie."
(Buchanan column in <I>Wall Street Journal,</I> 1/21/93) 
 <P>
On AIDS, Buchanan wrote in 1983: "The poor homosexuals--they have declared war upon nature, and now nature is extracting an awful retribution (AIDS)." (<I>Los Angeles Times,</I> 11/28/86)  Later that year, he demanded that New York City Ed Koch and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo cancel the Gay Pride Parade or else "be held personally responsible for the spread of the AIDS plague."  "With 80,000 dead
of AIDS, our promiscuous homosexuals appear literally hell-bent on
Satanism and suicide," Buchanan wrote in 1990 (syndicated column,
10/17/90).  In the 1992 campaign, he declared: "AIDS is nature's
retribution for violating the laws of nature." (<I>Seattle Times,</I>
7/31/93)
 <PRE>    </PRE>
ON WOMEN:
 <P>
"Rail as they will about 'discrimination,' women are simply not
endowed by nature with the same measures of single-minded ambition and the will to succeed in the fiercely competitive world of 
Western capitalism." (syndicated column, 11/22/83)
   <P>
"The real liberators of American women were not the feminist 
noise-makers, they were the automobile, the supermarket, the 
shopping center, the dishwasher, the washer-dryer, the 
freezer." (<I>Right from the Beginning,</I> p. 149) 
<PRE>    </PRE>

ON DEMOCRACY:
 <P>
Attacking what he considers the "democratist temptation, the
worship of democracy as a form of governance," Buchanan commented: "Like all idolatries, democratism substitutes a false god for the real, a love of process for a love of country." (Patrick J. Buchanan: <I>From the Right,</I> newsletter, Spring/90)
 <P>
In a January, 1991 column, Buchanan suggested that "quasi-dictatorial rule" might be the solution to the problems of big municipalities and the federal fiscal crisis: "If the people are corrupt, the more democracy, the worse the government." (<I>Washington Times,</I> 1/9/91)  He has written disparagingly of the "one man, one vote Earl Warren system."
<P> 
In his autobiography, <I>Right from the Beginning,</I> Buchanan refers to Spanish dictator Francisco Franco as a "Catholic savior."  He called Franco, along with Chile's Gen. Pinochet, "soldier-patriots."  (syndicated column 9/17/89).  Both men overthrew democracy in their countries.
 <P>
Buchanan devotes a chapter of his autobiography--"As We Remember Joe" --to defending Senator Joseph McCarthy. He advocated that Nixon "burn the tapes" during Watergate, and he criticized Reagan for failing to pardon Oliver North over Iran-contra.
<P> 
Buchanan, shortly before he announced he was running for president
in 1995: "You just wait until 1996, then you'll see a real right-
wing tyrant." (<I>The Nation,</I> 6/26/95)

Willis Carto has been called a "shadowy figure" who is "largely responsible for the preservation of anti-Semitism as a movement,"  according to the Center for Democratic Renewal (CDR), formerly known as the National Anti-Klan Network.  The CDR's publication "When Hate Groups Come to Town" (1992), briefly discusses Carto and some of his web of organizations which are used to disseminate anti-Semitism and racism.  Carto has most recently received notoriety in the May 15, 1994 <I>Los Angeles Times</I> for his fisticuffs in an attempted take-over of the offices of the Institute for Historical Reviw (IHR), the leading Holocaust-denial organization in the world.
<P>
Carto has long been attracted to radical extremism, first in the McCarthy era, battling the nebulous "Communist conspiracy," and later as the founder of many organizations and businesses which were--or are--involved in spreading white supremacist racism and anti-Semitism.
<P>
What follows is as complete a listing as exists, to this writer's knowledge, as to the extent of Carto's web of hate-mongering activities.
<P>
In the 1950s, Carto joined the John Birch Society, but was ousted by its founder Robert Welch after disputes arose--in short order--between them. In 1954, Carto served as Director of the "Congress of Freedom".  He supported the "Joint Council for Repatriation," 
a "Back-to-Africa" white racist group. He was affiliated with the racist "National Alliance for White People," as well as "Americans for National Security," the "United Congressional Appeal," and the "Save our Schools" group.  All of the aforementioned were rabidly white supremacist, anti-civil rights, racist organizations. 
<P>
Carto served as the Regional Vice-President of the "We, The People" group and was active in the "Government Educational Foundation."  In 1968, he backed George Wallace when Wallace ran for President, running a highly racist-laced campaign favoring segregation and denouncing civil rights efforts.  Carto took over the "Youth for Wallace" group and founded its successor, the "National Youth Alliance."
<P>
The common theme woven throught Carto's organzations and their publications were/are code words, heavily laced with the typical paranoid conspiracy theories alleging an ongoing, supposedly secret history to the world involving an extended, centuries-old plot by Jews to take over the world, destroy Christianity, destroy the Constitution, and enslave gentiles to do the work of a Jewish elite who would rule the world, as per (Christian interpreted) Biblical prophecies.  According to the conspiracy-minded writers, this plot extended back in time to include the Knights Templars, the Illuminati, Freemasons, Jacobins, and other similar "secret societies."   
<P>
In the more "modern" version of the plot line, the conspirators inevitably turned out to be alternately labeled the Jews, Zionists, international bankers (who had Jewish sounding names), monied elites (who were considered the "super-Capitalists"), and secret "cabals" with various ominous-sounding names.
<P>
It is a tortured effort to try to get at how and when anti-Semitism began to permeate these conspiracy theories.  For our purposes, it is important to know that the evolution and disseimination of these theories do indeed have a "genealogy"--including such figures as Henry Ford.

For now, howver,  we will focus on Willis Carto who bought into contemporary (<I>today's</I>) American scene these earlier anti-Semitic (and increasingly white supremacist) conspiracy fairy-tales.  Along with the anti-Semitism of the more recent Christian origins, ran the German nationalist (Nazi) idea of the so-called "Aryan supremacy."  (To set the record straight, "Aryan" refers to a language group, and the only Aryan-speaking people in Hitler's Europe were the  Gypsies, whom he promptly sent to the gas chambers.  So much for the precision of language used by those who called themselves Aryans to describe the Aryan race.)
<P>
The theme of white (or "Aryan") supremacy is infused throughout Carto's hate-mongering affiliations.  You just have to know that words like "Zionist," "international bankers," "ZOG," (Zionist Occupational Government). "alien other," and other similar code-words, all mean the same thing to the Cartos of the world:  that the Jews were/are behind an alleged conspiracy to take over the world and create the ever-fabled one-world government.
<P>
In addition to other far-right-leaning organizations and entities, Carto founded the organization "Liberty and Property" in the 1950s, serving
variously as writer and executive secretary.  "Liberty and Property's"
publications included <I>Right</I> which was viciously anti-Semitic and continued with the same old anti-Semitic lies that "internationalist bankers were in cahoots to finance the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the development of and spread of Communism, socialism," etc....(Read <I>Blood In the Face</I> by James Ridgeway, 1990). 

<P> Another publication Carto founded was called <I>Truth Seeker</I>, an ironic choice for a name, considering the lies it contained.   <I>Right</I> was a monthly newsletter which attacked the National
States Rights Party in the 1950s. 

<P> In addition to being anti-Semitic, and (WARNING! codeword) anti-Zionist, <I>Right</I> promoted Denis Fahey's and Gertrude Coogan's conspiracy tales as well. 
<P>
Fahey wrote <I>The Mystical Body of Christ in the Modern World</I>, published in 1935 & 1938, which promoted the idea of the U.S. as a Christian nation-state, in this case, Catholic.  Gertrude Coogan wrote "Money Creators", published in 1935 also, which contained nativist, xenophobic rants, suggesting the money supply was being controlled by "alien outsiders" [the Jews, again, already!] and that the Constitution did not provide for the establishment of a national
bank, i.e., the Federal Reserve Bank, which Coogan considered illegal as well as part of a plot by international bankers to control America's (and the world's) economy.]  Whew!  Did ya' get all that?
<P>
In 1955, Carto founded the "Liberty Lobby", which was similar to "Liberty and Property" in scope and tenor, opposing civil rights laws, and promoting neo-Fascism.  Liberty Lobby's publications included "Liberty Letter," which was similar to <I>Right,</I>  "Liberty Lowdown,"  a two-page bulletin, and "Liberty Ledger" which rated senators and representatives according to Carto's particular agenda. 
<P>
<P> Other Carto/Liberty Lobby newsletters or journals include "Zionist Watch" which was virulently (WARNING!  codeword!) anti-Zionist (as opposed to the less-fashionable "anti-Semitic" or barely
less-inflammatory, "anti-Israel") which later was renamed the less-truthful and more enigmatic title,  "New America View."  
<P>
Carto took over ownership of the twice-monthly newsletter, the "Washington Observer" and founded the pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic "Western Destiny" in 1964. In Western Destiny, Carto promoted pro-eugenics notions borrowed from his idol, Francis Parker Yockey, as well as eugenicist, Osward Spengler, author or <I>Decline of the West</I> (1918) and <I>The Hour of Decision</I> (1934).  
<P>
In 1966, Carto acquired "The American Mercury" which up to that time had been a mainstream, venerable publication.  Under Carto's leadership, it now promoted the all-too-familiar Carto ideology of anti-Semitic, racist conspiracy theories.  (I'm beginning to sound redundant using those terms, however, Carto has sued writers who have described his writings and organizations as such, claiming libel, and Carto lost every time, and indeed in one instance, the Court itself declared Carto and the Liberty Lobby racist and anti-Semitic.  I have the case-law citation if anyone would like to have it).
<P>
Carto founded the "Legion for Survival of Freedom (though it is Elizabeth Carto's name on the filing papers for the organization.  Elizabeth is Willis's German-born Nazi wife.)  The "Legion..."  is an umbrella organization which owns  "Noontide Press," a publishing company which sells racist, anti-Semitic, conspiracy-oriented books and pamphlets, and "The Institute for Historical Review (IHR), located in Torrance, California.  The IHR is notorious for its Holocaust denial, even losing a $50,000 challenge "To anyone who can prove the Holocaust really happened."  Mel Mermelstein, represented by attorney Gloria Allred, took up the challenge and won in a court of law a settlement against the Institute for Historical Review for having proved exactly that.  He collected his $50,000 and court costs, as well, if I recall correctly.  
<P>
The IHR puts out two publications, the pseudo-scholarly "Journal of
Historical Review" and the "IHR Newsletter."  Both of these publications are widely distributed among neo-Nazi, Ku Klux Klan, white supremacist, and other racialist, anti-Semitic groups.  The IHR has been successful at spreading its Holocaust-denial in the name of "free speech" and "hearing both sides" of the Holocaust "story."  Tom Marcellus, Fred Leuchter, and David Irving are some of the people associated with this hodge-podge of pseudo-history. 
<P>
The tactics employed by Holocaust deniers include fabricating voluminous research, heavily loaded with others' pseudo-scholarly citations, which deny both the numbers of Jews killed and even the various methods used in their destruction at the hands of the Nazis.  The goal of the Holocaust deniers seems to be (1)  to downplay the historic fact of Christian animosity toward the Jews and (2)  to deny the actual fact of Hitler's war-within-a-war, waged with the specific intent to eradicate the Jews completely. 
<P>

The Institute for Historical Review denies that gas chambers were actually used for gassing; denies that 6 million Jews were systematically exterminated by the Nazis; that Hitler knew of and ordered the "Final Solution"; and the IHR disputes various other voluminously documented facts regarding Nazi doctrines, policies, and actions.  Fred Leuchter's so-called "Leuchter Report" has been so thoroughly debunked, it ceases to even raise an eyebrow, except among the vulnerable, unsophisticated, uneducated nitwits who like to have their (version of) Truths handed up to them as Verities.  
<P>
Deborah Lipstadt's <I>Denying the Holocaust</I> does a marvelous job of debunking Leuchter, who has since had to admit in court that he isn't really an engineer and that he lied about/faked his "credentials."  In short, Leuchter wouldn't know a provable fact if it bit him on the head.  Thinking people know better.  
<P>
Carto's recent (May 15, 1994) dispute with the IHR was over tactics, whether the IHR should concentrate on denying the Holocaust or focus more on racist issues.  Carto wants the IHR to take a more low-key, more code-worded approach so as to entice the intellectually weak and/or lazy newcomers to their neo-Nazi ranks.  (More on the term 'neo' Nazi later.)
<P>
"Noontide Press" is the publishing house owned by Willis Carto and the Liberty Lobby, and which reprints otherwise out-of-print anti-Jewish, pro-Nazi tracts, books, and pamphlets.  Noontide is a major disseminator of hate literature and conspiracy-theory oriented books to racist hate groups in the U.S. It has also been linked to European, particularly German, hate groups and also does a brisk business in Canada.  Among Noontide's perennial publications is Francis Parker Yockey's <I>Imperium</I>, first published in 1949, reprinted by Noontide in 1969 & since.  
<P>
<I>Imperium</I> is a 600 page tome, an apologia for Hitler which blames the West for stopping Hitler before his plans for the Jews were completed, before Nazi "ethnic cleansing of the Jews" would solve all of Germany's problems.
<P>
Carto's other enterprises include "Liberty Library" which disseminates tapes and books and "Liberty Trust which sells commemorative coins and "patriotic" paraphernalia.  The "New American View" is/or was controlled by Carto's Liberty Lobby and is a source for anti-Zionist (read "anti-Jewish) propaganda. 

<PRE>    </PRE>

"THE SPOTLIGHT"
<P>
Liberty Lobby continues to print a tabloid-styled newspaper, originally called "National Spotlight" which was later re-named 
"The Spotlight."  This is a "National Enquirer"-styled weekly publication and is currently estimated to have a circulation of about 200,000.  "The Spotlight" relies heavily on anti-Federal government stories and conspiracy theories which frequently target the Federal Reserve Board as "unconstitutional," and blames the nation's problems on "Zionists," ZOG, the Council on Foreign Relations, the ADL (Anti-Defamation League), the Bilderbergers, ancient plots, recent immigration, and racial mixing, among other things.  Timothy McVeigh, the suspect being held for the Oklahoma City bombing, placed an ad in "The Spotlight" to sell armaments. The ADL credits "The Spotlight" as being the number-one source of hate-groups' ideas.
<P>
"Liberty Lobby" also has media access through its radio programs:  "This is Liberty Lobby" (now defunct), " Editor's Roundtable," and "Radio Free America."  These last two radio programs are/or were broadcast by the "Kayla Satellite Broadcasting Network."  The "Sun Radio Network" claimed it had 200 affiliates, as of 1992.   One of its headquarters was known as "North America One," broadcast via satellite from Richland Center, Wisconsin.  So far as I know, North America One is defunct, but I could be wrong on that.  
<P>
The remaining active radio affiliates feature interviews with conspiracy-minded
writers, survivalists, eugenics writers, rabid white supremacists, as well as the usual critics of the FBI, ATF, CIA, EPA, Dept. of the Interior, etc.  There is also a heavy contingent of 2nd Amendment gun rights spokemen who are interviewed as well.
<P>
"Radio Free America" (a very innocuous sounding name, right?) is a 2-3- hour radio call-in talk show, hosted by Tom Valentine.  Valentine is listed on the "Spotlight" as a Liberty Lobby regional director.  "Editor's Roundtable" is hosted by Vince Ryan.  Both of these programs promote the "Populist Party-line," Liberty Lobby propaganda, including some of the same rank lies that the militias believe in, for instance, "ominous black helicopters reportedly seen over the area," "Russian tanks on American soil," preparing for
the "orchestrated U.N. invasion of the U.S." (You have to tie your brain in knots to be idiot enough to believe this stuff.  There's a conspiracy theory lying under my bed, my pillow....)
<P>
[Editor's Note: S few months ago, a newsletter catering to the American Islamic community called "Islam Today" ran a front-page story with alarming information that U.S. troops, ordered by the Clinton adminsitration, were deployed in Chechnia. This is absurd. There have never been any U.S. troops in Chechnia. The "source" of this information was none other than "The Spotlight." The motivation of Carto is apparently to stir up resentment in the Islamic community toward the U.S. His tactic is effective. The woman who showed me the newsletter was outraged, ranting and raving about how terrible the U.S. is--especially Clinton--until I explained to her what "The Spotlight is and does.]
<P>
Incidents of alleged government abuses of power, such as the Randy Weaver case and the Ruby Ridge incident, Gordon Kahl, Waco, even Clinton's Whitewater problems, are frequent topics of the call-in radio talk shows. (Such incidents as REAL government foul-ups and abuses of power only add fodder to the conspiratorial-minded Carto-like ilk.)  Other topics include issues such as "takings rights," "property rights," and "state's rights," among others. 
<P>
In case you're too young to know what "states rights" means, ask
any Southerner and they'll tell you pretty quickly, "That's why we fought the Civil War, to retain our rights to determine for ourselves various laws and freedoms not specifically spelled out in the Constitution."  (Of course, those Southerners & others still hampered by racism will say that this means there shouldn't have been any federal "interference in southern rights to own slaves" in order to continue their "peculiar way-of-life,"  BTW, I'm a white southerner, and I say this without prejudice towards the south. That was the thinking and still is among those who are still rabidly racist.)
<P>
Willis Carto launched a version of the so-called "Populist Party" in 1986. This Populist Party became the haven for refugees from the KKK, neo-Nazi groups, and others.  The Populist Party fielded David Duke, a former KKK Grand Wizard, for its U.S. Presidential candidate, with James 'Bo' Gritzs VP candidacy in 1988.  Gritz was the Populist Candidate in the 1992 election. (Gritz is the model for the "Rambo" movies;   Gritz was the most decorated American in the Vietnam war.)  Carto parted company with the co-founder of the modern Populist Party, William K. Shearer, who went on to found the "American Independent Party."  The Carto-ite Populist Party puts out a newsletter called "The California Statesman." 
<P>
Willis Carto is now 67 or thereabouts.  During his life, he has been
intensively preoccupied with anti-Semitism, beginning during World War II, but especially after 1946, when Carto met Francis Parker Yockey.  Yockey was a minor official in some of the secondary War Crimes investigations & trials.  Yockey was a Nazi-sympathizer who was arrested in the U.S. for passport fraud (seems he had a few too many passports, in various names).   Willis Carto interviewed Yockey in jail, and in the Introduction to <I>Imperium",</I> Carto expressed his intense admiration, indeed, almost hero-worship of Yockey.  Yockey committed suicide while in jail and later Carto went on to publish <I>Imperium</I> through the Noontide Press publishing house Carto owns.  In the 35-page Intro, Carto gushed with his adoration of Yockey and his ideas.  
<P>
From Carto's John Birch Society days until the present, he has been extremely active in promoting his own particular Nazi (not "neo-" because it was of WWII vintage, i.e., truly Nazi) ideology. Carto has been a virtual one-man hate industry in his own right, starting or buying some 40 different organizations, publishing houses, newsletters, journals, etc.  Carto can be "credited" (though this word sounds much too positive) with keeping anti-Semitism alive, not only in the U.S. and Canada, but with ties to European neo-Nazi, xenophobic racist groups as well.  Carto has been  adept at changing his code-language to fit the times.
<P>
Carto's activities have not been without personal gain.  Though he tries to keep a low-key profile, the Carto life-style can be described as palatial.  He resides in a mansion in Torrance, California, living off of his ability to shrewdly manipulate the ignorant and the gullible among us.  Many who fall for his rabid hate-mongering may not even be aware that they are falling for the same lies Hitler told, which directly led to German nationalistic war-making, as well as "The Final Solution." Whether Carto believes his own propaganda is a question I can't answer.  There is a lifelong pattern which suggests that Willis Carto exhibits the classic "True Believer" syndrome described by Eric Hoffer.
<P>
There is much overlap among Carto's organizations and their "concerns" and those of other racist and anti-government groups, such as the militias, Christian Identity Movement, KKK, Aryan Nation, the Order, White Aryan Resistance, John Birchers, Church of Jesus Christ Christian, National Alliance, Populist Party, LaRouch, and others.  These groups have addresses on the internet, fax numbers, E-mail addresses, local cable company access, etc.  They have gone high-tech, using every means at their disposal to spread their cant and racist poison.  
<P>
A countervailing force is also on the net that attempts to meet lies, hate, and racism with factual, well-researched information which debunks the conspiracists completely.  
<P>
Any errors in this posting are strictly those of this writer. I'd appreciate it if anyone finds any factual error or has more updated information on the subject of Willis Carto, the Liberty Lobby, etc., that you will e-mail me.  I fully realize that the Carto-ites among us will think they find grievous factual error.  But the thinking so, does not make it so.  Once again, don't answer fact with opinion.  Opinions are a dime a dozen and won't raise a bit of dust when I wipe my feet on them.  
<P>
I suggest that before Carto-believers begin ranting, do your homework.  Just remember, facts are not partisan.  They are neutral.  All ya' gotta do is find them.  BTW, conspiracy theories do not count as facts.  You cannot prove a lie to be the truth, so sit on any tendency to foam at the mouth long enough to read the facts and ponder them.  If you are a Carto-sympathizer, just maybe you're the one who has been lazy and allowed yourself to be hoodwinked with smoke & mirrors, and old ones, even at that.  So if you're gonna rant, at least try for originality.  Quoting the Bible doesn't do it.  Quoting "Turner Diaries" doesn't do it.  Quoting the spoof "Iron Mountain" won't do it.  Quoting the totally concocted "Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion" sure doesn't do it.  And quoting books and literature put out by any of the certifiable hate groups will certainly not do it.
<P>
                 Learning can be such a painful experience!
<P>
                 Go in peace, armed with Truth.
<P>
                 By ya'll.

<P>
                Massalia

<H4><font size=5>L</font size=5>ong have I been wandering the Web and seldom have I stepped foot in such a rich and fascinating world as "The Real News Page." When it comes to media, this is the page I've been looking for. I think your insights and questions are interesting. The simple fact that questions are being asked at all is refreshing. Thanks. Keep it up. <P>

<P>
<font size=5>T</font size=5>hanks for the tip on the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> series on "Media Cynicism." Fabulous! Finally getting real! But will there really be any change? Despite letting their hair down on cynicism, there's still the problem of "manufacturing sausage" in the newswire pipeline. There's still the problem of corporate management decisions that put pressure on staff editors to sustain sales interest. This is the bottom line. We have to let them know--we the media consumers--have to refuse to be insulted anymore. It really <I>is</I> getting to be like "Network." There will come a day when hundreds of thousands of citizens will lean out their windows yelling, "I'm madder than hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"

<P>
<font size=5>I</font size=5>'ve just read your letter, Jane (<A HREF="abovfold.htm">"Above the Fold, Below the Pale"</A>), to the Associated Press--and I'm copying it to local papers here that have run the same kind of half-baked AP stories as an attachment to my own comments. This brand of insinuation-reporting has been going on for years and President Clinton is by no means the only victim, although the practice seems to have worsened since he took office, I don't don't why. 
<P>
Your comments in <A HREF="scarw.htm">"The Scarlet W"</A> are intriguing in this regard--perhaps there is a heightened judgment of Clinton on Whitewater as a punishment for his personal transgressions. Something is definitely out of proportion and most of the media-consuming public knows it. I personally think there is also resentment of any discussion of ethics or morality within the news media on the part of news editors and managers. They seem to  make a joke of such matters and are unforgiving when they do discuss them. The <I> L.A. Times</I> series on media cynicism gets into some of this problem [see 3-part series beginning with "A Negative Spin on the News" in <A HREF="flashcon.htm"> Contents</A>]. 
<P>
I like this page. It's really wide-ranging and thoughtful, makes me re-consider a lot of things about the media, makes me realize how serious the whole thing is, makes me <I>think</I> and want to <I>act.</I>

<font size=5>A</font size=5>CTION ALERT! California: Protest Radio KMPC's Firing of Tom Leykis. <BR>From FranLong@aol.com
<P>
FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting) is encouraging a protest about Disney-owned radio station KMPC taking liberal talk host Tom Leykis off the air in Los Angeles.  Leykis has been replaced by conservative host Michael Reagan. 
<P>
Even though Leykis has already been cancelled and replaced with Michael Reagan, it is still important to contact the station's ownership and management. We must voice our objections to our AM radio stations broadcasting only one political point of view or things will never improve.  
<P>
If you live in southern California, please e-mail a note to me (<I>FranLong@aol.com</I>). I am an associate of FAIR and will see that someone from FAIR e-mails information back to you you about contacting the KMPC station management. You can also write directly to Michael Eisner/Disney at the address given below. 
<P>
Following is the text of a letter from FAIR to
Michael Eisner, CEO of the Disney Company which owns KMPC.   FAIR encourages you to contact Michael Eisner using your own words. Please voice your objections to KMPC's dropping the Leykis show to:

than overwhelmingly conservative.
<P>
"Your radio stations, on the other hand, have given more and more air time to conservative talk show hosts.  There are only two issues-oriented talk shows hosted by someone who is not right of center on your two stations Monday through Friday.  One of the two hosts was cut from four hours to three.
<P>
"The overwhelming majority of conservative and white male talk show hosts on your stations is so much greater than that of your listeners that you would probably increase the size of your audience if you presented more balanced programming instead of removing women and liberals from the airwaves to be replaced by increasingly conservative hosts."
<P>
Removing Tom Leykis from KMPC and replacing him with Michael Reagan will leave Los Angeles with only one remaining talk radio host who is not conservative or extreme right wing.  It is wrongheaded, in that Tom Leykis appeals to a broad spectrum of listeners, while Michael Reagan does not.  Any show broadcast during the 3:00-7:00 p.m. weekday time slot will suffer in its
ratings due to pre-emption for sporting events, and no change in talk show programming will remedy the problem. 
<P>
In light of the recent changes in management of KMPC and KABC, we request that the replacement of Tom Leykis be at least postponed until the new leadership has a chance to properly assess the situation.  Hopefully, Ms. Lesourd and Mr. Callahan have better knowledge of the Los Angeles listening audience and the effect of sports pre-emption on ratings than Messrs. Green, Law and Ludlum.
<P>
Broadcasting only one political point of view to the exclusion of all others is incompatible with Disney's company values and its endeavors to reach the largest audience to optimize profits.

<P>
With respect, I disagree with your statement that "most people outside the Oklahoma area have pretty much forgotten the bombing" of the Murrah Building.  I live in Santa Barbara, travel often to LA, have friends in NY, Mpls, Miami, Brussels and Caracas. From the people I talk to in all those places, OK City is not at all forgotten. In fact, for many it was such a profound shock that it's hard for people to express how they feel about it, like an assassination. This may explain what you perceive as fading memory, but it is deeply shocked reflection rather than forgetting.
<P>
Your missing this, as a member of the news media, is unfortunate
and may contribute to the growing impression of media consumers that the news media are not tracking or delivering the real news.
<P>
OK City put a human face on government and abruptly reversed the
tone of harsh GOP anti-government rhetoric that reached its peak in the 1994 elections. OK City was a turning point for public perception of government and redefined the debate about government in more realistic and human terms.

<font size=5>W</font size=5>hile there's plenty of coverage on the Net on the Communications Decency Act, the quality of the coverage I've seen in the media (with outstanding exceptions, e.g. the <I>Washington Post</I>) has merely broadcast the fact that the editors of major media are as clueless as the politicians about cyberspace. 
<P>
Also, I've seen nothing anywhere about the possible disastrous economic effects of cyber-censorship... Hollywood is going digital... effective censorship on the Net means that Hollywood has to either restrict its product to children-suitable or move...

They pride themselves at C-SPAN on the call-in aspect, but they do nothing about screening out the obvious wacko right-wing element, nothing about the obvious overloading of callers from the right (mostly from the South) nothing about balancing their far-out right-wing panelists with appropriately left-wing opponents--and so on...

<P>
<font size=5>I</font size=5>'ve just discovered this page, and am delighted with the quality of
the information and the thinking of the editor. 
<P>
At the moment, I'm also appalled by what I have learned from the <A HREF="harpers1.htm">"Mediagate"</A> documents.  In my innocence, I have assumed that the horrendous coverage of the
Whitewater hoax has been the product of prejudice and laziness on
the part of the media.  Now I know that the <I>New York Times</I> bears major responsibility for this blot upon a presidency. They seem to have written a slanted story to begin with, to have done nothing to check the accuracy of their innuendos, and, since 1994, to have ignored evidence that they were wrong, and led the rest of the country's media down an increasingly libelous road to the current attempt to laugh a sitting president out of office. 
<P>
What I have not seen discussed  yet are my perceptions that 1) the media are no longer simply observers of events--they are players in the game of politics, while pretending that they merely report it,  and 2) that the media's contention that the Clintons could have defused this non-scandal early by being entirely forthcoming about all the facts in the case is a nonsensical idea if the Clintons had nothing to hide.  If they knew that there were no illegal acts to be found, they would have been in the position of having to prove a negative, and not in a court of law, but in mediacourt.  They would have had to turn over private papers on any subject of interest to "reputable" media, and awaited a verdict.  Am I the only American to see this as a ridiculous suggestion?  
<P>
It should be noted that the Clintons attempted to get
a reasonably unbiased press investigation of the case from David
Stewart, with the result we have seen--a reporter (whose work was
sloppy) going around the interview shows admitting that he could find no evidence of wrongdoing, but castigating the Clintons for the usual character flaws anyway.  
<P>
Is there any way to force the media, starting with the <I>Times</I>, to admit to the nation that they jumped to a very harmful conclusion four years ago, and have done nothing to correct the record since?

<I>NOTE: Joel Swadesh wrote the following letter to Janet Reno on June 19, 1996. <BR>Readers of The Real News Page are encouraged to follow suit to the Attorney General and to their Senators and Congressmen.</I>

Attorney General Janet Reno<BR>			  
U.S. Department of Justice<BR>
Constitution Ave. & 10th St., NW<BR>
Washington, DC 20530
<P>
<font size=5>D</font size=5>ear Attorney General Reno,     	
<P>
I am writing you regarding excessive concentration of ownership of the media and to request that existing antitrust laws be enforced.  Corporate America, generally, has a disproportionate voice in our political system and in our daily lives.  There is excessive concentration of power in all areas, but to have such concentration of power in the media is simply dangerous.         
<P>
The press was conceived to be the institution that safeguarded liberty by serving as a check to the power of government. Now, due to excessive concentration of ownership, it has become the agent by which the views of Murdoch and Malone and a few other wealthy men are force-fed to the people.
<P>
I see increasing examples of the media being used as propaganda.  One particularly egregious example was an advertisement used by the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) for the 700 Club. Images supportive of Speaker Gingrich and accusatory of Hillary Clinton were flashed by the viewer faster than the conscious mind is capable of processing them.  Even in the mainstream media, we see product placement in programming, clearly a manipulative technique.
<P>
Bias in news selection is the natural consequence of excessive concentration. Despite the fact that many millions of Americans belong to labor organizations, there is almost no labor news.  The rise of right-wing paramilitary groups was consistently underreported until the Oklahoma City bombing, and even still, numerous terrorist acts are ignored or minimized or mislabeled.  Coverage of Whitewater evades the inconvenient facts of Kenneth
Starr's serious conflicts of interest.  Blatant violations of the election laws--exemplified by John Kasich's urging of the Christian Coalition to "watch Pat [Robertson], and I will come on and I will give you a little direction, and then you ring the phones right off of the hook"--are never reported.  
<P>
Lacking a balanced picture, people cannot make reasoned choices.  A majority of Americans cannot accurately name their elected representatives, name the major programs of the budget, or describe the differences between the political parties.  While the media would like to blame this on laziness, it is just as probable that the media contribute to ignorance.  
<P>
Corporate control and abuse of information-gathering and dissemination are dangerous to democracy.  The Justice Department has the legal basis and the moral obligation to intervene.  I urge you to at least establish a task force to examine these concerns and report to the American people.    
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>

<H4><I>WHERE ARE THE EDITORS?</I>
<P>
<font size=5>R</font size=5>egarding the Hillary Clinton/Jean Houston story, Maureen Dowd, columnist of the <I>New York Times,</I> wrote a column which appeared in the Austin <I>American-Statesman</I> June 29, 1996 [appeared June 27 in the <I>New York Times</I>]. You need to add Dowd to the list of "journalists" who twist the news out of all proportion. I am sending along a copy of that column to share with your readers. How full of hate can one get? 
<P>
"First Lady Should Look Past Seance"<BR>
Column by Maureen Dowd (<I>Excerpts):</I>
<P>
"The Age of Aquarius was bad enough, but the New Age is ludicrous. At least in the '60s, people were worried about civil rights, equality, peace--higher things that took place outside the bridge of their nose. Now we're all inside the bridge...."
<P>	
"Here are the Clintons at what most people would call a destination point, and all they can do is keep searching. They are so unfinished, so intellectually unstable, so uncomfortable in their own skins, so desperate to win the love of everybody, that they think they must be everybody. They constantly, unnervingly, take on different identities and gurus. Bill Clinton has to be the only president who is still social climbing. Mrs. Clinton tries on an array of motivational mountebanks, from Tony Robbins to Marianne Williamson to Stephen Covey to [Jean] Houston--the spiritual equivalent of her hairstyles.
<P>
"Where is the brainy, no-nonsense Methodist lawyer who was going to keep the shambling, loosey-goosey Bill on the straight and narrow? Neither one seems to have a center now. If Mrs. Clinton did manage to channel Mrs. Roosevelt, that sterling first lady would probably tell her to pull up her socks, fight for some really good causes and stop worrying about who agrees with you." (end of excerpts)
<P>
In Hillary's keynote address at the dedication of the Eleanor Roosevelt College in San Diego, given 18 months before Bob Woodward's "revelations" and Maureen Dowd's column above, Hillary Clinton stated that after "talking" to Eleanor twice she concluded (in paraphrase), "One simply has to pull up one's socks and do one's best." 
<P>
PS: 
<P>
Jane: A mutual acquaintance guided me to "The Real News Page." Great. I was a college classmate of Ed Diamond's who is also keeping an eye on our media. 
<P>
I really can't believe what I am reading these days--I don't recognize the <I>New York Times,</I> and I can't believe anyone would spend a minute with the Moonie <I> Washington Times.</I> Hate Talk TV and Radio, CNN and C-SPAN--and finally columnists like Maureen Dowd (above)--all these people are driving my wife and me crazy. 
<P>
Is it possible, do you suppose, that a large number of citizens could file class-action suits for libel and defamation on behalf of Bill and Hillary against some of these folks, and determine the truth in courts of law? This might be more judicious than our media is at present. 
<P>
Even John Stuart Mill in his essay "On Liberty" would find this material we are being deluged with harmful to all of us and thus infringements on our community, social, and individual liberties.
<P>
These people with whom I may disagree have every right to have and to maintain their own opinions, however wrong, misguided, or mischievous. But aren't radio, television, and channel TV public utilities of a sort? Apparently editors have disappeared from the print media--or they were all promoted from the circulation department.

<I>Editor's Note: The following letter appeared in the <I>New York Times</I> on 6-30-96 from James A. Michener:</I>
<P>
To the Editor: 
<P>
<font size=5>T</font size=5>he commentators who are having a festival ridiculing Hillary Rodham Clinton for her imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt ought to look into the case of the English poet and essayist Walter Savage Landor (1775-1864). 
<P>
Landor is famous for his "Imaginary Conversations," five volumes in which he supposed himself to be overhearing conversations between important personages long dead. But his most effective samples are when he himself is interviewing some long-gone English worthy. His books, published from 1824 to 1829, were phenomenally popular and insured him of a modest immortality. 
<P>
So the tradition of imaginary conversations is grounded in Western culture. I wish that Mrs. Clinton's could also be published in book form.

<I>WHAT HAPPENED TO FACT-CHECKING?</I>
<p>
To Howard Kurtz, <I>Washington Post</I>  message board, CC to Media Discussion Center:
<P>
<font size=5>I</font size=5>nvestigative legwork costs money and corporate media
     claim the need to keep their overhead down. 
     So we end up with stories about allegations instead of stories about checked facts.
     Still, an effort toward research of some sort is desirable, is it not? Otherwise, the media are
     easily manipulated by partisans who have a field day with "questions raised." 
<P>
     When I used to work for a major magazine in New York, we had a fully staffed
     research department that would check the facts on everything our magazine printed.
     This was done thoroughly and was accomplished economically, although admittedly
     our fact-checkers were bright and persistent. The magazine had a good enough
     reputation that the author was motivated to cooperate in providing verification of facts.
<P>
     On this basis, the allegations of Mr. Gary Aldrich, for example, would not get into the
     pages of our magazine without rigorous fact-checking. If he couldn't document his
     stories, he would have to go elsewhere, to a tabloid or somewhere that didn't care
     about such details as facts. Certainly Mr. Aldrich's allegations would not enjoy the
     stage of implied credibility such as offered by air time on ABC's "This Week with David
     Brinkley" (6-30-96) where his non-responses on what proof he had were allowed to
     slip by as the fast-paced TV show moved on. Did ABC fact-check <I>any</I> of Aldrich's
     allegations before considering their invitation to have him on their prestigious show? 
<P>
Dare I ask whether the excuse of not having time or money to check facts
     is simply a cover for media's preference to deal with far more entertaining and
     newsstand-selling "questions raised" instead of facts and answers? 
<P>
     Given the nature of the Aldrich book, we probably wouldn't have ignored it. More
     likely we would have assigned a writer to go deeper than the mainstream accounts and
     report on the phenomenon of an FBI agent in the White House who wrote a book full of unsupported
     gossip and had an ax to grind with President Clinton and went around with an
     anti-Clinton entourage. We would have gotton under the skin, explored his motives, found out more about
     him, learned more about what his agenda was, who his cohorts were. The angle would probably have been
     skeptical, not "Duh, gee, I wonder if what he's saying is true. Let's ask him." We
     would have been skeptical not because we had a political bias but because journalistic
     standards require credible sourcing of reported information.  <P>
We did not use the pages of our magazine as a scribble board for political fantasies for their titillation value, to be checked out later, if ever.
<P>
     What's happened to fresh investigation and basic research departments in today's
     major media? If they are too expensive, then perhaps the news business should not be
     in business, for fact-checking is essential to doing news, is it not?

<font size=5>E</font size=5>ditor's Note: The following was picked up from "C-News," a conservative e-mail newsletter edited by Mark White, announcing that Fox News (owned by Mr. Rupert Murdock) is launching a "non-liberal" news show (the quotes should around "news" rather than non-liberal). Chief players are Roger Ailes (former Reagan and Bush handler and supervisor of the Willie Horton campaign) and Tony Snow (alter ego of Mr. Limbaugh and all-over-the-place conservative media presence). I reprint the message in case you want to monitor what they do. Right off the bat they do a bit of psychiatric second-guessing about Ted Turner. They have a Web page too, of course.

Subject: New Non-Liberal Sunday News Show<BR>
<P>
I thought this might be of interest to C-News readers:
<P>
Announcing Fox News Sunday - On Fox TV and the Internet
<P>
http://foxnews.iguide.com
<P>
For those who are tired of the continuous liberal barrage of the 
establishment media, a new alternative has emerged.  Fox News
Sunday offers a refreshingly balanced view of the week's news,
without the knee-jerk liberal reactionary defense of the 
big-spending, "protect the Clintons," pro-abortion slant of
the old-media network news.
<P>
Fox News Sunday is broadcast live on Sunday mornings from 9 to 10
A.M. from Washington DC, with host Tony Snow.  Tony is familiar to listeners of the Rush Limbaugh radio show as a renowned substitute when Rush was on vacation, and to readers of his syndicated column in the USA Today, Detroit News, Conservative Chronicle, and 160 other newspapers.
<P>
However, some Fox TV affiliates carry it at different times, and
others not at all.  But not to despair.  Fox News Sunday is the 
first major network to broadcast its Sunday morning news show 
over the Internet!  
<P>
The president of Fox News is Roger Ailes, who is Executive
Producer of the Rush Limbaugh TV show.  When he announced the
creation of a 24 hour all-news network to compete with CNN earlier this year, Rupert Murdoch said his intention was to provide a more balanced perspective on the news.  
<P>
At that time Mr. Murdoch mentioned that he wasn't sure if the reason CNN had moved so far to the left was because Ted Turner had stopped taking his lithium, or because he had married Jane Fonda. (Ted Turner had previously admitted that he had been taking lithium for depression but stopped it six months earlier).
<P>
Fox News Sunday is one of the few shows on a major network which
you can watch without becoming outraged by obvious liberal bias,
and Tony Snow is not afraid to confront liberal guests with the 
tough questions other news shows shy from.  
<P>
Since its debut on April 28th of this year, Fox News Sunday had
been rapidly gaining new viewers each week, and is being widely
quoted in radio, TV, and newspapers for its breaking stories.
<P>
This announcement is a public service of BILATON Views.  Spell it backwards! </font size=-1>

<P>
<I>"COUNTERPUNCH" AND "WASHINGTON BABYLON"</I>
<P>
<font size=5>B</font size=5>ravo on this wonderful, much needed page!  
<P>
To those of you interested in the media's failure to report accurately on the nation's power elite, consider taking a look at CounterPunch, a  Washington-based newsletter that frequently reports stories either missed or ignored by the "liberal" media.  It's authored by Ken Silverstein and Alex Cockburn. Ads for it run regularly in <I>The Nation.</I>
<P>
Also, Silverstein and Cockburn have just come out with a new book called <I>Washington Babylon</I> (Verso, 1996), which details how "celebrity" journalists' passion for $30,000 speaking engagements and nationally televised screaming matches is destroying responsible, citizen-oriented reporting.
<P>
How can we expect political change when one of the nation's primary sources of information is firmly in the hands of politicians and their corporate sponsors?
<P>
My guess is we need to start by supporting pages like this one as well as alternative independents!

<I>ONLINE NEWSPAPERS DON'T MEASURE UP TO PRINT VERSIONS</I>
<P>
<font size=5>I</font size=5>'ve been comparing online and newsstand papers--and there is a big, disappointing difference.  It seems that each is a different paper.
<P>  
Try a comparison on one day, <I>LA Times</I> or <I>USA Today,</I> etc.  The online version has shorter articles, different photos, and missing articles.
<P>
For example, recently the print version <I>USA Today</I> ran an excellent 3-part series, a comprehensive study on Church Burnings, but the online version was very condensed, it lacked the 9 page--yes 9 pages!!--emphasis that was in the print version.
<P>
My contention is that the online version is only what is selected to be online--a McLuhanesque selection based on Pow/Zap/Kazam--the Pow brevity, Zap content, and Kazam photogenecity medium--really not fully representational of what others are finding in the print version of the newspaper.
<P>
Plus, what about those "small stories on page 23" which can be the rumblings of a volcano about to burst?  They're not online.

<I>BRIAN LAMB'S "BALANCE" NOT BALANCE AT ALL</I>
<P>
<font size=5>I</font size=5> used to be an avid C-SPAN watcher until I noticed that Brian Lamb and his staff have allowed the right wing to take over both of the C-SPAN networks.  The bias is not only reflected in the call-in portion of the programming but in other programming as well. 
<P>
What Brian Lamb considers balance is not balance at all.  The Heritage Foundation may schedule a show with discussion aimed against the Administration--and Brian's "balanced" response is to have a member of the President's party discussing an issue but no one to refute the allegations made by the Heritage Foundation or other right-wing sources aired on C-SPAN.  
<P>
Why is it that mostly right-wing callers get through on Brian's call-in shows? Is it possible to start a phone club dedicated to calling C-SPAN?

<I>HERITAGE FOUNDATION, "THE MEDIA'S FAVORITE THINK TANK":<BR>
DEEP THINKING OR FRONT FOR POLITICAL P.R. & LOBBYING?</I>
<P>
A FAIR Press Release .   .   . Contact: Steven Rendall<BR>
July 2, 1996 <BR>      
 <P>
<font size=5>A</font size=5> new cover story in FAIR's magazine <I>EXTRA!</I> raises questions about the power and influence of the Heritage Foundation. Although it's the most frequently cited think tank in U.S. media, Heritage has generally avoided tough scrutiny. 
 <P>
The Heritage profile (<I>EXTRA!</I>, July/Aug.'96), by syndicated columnist and FAIR associate Norman Solomon, probes the following inconsistencies: 
 <P>
     ** Heritage is a "think tank" where thinkers and scholars play second fiddle to PR operatives and conservative political figures. "Our two primary audiences are Congress and the media," Heritage's PR chief told Solomon. 
 <P>
     ** To retain its tax-exempt status, Heritage regularly says it does not lobby. Yet its current annual report boasts that "Heritage has been involved in crafting almost every piece of major legislation to move through Congress." A recent Heritage position paper encourages Congress to deepen foreign aid cuts and abolish the Agency for International Development. 
<P> 
Says writer Norman Solomon: "Like a utility firm that boasts to its stockholders of big profits, and then pleads poverty to the public utility board while requesting a rate hike, Heritage says one thing to one audience, funders, and quite a different thing to another, the IRS." 
 <P>
** Aided by its tax-exemption, Heritage received $29.7 million last year from right-wing foundations, wealthy individuals, corporate/executive donors and foreign sources. U.S. media cite Heritage's views on foreign controversies like South Korea (<I>New York Times</I>, 3/12/96; <I>Washington Post</I>, 4/9/96) without mentioning
the funding Heritage receives from Korean corporate and government sources. 
<P> 
<I>EXTRA!</I>'s profile of the Heritage Foundation is accompanied by a sidebar, "Heritage of Extremism," exploring some of the far-right convictions and connections of leading Heritage associates through the years.
 <P>
<I> EXTRA!</I>'s May/June issue included a study that compared citations of think tanks in major media last year and found the Heritage Foundation to be the media's favorite think tank.  A Nexis database search of major newspapers as well as radio and TV transcripts found 2,268 references to Heritage in 1995.

<I>CAN'T TIMES FIND SMART CONSERVATIVES TO PUBLISH?</I>
<P>
To the Editor of the <I>New York Times</I>: 
<P>
<font size=5>H</font size=5>ow sad that so much of the media feels it must jump on the
bangwagon every time conservatives roll out another unfounded attack on the Clintons to prove that they do not have that imagined "liberal bias." Is that what your featuring of conservative essayist William Safire all about?
<P>
Or is it a sneaky way to portray conservatives as dishonest and\or stupid?
<P>
In his July 4th column William Safire, who worked in the Nixon White House and may have known Tricky Dick's master of dirty tricks, makes a lame attempt to make Craig Livingstone "Bill Clinton's Segretti."  Richard Nixon's CREEP did not hire Donald Segretti to do his best to get his picture in as many papers in the country and on national TV.  His mission was to be a snake in the grass and to do as much dirty campaigning against Nixon's challengers as he possibly could, without getting caught.  
<P>
Believe it or not,  Mr. Safire,  Democratic activists do not appear at Republican rallies dressed as  "Chicken George" and "Butt Man" because they are trying to hide anything.  They are doing their utmost to be noticed, to get caught in the act of exercising their free speech, knowing full well that the very papers and television programs that would not print a word they have to say may well plaster their pictures all over the country.  
<P>
Aren't there any honest and smart conservative essayists the <I>New York Yimes</I> could publish?

<I>EEK!</I>
<P>
<font size=5>C</font size=5>onquered! read the headline on the front page of the 7-8-96 <I>Los Angeles Times</I>. <BR> Independence Day captures money, crowds and American psyche, blared the sub-head over a story it took two staff writers to write.
<P>
After Jean Houstons visits to the White House, reported as visitations with a great deal of disapproving speculation about seances, spells and capturing Hillarys psyche, now comes a movie to capture Americas psyche--and we love having our psyche captured. Nothing wacko about it--just plain all-American fun!
<P>
If you thought there was no difference between politics and entertainment, there is, but not much. We just dont like our First Ladys psyche being captured, especially when we have muzzled her and cut off her hands and not allowed her to do anything with her mind. Just think of all the trouble a captured psyche could cause that doesnt do anything? Its maddening to imagine. Better go to the movies and forget about it, suppress it, and project it into the giddy joy of being overtaken by aliens. 
<P>
Still, it's remarkable how glibly the same reporters--who couldn't utter the word "psychological" in reference to Hillary and Jean without guffawing or using the word "psychic" instead--with perfect seriousness used the same conceptual language Jean might use (in italics below) when it came to reporting on a fantasy movie. We take fantasy seriously and we take seriousness fantastically--and so it goes ....
<P>
Quoth the <I>L.A. Times</I>:
<P>
According to the movie-makers, psychologists [eek!] and marketing czars[?],  'Independence Day' has hit the jackpot with a combination of zealous and well-positioned advertising, a critical mass of unpaid publicity including simultaneous [as usual] covers of <I>Time</I> and <I>Newsweek</I>, and capitalization on <I>the publics deep-rooted desire to unite against a common enemy.</I>
<P>
This movie delves into some very <I>archetypal</I> [eek!]<I> needs and myths </I>[eek!], said a media psychologist [eek!] at Cal State. <I> There is an idea that we, as a people, have been fragmented since a primordial time.  Anything that can provide us with the illusion of oneness and unity will have an appeal.</I>
<P>
As for the media, aha!  A traditionally skeptical media was a pushover this time, said the prez of 20th Century Fox, astutely waiting until after the opening of ID4 to spill his hand.  The material was so good and the concept so easy to grasp that the press played into it, hook, line and sinker. Did the two <I>L.A Times</I> staff writers wince when the prez of 20th Century Fox said this straight into their faces?
<P>
Here comes the--eek!--psychological part.  Experts say the public is receptive today to accounts of the paranormal [eek!]. <I>Consider the cult </I>[eek!] <I>status of The X Files and a handful of otherwordly</I> [eek!] programming already on the air or coming next season, said a UCLA associate professor in Film and Television. 
<P>
Lillie Friedland, past president of the Media Psychology [eek!] division of the American Psychological [eek!] Association, points out that there is this <I>giant shadow in ID4 cast by the alien ship.  That is a very primitive fear--of the Shadow</I> [eek!] <I> that C.G. Jung</I> [eek!] <I>spoke of.  When youre a kid, its the authority figure coming to get you. But now the Shadow</I> [eek!] <I>is a spaceship coming to get all of us.</I>
<P>
In ID4, the aliens blasted the White House. Jean Houston helped to heal [eek!] the White House and she got blasted by the press, some of whom are,  in their sweet way, like aliens among us.
<P>
Only two weeks after the whole media universe said "Eek!" when they found out Hillary and Jean had used their brains, now every armchair phychologist in the universe is discussing in relaxed speech cadences the probability that UFO's have landed.
<P>
Such a money-making easy-to-grasp shadow will surely have a sequel. When will production begin on ID4-II [eek!]? the head of 20th Century Fox was asked. 
<P>
In the next 20 minutes, he quipped.

<P>
<font size=5>W</font size=5>atch and see what the media do with the recenly published scholarly book by Arkansas editor Gene Lyons, "Fools for Scandal." 
<P>
The media couldn't do enough to publicize the scandal-mongering trash aimed at the President of the United States. But now that the <I>media themselves</I> are the target and someone (Lyons) is daring to point out the scandal of supposedly respectable media stars and even the supposedly respectable <I>New York Times</I> stooping to the level of the "trash for cash tabloids," the silence of the media will be deafening.  
<P>
If Gene Lyons' "Fools for Scandal" is going to get any play at all, it will only be because of the efforts of people who are concerned enough about truth, fairness and a truly independent "fourth estate"  to buy the book and get the word out over call-in shows and the WWW.

CC: Media Discussion Center	      
<P>
Dear Mr. Kopple,
<P>	
<font size=5>O</font size=5>n "Nightline" Tuesday July 9, you opened the show with a Demo ad featuring kids smoking, with one of three kids disappearing (dying) in adulthood. You characterized the ad as "negative" and said that it typified the "smoke and mirrors" of the Presidential campaign.
<P>
You then featured as your only commentators on this subject two political campaign consultants.
<P>
I have two questions:
<P>
1)  Instead of doing a shallow show based on calling such an ad "negative" (which it was, being somewhat exaggerated but essentially true and reflecting quite negatively on Mr. Dole), why didn't you do a deeper more important show on the current status of studies on kids' and adults' smoking? 
<P>
This approach would have shed light on the veracity (or not) of the ad's contention that kids' can eventually
die of the effects of smoking if they continue smoking into adulthood, as many smokers tend to do.
<P>
2)  If you felt that it was so vital to your viewers to discuss the shallowness of campaign ads (which we've seen dozens of times before and which is not likely to change before the election), instead of using Lyn Nofziger and Susan Estrich, why didn't you bring on Roger Ailes who was directly involved in the production of the William ("Willie") Horton ad to face whoever the current Demo consultant oversaw this kids' smoking ad?
<P>
Then viewers might have viewed the "negative ad" question in its proper perspective.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>

<font size=5>G</font size=5>ene Lyons' new book, <I>Fools for Scandal: How the Media Invented Whitewater</I>, has just been released (August 1).

<H3>Missing Story: Sell off public lands to pay for Dole tax cut?</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>T</font size=5>he following is a plank in the Republican platform which I have heard nothing about (though it may have been mentioned somewhere). 
<P>  
The GOP platform says, in part:  "The  current [ESA] is seriously flawed
and, indeed, is often counterproductive."  "We support a thorough review of the lands owned  by the federal government with a goal of transferring lands. Properties transferred from federal control must recognize existing property and mineral rights including water, mining claims, grazing permits."  The platform calls for expanded production of livestock on public lands, the responsible harvesting of dead and diseased trees, and supports "the original intent of the Mining Law of 1872."
<P> 
I wonder if the Republicans intend to pay for their tax cut by selling
off public land?  The rich will benefit by the tax cut most.  They will buy land for their private uses, and our grandchildren will not even have access to what is now our right.  Not only has FDR's New Deal been dismantled, now they are going after Teddy Roosevelt. An important story, but the silence is deafening in the media.

<H3>Where's the Media Coverage of the Real Consequences of Block Grants?</H3> 
<P>
<font size=5>R</font size=5>egarding the handing over the the states the many activities now handled by the Federal government.  Are the so-called "block grants" to the states going to have any direction or requirements as to how they are spent?  (No one has made this clear to me.)  If not I foresee a lot of fancy new sports stadiums springing up all over the country and corruption passing even that of the Reagan administration. 
<P> 
Since most states say they cannot possibly handle the expenses with only the "block grants", I can see state income taxes going up drastically and being instituted in those states that do not have them.  I wonder if anyone has thought of this as I have never heard anyone say a thing about it in the media.  Other taxes, e.g. sales taxes, property taxes, in the states will probably be increased also when the Federal programs are turned over to the states to run.  No one has addressed this to my knowledge and I am concerned about it.  I am especially concerned that "block grants" meant to help the poor not be funneled to the super-rich to pay for their toys.
<P>
I agree that welfare and other Federal programs need changing and updating.  The welfare system is more out of date than "broken".  I also agree that it is far better to help every citizen who can work to get a job by educating and training them and I wish the  President had made more of a case to the Congress about this as I know that was in his original plan and I think the people would have understood then had he vetoed the bill.  Since it is too late to veto it, I hope he can fix it during his next term by insisting on training and education programs to help people get work.
<P>
The problem is that the same people who want to end welfare also want to dismantle the public education system so the poor cannot be educated.  There is much more going on underneath this struggle than many realize as so many of the electorate are operating on a hidden agenda.

<P>
       Position Statement Regarding
Voluntary School Prayer<BR>and Religious Discrimination
<P>
The Interfaith Religious Liberty Association (IRLA) opposes H.J.R. 184
(Armey) and any other measure that would require government to give
harmful, preferential treatment to religion.  H.J.R. 184 (Armey) is slated
to be acted upon in the House Judiciary Committee in early September and
possibly later that month before the full House.  Other similar measures
have been H.J.R.'s 121 (Hyde), 127 (Istook) & S.J.R. 45 (Hatch).  The
current proposal by Armey reads as follows :
<P>
 [Substantive Preamble:] "Proposing an amendment to the Constitution
 of the United States to further protect religious freedom, including
 the right of students to pray without government sponsorship or
 compulsion, by clarifying the proper construction of any prohibition
 on laws respecting an establishment of religion."
<P>
 [Text of Proposed Amendment:]  "In order to secure the right of the
 people to acknowledge and serve God according to the dictates of
 conscience, neither the United States nor any State shall deny any
 person equal access to a benefit, or otherwise discriminate against
 any person, on account of religious belief, expression, or exercise.
 This amendment does not authorize government to coerce or inhibit
 religious belief, expression, or exercise."
<P>
At first glance the text of the Armey amendment does not seem to have
negative consequences.  However, closer analysis reveals the opposite.
Some of our major reasons for opposing H.J.R 184 and any comparable
constitutional amendment are as follows:
<P>
A.  An amendment is not needed.  Existing law already provides
vigorous protection of religious liberties.  Proponents of these
measures cite examples of discrimination against religion in public
schools. However, God has not been "kicked out of the public schools."
The First Amendment and an array of supporting laws, such as the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act, guard against abuses.   The answer
lies not in the creation of divisive new laws, but in the enforcement
of existing law and in educating the educators about students'
religious liberties.  For example, under existing constitutional law:
<P>
1.  Students can pray.  They can do so voluntarily in public school
any time, individually or in groups, as long as they do not disrupt
the educational programs.
<P>
2.  Students can express their religious beliefs.  In the classroom:
They can do so in class assignments and class discussion.  They may
not extend this right, however, to evangelizing "captive audiences" of
students or conducting religious worship services to "captive
audiences", and rightly so.  Outside of the classroom:  They may hold
religious club meetings or gather for religious purposes on school
property before and after school. They may distribute religious
literature under reasonable time-place-manner limitations, and they
may freely express their religious beliefs -- unless it turns into
religious harassment.
<P>
B.  Serious ambiguity in the language could provoke major governmental
intrusions into the private religious lives of Americans.   Possible
disturbing interpretations of the Armey amendment include:
<P>
1. "Noncoercive" governmental preference of one religion over others
would be allowed.  Much misuse or abuse of religion would be
permissible short of actual "coercion".  The word "people" can be
interpreted to include governmental entities.  Therefore, official
public declarations and acknowledgments that favor one religion would
be permissible.  Government officials could declare America to be a
"Christian nation" or even proclaim one faith to be the preferred
religion of the state.  As long as the government did not enforce its
declarations through "coercive" measures, it could publicly  endorse
specific religious beliefs and practices and disparage others at will.
<P>
However, the final sentence which purports to offer protection against
government coercion of religious practice provides little assurance as
courts are divided over what constitutes government coercion of
religion. Also, there are numerous ways government may misuse religion
without giving rise to actual coercion.  At least one court has held
that subjecting unwilling public schools students to prayers is not
coercive.  By singling out coercion the amendment condones other less
intrusive but equally objectionable government uses (and misuses) of
religion.
<P>
2.  Tax dollars would be spent to support religious purposes.
Protections afforded to persons under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments have been extended to include groups and corporate entities
(such as churches and religious organizations), and there is nothing
in the proposed language to limit its scope to private individual
"person[s]'".  As such, not only will individuals be able to demand
equal government benefits for religious purposes (such as vouchers for
private religious education); all religious organizations would be
eligible to obtain direct government subsidies to support their
ministries.
<P>
3.  Existing protections against insistent, harassing or disruptive
religious speech and practices in all public settings--not just
schools--would be eliminated.  In addition to the concerns raised
above, the amendment only prohibits government discrimination against
religion.  It does not also prohibit discrimination in favor of
religion.  Thus, the anti-discrimination clause elevates religious
belief and expression over other forms of belief and expression,
authorizing government to prefer religion and giving religious speech
a trump over other types of speech. This is not government neutrality
toward religion.  Also, the amendment may be interpreted to provide an
absolute right to engage in religious conduct -- overriding existing
governmental authority to restrict religious practices for a
compelling reason (such as a compelling health, safety or welfare
concern).
<P>
4.  The right to practice and promote specific religious beliefs would
extend to public officials and employees acting in their official
capacity -- not to just private individuals.  The proposed terminology
of "person" is not restricted to private persons; thus public
officials and employees acting in their official capacity (such as
teachers, judges, legislators, policemen, etc.) arguably could have
the same right as individuals to engage in religious expressions
protected under the proposed amendment. Hence the amendment goes far
beyond it stated purpose of protecting the right of students to prayer
in public schools and authorizes, for example, officially sponsored
prayer.
<P>
In drafting the Bill of Rights, the framers of the United States
Constitution sought to insure a benign governmental neutrality toward
religion -- a delicate balance where government neither favors nor
hinders religion.  Under the proposed Armey, Hatch, Istook & Hyde
amendments, that neutrality is recast as "discrimination".  The "cure"
they propose would create the very type of governmental partnership of
church and state which so oppressed minority faiths that our
forefathers were forced to flee to our shores.
<P>
The religious freedom we have enjoyed under existing constitutional
protections has served America for over 200 years.  We strongly affirm
the necessity of preserving our American tradition of separation of
church and state and oppose any effort to threaten it.

<H3>Politics as Usual: Nightline Won't Learn</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>D</font size=5>ear Nightline			     	
<P>
RE: Program on teachers, unions and school choice, 9-9-96:
<P>
Host to guests: We know you want to debate the issues but we want to get to the politics of it.
<P>
The networks have been worried about why viewership of TV news programs is declining and the above quote is exactly one reason why.  Im surprised that you have not read  (or taken to heart) Mr. James Fallows book <I>Breaking the News</I> which in painful clarity analyzes this problem and points out that journalists, such as yourself, have become conditioned to focusing on the political horserace and its tactics while neglecting the debate of difficult issues that actually affect peoples lives.
<P>
On page 23 of his book, Mr. Fallows gave an example which almost perfectly mimics the statement above by Nightlines host: When Sen. Kennedy began giving his views about the balanced budget amendment, [Dan] Rather steered him back on course: Senator, you know Id like to talk about these things the rest of the afternoon, but lets move quickly to politics..... 
<P>
Media analyst Kathleen Hall Jamieson has remarked on this problem over and over again.
<P>
Another example: Tonights program cut short discussion of how school voucher money would deplete funds for public education--a difficult problem needing deep discussion--while giving uninterrupted air to the view that teachers dont want to compete. This is utterly fallacious and yet it sounds good. It sounds contentious. And its quick.  If I were editing the show, I would have spent the full 23 minutes on this question alone. That would have been a better contribution to the publics information. Instead,  Nightline added to the publics misinformation.
<P>
Even with Ted Koppel hosting, I watch Nightline now, not for news or intelligent discussion, but to see if you and your colleagues have learned anything from all the wisdom that has been provided by observers such as Fallows and Jamieson.
<P>
I notice tonight--quite dramatically--you havent.

<H3>"Slate": I Can Get It For You Elsewhere</H3>
<P>
Jane,
<P>
<font size=5>R</font size=5>egarding "Slate" and your analysis (<A HREF="slate.htm">"Preview of Slate Inspires Reflections on the Old Esquire"</A>), I agree with you that it's far too commercial--far too palatable to appeal to the masses--to be the avant garde tool that it could be given that it's on the Web. "Wired" magazine said it best in its "Tired/Wired 100 List" in September that Michael Kingsley is the Pat Boone of the Internet: just when all that rock and roll began to be devoured by teens and simultaneously rejected by their parents, along came Pat Boone with a shiny, happy, tolerable message. To be good on the net you must do something my editor at a small town Indiana newspaper told me: give the reader something they can get no where else. Guess what? I can get that retread of a mag at the corner Starbucks or print the sucker out because it's far too lengthy to skim on the Web. Eee-gads Michael, and I thought you were a pro.
<P>
Jane, regarding this Web site, I love it. Great place for information and discussion. By the way, I was an avid reader of "Esquire" until this latest "new and improved." Do you have any affiliation with the magazine anymore? [Jane: No] If not/if so, what are your thoughts on it? [Jane: It's not "Esquire" anymore. More like "Esquire, Jr."]

Thanks again for the forum.

<H3>Real News About Jean Houston</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>J</font size=5>ane:
<P>
I was absolutely overjoyed at your "defense" of Jean Houston who, we know, needs no defense. Having been interested in the human potential movement (although not actively involved for years), Jean's name would surface from people I respected.  I finally was able to attend one of her three-day workshops in '94 just before the infamous session with Mrs. Clinton.
<P>
What happened with the media, for whom I have lost most of my respect, was outrageous to be beyond belief! The garbage that was attributed to Jean was proof positive that the media were making it up as they went along and stating not the truth but what sells.  Many have lost their integrity.
<P>
Unfortunately the negative tone that vibrates throughout the country makes me think that we are all too willing to believe anything ugly said about anyone.  Any one of us could fabricate any outrageous rubbish about anyone and there would be many, including the media, not only ready to repeat it but only too happy to provide the gory details of which there are none!
<P>
Thanks for the "real news" about Jean Houston.  
I'm glad I discovered you too, even at this late date, Jane!

<H3>The Media Are Liberal Clinton-Lovers</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>T</font size=5>he media is made up predominately of liberal Democrats who have been working for Bill Clinton's campaign.  They have failed to investigate the many swirling scandals that threaten to bring the Clinton Administration down.  By failing to perform their investigative reporting as they would were it a Republican candidate that was so deeply involved in alleged criminal behavior, the media have lost all credibility with millions of Americans.  Their audience is leaving in droves as they watch the Tom, Peter, Dan, Judy Woodruff and other liberal Democrats in the media campaign shamelessly for the Clintons. 
<P>
The end result of a partisan liberal press will be a further shift to the right by most Americans in their effort to balance the left.  This process began in November of 94' and will continue this November whether the Clintons are re-elected or not. 
<P>
<I>Larry Clifton (larryclifton@worldnet.att.net), Tampa, FLA, 10-28-96 </I>
<P>
<I>Editor's Response:</I> Mr. Clifton, you will then please explain why the supposedly liberal <I>New York Times</I> took the lead in breaking the Whitewater story, never let up for nearly 4 years (--and came up with nothing, just as dozens of Congressional hearings and two Republican special prosecutors have come up with nothing).
<P>
Yes, the <I>Times</I> failed to do "investigative reporting" on Whitewater--she failed to report on any of the exculpatory evidence which exonerates President Clinton. She failed to report the bias of RTC operative Jean Lewis. She failed to report Arkansas bank regulator Beverly Bassett Shaffer's side of the story. It took Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato to finally bring Shaffer before his Whitewater hearings to testify to the facts after 4 years of innuendo. It took a Republican Clinton-enemy Jay Stephens to exonerate the Clintons in the RTC reports of any gross wrongdoing.
<P>
Read Gene Lyons' "Fools for Scandal" to get to the heart of this "swirling scandal." As for another "swirling scandal" that still hangs in the air, read my research on <A HREF="paula.htm"> Paula Jones</A>. But are you interested in getting to the bottom of these allegations, Mr. Clifton? 
<P>
Moving along on the "liberal media" motif, will you please explain why the supposedly liberal <I>Washington Post</I> ran Bob Woodward's story about Hillary's "seances" with Eleanor Roosevelt on its front page. You will please explain the incessant "attitude writing" about both Clintons in straight news stories of most "liberal" media outlets. ABC's Brit Hume, a Republican who wept when George Bush lost in 1992, covers the Clinton White House with as many "questions raised" as he can dream up.  Examples of anti-Clinton reporting and slanting are endless.
<P>
You will please explain why the <I>Post</I>, just a few weeks  before the election while Dole was pounding President Clinton's character, held off publishing a story about Sen. Dole's mistress during his first marriage (see <I>Newsweek</I>, 11-18-96, page 110). The <I>Post's</I> decision was unfortunate, I believe. 
<P>
The <I>Post</I> "accepted the distinction between public trust and private actions." Dole had made this distinction and it was an artificial one, made to protect himself from his own dishonorable past. On the score of private character, Bill Clinton's adultery in his own marriage was aired openly before a <I>60 Minutes</I> television audience of millions before he was elected the <I>first</I> time. On the score of public character, the Clintons have suffered (unfairly I believe) from their opponents' and the media's label of hypocrisy because of the Clintons' damnation of the "greed of the 1980's" while they themselves supposedly exercised greed in Whitewater and cattle futures--a claim thus far not substantiated. Just so, Mr. Dole deserved to suffer the critical judgment of being a hypocrit for preaching about Clinton's character (public, private, you name it--few make the distinction he tried to make) and about "family values" while hiding his own adultery. 
<P>
According to the author of "Senator for Sale" and a witness, Dole escorted his mistress to an abortion clinic as well. This story would have blown his anti-abortion message to smitherines and destroyed his support from the Christian Coalition. 
<P>
It was a supposedly "liberal elite" newspaper that saved Mr. Dole from profound embarrassment just before the election. 
<P>
I wish I could go along with your theory, Mr. Clifton. It would make life easier to have such a simple (simplistic) explanation. Far closer to reality, I believe, are two factors: 1) Within mainstream commercial media, any reporters who might be liberal have been intimidated by your brand of liberal-labeling into reporting on Clinton against that grain.  2) More generally, among editors and news managers who make the real news decisions, the mainstream news media, both print and broadcast, have little if any political soul. They're not political, they're <I> commercial.</I> 
<P>
In fact, generally speaking most of the news media go to great lengths to disparage, degrade and make fun of politics and politicians of every stripe. This in turn has the effect of leaving media commentators themselves in the position of perceived true wisdom--which serves their companies' commercial purposes extremely well. If the media were really "liberal" as you say, they would hardly let this happen. If they were genuinely liberal, they would not trash their field of dreams this way.
<P>
You fail to mention Rupert Murdoch's operation which is an exception to your theory, now that he's bought enough media to be called mainstream (he bought much of the stream which makes him main). Mr. Murdoch, as you know, is quite rabidly conservative. FoxNews went on the air not long before the election (not in New York City but everywhere else), just in time to deliver several tons of  anti-Clinton "news," calling itself "objective." 
<P>On the other hand, follow this twist: since 1977 the "liberal elite" <I>New York Times</I> has been appealing to suburban readers (and later, national readers) who are more moderate and conservative than their New York City readers. That concerted effort (which I know well because I was on the team that redesigned the <I>New York Times</I> to appeal to suburban and national newsstand readers) was premised on mellowing any percerived liberal political stance, not for political reasons but for the purpose of marketing and sales. 
<P>
There is a way that liberalism does occasionally permeate the debate. The liberal editorial voice of some papers such as the <I>New York Times</I> has repeatedly criticized President Clinton for not being liberal enough. You may not like the irony of this, Mr. Clifton: the negative bias against Clinton for not being liberal enough has the effect of showing that Clinton is not as liberal as his opponents paint him, which ultimately has a positive effect for Clinton with the general public which appears to want a moderate leader. It's not an easy journey for Clinton, no matter how one looks at it. There is not much "Clinton-loving" going on anywhere--left, right or center--except among a large number of voters who elected him--and will probably re-elect him--President.
<P>
There are many more things than meet the eye when it comes to media's motivations--more forces at work than simply individual reporters' personal political views. Additionally, Mr. Clifton, there are many other reasons why the country is moving to the right, some of them quite real and disturbing and some quite good social changes which have nothing to do with the media. At most, the media among those who agree with your view are the scapegoat, not the cause. 
<P>
I hope you continue to research your premises, Mr. Clifton, because you have the potential of developing your understanding of politics--and media--beyond your dislike of President Clinton. You appear to have backed into this theory of "liberal media" to explain Clinton's impending re-election. More often than not, any liberal influence in the media encourages people to vote away from Clinton and toward Ralph Nader. The evidence appears to show that Clinton will likely win <I>in spite</I> of the news media, not because of it. Thanks for writing. --J.W.P.

<H3>Is There a "News Philosphy"?</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>I</font size=5>'ve got a question that's been bugging me for ages: Is there such a thing as a "news philosophy"? This question was posed to me during an interview and (ten years later) I still can't express a simple point of view on the matter. Does anyone else find this? Even in simple TV news I cannot really accept the concept of there being a single philosophy. I am interested in hearing from anyone who has pondered this and has a philosophy-- indeed one that translates to practical day-day operating, especially in the broadcast medium. 
<P>
<I>Peter (malert@mpx.com.au), Sydney, Australia, 9-1-96</I>
<P>
<HR WIDTH=100%>
<P>
<H3>Yes, There <I>Is</I> a "News Philosophy"</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>I</font size=5>n response to the query as to what the philosophy of the media is, it's very simple.  Like any business, the media has customers.  Those customers are not viewers or readers, but advertisers.  No media outlet will print or broadcast stories that anger its advertisers. The situation becomes even more complex when you have conglomerates like octopi choking out free speech on the airwaves.  The shareholders of a media empire may themselves have interests which are adversely affected by a story.  The consequence, as we see, is a media that can only find it possible to report stories that offend unimportant people--welfare mothers, union members and blacks, for example.
<P>
Think of the change in the offing as the media oligopoly shrinks to one or two mega-companies, with thousands of shareholder conflicts... as the middle class shrinks to insignificance, shouldered out by the corporate state.  Then you and I shall be made sport of, in the way that welfare mothers are reviled today.

<H3>Microsoft-headed?</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>T</font size=5>o the Editor, <I>Los Angeles Times</I>,<BR>
November 22, 1996
<P>
Your article "Microsoft Gets Static Over Its High-Powered Image" (Nov. 22) does not mention Microsoft's entry into commercial media as signified by MSNBC and the Webzine "Slate." 
<P>
Like all large corporations selling products on media channels that presume to bring us news information, Microsoft's moves are having an Orwellian effect on how we think.
<P>
This is old stuff--but why are so few speaking up?
<P>
Microsoft's television partnership with NBC to form the techno-glitzy MSNBC was a brilliant marketing coup for selling computer products. Theyve accomplished this ably by creating a pseudo-culture not unlike the one created by Disney, another super-sales corporation. 
<P>
MSNBC delivers yet one more "news" channel of inferior quality which promotes techno-thinking consisting of short, predictable, often shallow and incomplete, observations that make no serious waves. Microsoft and NBC combine to control the news discussion to make the show safe for the selling of products to the broadest spectrum of consumers. 
<P>
This is just plain Marketing 101--but it's happening <I>within</I> a "news" outlet. It's hard to believe that only a  decade and a half ago, before the Reagan administration rescinded the regulations, commercials were limited on newscasts precisely to avoid commercial influence on the news.
<P>
Microsoft's Webzine "Slate" appears to offer hip commentary on politics--and sometimes it does. But when carefully examined, "Slate" also serves corporate interests by generally portraying politics and politicians as a joke. This technique, common among almost all mainstream commercial news perveyors, has the effect of making corporations look "wise" and their products look like the only things we can depend on, the only information sources we can "trust."
<P>
This is all so absurd that I'm surprised to see so few comments of alarm. Have we simply become conditioned to this mode of news?  I realize Microsoft uses predatory business practices to sell its products, and this is bad enough. But when Microsoft creates and uses a news medium to sell products and a Webzine to position its image, thats when I get out of my chair. 
<P>
These tendencies are what worry me about Microsoft and what worry me about commercial media. I'm also worried about the fact that your own news reporting on this subject leaves these worries out of the text.

Subject: Microsoft-headed?
<P>
Dear Jane,
<P>
<font size=5>T</font size=5>hank you so much for writing this letter about Microsoft. For years corporations have been coaxing the American media toward safer and less threatening presentations of the news that affects them. Microsoft, however, seems to have outdone the others in its rush to herd us all toward a monocultural view of computing.
<P>
I develop computer printers for Japan, where Microsoft products are in the extreme minority.  I have watched with a mixed sense of amusement and horror as magazines such as 'Computing Japan' have dropped from their pages any mention of non-Microsoft products, focusing entire issues to evangelistic explainations of why American companies should only develop products which are Microsoft-friendly.
<P>
It was not that long ago that even a hint of collaboration between a newspaper or magazine and its advertisers was scandalous.  Now it seems all the rage.

<H3>Columnist: "Character Assessment" or Character 
Assassination?</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>T</font size=5>o the Editor, <I>Biddeford Journal Tribune</I>
<P>
Jay Ambrose's (Monday, Nov. 18) notion of an ideal
politician is someone who is civil and open-minded, knows how to negotiate and knows how to compromise. He then does a weird sort of flip-flop that only columnists seem capable of doing and criticizes President Clinton for being all of the above.
<P>
Apparently, Mr. Ambrose's ideal notions only involve the
principles of those he agrees with. This makes his
journalistic character assessment seem more like a character 
assassination. Add to that Mr. Ambrose's talent for leaving out the substance in any Clinton story he relates and we're left with just another mud-slinging columnist. 
<P>
Ambrose begins his undisguised attack by trying to bring back to life a horse that was long ago beaten to death by every
conservative columnist and Dole campaign strategist in the nation--Clinton's by now infamous remarks on MTV.
<P>
During that interview a member of the audience jokingly asked
Clinton, "If you had to do it over again, would you inhale?" After being lambasted by the press for months over saying that he didn't inhale, the Mr. Clinton laughed and said, "Sure, if I could, I tried before..." Ambrose does not include honesty and humor in his list of ideals nor timeliness since the event took place in 1992. And if his column is indicative of the reasons for these omissions, it's probably because he seems to lack all three. 	 
<P>
Mr. Ambrose continues disingenously by relating his own version of the President's weekly radio remarks on the balanced budget amendment. He implies that the President can now "live with" such an amendment and that this is a flip-flop from the Presidents previous position. And if Ambrose was right that would be a major change for the President, however he is not right.
<P>
What Clinton said was that if the amendment contained an "escape clause" that would kick in during recessions, he would then consider a balanced budget amendment.  Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins (R-Me.), scoffed at the suggestion. Most believed it was pretty much the same position that President Clinton has always taken and they're not willing to reach that sort of compromise. But even though this unwillingness to compromise goes against Ambrose's vision of an ideal poltician, it's apparently alright when it comes from the "right" side.
<P>
One would think that someone who takes on the task of assessing Presidential character would at the least inform his/her readers of all the facts, place them in context and present them honestly. Mr. Ambrose does none of the above and that says a lot about his own character.

<P><H3>Media Hypes Sabotage Theories about TWA Flight 800</H3>
<P>
To the Editor, <I>New York Times</I>: 
<P>
<font size=5>A</font size=5> Nov. 24 Week in Review article says that after the crash of TWA Flight 800, "there were deep financial and psychological reasons why the possibility of sabotage remained robust in the public mind even as nothing to support it had been found in the wreckage." The article proceeds to examine why various organizations, including T.W.A., might have a vested interest in perpetuating a "sabotage" theory. 
<P>
You overlook your own contributions in perpetuating the notion that sabotage brought down the flight. 
<P>
It was a <I>New York Times</I> news article, not the F.B.I., that suggested early on (incorrectly) that there may have been a bomb in the nose wheel well. 
<P>
It was a news article, not the National Transportation Safety Board, that suggested (mistakenly) how a bomb might have got into passenger luggage. It was your article, not T.W.A., that theorized (inaccurately) on how the possible presence of a bomb in a cargo shipment indicated failings in security. 
<P>
It was your article, not Boeing, that questioned procedures for shipment of human tissue consignments, based on a theory (incorrect) that a bomb in a cornea tissue shipment in the cockpit brought down Flight 800. 
<P>
And it was another article that (wrongly) trumpeted the discovery of minute traces of explosive residue in the wreckage, traces that were later linked to training exercises for bomb-sniffing dogs. 
<P>
All along, the agencies charged with finding the truth have maintained that all theories remain under investigation. It is disingenuous of you to bemoan the persistence of a sabotage theory and to cluck at those who perpetuated it.

Hats off to Mr. Abels. I watched with amazement as the both the
print and broadcast media painted a picture of terrorism, bombs
and suspicion after the TWA crash. Again, as in the
tragedy in Oklahoma, the rush to judgment lacked any credible 
evidence and did nothing except generate anxiety and anger at a 
non-existent enemy.

<H3>The latest round--Clinton bashing via media surrogates</H3>

<font size=5>N</font size=5>PR and the <I>New York Times</I> are at it again. The <I>Time</I> is bashing James Carville for going after Kenneth Starr's political bias, and NPR this morning (12/06/96) took up the "Slate" line of comparing the Paula Jones compaint to Anita Hill's charges against Clarence Thomas. Naturally the analyst (name Ive already forgotten) found Paula more "credible." Safire, meanwhile, bashes Renos prosecutorial choice for investigating the Lippo connection to the DNC. <P>
Apparently no one is sacred except Kenneth Starr, whose objectivity dare not be challenged despite consistent and persistent evidence to the contrary. Well, after all, the son of a Baptist minister from Texas must be immune from even of whiff of ideological bias, right? 
<P>
Sure doesnt feel like Clinton won the election, or even that the 
campaign for control of the White House is over for now.

<H3>Uncle Walter Speaks His Mind</H3>
<P>
Hi Jane,
<P>
<font size=5>D</font size=5>id you catch Walter Cronkite on Larry King/CNN last night (Dec 9)?  An hour-long interview.  Aside from promoting his latest book and reminiscing highlights of his career (Kennedy assassination, Viet Nam War coverage, admiration for Anwar Sadat), he discussed the status of journalism today. 
<P> 
He talked about the integrity of journalists.  He said 90% of the 
O.J. trial news presentations were boring and lacked any new facts.  How true. 
<P> 
He distinguished between reporters and news presenters.  And he 
said there were far too many unrecognized "News Presenters," those whose bottom line is the quality of their hair spray rather than the quality and content of a breaking story.  To recognize them as they truly are would be to acknowledge the separation of news from entertainment.
<P>
This comment on news presenters is very interesting; that he 
would give us this new perspective on American journalism...and it is new for most of the viewers; the idea that they would begin to distinguish between a reporter (Wolf Blitzer, Judy Woodruff) and a local anchor/news presenter.  And from that acknowledgement, our expectations change. 
<P>
Overall, it was a hope-filled hour listening to Uncle Walter speak his mind.

<H3>Ben Bagdikian Was Right</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>I</font size=5>'ll tell you this much. As a young freelance reporter coming up in this day and age, I believe the media critic Mr. <A HREF="monopoly.htm">Ben Bagdikian</A> speaks the truth. It's obvious. I just wonder why I had to live in America for twenty-five years to hear my "questionable" perceptions confirmed. 
<P>
I don't, as a young idealist, plan to lay down and work
for some fluff-pushing scumbag who gets his health insurance
coverage from Texaco. I'm planning to shake off the naysayers
and compete against these mental and physical pilferers. 
Anyone one else? 
<P>
I'm talkin' influence-free newsprint, baby. Can it be done?

<H3>Finally! ABC White House Reporter Brit Hume's True Colors! <BR>...He Signs with Murdoch's Media</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>O</font size=5>ver the years I have been critical of the conservative, even blatantly right-wing, reporting and programming of ABC.  Three years ago this month I complained about ABC reporter Brit Hume spreading lies in Washington about sexual misconduct by the President while he was governor of Arkansas.  A two-month investigation by the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>, according to Jack Nelson, found that Hume was intentionally spreading misinformation to get the paper to run a negative story on the President.  Last month, I criticized ABC's Sunday morning news program "This Week" for being politically unbalanced to the conservative side.  
<P>
But now there appears to be a glimmer of hope at the network. 
Brit Hume has resigned from ABC and is putting his slanderous
conservative credentials to work for another political
rightwinger and Newt Gingrich sugar-daddy, Rupert Murdoch.  Hume
will be chief Washington correspondent for Fox News and also will
write for <I>The Weekly Standard</I> magazine--a fitting tribute to his lack of professional objectivity. [Ed. Note: Both Fox News and the <I>Standard</I> are bankrolled by Mr. Murdoch]. 
<P>
The other good news at ABC is that it has hired George
Stephanopoulos as a contributing correspondent.  George will
start out bringing a much needed progressive analysis to the
Sunday news program "This Week."  Who said complaining won't make
things better?

<H3>Are We Losing Our Local Public Access TV Channels?</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>D</font size=5>ear Alliance for Community Media:	
<BR>
(alliancecm@aol.com) (URL: http://www.comm21.org/acm.html)
<P>
I live in Santa Barbara CA where Cox Cable Company is our cable 
franchiser. I understand that the Telecom Act has released cable 
franchisers from any requirement to provide training and production facilities for Public Access TV channels that would make possible individual expression by private citizens. This means that it is now up to the local City Council to negotiate with the cable company and say, in effect, "We will allow you to have franchise access to our community <I>if</I> you provide funding and training for Public Access facilities in our community." 
<P>
Sounds easy--but it's not.
<P>
One problem is a matter of PA's public image. Of the three competing "public" aspects (Public Access, educational and government--PEG), Public Access seems to be viewed as the least valued or somehow expendable, "the poor cousin," in part because some of the programming is perceived as not up to par compared to slick commercial shows and some programming is not in the "mainstream" of the community's "majority" in terms of ideas or points of view. 
<P>
On the "bad image" front, we have a Public Access program here, for example, that promotes white supremacy. But we also have the capacity (so far) to produce programs to counter that view and we should not be precluded from the right to speak up just because "objectionable" views are shared. Indeed, the PA channel is seen as the "Hyde Park Corner of the airwaves" with both positive and negative connotations of that image.
<P>
Perhaps it was, partly, this vulnerability of Public Access to 
demagoguery by appearances that may have brought into being the original Federal requirement in the first place--because the free speech premise of Public Access needs protection and fostering that might not be universally found among local cities. 
<P>
This Federal protection is now gone.
<P>
How effective will be the City's negotiations with the cable franchiser to preserve Public Access if the thing the City is negotiating for is deemed expendable--and the competing entities know this and take advantage of it by promoting "community value" of programming and other noble-sounding but misleading notions?
<P>
In the debate on the local level, many are not really clear about what Public Access <I>is</I>. The essence of the original concept of "Public Access" with emphasis on free speech is being lost in favor of a quasi-commercial-type model of programming that must demonstrate popularity, ratings, "educational value," "community worthiness," etc. 
<P>
On the contrary, the idea is to make at least one Public Access channel available for anyone in the community (on a first-come basis) to produce his or her or their own show no matter what its perceived merits, exercising First Amendment free speech rights which are limited only insofar as any public speech is limited. The trade-off is that, as long as the cable company is being given the right to bring multiple channels of their own programming selections into the community for a charge per month to its customers who are virtually a captive market, at least one of those cable channels must be made available and production training provided so that members of the community can produce their own media programming. 
<P>
Without some alternative means of expression via non-commercial public community access, the average citizen has no recourse within the media system (which is largely corporate) to speak up against the "corporate culture," for example. 
<P>
Some say that if individual community members want access to public expression of their ideas, "Let them eat the Internet." But Public Access TV is reached by millions more people than the Internet. Given how powerful the television medium is, how important alternative information and points of view are to an informed democracy, and the imperative that we have a channel of free public expression <I>somewhere</I> in the media culture, this is one of the most profound problems of democracy I've ever come across. 
<P>
Many people involved in the decision-making here at the City level don't quite understand what "Public Access" actually is or appreciate the unique value of what we have lost by losing the guarantee to public access through the Telecom Act.
<P>
Now we have a situation in Santa Barbara where:  1) the City Council is being lobbied heavily by educational institutions and government entities in competition with Public Access interests for the same small amount of money (assuming there is any money at all extracted from Cox Cable Company in negotiations, and there is no guarantee of that except what the City can scrounge in the trade-off, depending on how tough the City Council is), with Public Access suffering the image problem mentioned above. 
<P>
2) The City Council is being lobbied heavily by a private consortium of "business and educational leaders" who want to take over whatever funds are allocated to Public Access so that they can set up a "panel" to "select appropriate programming" that they find palatable, "educational," and "rewarding" for the community according to their own judgment. This might sound benevolent but their panel might not look kindly on some of the program content likely to pop up on the Public Access proposal list. A call-in program for gay teens, for example? Forget it.
<P>
I am hoping to write about this to our local newspaper to alert fellow citizens about this situation (I urge all online readers to research the PA situation and do the same in your own communities--and write to Congress and the President), and I need more information ASAP (negotiations between the City and Cox Cable will occur in January 1997). 
<P>
Can you please advise me: 
<P>
1) Where exactly in the Telecom Act can I find the section in which this transfer or release of the cable franchiser's responsibility is described from the Federal government or FCC to local City dispensation of Public Access rights? 
<P>
2) Where can I find information on what's happening to Public Access in other communities? 
<P>
3) Do you have any advice as to negotiating strategies with the City regarding preservation of Public Access television? Has this wheel been invented somewhere already?
<P>
Many thanks for your anticipated assistance.

<H3>Does a columnist have the same responsibility for fact-checking<BR>as the journalist writing a hard news story?</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>A</font size=5> while back I wrote a letter to the editor of our local paper [11-24-96: see <A HREF="center4.htm"> Columnist: "Character Assessment" or Character Assassination?</A> on message board #4] and voiced my disproval concerning a column that I felt was not only extremely biased, but untruthful as well. I said I felt that when a columnist is relating events as facts, then said columnist has the same responsibility for fact-checking as the journalist writing a hard news story.
<P>
The paper refused to print the letter (it was the first and only time they've refused to print one of my letters), saying that a column is strictly opinion and therefore the columnist can pretty much say whatever he/she wants.
<P>
I now find myself in the same position with regard to a column written in the <I>Boston Globe</I>. The column was recently posted to the civic-values mailing list for discussion and after doing some minor research, I found many of the facts incorrect and that these facts could easily obtained over the "net." 
<P>
At any rate, I'd like to hear others' opinions on whether columnists should fall under the same standards as reporters when it comes to presenting "stories" as fact within their columns.

<H3>A Journalist's View of Media in Australia</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>I</font size=5> am finding more and more what is reported in the media is as far from reality as you can get. 
<P>
As a former journalist with a radio station, I was asked to compact into a 45-second read details of a story which left out vital variables which could change the way people perceive the line of the story.  The less we look into what makes a story happen, the more we assume--and that leads to a gross negligence in our tolerance.  
<P>
Look at what the media has done with the issue of racism here in Australia.  It has fairly whipped it up by focusing on the inappropriate comments of a young politician, Pauline Hanson, and will continue to milk the issue so it can glean sound-bites and visual grabs of rallies for and against racism and in-your-face arguments between cultures.
<P>
Media will not seek to solve the problem, merely report on it.  I have been told that was not our job.  Is there no sense of altruism in media?

<H3>Con Men Running Infomercials? Does Commercial Media Look the Other Way?</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>W</font size=5>ell, I'm not sure if this is exactly the sort of thing this forum 
addresses <BR>[Ed. Note: it is], but I recently contacted a couple of local TV news departments about infomercials that they are running,  specifically, that these shows are produced by individuals with some pretty shady backgrounds.  
<P>
For example, infomercial host Kevin Trudeau has
criminal convictions for credit card fraud and larceny 
(http://www.sos.state.il.us/new/press/release/960508a1.html) and
Ed Beckley (http://www.peak-computing.com/96/feb/16/home.html)
has lost a lawsuit brought by the Iowa Attorney General and is 
currently being investigated by the Kentucky AG.  
<P>
One station 
(KENS-TV) did not respond to e-mail or telephone but only to 
a registered letter to local anchors copied to the general manager
and assignments editor.  The response was a telephone call saying
they didn't want to be involved with anyone that wasn't squeaky clean, but they continued to show the program anyway. 
<P>
 The other station
(KMOL-TV) indicated their news department was interested (we'll see).
<P>
In addition to the consumer protection issues, I think this is a
situation which illustrates the commercial influence on journalism.
It does take some persistent searching on the Internet to get the 
info on these infomercial guys.  Con men who buy ad time somehow 
don't seem to get quite the same media coverage as other sorts of
consumer fraud.  
<P>
Feel free to e-mail me for info on other infomercial
frauds. I didn't want to clog the page with URL's but I have a few
others.

<H3>Analysis of an AP Story</H3>
<P>
<font size=5>I</font size=5>n light of the criticism of media coverage of TWA Flight 800 by Mr. Abels [see <A HREF="center4.htm"> Message Board #4</A>], I thought I'd present the following for discussion. By way of background I'm 50 years old, married and have been attending the University of Southern Maine for the last three years. I am not a journalist but have taken a number of introductory courses in "newswriting" taught by working editors and reporters.
<P>
These are my own thoughts based on personal preference, 
observation, and what is being taught in basic newswriting classes. 
This is an analysis of an AP story [quotes in red] with my own comments indented.

<font color="#ff0000">Headline: "Hangar workers don't agree with NTSB officials"<BR>
December 17, 1996 
<P>
SMITHTOWN, New York (AP)--Workers reassembling TWA Flight 800 wreckage accused the National Transportation Safety Board Monday of trying "to shut the lights off" on the probe by suggesting the plane was brought down by static electricity.  "It's their one-way ticket out of here," said one accident investigator about the NTSB's newest position, that the catastrophic explosion in the center fuel tank might have resulted from a static electricity-induced spark. It's a theory the NTSB acknowledges it has no evidence to support.</font color="#ff0000">

    What a lead. Right off the bat the reporter baits the reader
    without providing real information that a reasonable and
    critical reader needs to have in order to judge the stories
    credibility. 
<P>
    Buried by the accusation of wrongdoing by the NTSB is the
    fact that the NTSB has gone out of its way to say that the
    "static electricity theory" is just that, <I>a theory</I>. And
    furthermore that it is only one theory under consideration.
    The reporter will mention this, but will do so way down in
    the story and as most reporters know, the further down one
    gets in the story, the less importance is attached to what is
    being read by the reader. 
<P>
    In the desire to enhance the image of wrongdoing, the
    reporter leads us with ambiguous and anonymous "sources"
    such as "hangar workers," and "one accident investigator,"
    and, contrary to good reporting, attibutes direct quotes to
    both. One wonders just what are hanger workers? Are they
    engineers, metalurgists, or just workers assigned to move
    pieces of the wreckage around? Who is the "accident
    investigator" and how and why did he/she talk to the
    reporter? Without some sort of explanation or credentials,
    the reporter should not have used  direct quotes. 
<P>
    The reporter finishes the paragraph in the negative by
    stating that the NTSB "has no evidence to support" the
    theory, which then furthers the reporter's goal of presenting
    wrongdoing, yet the simple fact is that of course they have
    no evidence and that's why it's called a "theory."    
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<font color="#ff0000">Dismayed workers said they suspect the accident agency may be 
preparing the public for the possibility it might never determine 
exactly what's to blame for the deaths of 230 people, but wants to
present a probable cause that would be nearly impossible to refute.</font color="#ff0000"> 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Here the reporter fails to report the story in such a way that
    the reader is allowed to make his/her own judgement as to
    the emotional state of the paragraph's subject, in this
    case, the anonymous "dismayed workers." As almost any good
    reporter or teacher will say, "show, don't tell." Yet "tell"
    the reporters does and the problem is that this whole
    paragraph is conjecture and opinion designed to exploit the
    tragedy, hence the use of the words "deaths of 230" to over-
    dramatize and further add emotional weight to the reporter's
    accusation of wrongdoing by the NTSB.   
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<font color="#ff0000">"It's a theory no one can prove and no one can disprove," said the investigator, who spoke on condition of anonymity. </font color="#ff0000"> 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Again we're subjected to the cover of anonymity. Once,
    twice perhaps, a good reporter can credibly use anonymity,
    yet as one continues to read this piece, the whole story
    becomes synonymous with the anonymous. And that's not good
    reporting.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<font color="#ff0000">The agency took the position late last week that while nothing is 
certain, one of its leading theories was that the center fuel tank 
exploded because of sparks touched off by static occurring as fuel 
passed through a pipe in a fuel tank. </font color="#ff0000">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Here the reporter finally portrays the NTSB's stance on the
    crash as something that reasonably resembles the reality
    of the NTSB's remarks. Yet, it comes too deep into the story
    to make any real difference. The dominant impression created
    by the story up to this point is one of wrongdoing by the
    agency promoting a coverup.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<font color="#ff0000">"The static electricity theory is premature," said the investigator. 
"It's a catch-all theory that when you can't prove anything else, you can point to that." </font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	More anonymity...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<font color="#ff0000">The public statements last Friday hit especially 
hard in the hangar in Calverton where crews have worked around the 
clock in search of a cause since the plane exploded about 10 miles 
off Long Island on July17. </font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    More conjecture and opinion without attribution. It's almost
    as if the reporter is editorializing instead of reporting.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<font color="#ff0000">Even agency experts studying the electrical and fuel systems of the
Boeing 747 were startled to hear what the public was being told. 
Many of them heard it on the radio. </font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

    Again, more ambigous anonymity, no attibution, and again the
    reader is told what to think instead of being given facts
    and allowed to reach a conclusion. 

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<font color="#ff0000">And James Kallstrom, who is heading the FBI investigation into the 
explosion, told  reporters last week that he was surprised at the 
NTSB's public speculation that static electricity was to blame for 
the explosion.</font color="#ff0000">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Finally, we're given a real person, so...where's the quote?
    Instead we have a paraphrase and the disclaimer below...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<font color="#ff0000">Kallstrom declined to comment this week as it became increasingly clear how strained relations had become between NTSB authorities in Washington and their workers on Long Island.</font color="#ff0000"> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Again, more editorializing. Clear to whom? Did Kallstrom say it was clear? If Kallstrom said something that is relevant to the story written, than it should be included rather than dismissed with the unattibutable claim of an interagency dispute. What is becoming "increasingly clear" is that the reporter is not reporting from facts. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<font color="#ff0000">Peter Goelz, an NTSB spokesman, denied there was a 
rift between officials in Washington and accident investigators at 
the hangar. He also noted that faulty wiring and a missing fuel pump 
are alternative theories still being considered. </font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Another real person and another lost opportunity to lend
    credibility to the story with a direct quote. But then
    again, doing that might lend more credibility to the agency
    and diminish the reporter's desire for conflict over
    substance. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<font color="#ff0000">Still, the investigator said the workers felt "blindsided" by news of the static electricity theory, since they weren't consulted beforehand and especially since only a small part of the pipe involved has been recovered. </font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    What "investigator?" Is the reporter still talking about
    "Peter Goelz, an NTSB spokesman" or is this a new person in
    the story?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<font color="#ff0000">It would be difficult to find a single worker in the 
hangar who would be willing to suggest that static electricity 
brought down the plane, the investigator said.  "It's a straw man 
being set up," added one worker from the hangar, who also asked
for anonymity. "Nothing we have seen so far points to static 
electricity. It's just a theory. We couldn't believe it." </font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    "It would be difficult?" Sounds to me like the reporter
    didn't try. Up to this point, we still don't 
    have one attibutable quote. 
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<font color="#ff0000">In the hangar, workers say it seems clear that the plane's center 
fuel tank exploded near its middle. The tank's center is as much as 
four feet from the pipe the NTSB suggests was the source of
static electricity created as fuel was transferred shortly after 
takeoff. </font color="#ff0000">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
    And? This paragraph creates more confusion than
    clarity. The NTSB has stated that the static electricity
    could have ignited the fumes from the fuel tank, so what
    does the fact that the pipe being four feet away from the
    tank have to do with this explanation? Nothing... since
    fumes could have been ignited the tank whether it was 2 feet
    or ten feet.  Good storytelling but poor
    journalism. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<font color="#ff0000">The NTSB several weeks ago began summing up its findings, and one NTSB official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agency expects to be finished in the hangar sometime in January.</font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    More of you know what....
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<font color="#ff0000">But the workers feel there's a rush to judgment following an outcry for answers, which reached a crescendo last week when Sen. Alfonse D'Amato blasted the NTSB for failing to do all it could to find a cause.</font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    "rush to judgement," "following an outcry," "reached a
    crescendo?" "blasted?" The whole paragraph is one giant
    cliche to portray breathless drama. One wonders if the reporter is familiar with the AP's own style book? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<font color="#ff0000">Still, Jose Cremades, whose 15-year-old son Daniel was killed in the explosion, said accident investigators told families at a meeting at NTSB headquarters during the weekend that static electricity was only one theory under consideration. "We were told it was just a theory without a lot of backing at the  moment," he said. </font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

    This last paragraph seems added as an after-thought and
    even the use of a direct quote can't save this 
    story from being what it is, a very poor example of
    reporting.

<H3>SOMETHING CERTAIN ABOUT NEWT</H3>	
<P>
To the Editor, Los Angeles Times,  cc: The Real News Page, <BR>Dec 23, 1996 
<P>
<font size=5>I</font size=5>n Mr. Gingrich's nuanced admission to the Ethics Panel, we hear his eloquent regret that he "brought down on the people's house a controversy which could weaken the faith people have in their government."
<P>
Wait a minute!  "Controversy"? A controversy is a difference of opinion. The Speaker confesses to a difference of opinion? What sort of confession is that? He chose the word carefully, masterfully, to avoid admitting wrong. Where is the word "dishonor"?
<P>
What weakens our faith is people using words like "controversy" instead of "dishonor" and nobody batting eye. What worries us is when the press paints the affair as a personal vendetta by Rep. Bonier by universally calling him "Gingrich's chief <I>antagonist</I>" when they used to call him simply a "critic." What concerns us is when Gingrich defenders call Bonier "fixated" as though he were the only one in America who is outraged. What gives us pause is the disingenuous Mr. Gingrich who says, "Look, no personal financial gain!" while accruing political power at the people's cost.
<P>
To those who argue, "Oh, this is nothing compared to Clinton's wrongdoing," 1) prove it as this has been proven by overwhelming facts, even if the Ethics Committee made a deal with Gingrich lawyers not to make a judgment in exchange for his confession to ignorance;  2) don't avoid the issue of the Speaker. The tactic of "twinning" is partly how we got onto this slippery slope.
<P>
I suggest we forget about "ethics violations" by Newt Gingrich. That old moral precision has become a morass of uncertainty, a "difference of opinion" that serves the evening news.
<P>
Aha! Here's something certain:  Since Gingrich pleads ignorance to the commonly understood illegality of using tax-exempt funds to further his political agenda (in the form of a college course distributed for partisan recruitment), then it is certainly clear that he should resign as Speaker or be denied the position--not because he is unethical but simply because he's incompetent.

<h5>By MICHAEL SPECTER</h5>
<p>   <img src="/images/s.gif" align=left alt=S>AVICHI, Belarus  --  This has been a cheerless decade for
18-year-old Svetlana Lebenok. She never finished school because
there are no longer any schools around here to finish. Her three
older brothers spend their days tethered to the vodka bottle. Her
parents live like invalids.
<p>   So when she heard there might be a job open in this emotionally
scarred, ecologically poisoned village not far from her home, and
only about 10 miles north of the Chernobyl nuclear power station in
Ukraine, she wasted no time worrying about her health. She just
grabbed it.
<p>   "Everyone is afraid here all the time," she said, standing
behind the counter of the only store in this mostly abandoned
village, where she rents a room from an older woman because there
are no buses to take her home at night. "People talk a lot about
how Chernobyl killed our country. That may be. But sometimes I
think the fear is worse than the sickness."
<p>   Ten years after the catastrophe at Unit 4 of the V.I. Lenin
Atomic Power Station turned the word Chernobyl into the world's
foremost symbol of technological disaster, the legacy of the
accident can be felt in every part of this wasted land.
<p>   The fire, which burned out of control for five days, spewed more
than 50 tons of radioactive fallout across Belarus, Ukraine and
western Russia.
<p>   Even now, the full medical consequences of the accident are
unclear, but some truths have emerged. In terms of deaths  --  and
even probable long-term illness  --  Chernobyl was not the worst
industrial accident of recent times.
<p>   Fewer than 500 people died so far as a direct result. By
contrast, the chemical leak at Bhopal, India, in 1984 killed at
least 2,000 people and injured some 200,000.
<p>   Oil fires during the Persian Gulf war in Kuwait and enormous
pipeline spills in Russia may have caused more serious, immediate
damage to the environment.
<p>   But in terms of political significance, economic dislocation and
absolute and enduring fear, Chernobyl stands alone.
<p>   "It's not too much to say that Chernobyl helped destroy the
Soviet Union and end the cold war," said Richard Wilson, professor
of physics at Harvard University.
<p>   "What it did to Belarus is hard to describe," he said while
attending a recent conference in Minsk, the coutry's capital, on
the effects of the accident. "But the worst disease here is not
radiation sickness. Except for children the physical effects are
not easy to measure. The truth is that the fear of Chernobyl has
done much more damage than Chernobyl itself."
<p>   Those are strong words, but even a few figures  --  some time spent
traveling through the partial ghost towns of southern Belarus  -- 
bear them out. The radiation released after the explosion at the
reactor's core on April 26, 1986, was nearly 200 times that of the
combined releases from the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki
in 1945.
<p>   The wind carried by far the heaviest radioactive deposits across
this country, where even today 25 percent of the land is considered
uninhabitable. Thousands of villages were abandoned. Schools were
closed, prime cattle were slaughtered by the ton, huge factories
were shut without a second thought. Desperate villagers fled their
homes with only the clothes on their backs.
<p>   The government here says it devotes more than 15 percent of its
gross national product  --  a total of more than $235 billion over the
last decade  --  to paying the cost of resettling tens of thousands of
people, as well as the medical and social bills growing from
Chernobyl, which is still operating just across the border. Yet
nobody is sure it is making any progress.
<p>   But the worst scars have settled in the mind. And no place has
been punished more than the Gomel region of Belarus, where the
Soviet authorities denied the accident for several days, allowing
people to linger in the radiation, then lied about its severity.
<p>   An area of nearly 2 million people  --  20 percent of the country's
population  --  Gomel once had the most fertile farmland in all
Belarus. Today, it is as if somebody had sown the land with salt:
20 of 21 agricultural districts produce nothing. People have become
paralyzed with fear.
<p>   They are afraid to move, afraid to stay, afraid to marry and
afraid to have families. All normal life stopped here simply
because there was a strong northerly wind on April 26, 1986.
<p>   For months after the accident, from northern Finland to the
Adriatic Sea, thousands of women chose to have abortions in panic
over the possible effects of exposure to radiation.
<p>   In Gomel, even today, there are three abortions for every live
birth, a rate more than twice that for the rest of the country.
<p>   "People say we are not really sicker than any one else in the
former Soviet Union," said Nikokai I. Ermakov, the man in charge
of Gomel's response to the accident. "They are talking about blood
diseases and death rates. That is not my interest. My interest is
life in Gomel. Here we have no jobs. The pristine forests have
radiation signs posted all over them. Poor farmers can't eat what
they grow. Is it so strange that what happened here seems like a
biblical curse?"
<br>
<p>   The city of Gomel, some 70 miles north of Chernobyl, has more
than half a million residents. But it is barren in the surrounding
region, where the soil still holds most of the radioactive fallout.
Driving south into the Exclusion Zone  --  the area within an 18-mile
radius of Chernobyl that is still considered too polluted for human
habitation  --  presents a visitor with one of modern life's eeriest
visions.
<p>   Scores of farms, villages and hamlets remain empty here. Huge
cafeterias, the buildings where most people ate all their meals in
Soviet times, have been stripped and their deeply contaminated
parts sold on the black market. Cars lie partly buried in the loamy
soil, and empty buckets hover silently over poisoned wells.
<p>   Deserted houses stand with coats still on hooks. There are
butter churns, pots on the shelves and stacks of newspapers
everywhere. "My dearest Lydia," reads one postcard on the floor
of a house in the empty village of Molochki, dated a couple weeks
before the accident. "I hope you pass the exams successfully. Best
of luck and cheer up. Your loving grandma Sasha." Half a dozen
dolls were strewn nearby.
<p>   Several thousand people still live scattered in some of these
towns. They are not supposed to, but many have no choice. The
radiation was deposited unevenly across the region, with some
villages heavily contaminated and other neighboring villages almost
untouched. Most of them attribute every ill or problem in their
lives to "the station," which is what they call Chernobyl.
<p>   "My teeth are falling out, and I can't see too well anymore,"
said Volodya Ronashev, a 48-year-old forest administrator who lives
and works in the zone. "I used to be healthy. What else could it
be but the station?"
<p>   The truth about the causes of medical illness is often hard to
find, and much harder to prove. There seems little doubt that the
enormous burst of ionizing radiation released from Chernobyl has
affected the thyroids of many thousand children in Belarus, Russia
and Ukraine.
<p>   The rise in cancer rates is too stark for any other conclusion.
There were seven cases of thyroid cancer among children in Belarus
in the decade preceding the accident. Since 1990, there have been
more than 300 cases, almost none of which have so far been fatal.
But what about other diseases? Are people in this contaminated land
really sicker than anywhere else?
<p>   "Nuclear energy is invisible," said Dr. Johan Havenaar, chief
of emergency psychiatry at the University Hospital in Utrecht, the
Netherlands. "It's treacherous. It scares people so they think it
causes them to be sick."
<p>   Like most doctors or radiation specialists, Havenaar readily
concedes that it is too early to know everything about the effects
of Chernobyl. But he decided to test the widely held belief that
people in Gomel are already sicker than people elsewhere.
<p>   He compared about 1,500 Gomel residents with a similar sample
from the northern Russian town of Tver, where no radioactivity from
Chernobyl had reached. The Gomel Project, as the study came to be
known, lasted from 1992 to 1995 and included the most exhaustive
medical examinations the participants had ever received.
<p>   The study showed that the people from Gomel said they were five
times as sick as those from Tver. And they almost always attributed
those illnesses to some result of radiation from Chernobyl. In
reality, after clinical exams, the level and types of physical
illness was similar  --  although psychological distress in Gomel was
far greater.
<p>   "These people are sick," Havenaar said. "It's just not the
type of illness they think. We have to realize that the
psychological damage here runs very deep. And we need to treat that
every bit as vigorously as we need to treat cancer."
<p>   Svetlana Lebenok, the shop clerk who rents a room in the
radiated depths of Savichi so that she can sell butter and eggs to
the 35 families left living there  --  and make extra wages doing it
in a danger zone  --  put the issue another way.
<p>   "I don't think my parents have really done anything at all but
sit in a room since the accident," she said. "They weren't
injured. I know that. People with cancer get help. But isn't there
anything they can do for everyone else? There must be some
answer."
<p>   The reality is that there are no simple answers to the range of
health, environmental and money problems created by the Chernobyl
accident.
<p>   Eight times in the last decade the leaders of Ukraine have
decided to close the giant facility's remaining three reactors. And
eight times they have changed their minds because shutting the
plant would strip 5,000 jobs from a region already devastated
economically.
<p>   For Belarus, the problem is even more acute. The country most
affected by history's worst nuclear accident does not even have a
nuclear power plant. Belarus opposed the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, and when it was left alone it was left with immense bills it
could not possibly handle. An agricultural land tainted by the
ultimate modern poison is of little use to anyone.
<p>   The people here have long sought to reunite with Russia, in part
so that it may better pay for Chernobyl. (On March 23, the two
Slavic countries agreed to form a union that would tie them to each
other politically, economically and culturally, though they would
remain separate countries.)
<br>
<p>   "The Chernobyl disaster taught us there are no borders to the
modern world," said Ivan A. Kenik, the chief Belarus official in
charge of the Chernobyl aftermath. "It taught us to question faith
in technology and in ourselves. I now wonder if we as a
civilization have the knowledge, strength and wisdom to survive
this nuclear century?"
<p>   Many of the people living in the region think they already know
the answer. There has always been such a lack of certainty about
the effects of the accident and information from the government and
health experts that nobody believes much of anything now.
Relatively few even seek answers, although several health centers
are available for questions every day.
<p>   For years after the accident all those in the Gomel area got
extra wages and free medical care. When the government realized it
could not keep up the policy for much longer, it applied a 12
percent "Chernobyl tax" to wage earners. Even so, the benefits
are no longer available to most people.
<p>   "They come around here and ask us why we never left," said
Elena A. Shagovika, 67, a resident of Khoiniki, about 30 miles
north of the reactor. "Where were we going to go? And what would
we do there? When my old neighbors come back to see us they just
stand in the road and weep. We don't belong anywhere else. We
belong here."
<p>   Most studies have shown that the people who feel worst about the
accident and their lives are the nearly 200,000 refugees who have
been resettled in other parts of Belarus. Those who stood their
ground, usually out of necessity, like Mrs. Shagovika, seem to have
a better attitude about their fate.
<p>   "At least I am at home," she said. Her house is a two-room
wooden cottage on a road only a few hundred yards from a fence that
marks the beginning of the forbidden zone. Most other houses there
have long been deserted. The window panes all blew out years ago.
<p>   But there are a few children playing in the street these days  -- 
new residents from parts of the former Russian empire where
persecution and uncertainty make this quiet town look promising.
Mrs. Shagovika eats the food and drinks the milk drawn from her
cow. People tell her it is dangerous but it is not exactly as if
they are busing new supplies in very often.
<p>   "I have to die sometime," she said, having resigned herself to
whatever fate was assigned to her on a spring day in 1986. "I want
to do it in a comfortable place."
<p>   The people of Microregion 17 of Gomel are not happy. Evacuated
from the most dangerous parts of the exclusion zone, they have been
forced to trade their simple wooden homes for cramped, windy
apartments on the soulless edge of the sprawling city. Empty vodka
bottles carpet the roads leading to the housing project.
<p>   "If I knew it would be this bad I would have chained myself to
the gates back home," Tamara Lusenko said. She was forcibly
evacuated shortly after the accident and now lives in a place that
to her is like a prison.
<p>   "Is the danger really so bad there now?" she asked wistfully,
hoping for the all clear. "Isn't it time we all went home?"
<p>   That is a question that may never be answered. Not even the
experts know what long-term exposure to low doses of radiation does
to people. Many suspect the effects will not be nearly as severe as
once feared. But it will take a generation or more to be certain.
<p>   "We are the great guniea pigs of modern times," said Yevgeny
Konoplya, director of the Radiobiology Institute of Belarus's
Academy of Sciences and an expert on post-Chernobyl effects.
<p>   "For the world we are getting to prove what radiation can do to
humans," he said. "We have suffered from the policies of a
country that no longer even exists. We have suffered from lies. And
we have suffered from other people's belief in technology. We once
had a beautiful country. What we have now is pain."

 <PRE>    </PRE>
Ten years ago, on April 26, 1986, a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl suffered two explosions that devastated the reactor itself, melted the nuclear fuel, spewed radioactive particles over most of the entire Northern Hemispehere, and left large patches of the richest heartland in the world inarrable, inhabitable and its human populations sick with radiation illnesses that persist and progress to this day.
<P>
The physical structure of the reactor was stabilized somewhat and release of radioactivity into the atmosphere was eventually stopped for the time being. But the fact remains that the reactor core melted and nuclear material flowed into the lower part of the building. Thousands of tons of sand and other materials were dumped into the core by helicopters to dampen the radioactivity; only some of this sand mixture actually reached the molten lava at the bottom of the reactor. An elaborate concrete and steel concrete "sarcophagus"--aptly named as a tomb, a chamber of death--was constructed around the reactor by nearly 800,000 extraordinarily brave Soviet workers.
<P>
The remoteness of the region of Chernobyl in the world, the informational isolation within then-still totalitarian Soviet Union, the defensiveness of Soviet engineers and bureaucrats, the pride and denial of indiginous peoples--radiation is invisible--and the resistence of the news media to dwell upon details of engineering to inform the public--all wove together a universal blanket of public ignorance regarding the actual effects of the disaster and the fact that the disaster is by no means over.
<P>
Robot films of the devastated and corroded conditions inside Unit 4 were shown in a television documentary three years ago. These films revealed that the bottom of the Chernobyl reactor is a mass of dust and debris. The question was raised in that documentary as to the imminence of a second massive disaster in Unit 4--a "radioactive dust accident"--with far worse consequences than the first disaster ten years ago. It would be worse because of the enormous quantity of dust and debris that now lies in the reactor chamber. Dust and debris particles can carry radioneucleids far distances in the atmosphere. They can remain suspended in the atmosphere for long periods of time, and they can fall to earth in unpredicatblly scattered "hotspots" here, there and everywhere.
<P>
Such a disaster could be monumentally dangerous to all living species beyond human imagining--no one knows because no one seems to be thinking much about it in public--and it's an imminent possibility that could occur at any moment. Yet we're standing around, most of us unaware of it, some of us thinking we shouldn't spend "the foreign aid," etc.
<P>
Although much has been publicized about the human health and environmental effects of the 1986 accident at Chernobyl and quite a bit has been discussed about the risk future accidents in <I>other</I> reactors, little has been said about the status of the particular physical plant at Chernobyl's Unit 4 or this pesky little question of the possibility of a second accident "waiting to happen" in precisely the same site. Principally I refer to the possibility that the precarious "lid" of the reactor sarcophagus could fall into the bottom of the reactor, causing a second explosion. I looked everywhere, read dozens of industry and engineering papers and plain old newspapers--and found zilch. I began to think the documentary I'd seen was a dream.
<P>
Finally comes an article by Richard Freemantle writing from England in the latest issue of <I>Chemical and Engineering News</I> (April 29, 1996) which corroborates the horrendous danger documented in those robot films. 
<P>
Freemantle reports that "several tons of fuel are dispersed as dust inside the sarcophagus." He goes on to say that "the long-term stability of the sarcophagus is causing concern. Cracks have appeared in the roof allowing rainwater to penetrate the tomb. The resulting high humidity inside has led to corrosion of internal metallic structures. The upper biological shield, a concrete cover for the reactor core, is wedged between the reactor walls and could fall. And the condition of the lower floor slab, damaged during the accident, is also uncertain." 
<P>
The extreme carefulness of engineering language permeats Freemantle's reporting and perhaps it is best not to become hysterical about what he's describing. Nonetheless, do not be lulled into relaxed complacency by his clinical language. Karen Richardson of Greenpeace in London puts the information more graphically:
<P>
"The sarcophagus is known to be crumbling," says Richardson. "If it does crumble, there's a danger it's going to hit reactor 3 as well, the reactor which is next to it." Keep in mind the fact, unknown to many, that the other reactors in the Chernobyl complex are <I>still operating</I> which means there is a large quantity of live nuclear fuel at risk right next door to Unit 4.
<P>
"The roof is the most serious problem," according to Valentin Kupny, deputy general director of the "shelter object" at Chernobyl. "It is still not completely closed to rainwater. We cannot say what will fall and when." He points out that an ongoing program to repair the roof includes strengthening the roof beams. 
<P> 
David R. Kyd of the International Atomic Energy Foundation in Vienna goes the farthest in describing what might happen if the reactor roof actually does collapse, coming closest to describing a radioactive dust accident, again using careful engineering language: "The problem of the festering reactor 4 within its sarcophagus needs to be addressed before groundwater becomes contaminated by the melted fuel still inside, and before the risk becomes a real one that <I>radioactive dust inside the structure could be resuspended in the atmosphere by any collapse of masonry." </I> [emphasis mine]
<P>
Not to second-guess the expert Mr. Kyd, but the facts appear to indicate that the risk has already become a real one.
<P>
According to CNN, grass fires in April 1996 in the region of Pripyat stirred up enough radioactive dust to be detected on the Swedish border. So we know it doesn't take much to create--or re-create--a serious problem at Chernobyl. The grass-fire incident involved only the radioactive dust <I>in the grass</I> outside the reactor. Imagine what would happen in a "resuspension in the atmosphere"--that means the air we breathe-- of the voluminous and intensely radioactive dust from <I>inside</I> the reactor.
<P>
I'd like to see the news media help every man, woman and child on earth imagine what this will be like, get us more information, write the truth in plainer language, and encourage the public to <I>do</I> something about this accident-waiting-to-happen right away.

<PRE>    </PRE>
If you are concerned about the safe decommissioning of Unit 4 at Chernobyl and want to be sure that the necessary funding and technical expertise are available, write to political leaders and persuade them to make the Chernobyl clean-up a top national security priority. Keep in mind that Russians and Ukrainians are resistent to dismantling these plants until they have alternative means of generating electricity for which they will need enormous funds. This "foreign aid"--loans from the World Bank and other countries, not only from the US--is a "buy off" in direct American interests, since the "resuspension of radioactive particles in the atmosphere" can extend all the way from Chernobyl to Hoboken or San Francisco. The American public can make it a priority by speaking up peristently and eloquently. 
<P>
Speak up against <I>all</I> nuclear reactors and weapons while you're at it. Chernobyl and Three Mile Island were only warnings. We'll really regret it when we stand around after the next accident at Unit 4, muttering to ourselves that, gee, we shoulda coulda....
<P>
Make use of the facts you find here and elsewhere on the Internet and in libraries. The topic is so important that you must be careful not to sound hysterical. Support your plea to political leaders with succint, forceful but non-strident argument. Make your case. Compel them. Not once but once a month. Write letters to editors, write op-ed pieces in your local paper.

<h2>10 Years Later, Through Fear, Chernobyl Still Kills in Belarus</h2>

<h5>By MICHAEL SPECTER</h5>
<p>   <img src="/images/s.gif" align=left alt=S>AVICHI, Belarus  --  This has been a cheerless decade for
18-year-old Svetlana Lebenok. She never finished school because
there are no longer any schools around here to finish. Her three
older brothers spend their days tethered to the vodka bottle. Her
parents live like invalids.
<p>   So when she heard there might be a job open in this emotionally
scarred, ecologically poisoned village not far from her home, and
only about 10 miles north of the Chernobyl nuclear power station in
Ukraine, she wasted no time worrying about her health. She just
grabbed it.
<p>   "Everyone is afraid here all the time," she said, standing
behind the counter of the only store in this mostly abandoned
village, where she rents a room from an older woman because there
are no buses to take her home at night. "People talk a lot about
how Chernobyl killed our country. That may be. But sometimes I
think the fear is worse than the sickness."
<p>   Ten years after the catastrophe at Unit 4 of the V.I. Lenin
Atomic Power Station turned the word Chernobyl into the world's
foremost symbol of technological disaster, the legacy of the
accident can be felt in every part of this wasted land.
<p>   The fire, which burned out of control for five days, spewed more
than 50 tons of radioactive fallout across Belarus, Ukraine and
western Russia.
<p>   Even now, the full medical consequences of the accident are
unclear, but some truths have emerged. In terms of deaths  --  and
even probable long-term illness  --  Chernobyl was not the worst
industrial accident of recent times.
<p>   Fewer than 500 people died so far as a direct result. By
contrast, the chemical leak at Bhopal, India, in 1984 killed at
least 2,000 people and injured some 200,000.
<p>   Oil fires during the Persian Gulf war in Kuwait and enormous
pipeline spills in Russia may have caused more serious, immediate
damage to the environment.
<p>   But in terms of political significance, economic dislocation and
absolute and enduring fear, Chernobyl stands alone.
<p>   "It's not too much to say that Chernobyl helped destroy the
Soviet Union and end the cold war," said Richard Wilson, professor
of physics at Harvard University.
<p>   "What it did to Belarus is hard to describe," he said while
attending a recent conference in Minsk, the coutry's capital, on
the effects of the accident. "But the worst disease here is not
radiation sickness. Except for children the physical effects are
not easy to measure. The truth is that the fear of Chernobyl has
done much more damage than Chernobyl itself."
<p>   Those are strong words, but even a few figures  --  some time spent
traveling through the partial ghost towns of southern Belarus  -- 
bear them out. The radiation released after the explosion at the
reactor's core on April 26, 1986, was nearly 200 times that of the
combined releases from the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki
in 1945.
<p>   The wind carried by far the heaviest radioactive deposits across
this country, where even today 25 percent of the land is considered
uninhabitable. Thousands of villages were abandoned. Schools were
closed, prime cattle were slaughtered by the ton, huge factories
were shut without a second thought. Desperate villagers fled their
homes with only the clothes on their backs.
<p>   The government here says it devotes more than 15 percent of its
gross national product  --  a total of more than $235 billion over the
last decade  --  to paying the cost of resettling tens of thousands of
people, as well as the medical and social bills growing from
Chernobyl, which is still operating just across the border. Yet
nobody is sure it is making any progress.
<p>   But the worst scars have settled in the mind. And no place has
been punished more than the Gomel region of Belarus, where the
Soviet authorities denied the accident for several days, allowing
people to linger in the radiation, then lied about its severity.
<p>   An area of nearly 2 million people  --  20 percent of the country's
population  --  Gomel once had the most fertile farmland in all
Belarus. Today, it is as if somebody had sown the land with salt:
20 of 21 agricultural districts produce nothing. People have become
paralyzed with fear.
<p>   They are afraid to move, afraid to stay, afraid to marry and
afraid to have families. All normal life stopped here simply
because there was a strong northerly wind on April 26, 1986.
<p>   For months after the accident, from northern Finland to the
Adriatic Sea, thousands of women chose to have abortions in panic
over the possible effects of exposure to radiation.
<p>   In Gomel, even today, there are three abortions for every live
birth, a rate more than twice that for the rest of the country.
<p>   "People say we are not really sicker than any one else in the
former Soviet Union," said Nikokai I. Ermakov, the man in charge
of Gomel's response to the accident. "They are talking about blood
diseases and death rates. That is not my interest. My interest is
life in Gomel. Here we have no jobs. The pristine forests have
radiation signs posted all over them. Poor farmers can't eat what
they grow. Is it so strange that what happened here seems like a
biblical curse?"
<br>
<p>   The city of Gomel, some 70 miles north of Chernobyl, has more
than half a million residents. But it is barren in the surrounding
region, where the soil still holds most of the radioactive fallout.
Driving south into the Exclusion Zone  --  the area within an 18-mile
radius of Chernobyl that is still considered too polluted for human
habitation  --  presents a visitor with one of modern life's eeriest
visions.
<p>   Scores of farms, villages and hamlets remain empty here. Huge
cafeterias, the buildings where most people ate all their meals in
Soviet times, have been stripped and their deeply contaminated
parts sold on the black market. Cars lie partly buried in the loamy
soil, and empty buckets hover silently over poisoned wells.
<p>   Deserted houses stand with coats still on hooks. There are
butter churns, pots on the shelves and stacks of newspapers
everywhere. "My dearest Lydia," reads one postcard on the floor
of a house in the empty village of Molochki, dated a couple weeks
before the accident. "I hope you pass the exams successfully. Best
of luck and cheer up. Your loving grandma Sasha." Half a dozen
dolls were strewn nearby.
<p>   Several thousand people still live scattered in some of these
towns. They are not supposed to, but many have no choice. The
radiation was deposited unevenly across the region, with some
villages heavily contaminated and other neighboring villages almost
untouched. Most of them attribute every ill or problem in their
lives to "the station," which is what they call Chernobyl.
<p>   "My teeth are falling out, and I can't see too well anymore,"
said Volodya Ronashev, a 48-year-old forest administrator who lives
and works in the zone. "I used to be healthy. What else could it
be but the station?"
<p>   The truth about the causes of medical illness is often hard to
find, and much harder to prove. There seems little doubt that the
enormous burst of ionizing radiation released from Chernobyl has
affected the thyroids of many thousand children in Belarus, Russia
and Ukraine.
<p>   The rise in cancer rates is too stark for any other conclusion.
There were seven cases of thyroid cancer among children in Belarus
in the decade preceding the accident. Since 1990, there have been
more than 300 cases, almost none of which have so far been fatal.
But what about other diseases? Are people in this contaminated land
really sicker than anywhere else?
<p>   "Nuclear energy is invisible," said Dr. Johan Havenaar, chief
of emergency psychiatry at the University Hospital in Utrecht, the
Netherlands. "It's treacherous. It scares people so they think it
causes them to be sick."
<p>   Like most doctors or radiation specialists, Havenaar readily
concedes that it is too early to know everything about the effects
of Chernobyl. But he decided to test the widely held belief that
people in Gomel are already sicker than people elsewhere.
<p>   He compared about 1,500 Gomel residents with a similar sample
from the northern Russian town of Tver, where no radioactivity from
Chernobyl had reached. The Gomel Project, as the study came to be
known, lasted from 1992 to 1995 and included the most exhaustive
medical examinations the participants had ever received.
<p>   The study showed that the people from Gomel said they were five
times as sick as those from Tver. And they almost always attributed
those illnesses to some result of radiation from Chernobyl. In
reality, after clinical exams, the level and types of physical
illness was similar  --  although psychological distress in Gomel was
far greater.
<p>   "These people are sick," Havenaar said. "It's just not the
type of illness they think. We have to realize that the
psychological damage here runs very deep. And we need to treat that
every bit as vigorously as we need to treat cancer."
<p>   Svetlana Lebenok, the shop clerk who rents a room in the
radiated depths of Savichi so that she can sell butter and eggs to
the 35 families left living there  --  and make extra wages doing it
in a danger zone  --  put the issue another way.
<p>   "I don't think my parents have really done anything at all but
sit in a room since the accident," she said. "They weren't
injured. I know that. People with cancer get help. But isn't there
anything they can do for everyone else? There must be some
answer."
<p>   The reality is that there are no simple answers to the range of
health, environmental and money problems created by the Chernobyl
accident.
<p>   Eight times in the last decade the leaders of Ukraine have
decided to close the giant facility's remaining three reactors. And
eight times they have changed their minds because shutting the
plant would strip 5,000 jobs from a region already devastated
economically.
<p>   For Belarus, the problem is even more acute. The country most
affected by history's worst nuclear accident does not even have a
nuclear power plant. Belarus opposed the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, and when it was left alone it was left with immense bills it
could not possibly handle. An agricultural land tainted by the
ultimate modern poison is of little use to anyone.
<p>   The people here have long sought to reunite with Russia, in part
so that it may better pay for Chernobyl. (On March 23, the two
Slavic countries agreed to form a union that would tie them to each
other politically, economically and culturally, though they would
remain separate countries.)
<br>
<p>   "The Chernobyl disaster taught us there are no borders to the
modern world," said Ivan A. Kenik, the chief Belarus official in
charge of the Chernobyl aftermath. "It taught us to question faith
in technology and in ourselves. I now wonder if we as a
civilization have the knowledge, strength and wisdom to survive
this nuclear century?"
<p>   Many of the people living in the region think they already know
the answer. There has always been such a lack of certainty about
the effects of the accident and information from the government and
health experts that nobody believes much of anything now.
Relatively few even seek answers, although several health centers
are available for questions every day.
<p>   For years after the accident all those in the Gomel area got
extra wages and free medical care. When the government realized it
could not keep up the policy for much longer, it applied a 12
percent "Chernobyl tax" to wage earners. Even so, the benefits
are no longer available to most people.
<p>   "They come around here and ask us why we never left," said
Elena A. Shagovika, 67, a resident of Khoiniki, about 30 miles
north of the reactor. "Where were we going to go? And what would
we do there? When my old neighbors come back to see us they just
stand in the road and weep. We don't belong anywhere else. We
belong here."
<p>   Most studies have shown that the people who feel worst about the
accident and their lives are the nearly 200,000 refugees who have
been resettled in other parts of Belarus. Those who stood their
ground, usually out of necessity, like Mrs. Shagovika, seem to have
a better attitude about their fate.
<p>   "At least I am at home," she said. Her house is a two-room
wooden cottage on a road only a few hundred yards from a fence that
marks the beginning of the forbidden zone. Most other houses there
have long been deserted. The window panes all blew out years ago.
<p>   But there are a few children playing in the street these days  -- 
new residents from parts of the former Russian empire where
persecution and uncertainty make this quiet town look promising.
Mrs. Shagovika eats the food and drinks the milk drawn from her
cow. People tell her it is dangerous but it is not exactly as if
they are busing new supplies in very often.
<p>   "I have to die sometime," she said, having resigned herself to
whatever fate was assigned to her on a spring day in 1986. "I want
to do it in a comfortable place."
<p>   The people of Microregion 17 of Gomel are not happy. Evacuated
from the most dangerous parts of the exclusion zone, they have been
forced to trade their simple wooden homes for cramped, windy
apartments on the soulless edge of the sprawling city. Empty vodka
bottles carpet the roads leading to the housing project.
<p>   "If I knew it would be this bad I would have chained myself to
the gates back home," Tamara Lusenko said. She was forcibly
evacuated shortly after the accident and now lives in a place that
to her is like a prison.
<p>   "Is the danger really so bad there now?" she asked wistfully,
hoping for the all clear. "Isn't it time we all went home?"
<p>   That is a question that may never be answered. Not even the
experts know what long-term exposure to low doses of radiation does
to people. Many suspect the effects will not be nearly as severe as
once feared. But it will take a generation or more to be certain.
<p>   "We are the great guniea pigs of modern times," said Yevgeny
Konoplya, director of the Radiobiology Institute of Belarus's
Academy of Sciences and an expert on post-Chernobyl effects.
<p>   "For the world we are getting to prove what radiation can do to
humans," he said. "We have suffered from the policies of a
country that no longer even exists. We have suffered from lies. And
we have suffered from other people's belief in technology. We once
had a beautiful country. What we have now is pain."

<font size=5>T</font size=5>oday I want to have more of a conversation than deliver a formal speech about the <BR>great debate
now raging in our nation, a conversation not so much about <I>what</I> we should do, but about <I>how</I> we should resolve these great questions, here in Washington and in communities all across our country. I want to talk about the obligation of citizenship imposed on the President and people in power and upon all Americans to find common ground.... 
<P>
Politics has become more and more fractured and pluralized, just like the rest of our lives. Its exciting in some ways. But as we divide into more and more sharply defined organized groups around more and more stratified issues, as we communicate more and more with people in extreme rhetoric through talk radio, mass mailings or sometimes semi-hysterical telephone messages right before elections, or 
30-second ads designed far more to inflame than to inform, as we see politicians actually getting language lessons on how to turn their adversaries into aliens, it is difficult to draw the conclusion that our political system is producing the sort of discussion that will give us the kind of results we need....
<P>
One great debate were having, for example, is about the nature and role of government. If we want to maintain a public response, there must be a relentless effort to change but not to eviscerate the government. We have tried weak government, nonexistent
government, in a complex industrial society where powerful interests that are driven only by short-term considerations call all the shots. We tried it decades and decades ago. It didnt work out very well. It didnt even produce a very good economic policy. It had to do with the onset of the Depression. 
<P>
On the other hand, we know that an insensitive, overly bureaucratic, yesterday-oriented, special-interest-dominated government can be just as big a nightmare. We've done what we could to change that. The government has 150,000 fewer people working today than it did when I took office. Weve gotten rid of thousands of regulations and hundreds of programs. We've dramatically improved government efficiency. We have a few shining stars like the Small Business Administration, which today has a budget thats 40 percent lower than it was when I took office, thats making twice as many loans, has dramatically increased the loans to women and minorities, has not decreased loans to white males and hasnt made a loan to a single unqualified person. 
<P>
We can do these things--and its not an "either/or." You dont have to choose between being personally right and having common goals. 
<P>
...The important thing is not whether Im right or my opponents are--the important thing is <I>how</I> we are going to resolve this debate. 
<P>

<P>
I believe -- and youve got to decide whether you believe this --  that a democracy requires a certain amount of common ground. I don't believe you can solve complex questions like this at the grass-roots level or at the national level or anywhere in between if you have too much extremism of rhetoric and excessive partisanship. Times are changing too fast. We need to keep our eyes open. We need to keep our ears open. We need to be flexible. We need to have new solutions based on old values. 
<P>
We can't get there unless we can establish some common ground. And that seems to me to impose certain specific responsibilities on citizens and on political leaders. 
<P>
Let me say what those responsibilities are. They may be painfully
self-evident, but I dont think theyre irrelevant. Every citizen in this country has got to say, "What do I have to do for myself or my family, or nothing else counts?" The truth is that nobody can repeal the laws of the global economy, and people who dont have a certain level of education and skills are not going to be employable in good jobs with long-term prospects. Thats just a fact. 
<P>
The truth is that if every child in this country had both parents contributing to his or her support and nourishment and emotional stability and education and future, wed have almost no poor kids, instead of having over 20 percent of our children born in poverty. 
<P>
More of our citizens have got to say, "What should I do in my community?" You know, its not just enough to bemoan the rising crime rate or how kids are behaving and whatever -- thats just not enough. It is not enough. Not when you have example after example of all these local initiatives and community corporate initiatives that are now going around the country... 
<P>

<P>
People have to ask themselves: "What should I be doing through my church or my community organizations?" People who feel very strongly about one of the most contentious issues in our society, abortion, ought to look at the United Pentecostal Church. Theyll adopt any child born, no matter what race, no matter how disabled, no matter what their problems are. There is a positive, constructive outlet for people who are worried about every problem in this country if they will go and seek it out. And there is nothing the government can do that will replace that kind of energy. 

<P>
Are we making good decisions? Do we approach these decisions in the right frame of
mind? Do we have enough information? Do we know what were doing? I can tell you, the American people are hungry for information. When I announced my balanced budget and we put it on the Internet, there were a few hours when we were getting 50,000 requests an hour. The American people want to know these things. 
<P>
So I say to every citizen, do you have the information you need? Do you ever have a
discussion with somebody who is different from you? Not just people who agree with you but somebody whos different. Do you ever listen to one of those radio programs that has the opposite point of view to yours, even if you have to grind your teeth? And what kind of language do you use when you talk to people who are of different political parties with different views? Is it the language of respect or language that sees a suspect? How do you deal with people? This is a huge thing.

<P>
Thomas Jefferson said he had no fear of the most extreme views in America being
expressed with the greatest passion as long as reason had a chance. Citizens have to give reason a chance. 
<P>
What do the political leaders have to do? I would say several things... We need more conversation and less combat. When we differ we ought to offer an alternative. We ought to look relentlessly at the long-term and remind the American people that the problems we have developed over a long period of years. And we shouldnt just berate the worst in America, we ought to spend more time celebrating the best. 
<P>
Those are things that I think I should do and I think every other leader in this country ought to do. 
<P>
Conversation, not combat... Differ, but present an alternative... Americans dont want "just say no" politics. If they can get the truth, theyll make the right decision 99 times out of 100. And we have to offer an alternative. And so do they. We all should. When we differ, we should say what were for, not just what were against. 
<P>
Look for the long-term... Our job is not to get reelected, its to think about the 
long-term because the problems are long-term problems. 
<P>
President Havel said in his Harvard commencement speech, "The main task of the
present generation of politicians is not to ingratiate themselves with the public through the decisions they take or their smiles on television. Their role is something quite different -- to assume their share of responsibility for the long-range prospects of our world, and thus, to set an example for the public in whose sight they work. After all, politics is a matter of serving the community, which means that it is morality in practice." 
<P>
Maybe the most important thing is, we should not just condemn the worst, we ought to find the best and celebrate it, and then relentlessly promote it as a model to be followed. 
<P>
Thats what AmeriCorps is all about. The national service program gives young people a chance to earn money for college by working in grass-roots community projects all across the country. I was in Texas the other day walking the streets of an inner city and a girl with a college degree from another state was there working with welfare mothers because she was raised by a welfare mother who taught her to go to school, work hard, and get a college degree, and she did.

<P>
We have to find a way to systematically see these things that work sweep across this
country with high standards and high expectations and break through all this bureaucracy that keeps people from achieving. We can do that. 
<P>
Now, I believe, obviously, that my New Covenant approach is better than the Republican Contract approach to deal with the problems of middle class dreams and middle class values. But when I ran for this job I said I wanted to restore the American Dream and to bring the American people together. I have now come to the conclusion, having watched this drama unfold here and all around our country in the last two and a half years, that we cannot do the first unless we can do the second. We cant restore the American Dream unless we can find some way to bring the American people closer together. Therefore, how we resolve these differences is as important as what specific positions we advocate. 
<P>
I think we have got to move beyond division and resentment to common ground. Weve got to go beyond cynicism to a sense of possibility. America is an idea. Were not one race. Were not one ethnic group. Were not one religious group. We do share a common piece of ground here. When you read the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, and youll find that this country is an idea. And it is still going now in our 220th year because we all had a sense of possibility. We never thought there was a mountain we couldnt climb, a river we couldnt ford, or a problem we couldnt solve. 
<P>
We need to respect our differences and hear them, but it means instead of having shrill voices of discord, we need a chorus of harmony. In a chorus of harmony you know there are lots of differences, but you can hear all the voices and we can hear the notes we have in common. And that is important. 
<P>
And weve got to challenge every American in every sector of our society to do their part. We have to challenge each other in a positive way and hold accountable people who claim to be not responsible for any consequences of their actions that they did not specifically intend -- whether its in government, business, labor, entertainment, the media. None of us can say were not accountable for our actions because we did not intend those consequences, even though we made some contribution to them. 
<P>
You know, Oklahoma City took a lot of the meanness out of America. It gave us a chance for more sober reflection. It gave us a chance to come to the same conclusion that Thomas Jefferson did in his first inaugural. Thomas Jefferson was elected the first time by the House of Representatives in a bitterly contested election in the first outbreak of completely excessive partisanship in American history. In that sense, it was a time not unlike this time. And Jefferson said: "Let us unite with our heart and mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and life itself are but dreary things." 
<P>
In our hour of the greatest peril and the greatest division when we were fighting over the issue which we still have not fully resolved, Abraham Lincoln said, "We are not enemies but friends. We must not be enemies." 
<P>
My friends, amidst all our differences, let us find a new, common ground. 
<P>
Thank you very much.

<PRE>    </PRE>

              
<font size=5>O</font size=5>n December 15, 1996, Melissa Healy reported in the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> on efforts to build a movement based upon the ideas of sociology professors Amitai Etzioni of George Washington University and Robert Putnam of Harvard. For years Prof. Etzioni has decried the uncivil tone in American life. Prof. Putnam has recently produced several  well-received essays that have re-awakened interest in renewal not only of civility but civic activism on a grassroots local level to bring life back to democracy. 
<P>
As readers of The Real News Page are aware, we view Putnam's ideas as crucial to an understanding of how the rise of the media age--especially television--may have played a role in the deterioration of civic activity and participation in the numerous community civic associations that thrived in the America of the 19th Century described by Alexis De Toqueville. Putnam feels that this decline in civic associations has, in turn, led to a decrease in civic involvement at all levels, including voting and even newspaper readership. 
<P>
(See Putnam's essays on this site: <A HREF="putnmtv1.htm">The Strange Disappearance of Civic America (1996)</A>, especially the last section <A HREF="putnmtv4.htm">Is Televison the Culprit?</A> , plus <A HREF="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_democracy/v006/putnam.html">Bowling Alone</A> and <A HREF="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal
_of_democracy/v006/putnam.interview.html"> Interview with Robert Putnam</A>. You can also take a look at my own essay <A HREF="talktown.htm">Talk and the Town: Can Media and Community Co-Exist?</A>).
<P>
President Clinton, a student of Robert Putnam's work, has been calling for greater civility and civic activism since he first took office in 1992. Ironically, in a story reported in the same issue of the <I>L.A. Times</I> on December 15, 1996, Clinton  remarked at length on "the politics of personal destruction and meanness that have replaced debate over issues and ideas." President Clinton has directly experienced this--and done his best to ignore it--as have many other national leaders. Clinton's speech on <A HREF="together.htm">"Responsible Citizenship and Common Ground"</A> is worth reading in this regard.
<P>
Now, the <I>Times</I> reports that an Institute for Civil Society has been endowed in Boston with $35 million from an anonymous donor, one of the largest gifts in the history of philanthropy. The Institute will be headed by the recently retired former House Representative from Colorado, Patricia Schroeder. 
<P>
On other fronts, former Senators Sam Nunn and Bill Bradley have joined the National Commission on Society, Culture and Community, sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania (which also houses the Annenberg School of Communications headed by respected media analyst Kathleen Hall Jamieson). The Pew Charitable Trusts are planning to spend $14 million on civic renewal issues in the United States in 1997, along with other major foundations. 
<P>
Ms. Healy reports that some of these efforts will be directed to "rebuilding a lost sense of community the old-fashioned way: by funding projects designed to help shattered--and even just
frayed--neighborhoods get back on their feet."
<P>
Ms. Schroeder and her Insitute will be on the lookout for civic projects to increase "corporate and entrepreneurial responsibility for disadvantaged communities and individual responsibility on the part of members of those communities." 
<P>
To try to reinvigorate a sense of civility among members of Congress, the Pew Foundation will sponsor a bipartisan retreat in March 1997 for House lawmakers "to contemplate how to improve the tenor of debate in the lower chamber." Will Mr. Gingrich and Mr. DeLay attend?                        
<P> 
Brookings Institution senior fellow and <I>Washington Post</I> political columnist E.J. Dionne wants to "bring together academics and activists from across the political spectrum to explore questions that divide right and left and lie at the heart of all civil-society debates: What, if anything, has government done to erode the neighborhood and community institutions that bind Americans together and what can government do to help foster
and restore them?"
<P>
The Real News Page would add: What, if anything, has television and all media done to erode the neighborhood and community institutions that bind America together and what can television and all media do to help foster and restore them?" The same questions can be asked about all major American corporations.
<P>
Paul Light of the Pew Charitable Trusts made one of the most interesting comments in the entire story when he said that as America sought to export democratic methods and institutions to central Europe and the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall, "they realized that the product they sought to export appeared [was] in poor repair... There's a tendency among the people you're trying to help [overseas] to ask: 'How's your election process going?' " said Light. "As you're working on strengthening democracy in Central Europe, it may sensitize you to the fact it's not working so well in the United States." 
<P>
Sam Nunn proclaimed in an address to the newly launched National Commission on Civic Renewal, "A broad consensus has emerged among both experts and ordinary citizens that the quality of our public and civic life has declined alarmingly in recent decades."  
<P>
Univ. of Pensylvania President Judith Rodin, a psychologist, noted that "We're not necessarily arguing [that] we all ought to be nice to one another," Rodin said. "But we must help people listen to one another, take the time to really hear and engage with each
other and take on the hard task of citizenship." 
<P>
<I>L.A. Times</I> reporter Healy does not carefully distinguish "civil" (manner of debate) from "civic" (involved in matters of the town). While several different efforts seem to be going on here (civility, civic repair of inner cities, and civic activism in community associations--a la Putnam--leading to renewal of  democracy), they all work together and the overall interest is, to say the least, lauditory. --J.W.P.

<P>
<I>By George Clifford III, <BR>The Washington Monthly, March 1996</I></CENTER></font color="#0000ff"></I>
<PRE>  </PRE>
 

In July 1994, Senator Lauch Faircloth and Judge David Sentelle lunched together in the quietly elegant Senate dining room. Just days later, a three judge panel headed by Sentelle removed Robert B. Fiske Jr., a moderate Republican, from his position as independent counsel in the Whitewater affair-and replaced him with an active Republican partisan, Kenneth Starr.
<P>
Sentelle was supposed to be making his decisions free from political
influence. Faircloth was a leader of the Republican charge against the
Clintons on Whitewater; just weeks before, he had written Attorney General Janet Reno to complain about Fiske. So the lunch raised considerable controversy: Had Faircloth used the occasion to lobby or pressure Sentelle? Fiske's axing-after nine months and $2.5 million worth of work that had yet to produce material damaging to the Clintons-was precisely what Faircloth was after.
<P>
A year later came the news that approximately five months after the lunch and Fiske's replacement, Faircloth had hired Jane Oldham Sentelle, the judge's wife, as a receptionist for his Senate office. She had started in January 1995 at a salary of $20,000, which was later raised to $22,500.
<P>
That's more or less equivalent to the amount Rose Law Firm earned from its work for Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan in the mid eighties-work that has come under intensive scrutiny partly because then-Governor Bill Clinton may have helped steer it his wife's way. As the recently released billing records show, the firm earned approximately $21,000 from representing Madison Guaranty; Hillary Clinton's take was about a third of that total.
<P>
Hillary Clinton used poor judgment by participating in an apparent
conflict-of-interest; she may have even been modestly on the take. But the same could be said of the Sentelles. At the least, a senator and a ranking federal judge had thumbed their noses at the principle of keeping special prosecutors insulated from even the appearance of political pressure-the principle the Sentelle-led panel had cited in replacing Fiske, who had been appointed by Janet Reno.
And so for a Whitewater-fixated press corps avidly sniffing long-dead trails between Hillary Clinton and Madison like bloodhounds, Sentelle's hiring should have been a story with legs. Instead, the story of Jane Sentelle's job got almost no play.
<P>
The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> ran a 28-word item on the front page in its "Washington Wire" Column. The Associated Press sent out a story by veteran reporter John Solomon that included comments from analysts criticizing the hiring.
<P>
But The <I>Washington Post,</I> The <I>New York Times,</I> and the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> did not pick up the AP story, even as a blurb, nor did they assign their own reporters to probe it. "I hate to say this," Andrew Rosenthal, Washington editor of The <I>New York Times,</I> told me when I asked him about the story, "but I don't remember it." "We should have had something on that," said The <I>Washington Post</I>'s Al Kamen, who added that the story was discussed in the newsroom but never made it into the paper. Editorial writers and columnists were almost uniformly silent. The only exception: a guest op-ed by Gilbert
Cranberg in The <I>New York Times,</I> where he argued that the judges that appoint independent counsels should have to abide by the judicial code of ethics.
<P>
The press treatment of the Sentelle-Faircloth indiscretion was no aberration. Whitewater has been characterized by a strange bifurcation: While a zealous press corps chases every lead about the Clintons, it ignores hints that the GOP investigation may be suspect as well.
<P>
Whitewater isn't only about what the Clintons did or didn't do; it is also a story of the system being used and abused by the Clintons' political opponents. Many of those opponents have the scent of conflicts of their own-and the stench of partisan agendas. Sentelle has rock-solid Republican credentials. He's best known as the judge who overturned Ollie North's Iran-Contra conviction, and he had built a reputation before joining the federal bench as a firebrand Republican county chairman in North Carolina. He was the protege of another strongly anti-Clinton North Carolinian, Jesse Helms, who also dined with Sentelle and Faircloth that day in the Senate dining room.
<P>
The panel Sentelle headed appointed a man with some possible conflicts of his own. Kenneth Starr was U.S. Solicitor General under the president Clinton defeated. Just prior to his appointment, Starr had announced he was at work on a friend-of-the-court brief in the Paula Jones case; the brief was to argue that Clinton's incumbency did not shield him from civil lawsuits. Starr is also an active contributor to Republican campaigns, and he has done legal work for the Republican National Committee since becoming independent
counsel.
<P>
Then there's Lauch Faircloth. A North Carolinian and former Democrat, he has gone to extraordinary lengths to demonstrate his Republican bona fides. He has pushed Whitewater arguably harder than any other member of Congress; indeed, he has been so aggressive that Al D'Amato had to rein him in. Like other Republicans, Faircloth has seized on Bill Clinton's possible conflict-of-interest when he was governor of Arkansas and technically in charge of regulating the savings-and-loan of James McDougal, his partner in the Whitewater land deal. The press has dutifully followed Faircloth's lead, though reams of copy have yet to prove that Clinton abused his position.
<P>
But Faircloth has a possible conflict of his own. He sits on the Senate
Banking Committee, which oversees all banking legislation (as well as the Whitewater hearings). And as of 1993, according to a recent Business Week report, he owned $850,000 of bank stock. Accusing Faircloth of using his position to enhance his stocks would be premature. But given the scrutiny Clinton has received for a similar situation involving far smaller amounts of money, it would be fair to look into it.
<P>
A telling comment about the way Whitewater has been played came from a paper that did mention Jane Sentelle's hiring. The Washington Times, which frequently headlines with the latest Whitewater mini-scandal, mentioned Jane Sentelle's job in Greg Pierce's "Inside Politics" column. "It remains to be seen," Pierce wrote of the hiring, "whether politicians and the media will lose their lunch over this."
<P>
They didn't. Senate Democrats said nary a word about the hiring-and neither did a reactive media. In the Whitewater affair, the press has been herded by whoever cracks the loudest whip, and that's usually been the Republicans. After all, Whitewater itself didn't become a story overnight. Clinton adversaries like David Bossie, formerly of the right-wing lobby Citizens United, pushed for months to get it serious attention in the mainstream media. Where is Bossie now? The same place as Jane Sentelle--on Faircloth's payroll, as an assistant to the senator.

What follows excerpts of an article which appeared in Issue #507 of<BR> RACHEL'S ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH WEEKLY, August 15, 1996:
<PRE>   </PRE>        
<font size=5>F</font size=5>or the past 15 years,
Americans have been angry at government.  Now, a new survey
shows, they are also angry at big corporations.....
<P>
The survey and focus groups were conducted by EDK Associates and
by Peter D. Hart Research, working under contract to the Preamble
Center for Public Policy in Washington, D.C. ...  The sample size
of 800 means that the surveyors can be 95% confident that their
results are accurate plus or minus 3.5%.
<P>
Almost without exception, people who feel negative about
corporations feel VERY negative.  And huge numbers are feeling
negative.  Large majorities see corporate behavior as a "serious
national problem." When asked whether reduced benefits (health care
and pensions) are a "serious problem" or not, 82% say yes.  Large
layoffs during times of profitability are regarded as a "serious
problem" by 81%. Huge CEO salaries (which are now 200 times as
large as the average worker's pay) are a "serious problem" for
79%. Stagnant wages (wages that don't keep up with the rising
cost of living) are a "serious problem" for 76%.
<P>
People do not buy the explanation that recent corporate behavior
is required by a competitive global economy.  Only 22% of those
surveyed said they thought competitiveness motivated corporate
behavior; 70% said they thought greed was the motivating factor
(while 7% said they didn't know).  The view that greed is what
motivates corporations, not competitiveness, crosses all age
groups, all races, all educational backgrounds, and all incomes in the studied group. It even crosses political parties: 79% of Democrats, and 63% of Republicans said they thought corporate greed explains downsizing, stagnant wages, and reduced job benefits.
<P>
Furthermore, most people in the studied group saw corporate greed as a greater
problem for the economy than government corruption, waste, and
inefficiency. Asked to choose between wasteful government and
corporate greed as the main obstacle preventing the middle class
from getting ahead, people chose corporate greed (46%) over
government waste (28%), with a substantial percentage (22%)
volunteering the opinion that both were responsible.  Thus,
despite continued high levels of public dissatisfaction with
government, extrapolating from this study, 68% of Americans believe big corporations are as
responsible as, or more responsible than, government for the
economic problems of the middle class.  Even among Republicans,
55% says corporations are at least as big a problem as government.
<P>
What is surprising--members of the survey team said they were
"shocked" and "amazed" by these findings --is that the public is
ready to support government action to control corporate behavior.
Most people surveyed (69%) say they generally favor government
intervention to ensure that corporations act more responsibly.
Some 42% strongly favor this position.  This is an important
reversal of political ideas that have dominated America for 15
years.
<P>
 Environmentalists, and others seeking reform, can build on
people's anger at government AND corporations by emphasizing how
government caters to the interests of large corporations, wasting
taxpayers' money in the bargain. The true relationship between
corporations and government is a reciprocal one: corporations
dump mountains of cash into elections, corrupting the basic
institutions of our democracy while putting anti-government,
pro-corporate extremists into office. 
<P>
In turn, government then
subsidizes big corporations and relieves their tax burden. Profit-motivated
corporations then turn around and take advantage of their workers, who are
already bearing the brunt of the nation's unfair tax system. This
kind of subsidy abuse by corporations--and the corrupt election
process which feeds it--could easily become a target of
significant anger. With some work, the result might be a law to
get corporate and other private money out of our elections.
Democracy in this country would be advanced in a major way, as
would environmental protection.

Broadcast for week ending 7/19/96:
<P>
A look at some of the week's press:
<P>
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>Time Magazine Makes Joke of Politics While Serious Issues Slide By</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<P>
<font size=5>J</font size=5>anine Jackson: <I>Time</I> magazine's July 15 piece on the Presidential race provided a good snapshot of what's wrong with mainstream campaign coverage.  The story, titled "Peering through the Smoke," began by describing Bob Dole's interview with Katie Couric on smoking -- the one where Dole insisted, "I'm not certain whether it's addictive."  <I>Time</I> went on to discuss Butt Man, the character the Democrats invented as a symbol of Dole's dependence on tobacco contributions, and from there went on to talk about Craig Livingstone, the Filegate culprit who, it turns out, ran similar stunts with men in chicken suits during the '92 campaign.
<P> 
What moral does <I>Time</I> draw from this?  "The political silly season is upon us--a patch of especially funky Washington weather that is spreading nationwide and reminding Americans why they hate politics.  Every election has one of these strange spells, which always combine high dudgeon and low farce: politicians trading blows over trivial issues while important concerns get reduced to the level of cartoon."
<P>
Well, we might ask <I>Time</I> magazine, whose fault is that?  The article started out talking about tobacco, a product that kills an
estimated 400,000 Americans a year -- hardly a trivial issue.  And the campaign contributions that lead a politician to say such absurd things are perhaps the most important issue in politics. <I>Time</I>, and the rest of the media, could have focused their attention on those issues -- in fact, Peter Jennings of ABC did so in a recent documentary on the politics of tobacco. If <I>Time</I> wants to get distracted by men in chicken suits, that's its problem.  
<P> 
The intro to this piece reads: "Specious claims and strange mascots have turned the race to farce at times.  But there are serious lessons too.  Will the candidates learn them?"  These "serious lessons" -- which take up more than half the article -- turn out to be lessons for the candidates on how to manipulate the press -- i.e., "If a story hurts, cut it off fast."  Unfortunately, this is the kind of coverage that people rely on to figure out who to vote for.
<P>
A footnote to Katie Couric's interview with Dole:  During that
interview, when Dole was being pressed about his tobacco
contributions, Dole snapped that Couric might be "breaking FEC
regulations" by "sticking up for the Democrats all the time."  Of course, the Federal Election Communication does not regulate the content of political reporting -- and can't, under the First Amendment -- but what does Dole's comment suggest about a Dole administration's respect for a free press?
<P>
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>Press Coverage of Immigration: More Heat Than Light?</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<P>
<font size=5>L</font size=5>aura Flanders: The July 4th broadcast of ABC World News Tonight led with some fireworks of the kind that provide plenty of heat but no light whatsoever. The argument over immigration, Peter Jennings told viewers, "turned violent today when demonstrators on both sides of the issue met in the streets of Los Angeles." While viewers watched footage of confrontations between unidentified protestors, correspondent Brian Rooney explained that a group called the "voice of citizens" was demonstrating against illegal immigration when they met counter-demonstrators from what Rooney described as a "an immigrant group carrying placards bearing Communist slogans."  
<P>
Since the immigrant group is never identified, no one gets to
explain exactly what those signs said, but chasing after facts
doesn't seem to be the point of this piece.  After Rerunning the infamous footage of the April beating by police officers of immigrants who'd been pulled from a truck, Rooney says that that brutality "further polarized Californians to view illegal
immigrants as either victims or criminals". Only one side of that discussion is on offer here, though. Rooney goes next to a comment from Ron Prince the author of California's anti-immigrant Proposition 187, who has no doubt about who's to blame for any violence. "I think you could see today that the people who came out--the Young Communists, for example, -- were armed, not with guns necessarily but with sticks and bottles and so on." 
<P>
Again, no one from the immigrant group is given the chance to
contest the accusation; instead we get a quote from the anti-
immigrant protest leader, Glenn Spence. He and Ron Prince are the only quoted sources in the piece. Spence is angry that the
demonstrations have been broken up by police. "There were plenty of police to stop Americans" he tells ABC "but nobody to stop these people who are invading our country."  Rooney closes the piece by saying that "the passions over illegal immigration are heating up."
<P>
That may be; and one-sided reporting like that surely only fans the flames.
<P> 
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>ABC-Disney's Merger "Synergy": Convenient for PR</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<P>
<font size=5>L</font size=5>aura Flanders: Usually when a film studio wants to promote one of its movies on a TV network, it has to buy expensive ads. But when you own the TV network, you get a full one hour TV special promoting your film. On Tuesday, July 2, ABC aired a one hour show on the making of Disney's latest product, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame."  Then ABC re-ran the special during its Saturday morning children's lineup. When Michael Eisner spoke about the takeover by his company, Disney, of the ABC TV network, he said that one of the great things to come of the merger would be "synergy." Well, you can't say he wasn't right.
<P>
* * * * * * * *
<P>
CounterSpin Broadcast for week ending 7/26/96:
<P>
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>Time-Warner and Turner Merge</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<font size=5>L</font size=5>aura Flanders: Yet another media merger: A deal we told CounterSpin listeners about weeks ago has been virtually approved. According to July 18, 1996 <I>New York Times,</I> the Federal Trade Commission has cleared the way for the merger of Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting Systems, creating (for the moment anyway) the world's largest media company. FTC staffers had been balking at the deal as a possible anti-trust violation, because the combined company would form a link between Time Warner and TCI--the country's largest cable operator--and the new entity could reach up to 40% of US cable households--leading to fears that 1) cable rates could go up, and 2) that the new company would unfairly favor its own programming for carriage on its own service. 
<P>
The <I>Times</I> piece doesn't make clear why the FTC no longer has these fears. The only sop the deal makers threw to consumer advocates was the mandate that the new company carry a second all-news channel to compete with Turner's own CNN. There's more fine print on this story, of course, but the long and short of it is that the bottom line is, once again, the bottom line. And the government watchdogs look more like lapdogs every day. 
<PRE>   </PRE>
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>Oops! Illegal Campaign Contribution--but Wrong Campaign...</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<P>
<font size=5>J</font size=5>eanine Jackson: From what's all over the news, to what's suspiciously absent. Imagine that a vice-chair of the Clinton for President finance committee admitted to giving Clinton tens of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign contributions--and that this official was facing six months in jail and paying a million dollar fine.  Now imagine that this story was ignored by the network news shows, and that the New York Times buried the story on page B10.  Wouldn't that be pretty good evidence for a pro-Clinton bias on the part of the press?
<P>
Well, the story is true--except it wasn't a Clinton official, it was Dole finance committee vice-chair Simon Fireman who admitted on July 10 that he illegally gave $70,000 to the Dole campaign. The story first surfaced in April in the <I>Kansas City Star.</I> This month it was on the front page of the <I>Washington Post,</I> that the Dole Campaign had admitted this misdeed. But there the story virtually died. No day after day dogging of Dole on this one. Not at all.
<P>
While the underplaying of this story may not indicate a pro-Dole bias, it does illustrate how the media can ignore any story that doesn't fit in with the conventional script--which says that Dole is a decent fellow who doesn't know how to run a campaign.  The conventional wisdom about Clinton, on the other hand, is that he's ethically challenged.  So trials involving improprieties in past Clinton campaigns have the press corps camping out in Arkansas for the latest developments, while convictions involving officials of
the current Dole campaign are virtually ignored. The underplaying of this story also makes another point: that the right wing strategy of bashing the so-called liberal press sometimes works. 
<PRE>   </PRE>
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>MSNBC and New York Times: Conflict of Interest?</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<P>
<font size=5>L</font size=5>aura Flanders: How many bedfellows can a news organization stand?" That was the question in <I>USA Today</I> July 16 and it's a good one. The item was about MSNBC: the new cable channel that's a cooperative venture between GE's NBC and Microsoft. NBC News president Andrew Lack has now announced that they're forming an "alliance" with the <I>New York Times</I> to create a weekly news show for the network. The show would use <I>New York Times</I> reporters, and draw on <I>Times</I> stories and features, but be anchored by an NBC correspondent. 
<P>
If you think all of this spells big-time conflict of interest, well, we agree. What does NBC's Andrew Lack think? Well, see if you can decipher his comment on the matter: "There's nothing we can do these days where we don't bump into someone in theory or reality that we have a conflict of interest with. Our rule of thumb is to be honest with each other about those stories that are obvious to both of us where even the appearance of conflict arises and assure viewers that that issue is not an issue with us."  Huh?
<PRE>   </PRE>
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>Disney: Merger "Synergy" = Turning Its TV Outlets into PR Devices?</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<P>
<font size=5>J</font size=5>anine Jackson: Speaking of conflicts of interest, you may have noticed that half-hour TV special a couple weeks back on the making of the Disney movie "The Hunchback of Notre Dame." That show, essentially a promo for the film, aired on NBC--just kidding, of course the show aired on ABC, the TV network Disney recently bought for $19 billion. It may have struck you as the most obvious kind of self-promotion, and in fact, it struck some ABC executives that way too--especially since the network had just got through airing a different special, called "Disney's Most Unlikely Heroes" that included footage from "Hunchback." And that's without mentioning the "Making of Hunchback" special that was already airing on the Disney Channel.
<P>
But, in a pattern we'll surely see more of, the dissenters were overruled and ABC aired the show. The idea of
companies' turning their media outlets into promotional devices for their other media outlets might make press critics queasy, but it makes Disney execs very happy. A Disney spokesman told the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> July 12, "I think we'd have been faulted for <I>not</I> using that kind of synergy." Faulted by whom, he doesn't say, I don't think he means the viewers.
<P>

Broadcast for week ending 8/3/96:
<PRE>    </PRE>
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>Giveaway of Digital Spectrum to Corporate Broadcasters</H3></font color="#2F4F2F"> 
<P>
<font size=5>S</font size=5>teve Rendall: On July 24, Congressman Barney Frank introduced an amendment to try to block the giveaway of the new digital spectrum to the broadcasters. This public resource, which is estimated to be worth between 10 and 100 billion dollars may well be given for free, with virtually no conditions, to the current broadcasters. Frank's amendment would have held off on giving the spectrum until Congress considered the subject in earnest and had hearings--as the Congressional leadership promised several months ago. 
<P> 
Frank's eloquence however had little impact. The amendment was
defeated 408 to 16, a testament to the power of broadcasters over Congress.
<P> 
It's noteworthy that several right-wing politicians--who typically bash the so-called "liberal media"--were pleading for the giveaway to the broadcasters. FAIR supports providing part of the spectrum to non-profit groups, instead of all of it going to mega-corporations. The issue will be before Congress in the next several months, it's something you might want to raise with your local representative or senator. 
<PRE>   </PRE>
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>News Coverage of Wefare: What About Women?</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<P>
Laura Flanders: While the senate were giving lucrative resources away for free to wealthy broadcasters, the same gang of guys this week repealed welfare, no matter how much they and their friends in the media tried to call the bill "improvements" and "reform." And in the media coverage of this debate--more than 90 percent of welfare recipients--women--were disappeared, perhaps appropriately like undesirable victims of a coup d'etat. 
<P>
The <I>New York Times</I> editorial July 18 worried about the effects of the House bill on some people. The proposals would push "a million children into poverty, victimize legal immigrants and leave no ironclad Federal safety net underneath families that search for but cannot find work." But the <I>Times</I> editors weren't worried about women. The <I>Boston Globe</I> editors took the same approach July 23rd; Clinton "cannot in conscience send many thousands of Americans and legal immigrants--including large numbers of children -- into poverty," wrote the <I>Globe</I>.
<P> 
Perhaps women were left out of the line up of victims to care about because punishing women--especially poor women--with children is supposed to be okay--according to the legislators and the President, apparently, and the media too. It's no accident that welfare repeal targets about the least powerful, most vilified category of people in the USA. 
<P>
And if you hadn't already jumped to that conclusion, the <I>Washington Post</I> helped make it clear July 18.
"The central issue in reforming it has been the same for years. How do you increase the pressure on welfare mothers to go to work while continuing to support their children if they fail?"  It's not quite acceptable yet to go all out against little children, even if aiming at their moms is fine. 
<P> 
As writer Rita Henley Jensen put it in a letter to the <I>New York Times</I> July 25, 1996: "Gender-neutral language is supposed to be a more accurate use of language, not used to obscure bias. Families don't look for work," she added. "Single parents do."

<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>Update: Victory for Public Television in Pittsburgh--But Fight's Not Over</H3></font color="#2F4F2F"> 
<P>
<font size=5>L</font size=5>aura Flanders:  Finally, in an update on a story we've been following here on
CounterSpin, the Federal Communications Commission July 24 denied Pittsburgh Public Television's unprecedented request to convert their second station, WQEX into a commercial station that it could then sell or lease. The FCC decision was definitely a victory for the public interest and for activists defending public TV.  As we've heard here before, the Pittsburgh legislation would have set a precedent for dismantling public stations nationwide.  "We stopped the railroading here," Jerry Starr, of the WQED Accountability Project told CounterSpin. "With the help of supporters and CounterSpin listeners across the country."  
<P>
But the fight's not over, said Starr.  The contingency plan WQED had devised is an even worse alternative: that's the one whereby the station would be delivered into the hands of broadcasters affiliated with the Christian Coalition who'd be able to make millions from the deal at the same time. So Starr and his colleagues still need support and the story needs attention. <P>

Broadcast for week ending 8/9/96:
<P>
<font size=5>J</font size=5>anine Jackson: Welcome to CounterSpin--your weekly look behind the headlines of the mainstream news. Laura Flanders is on vacation.
<P>
A look at the week's press:
<P>
With me is FAIR's Senior Analyst, Steve Rendall.
<PRE>   </PRE>
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>Where Was the News Media on Welfare's Facts?</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<P>
<font size=5>S</font size=5>teve Rendall: President Clinton has said he will sign a bill that will eliminate the guarantee of assistance to the poor and legal immigrants in this country and throw millions of people into poverty, including by the Administration's own account, at least a million children. 
<P>
Media can't be blamed entirely for political scapegoating like
this, but news outlets have shaped this debate to a great degree, allowing a discussion of economic and social forces to be carried out as a twisted discourse on shame and morality--remember millionaire ABC PrimeTime star Diane Sawyer demanding of teenage mothers "Why should I pay for your mistake?"  Mainstream media perpetuated damaging and easily debunked myths about the poor and immigrants--about women's childbearing choices being determined by benefit levels for example; they parroted politicians claims and counterclaims but rarely checked them against reality, and, as a
survey by FAIR showed, they regularly left out the voices of
welfare policy experts--people who actually work with aid
recipients rather than simply guess about their "motivations" and "attitudes." 
<P>
As economist Frances Fox Piven commented after two hours of Firing Line debate leavened, as she said, with smug male jokes at the expense of poor women, "I am struck by how little evidence matters in talk about welfare."  Other voices left out of coverage included unions and worker advocates, who might have resisted the constant invidious portrayal of welfare as a battle between workers and the unemployed.  And then surely the sheer amount of coverage, the persistent media drumbeat around what is, remember, a tiny fraction of the federal budget are a big part of what made Clinton feel that
he had to sign a bill like this this year.
<P> 
<font size=5>J</font size=5>anine Jackson: This debate has been a prime example of what Mark Hertsgaard writing in the <I>Nation</I> called "palace court journalism"--a spectrum
of debate that ran only from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the other. That narrowed the discussion to a limited range of policy choices--you could be for maintaining the current welfare system just as it is, or against it. What we didn't see were people talking about other poverty-solving proposals besides cutting off benefits--job creation programs, lifting wages, universal health care. There are plenty of organizations who could have widened the debate, and they weren't silent about their desire to be included,
--but though media occasionally slipped in a mention of such points of view, they never allowed them to challenge the conservative-led discussion. 
<P>
Press accounts became more critical in recent weeks, a clear case of way too little way too late, and even then, reporters still used proponents' terminology: talking about welfare "reform", and using soft-focus language like the <I>New York Times</I> lead on August 1, 1996 that said the bill "touches the lives" of tens of millions of people. The <I>Times</I> editorial said it more honestly: "this is not reform, it
is punishment". But the question remains: why hasn't that been made clear all along?

<PRE>   </PRE>
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>Irresponsible media speculation on Atlanta yet-uncharged bombing suspect?</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<P>
<font size=5>S</font size=5>teve Randall: Mainstream media handwringing has begun again. Reporters, producers, and editors are worried that they may have gone overboard in covering the investigation of Richard Jewell, the
Olympic security guard who--at the time of this show's taping--has not been charged with anything, but is a suspect in the Olympic park bombing in Atlanta.  While the Jewell story <I>is</I> newsworthy, it does not justify the massive amount of irresponsible speculation it has received from print and broadcast outlets across the US.
<P>
Nightline's July 30, 1996 broadcast was typical of sensational coverage of the investigation. The show focused on Mr. Jewell, beginning and ending with anchor Chris Wallace's caveat that Jewel "had not been charged with anything." What came between the warnings though was a show that treated Jewell as if he had been charged. 
<P>
Even if Mr. Jewell is eventually charged with the crime, it will not make this kind of speculative reporting any less irresponsible. If he isn't charged, the media have even more to answer for.
<PRE>    </PRE>
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>NBC's coverage of Olympics: A Pro-American <BR>Technicolor "Triumph of the Will"? </H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<P>
<font size=5>J</font size=5>anine Jackson: Well, what can we say about coverage of the Olympic Games in Atlanta, except that this year might well be the most jingoistic,
pompously pro-American coverage we've ever seen--a little
Technicolor Triumph of the Will brought to you by NBC and sponsored by, well who <I>isn't</I> it sponsored by? As anyone trying to follow the events has learned--when an American wins, say, a bronze medal, TV coverage appears to suggest that they just didn't give out a gold or a silver. Even conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer was moved to complain. His July 30 syndicated column that ran in the Long Island paper <I>Newsday</I> with the headline "A Tasteless Orgy of Chauvinistic Olympic Gloating" pointed out that coverage of women's gymnastics was almost completely focused to the U.S. team--unless someone from an Eastern European country made a mistake, in which case "you could be sure NBC would treat you to a full replay of the lucky event as soon as our star-spangled might was done." Krauthammer claimed the coverage was so absurdly biased, it made him feel "pro-Russian"--and that's saying something.
<P>
(Editor's Note: Despite the lopsided <I>coverage</I>, this is not to say that US athletes did not deliver some wonderful performances to earn their medals, such as--my favorite among many--the US women's basketball team in their win over Brazil. Led by Lisa Leslie, Teresa Edwards, Katrina McLean, Mickie McRae, Cheryl Swoops, and Ruthie Bolton, they turned in the best women's basketball we've ever seen. 
<P>
To the point made by CounterSpin, at the closing of competition NBC aired a very moving film of children's faces among spectators with very inspiring music and a voiceover about "reaching out for your dream." Two African-American children were shown, no Hispanic, Oriental or other children, all the rest Caucasian, ending with the most exquisite white baby's face you've ever seen. There seems no doubt that NBC wanted to get across a glorification of whiteness. I suppose NBC feels they made up for it by having Gregg Gumble, Brian Gumble's brother, host the whole thing. Maybe I'm wrong. You tell me what impression I was supposed to get.
<P>
NBC's also aired a very moving closing film which featured some athletes from other countries demonstrating their humor, heart and sportsmanship--here, now, at the end, during what amounted to an overwhelmingly American-dominated advertisement for NBC. 
<P>
It appears to me that NBC saved their positive coverage of other nationalities for this closing film, using selective shots in slow motion and emotional music and scripting to glorify itself--NBC--to create the impression--only at the end during the NBC finale--of an international spirit, wrapping NBC in that spirit after having neglected this kind of treatment throughout two weeks of coverage. Maybe I'm wrong. You tell me. JWP)

<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>Watch for Canadian Media Mogul</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<P>
<font size=5>B</font size=5>y the time you hear this program, one man may control some
40% of Canadian newspapers. U.S. listeners may not even know his
name, but the paper you read every day might be one of the dozens
media mogul Conrad Black already owns in this country. Canadian
activist and author Maude Barlow (chairperson of the Council of
Canadians) will fill us in on Black's increasing influence,
including recent maneuvers that are threatening a national
journalistic institution, the wire service the Canadian Press.

<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>Stretching Media Ethics to the Breaking Point?<BR>More on the Atlanta Bombing Suspect</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">

<P>
<font size=5>W</font size=5>e spoke last week about how reporters have been stretching journalistic ethics to the breaking point in coverage of Richard Jewell, an Atlanta security guard who is a suspect in the fatal bombing in the Olympic Park Village.
<P>
The media wisdom on this case
seems to be that if Jewell is innocent, then all this rumor-mongering and speculation may have been wrong, but if he turns out to be guilty, then the press has been doing the right thing. But
reporters aren't psychics and they shouldn't be gamblers, betting
that a story's outcome will vindicate them. 
<P>
What, after all, could vindicate insinuation like this from the August 2, 1996 Long Island <I>Newsday</I>: "The Associated Press reported that a Washington law
enforcement source said Jewell had told an acquaintance--a fellow
law enforcement officer--that he owned an anarchist book which
might have contained instructions of making bombs." Follow that?
Newsday's telling us that another news outlet reported an
anonymous, third-hand story about a book Jewell might have read
that might have contained bomb instructions. Pretty slippery.
<P> 
And then there was this from NBC Nightly News correspondent Pete
Williams on <BR>August 6: 
<P> 
[Audio clip of Pete Williams saying that there's no proof that
Jewell is guilty, but there's no proof he's innocent, either.]
<P> 
Interesting logic. I guess we should be thankful Williams is just
a commentator and not a judge.

Excerpt from CounterSpin Broadcast for week ending 8/23/96
<P> 
[Hosted by Janine Jackson and Jim Naureckas]
<P> 
Welcome to CounterSpin your weekly look behind the headlines of the
mainstream news. Laura Flanders is on assignment. I'm Janine
Jackson. 
<PRE>   </PRE>
<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>Medianalysis of the GOP Convention Extravaganza</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">
<P> 
<font size=5>T</font size=5>he Republican National Convention was of course the major media
event this last week--and there's been no shortage of acknowledgement from the
press that it is in fact a <I>media event</I>. That awareness hasn't
stopped media outlets from adding to the hype, rather than
deflating or examining it. 
<P> 
In the midst of this, Republicans are making claim after claim
that, because of the narrow spectrum of mainstream commentators, go
virtually unchecked. For example, several speakers, in interviews
and from the podium, claimed that the Bob Dole-led GOP is dedicated
to preserving Medicare. Shouldn't independent journalists have
offered relevant background on this claim? Earlier in the campaign,
Dole boasted at a candidate's forum hosted by the American
Conservative Union that he had been opposed to Medicare from the
beginning: "I was there, fighting the fight, voting against
Medicare, one of 12, because we knew it wouldn't work in 1965." The
comment was part of Dole's argument that he was a "career
conservative."
<P> 
And with reference to Dole's tax cut proposal, one spokesperson
after another has spoken glowingly of how Ronald Reagan "balanced
the budget" and blamed the deficits of the Reagan years not on tax
cuts for the wealthy but on the big-spending Congress. It wouldn't
have taken much digging for a reporter to find that the budgets
Reagan presented to Congress, in at least 8 of his 12 years in
office, were bigger than those Congress eventually passed.
<P> 
<font size=5>R</font size=5>elevant background would have also been useful amidst media's generally warm embrace of vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp. The
<I>Washington Post</I>'s Howard Kurtz described in his August 13. 1996 column how Kemp won the "media primary" without lifting a finger. Kemp's appeal we were told, was that he's a unifier, someone who could reach across party divisions. Well, NPR's Nina Totenberg had a simpler explanation, according to the August 13 <I>Wall Street
Journal</I>, she told CBS "Let me be sexist for a minute: he's cute." 
<P>
<H3> Jack Kemp's Racist Advisers</H3>
<P>
Reporters on the GOP convention might have slipped in these facts about Kemp's background (but didn't):
<P> 
Jack Kemp has been widely hailed in the media as a "Compassionate
Conservative" free of bigotry. But a number of Kemp's closest
political advisers have not been free of prejudice. When he ran for
president in '88, Kemp's campaign was co-chaired by two veterans of
the right wing: Tim and Beverly LeHaye. The two were forced to
resign when reporters publicized some of Tim LaHaye's anti-Semitic,
anti-Catholic writings. 
<P>
Another Kemp advisor and campaign co-chair in his 1988 campaign
was Tom Ellis. Ellis had been the president of the Pioneer Fund,
the country's leading funder of racist, eugenicist research. Also
during that campaign, Kemp said that school boards should be able
to bar gays and lesbians from teaching positions in public schools.
<P> 
But instead of the most basic kind of fact-checking, we got 
a kid glove approach, with some flat-out cheerleading, like Dan
Rather's breathless review of Susan Molinari's address as "an
excellent keynote speech, excellently delivered"; Rather also
praised Elizabeth Dole's let-me-walk-among-you shtick as an
"electrifying performance."
<P> 
<font size=5>M</font size=5>any outlets seemed to feel that the party promotion going on at
the podium was not enough, and invited more boosters to offer their
comments and "analysis." So, ABC's Nightline on August 12, 1996, after
a day of Republican PR, brought on Newt Gingrich, who shocked no one
by delivering more Republican PR.
<P>
ABC also hired pollster Frank Luntz, who should be infamous by now as the man who provides nothing but Republican PR, except that he calls it poll data. 
<P>
Luntz
admitted last year that poll numbers he had claimed showed
overwhelming popular support for Republicans' Contract With America
had in fact been distorted beyond recognition--respondents were
asked highly leading questions that contained no language at all
from the Contract. Apparently, admitting past deceitful practices
in the service of conservative hype is no barrier to being a
Nightline expert on conservative policy.
<P> 
PBS has been one of the worst, offering viewers the pundit pair of
Paul Gigot, a <I>Wall Street Journal</I> writer with a pronounced right
wing tilt--and Mark Shields, hardly a balance for Gigot, Shields'
own bio boasts that he has "no slant."  Had PBS found someone who
could provide a counter to Gigot, he or she might have objected to,
among other things, Gigot's comment that one of the "best lines" of
the convention was when J.C. Watt said we should judge our
country's compassion not by the number of people on welfare, but by
the number of people off welfare. That would have been a good
opportunity for a progressive voice to ask whether compassion
shouldn't be measured by how many people are in poverty in the
U.S., how many people have homes and enough to eat--regardless of
whether they're on or off public assistance. 
<P> 
PBS's NewsHour also avoids real debate in their "historians and
reporters panel" that is supposed to be analyzing convention
events. The panel includes William Kristol--a full-time
conservative activist and advocate. FAIR called the show to ask why
there was no balance to Kristol in the form of an unabashed
progressive spokesperson, but at the time we tape this show, we
have not heard an answer.
<P> 
<font size=5>W</font size=5>e know Republicans want to portray themselves as more inclusive
and diverse than they are, but that doesn't explain why some media
outlets seem intent on doing Republicans work for them. Some
networks offered a kind of editorial "help" to Republicans, using
crowd reaction shots to underscore themes of speeches.  
<P>
During
Colin Powell's speech, for example, at least a fifth of the crowd
reaction shots on the major broadcast networks featured black
faces, according to a count made by the <I>New York Times</I>--even
though less than 3 percent of the delegates are African-American. 
The <I>Times</I> noted that ABC was so eager to find people that matched Powell's claims of an inclusive party that they aired a shot of one black "delegate" who turned out to be a reporter for <I>Time</I> magazine.
<P> 
It's said that media need conflict, so they've been puffing up
little matters in hopes of generating a story. But if conflict and
debate are what the press are after, all they'd need to do would be
to step outside the convention center and talk to some of the
thousands of people who have been protesting in San Diego on
various policy issues--like the party's treatment of gays and
lesbians, immigration and welfare. 
<P>
Of what coverage there has been of what's going on in the street,
some has been absurdly dismissive--like the piece new network MSNBC
did on August 12, 1996. The MSNBC reporter did venture into the fenced in "Free Speech" area across from the convention site--but for him
the real story there was not what anyone said, but the technical
procedure worked out for keeping speakers to their allotted time.
It was a traffic light by the podium, which turned from green to
yellow when speakers had just 10 minutes left, and turned red when
their time was up.
<P>
What did protesters talk about? What was their response to the party platform? That was unclear, but viewers did get to hear two detailed explanations of how traffic lights work.

COUNTER6.HTM     ADD LYONS INTERVIEW WHEN TRANSCRIPT ARRIVES

From CounterSpin Broadcast for week ending August 23, 1996:

<font color="#2F4F2F"><H3>XXX</H3></font color="#2F4F2F">           <P> 
On today's program: The Whitewater scandal has been as much about
rumor and speculation as hard facts from its beginnings. But still,
despite all the smoke and hot air, you probably think you basically
understand the essentials of the story--about an Arkansas real
estate deal gone bad--that's been the subject of years of
Republican crusade and media extravaganza. But after you hear from
our guest today, whatever you think about Bill and Hillary Clinton,
you may have to change your mind about that story. We'll be talking
with writer and reporter Gene Lyons, author of "Fools for Scandal:
How the Media Invented Whitewater." We'll get to that interview in
a moment, but first as usual we'll take a quick look back at the
week's press -- 

<PRE>   </PRE>                  
The term Whitewater certainly calls up a picture, but after living
with the story for years now, the picture still isn't a very clear
one. Is it a case of unseemly, or even illegal dealings by then-
Arkansas governor Bill Clinton? Or are old partisan charges being
hyped up and recirculated to make political hay by the president's
conservative opponents?  By now, Many citizens have just guessed
the truth lies somewhere in between and left it at that, but the
media are supposed to do better. Still, after years of free-
floating rumors and Congressional investigation, all of it duly
reported in the press, the Whitewater 'story' is as cloudy as ever.
Our next guest says there's a good reason for that, namely that
Whitewater, far from an example of a muckraking press uncovering
hidden facts of national importance, is instead "possibly the most
politically charged case of journalistic malpractice in recent
American history."
<P> 
Gene Lyons is a writer and reporter who has written for a variety
of outlets, including Newsweek, The Nation and Harper's magazine.
He has a weekly column in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. And he is
the author of the book "Fools for Scandal: How the Media Invented
Whitewater".
<P> 
[Interview segment--no transcript available. TRNP will try to get it. Here are some
questions:]
<P> 
--Whitewater is a very confusing subject for many people, so let's
summarize it for our listeners.  Whitewater is about Bill Clinton,
when he was governor of Arkansas, getting into a sweetheart real
estate partnership with an S&L operator, Jim McDougal, who later
got favorable treatment from the state.  Is that correct?
<P> 
--What are to you the most important examples of media just getting
the facts wrong?
<P> 
--We talked to Jeff Gerth of the <I>New York Times</I> today, and actually asked him if he wanted to discuss the book with you on CounterSpin.
<P>
He declined, saying that he didn't do radio or TV appearances.  But
he did say that he had questions of his own about your reporting.  He cited, as an example of what he called your sloppiness, an <I>Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</I> column you wrote that said that another Times
reporter, Steven Labaton, hadn't quoted a single Democrat in six
months of covering the Whitewater hearings. And apparently the
<I>Democrat-Gazette</I> ran a correction.
<P> 
--Gerth also complained that you had never called Labaton for
comment, and that you make a habit of criticizing people without
talking to them.
<P> 
--So many reporters have been covering Whitewater--if, as you
suggest, it ultimately centers around nothing, why haven't some of
these reporters figured that out and reported it?
<P> 
--People like Rush Limbaugh have criticized the <I>New York Times</I> and
other establishment papers for not covering Whitewater enough--and
for not following up on the evidence unearthed by the <I>New York
Post</I>, the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> editorial page and other conservative outfits.
<P> 
Thanks very much. We've been speaking with Gene Lyons, author of
"Fools for Scandal: How the Media Invented Whitewater." The book is
out now from Franklin Square Press. Thanks also to my colleague Jim
Naureckas, editor of Extra!

<I>This is for Brian Lamb, Jan 23, 1996 (fax)<BR>
 </I>
<P>
On C-SPAN-2 at 11 pm Pacific time on Tues 1-23-96, the Senate Whitewater hearings adjourned. There were the usual announcements of upcoming C-SPAN events. 
<P>
But wait a minute. First, there was an <I>announcement</I> that Hillary Rodham Clinton had been subpoenaed by prosecutor Kenneth Starr to appear before a grand jury to answer questions related to her legal work. I thought, oh, C-SPAN is announcing its schedule...<BR>but, gee, do they allow C-SPAN cameras in the grand jury proceedings? No. The announcer went on to announce the schedule for watching the Travelgate hearings. This little piece of subpoena news was just sort of squeezed in between routine C-SPAN scheduling.
<P>
What occurred, then, was that C-SPAN did a "news break" about the Hillary Clinton subpoena that had nothing to do with C-SPAN programming which is traditionally the only copy that runs in between C-SPAN events. Even if the announcer's commentary on the subpoena was intended to relate to the Senate hearings, when did C-SPAN start doing political news announcements? 
<P>
If C-SPAN is starting to do political news announcements unrelated to program scheduling, why didn't C-SPAN announce that Maggie Williams passed two lie detector tests, or that Clinton political opponent Jay Stephens had released an excupatory report for the RTC or any other such news announcement? 
<P>
Where did "news announcing" start on C-SPAN in this form and where will it end? By doing political "news breaks" in this manner, sandwiched between the D'Amato hearings and the schedule of the Travelgate hearings, doesn't C-SPAN break the bargain of strict objectivity and impartiality with your viewers by introducing something extraneous from the events themselves?
<P>
We wouldnt want to get the impression that Brian Lamb, the fairest of the fair, King Solomon of the airwaves, ran an operation that is actually zapping the most disparaging news to your most conservative anti-Clinton viewers who otherwise might not get that news because they dont watch mainsteam TV.
<P>
In this example and in other areas of your programming, specifically Washington Journal with media guests who are arranged cynically on either side of a widely polarized political spectrum, C-SPAN is becoming yet another political commentary outlet I have to watch. What a pain in the neck, just when I thought there was one channel where I could sit back, relax and witness the workings of Washington without the usual cynical filters.
<P>
I object strongly, Brian, and would like an explanation. 
 <P>
Sincerely, 
<P>
Jane Wardlow Prettyman
<P>

<P>
To C-SPAN Sunday Journal, 2-4-96 (fax):
<P>
The host of Sunday Journal today (2-4-96) seems to have a bias against President Clinton. In the interviews with several governors  at the Governors' Conference, the C-SPAN host repeatedly asked leading questions about the President's truthfulness: "Do you believe this President?", "Is the President telling the truth?", "Do the American people trust this President?" Most often, the person asked was a political foe of the President which means the answer was most often some gradation of "No."
<P>
Apparently the Sunday Journal host does not believe the President. Perhaps it would be clearer to C-SPAN viewers for the host simply to declare this fact and give his personal reasons why ("Personally I don't believe President Clinton because......What do you think?"), so that we do not suffer under the impression that the question of a President's (any President's) truthfulness is standard fare.
<P>
Normally in social interaction, even political social interaction, questioning a person's credibility is a profound insult. The host has prepared no groundwork to assume that President Clinton's words should not be trusted. Nor has he acknowledged the vagueness of political language that typifies all politicians, whether Republicans, Independents, Greens, Demos.  Rather, the C-SPAN host appears to be fishing among the opinions of others to elicit statements of doubt for his own personal satisfaction.
<P>
I strongly object and would like an explanation.	
	<P>

<P>
To C-SPAN, 2-1-96 (fax)<BR>
<P>
What? Yet another morning with a <I>Washington Times</I> reporter as a "guest commentator"?
<P>
The <I> Washington Times</I> is over-represented on C-SPAN. This extremely conservative anti-Clinton Whitewater-muckraking newspaper has representatives on your program several times a week. Their opinions are not thoughtful. They are predictable. 
<P>
I'm not saying other news reporters are any more thoughtful or less predictable, but they are less frequently represented than the <I>Washington Times</I>. 
<P>
Besides, the whole format of setting up "opposing" political views in the interest of "fairness" by inviting media people goes against the grain of the proclaimed non-partisan nature of journalism and does absolutely no justice to "fairness." Fairness is more than presentation of opposing views whose merits might be absurd. Fairness is a matter of intellegent exploration of the other side of the story, whatever the story is, and the inclusion of meritorious points of view, with an effort by all parties to listen to other views and to incorporate what they can of them. 
<P>
No such effort is made when the subject is President Clinton and one guest is from the <I>Washington Times</I>.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Jane W. Prettyman

<PRE>  </PRE>

<font size=5>R</font size=5>eporting in the <I>Orange County Register</I> on 11-7-96, journalist Anne C. Mulkern described an incident in which a 17-year-old worker at a Disneyland ice cream shop was detained by security because she forgot to check in her uniform after leaving work. The young woman was questioned for two hours and Disneyland security police refused to allow her to call her mother, Marilyn Dortch. Later Mrs. Dortch chastised security officers for violating her daughter's Constituional rights. "There is no Constitution at Disneyland," Dortch quoted the Disneyland security superviser as saying. "We have our own laws."
<P>
Legal experts note this alleged statement is accurate. "When you step inside the gates of the Magic Kingdom--or any private business--you surrender significant legal protections. And some say that is cause for concern," wrote Mulkern in the <I>Register.</I> Several people have sued Disneyland over the past few months, alleging wrongful arrest and detention. "Yet no official group scrutinizes the behavior of Disney security," reported Mulkern, "a force nearly as large as the 382-officer Anaheim Police Department, Orange County's second largest law-enforcement agency."
<P>
According to the <I>Register</I> article which gathered views from two law professors and several attorneys, "Disneyland doesn't have to release any information about arrests made by Disney security. Unlike civil police, private security forces do not need a reason to search you, do not have to read you your Miranda rights regarding silence and self-incrimination, and they do not have to follow laws governing police conduct during an interrogation."
<P>
According to David Sklansky, a law professor at UCLA, "One of the major problems is that we don't really know what Disney security agents are doing--how often they stop, interrogate, search or detain people. "They're not subject to the same regulatory control as the civil police."
<P>
Many of those interviewed by the <I>Register</I> for shoplifting or other charges said they did not know what their rights were and what authority Disney security had. Mulkern reported, "Several allege Disney security held them up to four hours in a small room with no access to a bathroom, telephone or water before the Anaheim police were called. Disney disputes these allegations. Parents said Disney security questioned their children without calling the parents first, and sometimes told adolescents they must confess or be sent to jail."

Letters to Editors<BR> 
Liberally Biased<BR></H1>
<H4>From Reuters--FLASH!</CENTER>
<PRE>   </PRE>
ATLANTA--11-4-94--House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Friday that he <BR>ignores letters written to newspaper editors because they are tainted by liberal bias.
<P>
  Gingrich told the Association of Opinion Page Editors that newspapers repeatedly misrepresent Republican efforts to cut spending for Medicare and other programs. <BR>I dont pay attention to letters to editors because I assume theyre just based on  misinformation, he said.
<P>
      He said he gives every group that supports his causes total access, but said <BR>I dont have the time to listen to political opponents. Gingrich said, for example, <BR>there was no point in discussing Medicare reform with the National Council of <BR>Senior Citizens because it is a left wing front group.

<P>
<H4>A question--and a few comments <BR> on one of the news stories of the century: <BR><I>the fringe is here.</I>
<P>
<I><font color="#0000ff"><CENTER>Letter to the New York Times by Jane Wardlow Prettyman, 11-15-95,<BR>  copied to Associated Press
</CENTER></font color="#0000ff"></I></CENTER>
<PRE>  </PRE>




<font size=7>C</font size=7>an editors of the <I>Times</I> explain what, after all, are the facts about Elohim City?
<P>
The <I>Times</I> reported (via AP) on 11-13-95 about another fertilizer bomb plot just uncovered, "and Elohim City, a white separatist community of about 100 people in eastern Oklahoma, was a purported <I>target</I>" (emphasis mine).  The first we ever heard of Elohim City was shortly after the Murrah Building exploded when the <I>Times</I> reported (May 25, 1995 in its own by-lined story, not AP) that there was an alleged record of a phone call from Tomothy McVeigh to the compound two weeks before the OK City bombing. However, there was no mention of that possible McVeigh-Elohim City connection in this 11-13-95 AP story.

<P> Elohim City is Rev. Robert G. Millar's compound. He is known to be a Christian Identity supporter and white supremacist. His grand-daughter is married to James Ellison who is the leader of the paramilitia ultra-hate group called "The Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord." 

<P> Millar, of course, denied knowing anything at all about McVeigh, and the <I>Times</I>, of course, seemed perfectly happy to believe him. (See my essay <A HREF="parano1.htm"> "The Paranoid Frontier"</A> for more about Millar, Christian Identity and the rest of this bizarre subject).
<P>
A second Associated Press story about Elohim City showed up in the 11-14-95 <I>Times</I>--the same subject aired two days in a row--this time with a confusing factual twist. The possible McVeigh connection to Elohim City was still not mentioned (a watched pot never boils when you're waiting for answers to questions and missing stories in the news media). But in this second little Elohim item from AP, quite significantly, instead of Elohim City being a "target" for bombers as if it might be attacked, the AP reported that the bomb plotters had "the intention of <I>testing</I> the fertilizer bomb at Elohim City" (emphasis mine).
<P>
"Target" vs. "testing" is a radically different set of perceived facts from one day to the next. Does this mean that Elohim City ("City of God") offered a safe haven and refuge from outsiders and from law enforcement, an ideal place where bomb "target practice" could be accomplished with the fewest questions asked?
<P>
This could be a big story! Why are we relying on AP to confuse everybody without strong investigative reporting--and clarification of facts--by the <I>Times</I>? Why are we left dangling with this mystery about something that could be vital to our understanding of what's going on out there? What? Aren't the deaths of 169 people enough to motivate the media to move? 
<PRE>   </PRE>


<H3><I>"The Fringe Is Here"--
An appeal to the New York Times to continue <BR>reporting on the larger picture.</I></H3>

<P>
<font size=7>T</font size=5>he news media--including the <I>Times</I>--have missed one of the stories of the century. 
<P>
These confusing and fragmentary Elohim City reports are a perfect example. At the very least, two completely opposing sets of facts are displayed. But even if the press got that part right, by and large theyre still nibbling around the edges and not catching on to the bigger picture. 
<P>
Why is this a big story?  Because the underpinnings of belief and motive that led to the bombing of the Murrah Building are still active and repeating themselves--Amtrak, JFK airport, whatever's going on at Elohim City [and since this letter was originally written, add the siege by the people who have ruined one the most precious words in the English language by calling themselves "Freemen"]. 
<P>
Dotted across the landscape,  ritualized memento mori like Waco leave us forever anxious about April 19 and god knows what other mysterious calandar date we'll discover with the next explosion. The surrounding literature and beliefs that are reported to have spurred McVeigh's pathological imagination are pertinent. The very real conflict between armed compounds and legal authorities is perinient--and not just in glorification of "patriots" with miniature Constitutions in their pockets. McVeigh's possible connection with Elohim City is pertinent if it was a channel of ideological justification for his ill outlook. 
<P>
The political-religious credos and hate-myths churning in the hearts of isolated  homespun compounds like the well-armed Elohim City are so intense and  becoming so widespread (via media, communications technology, and pick-up truck)  that their rhetoric and twisted viewpoint have entered our conventional suburban political language and perceptions which have, in themselves, been primed from the other end by the rhetoric of Pat Robertson ("conspiracy of Jewish cabal"), Pat Buchanan ("holy war"), John Trochmann (Militia of Montana, "elite (Jewish) banking elements"),  David Duke and others.  So, from government-hating militias, "freedom-loving patriots," and hate-based religious groups to the extreme wings of accepted political parties and accepted churches and credos,  a "bridge" is forming across which hateful, dehumanizing, or radically wrong-headed views are crossing into mainstream social expression and acceptance. 
<P>
It's not a big leap of imagination to swing from "no more big government" to jack-booted-thug government to boogie-man government   to the concept of  "ZOG" (Zionist Occupational Govt)  and the evil-one-world government of "The Turner Diaries." Or travel backwards from "Jews are out to control the world" to the idea of a "new world order" to  "liberal (Jewish) media to  an "evil UN" out to strip [emasculate] Americans of our individual rights and our sovereignty, right back to Buchanan in the orchards of New Hampshire.
<P>
A psyciatrist might notice a strong fear of castration running across this "bridge" of rhetoric, running all the way through the spectrum of expressed epithets of put-upon "patriots." Fear of castration certainly underlies homophobia. The same fear may account for Rush Limbaugh's "feminazi" view of women and Newt Gingrich's hostility toward "big government."
<P>
The current government shutdown is revealing an alarming disdain for government, in some cases with total disregard for people--for the human beings who have to meet their mortgage payments just like those hostile frontiersmen who revile "big government." Government is imagined as an abstract bureaucracy,  merely a big building, something explodable because it is not thought to be human. Government has been successfully abstracted by extreme Republicans and radical fringe evocateurs, even by the Unabomber at the leftist extreme.
<P>
Granted, the alleged perpetrators at OK City had pathological personalities. The danger is that their pathology is linked up with a rapidly developing globalized pathology, something in the air, words and ideas, something repeated over and over as with the Brothers Karamazov, until finally the quiet half-bother kills the father. 
<P>
McVeigh--or whoever did it--is only one man but the technology of mass destruction requires only one pair of hands. 
<P>
At the supposedly more civilized end of the spectrum of verbally coded intolerance, for example,  Mr. Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, tosses off phrases like the enemy of normal Americans and your fear of government is genuine, youre right to be afraid. 
<P>
This is bridgework. This is part of the set-up for idiosyncratic death. This is dangerous stuff, especially coming from the Speaker of the House, one of the high priests of our society. This is the word of one of our demi-gods. His word has power. Where is he taking us with his word power?
<P>
We see the dehumanization and objectification of government even now, as Phil Gramm is saying Look at all those government workers not working and we hardly notice! Maybe we should just terminate them permanently. Some of the Freshmen Republicans have freely admitted they wouldnt mind seeing something close to no Federal government at all. Government is "other." 
<P>
I'm not for big inefficient government, mind you. But I know government is made of human beings and if we don't like government's functions, we have to alter them in a orderly and civilized way, not with fertilizer bombs. That is my opinion and it is an ironic one.  I was a non-violent but extremely active protester against government policies in the Sixties and Seventies, although not against government itself.
<P>
Readers must be educated more about the potency of hate groups (including the virulently anti-Semitic Christian Identity movement which Rev. Robert Millar is said to support; see Michael Barkun's riveting work "Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of Christian Identity," U of NC Press, 1994) and the "literature" of hate that circulates now more freely than ever, via fax, phone, newsletters, internet and shortwave. The Militia of Montana catalog--cleaned up since OK City, you can't order the "Turner Diaries" through MOM as you once could--is still an eye-opener if not a hair-curler.
<P>
Editors may counter-argue that dragging readers through a slow build through the development of Christian Identity or the Order, for example, will put us straight to sleep. I counter-argue that this is one of those cases where the <I>Times</I> rises to a higher principle: Pursue this story for those who are awake and  wake up more.
<P>
Yes, there's a danger that some characters may use the information for violent ends, as McVeigh may have done with James Coates' "Armed and Dangerous." He reportedly used it as a "cookbook." But the general public must be made aware of the facts, learn to watch for signals of developing McVeighs, and speak up against hateful ideas.
<P>
I would call for a deep look at rhetorical sophistry in political media statements. I would call for a "verbal morality." This is not to say censorship, no! This is "to use our freedom of speech to speak up against hate speech!" as President Clinton asserted at Michigan State University after OK City.  Remember Gregory Peck in the film Gentlemans Agreement. Speak up when someone  drops a seemingly harmless little hate-joke at the dinner table.  Be intolerant of intolerance even among friends. 
<P>
Make your readers aware of the s-p-e-c-t-r-u-m of hate. It gets really subtle. It shows up in political language publically spoken with impunity, "the enemy of normal Americans." That's actually a 3-part hate-joke, playing on ENEMY and NORMAL and AMERICAN. You hurt your enemy, you kill your enemy. You spurn and disgard what is not normal. You put what is un-American against the traitor's firing-squad wall.
<P>
With this single phrase, Mr. Gingrich qualifies for a Nobel Prize for Hate. 
<P>
I'll write to Stockholm.
<P>
The Fayetteville Murders allegedly by neo-Nazi Army recruits have thrown this whole issue into our faces. At the heart of our most patriotic institution--the armed forces--gays are spurned but neo-Nazis are OK.
<P>
....Somethings wrong with this picture.
<P>
The <I>Times</I> has done a couple of lengthy reports after OK City, one mentioning "The Turner Diaries." But letting these confusing Elohim City stories dangle out there is puzzling, given the <I>Times'</I> interest in the subject. Perhaps one editor doesn't know what the other editor is doing. It's probably just that simple--I hope. I hope the <I>Times</I> cleans this up fast and continues to expose the rapid integration of the beliefs and actions of hate groups into mainstream suburban life. The extremist survivalist haters are saying "get ready!" and arming themselves to the teeth. We the American people in our daily lives need information so that <I>we</I> can "get ready" and arm ourselves with information to meet the violence these haters have planned. Remember, they are only a few compared to the huge majority of peaceful citizens--and it takes only a few to do enormous damage.
<P>
People like Morris Dees or James Coates or Michael Barkun or the ADL have been dutifully tracking hate groups for years. All these good people have been thought of as slightly nuts to bother with the fringe. Not anymore. 
<P>
Since Oklahoma City, there is no such thing as the fringe.
<P>
The fringe is here. 
<P>
The fringe walked right up behind us and tapped us on the shoulder. Im here! Our wonderful news media (including our usually wonderful <I>NY Times</I>) never saw it coming (that we knew of) and have been of little help explaining how the fringe got from there to here. Then Boom! OK City, the Amtrak train, the radar set-up at a New York airport, a preacher-bomber in or around Elohim City.
<P>
Some would say, Forget it, its just the fringe and (for some reason Ive never understood)  we should not give attention to the fringe. Like we would encourage the fringe by giving it attention. 
<P>
Well, we didnt give attention to the fringe and, like I said, the fringe is here--and we dont understand it.
<P>                                                 JWP 1-2-96

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
                <font size=5>T</font size=5>he House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct is today releasing a Statement of Alleged Violation issued in the matter of Representative Newt Gingrich. In addition, the Committee is also releasing Mr. Gingrich's answer to the Statement of Alleged Violation, in which he admits to the violation of House Rules contained in the Statement of Alleged Violation. 
<P>
                 In light of Mr. Gingrich's answer, the Investigative Subcommittee is of the
                 view that the Rules of the Committee will not require the holding of an
                 adjudicatory hearing to determine whether the violation has been proven.
                 Accordingly, with the concurrence of the Committee, the next proceeding
                 will be a hearing before the full Committee to determine a
                 recommendation to the House for an appropriate resolution. Since this
                 remains a pending matter, there will be no further public comment. 
<P>

              Mr. Gingrich responded the same day:<BR>

                      I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true

<P>
<HR width=100%>
<P>
 

             <H2>    Full Text of Statement Of Alleged
                 Violation By Rep. Newt Gingrich

                as issued by the House Of Representatives Committee On Standards Of Official
                 Conduct, known as The Ethics Committee. </H2>

<P>

                

                 1. At all times relevant to this Statement of Alleged Violation, Newt
                 Gingrich was a Member of the United States House of Representatives
                 representing the Sixth District of Georgia. 
<P>
                 2. At all times relevant to this Statement of Alleged Violation, GOPAC
                 was a political action committee within the meaning of section 527 of the
                 Internal Revenue Code dedicated to, among other things, achieving
                 Republican control of the United States House of Representatives. 
<P>
                 3. GOPAC's methods for accomplishing the goal described in paragraph
                 2 included the development of a political message to appeal to voters and
                 the dissemination of that message as widely as possible. As stated in a
                 draft document dated November 1, 1989, entitled "GOPAC IN THE
                 1990s:" 

                      [GOPAC's] role is to both create and disseminate the
                      doctrine of a majority Republican party. 

                      The creation of a new doctrine is essentially a research
                      function, involving the development of new ideas at the
                      strategic, operational and tactical level. Strategic doctrine, in
                      this context, consists of the language, policies and programs
                      that will define the caring, humanitarian, reform Republican
                      agenda of the 1990s. Operational doctrine consists of the
                      political message and image which will attract voters and
                      elect state and local candidates in support of this new
                      agenda. And, tactical doctrine consists of the specific
                      political techniques Republicans will use to win elections and
                      enact governing conservative policies. (emphasis in the
                      original). 
<P>
                 The document then states: 
<P>
                      As important as the creation of the new doctrine is its
                      dissemination. During the 1980s GOPAC and Newt
                      Gingrich have led the way in applying new technology, from
                      C-SPAN to video tapes, to disseminate information to
                      Republican candidates and political activists. 
<P>
                                           * * *
<P>
                      But the Mission Statement demands that we do much more.
                      To create the level of change needed to become a majority,
                      the new Republican doctrine must be communicated to a
                      broader audience, with greater frequency, in a more usable
                      form. GOPAC needs a bigger "microphone." (emphasis in
                      the original). 
<P>
                 4. From in or about September 1986 through in or about May 1995, Mr.
                 Gingrich was General Chairman of GOPAC. In that capacity he
                 determined the messages GOPAC used to accomplish its goals. 
<P>
                 5. In a document entitled "Key Factors in a House GOP Majoritv," Mr.
                 Gingrich wrote the following:
<P>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>            1. The fact that 50% of all potential voters are currently
                      outside politics (non-voters) creates the possibility that a
                      new appeal might alter the current balance of political power
                      by bringing in a vast number of new voters. 
<BR>[ . . . ]<BR>
<P>

                      3. It is possible to articulate a vision of "an America that can
                      be" which is appealing to most Americans, reflects the broad
                      values of a governing conservatism (basic American values,
                      entrepreneurial Free Enterprise and Technological progress),
                      and is very difficult for the Democrats to co-opt because of
                      their ideology and their interest groups. 
<P>

                      4. It is more powerful and more effective to develop a
                      reform movement parallel to the official Republican Party
                      because: <P>

                           a. the news media will find it more interesting
                           and cover it more often and more favorably; <P>

                           b. the non-voters who are non-political or
                           anti-political will accept a movement more
                           rapidly than they will accept an established
                           party; 

                         <BR>[. . . ]<P>

                      6. The objective measurable goal is the maximum growth of
                      news coverage of our vision and ideas, the maximum
                      recruitment of new candidates, voters and resources, and the
                      maximum electoral success in winning seats from the most
                      local office to the White House and then using those victories
                      to implement the values of a governing conservatism and to
                      create the best America that can be. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

                 6. In early 1990 GOPAC developed and carried out a project called
                 American Opportunities Workshop ("AOW"). It consisted of producing
                 and broadcasting a television program centered on a citizens' movement
                 to reform government. The movement was based on three tenants [sic]: <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

                      1. Basic American Values; <BR>

                      2. Entrepreneurial Free Enterprise; and <BR>

                      3. Technological Progress. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

                 The project also involved the recruitment of activists to set up local
                 workshops around the broadcast in order to recruit people to the
                 movement. The project was Mr. Gingrich's idea and he had a high level of
                 involvement in it. 
<P>

                 7. While AOW was described as being non-partisan, mailings sent by
                 GOPAC to its supporters described AOW as having partisan, political
                 goals. One letter sent over Mr. Gingrich's name stated the following: <P>

                      "[W]e'll be reaching voters with our message, and helping
                      drive down to the state and local level our politics of
                      realignment. 

                      Through the use of satellite hook-ups, not only can we reach
                      new groups of voters not traditionally associated with our
                      Party, but we'll be able to give them our message straight,
                      without it being filtered and misinterpreted by liberal
                      elements in the media."<P> 

                 The letter ended with the following: <P>

                      "I truly believe that our Party and our President stand on the
                      verge of a tremendous success this year, and that this
                      workshop can be a great election year boost to us."
<P>
                 8. AOW consumed a large portion of GOPAC's financial resources
                 during 1990. After one program the funding and operation of the project
                 was transferred, with Mr. Gingrich's knowledge and approval, to the
                 Abraham Lincoln Opportunity Foundation ("ALOF"), a corporation with
                 a tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
                 Code. ALOF operated out of GOPAC's offices. Its officers consisted of
                 Howard Callaway, the Chairman of GOPAC, and Kay Riddle, Executive
                 Director of GOPAC. In addition, the people who were listed as working
                 for ALOF were GOPAC employees or consultants. ALQI: raised and
                 expended taxdeductible charitable contributions to carry out the project. 
<P>
                 9. At ALOF the project was called American Citizens' Television
                 ("ACTV") and had the same goals as AOW. It was also based on the
                 three tenants of Basic American Values, Entrepreneurial Free Enterprise,
                 and Technological Progress and involved the recruiting of activists to set
                 up local workshops around the broadcast to recruit people to the citizens'
                 movement. In a letter sent by GOPAC over Mr. Gingrich's name, ACTV
                 was described as follows: <P>

                  <BLOCKQUOTE>    I am excited about progress of the "American Citizen's
                      Television" project, which will carry the torch of citizen
                      activism begun by our American Opportunities Workshop
                      on May l9th. We mobilized thousands of people across the
                      nation at the grass roots level who as a result of AOW, are
                      now dedicated GOPAC activists. We are making great
                      strides in continuing to recruit activists all across America to
                      become involved with the Republican party. Our efforts are
                      literally snowballing into the activist movement we need to
                      win in '92. </BLOCKQUOTE>



                               <P>         

                 10. ACTV broadcast three programs in 1990 and Mr. Gingrich continued
                 his involvement in the project. The first two were produced by ALOF.
                 They aired on July 21, 1990, and September 29, 1990, and were hosted
                 by Mr. Gingrich. The last program was produced by the Council for
                 Citizens Against Government Waste, a 501(c)(4) organization, and did
                 not include Mr. Gingrich. ALOF expended approximately $260,000 in
                 regard to these programs. 
<P>
                 11. Under the Internal Revenue Code, an organization which is exempt
                 from taxation under section 501(c)(3) must be operated exclusively for
                 exempt purposes. The presence of a single non-exempt purpose, if more
                 than insubstantial in nature, will destroy the exemption regardless of the
                 number or importance of truly exempt purposes. Conferring a benefit on
                 private interests is a non-exempt purpose. Under the Internal Revenue
                 Code, an organization which is exempt from taxation under section
                 501(c)(3) is also prohibited from providing any support to a political
                 action committee. These prohibitions reflect Congressional concerns that
                 tax-payer funds not be used to subsidize political activity. 
<P>
                 12. Mr. Gingrich did not seek specific legal advice concerning the
                 application of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code in regard to
                 the facts described in paragraphs 2 through 10 and did not take
                 affirmative steps to ensure that such legal advice was obtained by others
                 from an appropriate source.
<P>
                 13. During the Preliminary Inquiry the Investigative Subcommittee
                 ("Subcommittee") consulted with an expert in the law of tax-exempt
                 organizations. Mr. Gingrich's activities on behalf of ALOF and the
                 activities of others on behalf of ALOF with Mr. Gingrich's knowledge and
                 approval were reviewed by the expert. The expert concluded that those
                 activities violated ALOF's status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
                 Revenue Code in that, among other things, those activities: 
<P>
                      a. were intended to confer more than insubstantial benefits
                      on GOPAC and Republican entities and candidates; and<BR> 

                      b. provided support to GOPAC. 
<P>
                 14. The Subcommitee also heard from tax counsel retained by Mr.
                 Gingrich for the purposes of this Preliminary Inquiry. According to Mr.
                 Gingrich's tax counsel, this type of activity would not violate ALOF's
                 status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
<P>
                 15. Both the Subcommittee's expert and Mr. Gingrich's tax counsel agree
                 that had they been consulted about this type of activity prior to its taking
                 place, they would have advised that it not be conducted under the
                 auspices of an organization exempt from taxation under section 501 (c)(3)
                 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
<P>
                 16. If the legal advice described in paragraph 15 had been sought and
                 followed, most, if not all, of the tax-deductible charitable contributions
                 would not have been used for the activities described in paragraphs 2
                 through 10. As a result, the public controversy involving the legality of a
                 Member's involvement with an organization exempt from taxation under
                 section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code concerning activities
                 described in paragraphs 2 through 10 would not have occurred. 
<P>
                 17. In December 1992, Mr. Gingrich began to develop a movement
                 which became known as Renewing American Civilization. The goal of this
                 movement was the replacement of the "welfare state" with an "opportunity
                 society." 
<P>
                 18. A primary means of achieving this goal was the development of the
                 movement's message and the dissemination of that message as widely as
                 possible. The message was also known by the name of Renewing
                 American Civilization. The heart of that message was that the welfare state
                 had failed, that it could not be repaired but had to be replaced, and that it
                 had to be replaced with an opportunity society that was based on what
                 was called the "five pillars of American Civilization." These were:<P> 1)
                 personal strength; <BR>2) entrepreneurial free enterprise;<BR> 3) the spirit of
                 invention; <BR>4) quality as defined by Edwards Deming; and <BR>5) the lessons of
                 American history. <P>The message also concentrated on three substantive
                 areas. These were: <BR>1) jobs and economic growth; <BR>2) health; and<BR> 3) saving
                 the inner city. 
<P>
                 19. It was intended that a Republican majority would be part of the
                 movement. 
                     
<P>
                 20. One aspect of the movement was to "professionalize" the House
                 Republicans. One method for doing this was to use the movement's
                 message to attract voters, resources, and candidates. 
<P>
                 21. GOPAC was one of the institutions that was instrumental in
                 developing and disseminating the message of the movement. In early 1993
                 Mr. Gingrich, as GOPAC's General Chairman, was instrumental in
                 determining that virtually the entire political program for GOPAC in 1993
                 and 1994 would be centered on developing, disseminating, and using the
                 message of Renewing American Civilization. 
<P>
                 22. In late 1992 and through 1993, GOPAC's limited financial resources
                 were not sufficient to enable it to carry out all of the political programs at
                 its usual level. 
<P>
                 23. In or about late 1992 or early 1993, Mr. Gingrich decided to teach a
                 course. It was also entitled Renewing American Civilization. The course
                 lasted ten weeks and devoted a separate session to each of the "five
                 pillars" and each of the three substantive areas. 
<P>
                 24. GOPAC had a number of roles in regard to the course. They
                 included:

                      a. Starting in or about February 1993, employees and
                      consultants for GOPAC were involved in developing the
                      course. As of June 1, 1993, Jeffrey Eisenach, GOPAC's
                      Executive Director, and two of his assistants, resigned from
                      their positions at GOPAC to manage the operations of the
                      course. They did, however, maintain a consulting contract
                      under which GOPAC paid one-half of their salaries through
                      September 30, 1993. 
<P>
                      b. In a letter sent to all GOPAC Charter Members over Mr.
                      Gingrich's narne in June 1993, another aspect of GOPAC's
                      involvement in the course was described as follows: 

                           During our meeting in January, a number of
                           Charter Members were kind enough to take
                           part in a planning session on "Renewing
                           American Civilization." That session not only
                           affected the substance of what the message
                           was to be, but also how best the new message
                           of positive solutions could be disseminated to
                           this nation's decision makers-- elected officials,
                           civic and business leaders, the media and
                           individual voters. In addition to my present
                           avenues of communications I decided to add
                           an avenue close to my heart, that being
                           teaching. I have agreed with Kennesaw State
                           College, a 12,000 student graduate and
                           undergraduate college located in my district, to
                           teach "Renewing American Civilization" as a
                           for-credit class four times during the next four
                           years. 
<P>
                      c. GOPAC's Charter Member Meeting in April 1993 was
                      entitled "Renewing American Civilization." At that meeting,
                      Charter Members were asked to help develop the ideas
                      contained in the course. A memorandum to the Charter
                      Member attendees described that process as follows: 

                           As you are probably aware, Newt will be
                           teaching a for-credit class at Kennesaw State
                           College this Fall on the topic of "Renewing
                           American Civilization." The class is organized
                           around his "Five Pillars of American
                           Civilization" . . . 

                           During the afternoon of Sunday, April 25, we
                           are asking our Charter Members to participate
                           in a set of breakout sessions, with one session
                           focussing on each of the five "pillars." In
                           particular, we will ask you to critique a draft
                           "visions statement" explaining why we believe
                           each pillar is essential to renewing American
                           Civilization. If past experience is any guide, we
                           expect these sessions to dramatically improve
                           both our understanding of the subject and our
                           ability to communicate it. 
<P>
                      d. GOPAC employees took part in fundraising for the
                      course. 
<P>
                      e. GOPAC was involved in the promotion of the course. In
                      one such instance, GOPAC prepared and sent a letter
                      concerning the course over Mr. Gingrich's name to College
                      Republicans. The letter included the following: <P>

                           [C]onservatives today face a challenge larger
                           than stopping President Clinton. We must ask
                           ourselves what the future would be like if we
                           were allowed to define it, and learn to explain
                           that future to the American people in a way that
                           captures first their imagination and then their
                           votes. 

                           In that context, I am going to devote much of
                           the next four years, starting this Fall, to teaching
                           a course entitled "Renewing American
                           Civilization." I am writing to you today to ask
                           you to enroll for the class, and to organize a
                           seminar so that your friends can enroll as well. 
<P>
                                           * * *<P>

                           Let me be clear: This is not about politics as
                           such. But I believe the ground we will cover is
                           essential for anyone who hopes to be involved
                           in politics over the next several decades to
                           understand. American civilization is, after all,
                           the cultural glue that holds us all together.
                           Unless we can understand it, renew it and
                           extend it into the next century, we will never
                           succeed in replacing the Welfare State with an
                           Opportunity Society. 
<P>
                                           * * *<P>
                           I have devoted my life to teaching and acting
                           out a set of principles. As a fellow Republican,
                           I know you share those values. This class will
                           help us all remember what we're about and
                           why it is so essential that we prevail. Please
                           join me this Fall for "Renewing American
                           Civilization." <P>

                      f. In letters sent by GOPAC, a partisan, political role for the
                      course was described. 

                      Two letters sent over Mr. Gingrich's name included the
                      following statements: <P>

                           i. As we discussed, it is time to lay down a
                           blueprint -- which is why in part I am teaching
                           the course on Renewing American Civilization.
                           Hopefully, it will provide the structure to build
                           an offense so that Republicans can break
                           through dramatically in 1996. We have a good
                           chance to make significant gains in 1994, but
                           only if we can reach the point where we are
                           united behind a positive message, as well as a
                           critique of the Clinton program. 
<P>
                           ii. I am encouraged by your understanding that
                           the welfare state cannot merely be repaired,
                           but must be replaced and have made a goal of
                           activating at least 200,000 citizen activists
                           nationwide through my course, Renewing
                           American Civilization. We hope to educate
                           people with the fact that we are entering the
                           information society. In order to make sense of
                           this society, we must rebuild an opportunistic
                           country. In essence, if we can reach Americans
                           through my course, independent expenditures,
                           GOPAC and other strategies, we just might
                           unseat the Democratic majority in the House in
                           1994 and make goverrunent accountable again.
<P>
                      Another letter sent over GOPAC's Finance Director's name
                      included the following statement: 
<P>
                           iii. As the new finance director, I want to
                           introduce myself and to assure you of my
                           commitment and enthusiasm to the recruitment
                           and training of grassroots Republican
                           candidates. In addition, with the course Newt
                           will be teaching in the fall - Renewing American
                           Civilization - I see a very real opportunity to
                           educate the American voting population to
                           Republican ideals, increasing our opportunity to
                           win local, state and Congressional seats. 
<P>
                 25. The course was taught at Kennesaw State College in the fall of 1993
                 and was taught at Reinhardt College in the winters of 1994 and 1995. 
<P>
                 26. Each year the course consisted of forty hours of lectures. Mr.
                 Gingrich presented twenty hours of lecture and a co-professor from each
                 of the respective colleges was responsible for the other twenty hours of
                 the course. 
<P>
                 27. Each year the course was taught, it was also broadcast throughout the
                 United States via satellite and local cable channels, and distributed via
                 videotape and audiotape. The broadcasts and tapes only encompassed
                 the twenty hours of lectures presented by Mr. Gingrich. Kennesaw State
                 College Foundation and the Progress and Freedom Foundation were
                 responsible for this dissemination of the course; Reinhardt College was
                 not. 
<P>
                 28. The money raised and expended for the course was used primarily for
                 the dissemination of the course as described in paragraph 27. In 1993
                 course expenditures amounted to approximately $300,000, in 1994
                 course expenditures amounted to approximately $450,000, and in 1995
                 course expenditures amounted to approximately $450,000. 
<P>
                 29. The main message of the course and the main message of the
                 movement was renewing American civilization by replacing the welfare
                 state with an opportunity society. "Renewing American Civilization" was
                 also the main message of GOPAC and the main message of virtually every
                 political and campaign speech made by Mr. Gingrich in 1993 and 1994.
                 The course was, among other things, the primary means for developing
                 and disseminating this message.

                 30. Mr. Gingrich described the mission of the course and the movement
                 as follows: 
<P>
                      "We will develop a movement to renew American Civilization
                      using the 5 pillars of 21st Century Freedom so people
                      understand freedom and progress is possible and their
                      practical, daily lives can be far better. Renewing American
                      Civilization must be communicated as an intellectual-cultural
                      message with governmental-political consequences. As
                      people become convinced American civilization must and
                      can be renewed and the 5 pillars will improve their lives we
                      will encourage them and help them to network together and
                      independently, autonomously initiate improvements wherever
                      they want. However, we will focus on economic growth,
                      health, and saving the inner city as the first three key areas to
                      improve. Our emphasis will be on reshaping law and
                      government to facilitate improvement in all of american [sic]
                      society. We will emphasize elections, candidates and politics
                      as vehicles for change and the news media as a primary
                      vehicle for communications. To the degree Democrats agree
                      with our goals we will work with them but our emphasis is
                      on the Republican Party as the primary vehicle for renewing
                      American civilization." 
<P>
                 31. In a memorandum addressed to "Various Gingrich Staffs," which
                 included GOPAC employees and consultants as well as people involved
                 in Mr. Gingrich's campaign, Mr. Gingrich described the broad application
                 of the Renewing American Civilization message as follows: 
<P>
                      "I believe the vision of renewing American civilization will
                      allow us to orient and focus our activities for a long time to
                      come. 
<P>
                      At every level from the national focus of the Whip office to
                      the 6th district of Georgia focus of the Congressional office
                      to the national political education efforts of GOPAC and the
                      reselection efforts of FONG we should be able to use the
                      ideas, language and concepts of renewing American
                      civilization." 
<P>
                 He then described the role of the course in this process: 
<P>
                      "The course is only one in a series of strategies designed to
                      implement a strategy of renewing American civilization."
<P>

                 Another of Mr. Gingrich's strategies involving the course was: <P>

                      "Getting Republican activists committed to renewing
                      American civilization, to setting up workshops built around
                      the course, and to opening the party up to every citizen who
                      wants to renew American civilization." 
<P>
                 32. In writing about the goals of the movement, Mr. Gingrich wrote: 
<P>
                      "Our overall goal is to develop a blueprint for renewing
                      America by replacing the welfare state, recruit, discover,
                      arouse and network together 200,000 activists including
                      candidates for elected office at all levels, and arouse enough
                      volunteers and contributors to win a sweeping victory in
                      1996 and then actually implement our victory in the first
                      three months of 1997. 
<P>
                 The "sweeping victory" referred to in this document is by Republicans.
<P>
                 Mr. Gingrich went on to describe the specific goals within the overall goal,
                 all of which were to be accomplished through the course . . . 
<P>
                      1. By April 1996 have a thorough, practical blueprint for
                      replacing the welfare state that can be understood and
                      supported by voters and activists. 
<P>
                      We will teach a course on Renewing American civilization on
                      ten Saturday mornings this fall and make it available by
                      satellite, by audio and video tape and by computer to
                      interested activists across the country. A month will then be
                      spent redesigning the course based on feedback and better
                      ideas. Then the course will be retaught in Winter Quarter
                      1994. It will then be rethought and redesigned for nine
                      months of critical reevaluation based on active working
                      groups actually applying ideas across the country the course
                      will be taught for one final time in Winter Quarter 1996. 
<P>
                      2. Have created a movement and momentum which require
                      the national press corps to actually study the material in
                      order to report the phenomenon thus infecting them with new
                      ideas, new language and new perspectives. 
<P>
                      3. Have a cadre of at least 200,000 people committed to the
                      general ideas so they are creating an echo effect on talk
                      radio and in letters to the editor and most of our candidates
                      and campaigns reflect the concepts of renewing America. 
<P>
                      Replacing the welfare state will require about 200,000
                      activists (willing to learn now [sic] to replace the welfare
                      state, to run for office and to actually replace the welfare
                      state once in office) and about six million supporters (willing
                      to write checks, put up yard signs, or do a half day's
                      volunteer work). 
<P>
                 33. In a speech at a GOPAC training seminar for candidates at the
                 Virginia Republican Convention in June 1993, Mr. Gingrich described a
                 partisan goal of the movement: 
<P>
                      "We can't do much about the Democrats. They went too far
                      to the left; they're still too far to the left; that's their problem.
                      But we have a huge burden so that everyone who wants to
                      replace the welfare state and everyone who wants to renew
                      American civilization has a home, and it's called being a
                      Republican. We have to really learn how to bring them all in."
<P>
                 He then discussed the role of the course in the movement and described
                 how the "five pillars" of the Renewing American Civilization course could
                 be applied to political campaigns. 
<P>
                      "Now, let me start just as a quick overview. First, as I said
                      earlier, American civilization is a civilization. Very important.
                      It is impossible for anyone on the left to debate you on that
                      topic." 
<P>
                                           * * *
<P>
                     "But the reason I say that is if you go out and you campaign
                      on behalf of American civilization and you want to renew
                      American civilization, it is linguistically impossible to oppose
                      you. And how is your opponent going to get up and say I'm
                      against American civilization?" 
<P>
                 Near the end of the speech he stated: 
<P>
                      "I believe, if you take the five pillars I've described, if you find
                      the three areas that will really fit you, and are really in a
                      position to help you, that you are then going to have a
                      language to explain how to replace the welfare state, and
                      three topics that are going to arouse volunteers and arouse
                      contributions and help people say, Yes, I want this done."
<P>
                 34. In a number of other instances, Mr. Gingrich applied the ideas of the
                 course to partisan, political purposes. Examples include: 
<P>
                      a. In a document entitled "House Republican Focus for
                      1994" Mr. Gingrich wrote: <P>

                           "The Republican party can offer a better life for
                           virtually everyone if it applies the principles of
                           American civilization to create a more flexible,
                           decentralized market oriented system that uses
                           the Third Wave of change and accepts the
                           disciplines of the world market. 

                           These ideas are outlined in a 20 hour
                           intellectual framework "Renewing American
                           Civilization" available on National
                           Empowerment Television every Wednesday
                           from 1 pm to 3 pm and available on audio tape
                           and video tape from 1-800-TO RENEW." 
<P>
                      b. In a document Mr. Gingrich said was a briefing paper for
                      House Republican Members, he described the movement to
                      renew American civilization. Renewing American civilization
                      required the replacement of the welfare state with an
                      opportunity society. He wrote that doing this will require at
                      least 200,000 "partners for progress" willing to study the
                      principles of American civilization, work on campaigns, run
                      for office, and engage in other activities to further the
                      movement. <P>
Under the heading "LEARNING THE
                      PRINCIPLES OF AMERICAN CIVILIZATION" Mr.
                      Gingrich wrote, 
<P>"The course, 'Renewing American
                      Civilization', is designed as a 20-hour introduction to the
                      principles necessary to replace the welfare state with an
                      opportunity society." On the next page entitled "Connecting
                      the 'Partners' to the 'Principles,"' Mr. Gingrich described
                      where the course was being taught, including the fact that it
                      was being broadcast for fifty weeks during 1994 on National
                      Empowerment Television. He then wrote that, "Our goal is
                      to get every potential partner for progress to take the course
                      and study the principles." 
<P>
                      c. In a document entitled "The 14 Steps Renewing American
                      Civilization by replacing the welfare state with an opportunity
                      society," Mr. Gingrich described a relationship between the
                      course and the movement. He began with the proposition
                      that the welfare state had failed and needed to be replaced.
                      In describing the replacement, Mr. Gingrich wrote that it: <P>

                <BLOCKQUOTE>  "must be an opportunity society based on the
                           principles of American civilization 

                           These principles each receive two hours of
                           introduction in 'Renewing American
                           Civilization', a course taught at Reinhardt
                           College. The course is available on National
                           Empowerment Television from 1 - 3 P.M.
                           every Wednesday and by videotape or
                           audiotape by calling 1-800-TO-RENEW."</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
                      Mr. Gingrich then wrote: 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
                           "The Democrats are the party of the welfare
                           state. Too many years in office have led to
                           arrogance of power and to continuing violations
                           of the basic values of self-government. 

                           Only by voting Republican can the welfare
                           state be replaced and an opportunity society be
                           created. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
                 35. From in or about June 1993 through in or about December 1993, the
                 course was funded and operated with tax-exempt funds under the
                 auspices of the Kennesaw State College Foundation, an organization
                 exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
                 Code. From in or about December 1993 through in or about July 1995,
                 the course was funded and operated under the auspices of the Progress
                 and Freedom Foundation, an organization exempt from taxation under
                 section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. In 1994 and 1995 the
                 course was taught at Reinhardt College, an organization exempt from
                 taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
<P>
                 36. Under the Internal Revenue Code, an organization which is exempt
                 from taxation under section 501(c)(3) must be operated exclusively for
                 exempt purposes. The presence of a single non-exempt purpose, if more
                 than insubstantial in nature, will destroy the exemption regardless of the
                 number or importance of truly exempt purposes. Conferring a benefit on
                 private interests is a non-exempt purpose. Under the Internal Revenue
                 Code, an organization which is exempt from taxation under section
                 501(c)(3) is also prohibited from any participation in a political campaign
                 or from providing any support to a political action committee. These
                 prohibitions reflect Congressional concerns that tax-payer funds not be
                 used to subsidize political activity. 
<P>
                 37. Although Mr. Gingrich consulted with the House Committee on
                 Standards of Official Conduct ("Committee") prior to teaching the course,
                 he did not seek specific legal advice concerning the application of section
                 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code in regard to the facts described in
                 paragraphs 17 through 35 from an appropriate source and did not take
                 affirmative steps to ensure that such legal advice was obtained by others
                 from an appropriate source. 
<P>
                 38. During the Preliminary Inquiry the Subcommittee consulted with an
                 expert in the law of tax-exempt organizations. Mr. Gingrich's activities on
                 behalf of the Kennesaw State College Foundation, the Progress and
                 Freedom Foundation, and Reinhardt College in regard to the course
                 entitled "Renewing American Civilization" and the activities of others on
                 behalf of those organizations with Mr. Gingrich's knowledge and approval
                 were reviewed by the expert. <P>The expert concluded that those activities
                 violated Kennesaw State College Foundation's status under section
                 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Progress and Freedom
                 Foundation's status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
                 Code, and Reinhardt College's status under section 501(c)(3) of the
                 Internal Revenue Code in that, among other things, those activities were
                 intended to confer more than insubstantial benefits on Mr. Gingrich,
                 GOPAC, and other Republican entities and candidates. 
<P>
                 39. The Subcommittee also heard from tax counsel retained by Mr.
                 Gingrich for the purposes of this Preliminary Inquiry. According to Mr.
                 Gingrich's tax counsel, this type of activity would not violate the status of
                 the Kennesaw State College Foundation, the Progress and Freedom
                 Foundation, or Reinhardt College under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
                 Revenue Code. 

<P>
                 40. Both the Subcommittee's expert and Mr. Gingrich's tax counsel agree
                 that had they been consulted about this type of activity prior to its taking
                 place, they would have advised that it not be conducted under the
                 auspices of an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3)
                 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
<P>
                 41. If the legal advice described in paragraph 40 had been sought and
                 followed, most, if not all, of the tax-deductible charitable contributions
                 would not have been used for the activities described in paragraphs 17
                 through 35. As a result, the public controversy involving the legality of a
                 Member's involvement with organizations exempt from taxation under
                 section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code concerning activities
                 described in paragraphs 17 through 35 would not have occurred. 
<P>
                 42. On or about September 7, 1994, a complaint was filed against Mr.
                 Gingrich with the Committee. The complaint centered on the course
                 entitled "Renewing American Civilization." Among other things, it alleged
                 that Mr. Gingrich had used his congressional staff to work on the course
                 and that he had misused organizations that were exempt from taxation
                 under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code because the course
                 was a partisan, political project, with significant involvement by GOPAC,
                 and was not a permissible activity for a section 501(c)(3) organization. 
<P>
                 43. On or about October 4, 1994, Mr. Gingrich wrote the Committee in
                 response to the complaint and primarily addressed the issues concerning
                 the use of congressional staff for the course. In doing so he stated: 
<P>
                      I would like to make it abundantly clear that those who were
                      paid for course preparation were paid by either the
                      Kennesaw State Foundation, [sic] the Progress and
                      Freedom Foundation or GOPAC.... Those persons paid by
                      one of the aforementioned groups include: Dr. Jeffrey
                      Eisenach, Mike DuGally, Lana Rogers, Patty Stechschultez
                      [sic], Parnla Prochnow, Dr. Steve Hanser, Joe Gaylord and
                      Nancy Desmond. 
<P>
                 44. On or about October 31, 1994, the Committee sent Mr. Gingrich a
                 letter asking for additional information concerning the allegations of misuse
                 of taxexempt organizations in regard to the course. The Committee also
                 asked for information relating to the involvement of GOPAC in various
                 aspects of the course. 
<P>
                 45. Whether any aspects of the course were political or partisan in their
                 motivation, application, or design was material to the Committee's
                 deliberations in regard to the complaint. Whether GOPAC had any
                 involvement with the course was also material to the Committee's
                 deliberations in regard to the complaint. 
<P>
                 46. In November 1994, Mr. Gingrich retained counsel to represent him in
                 connection with the Committee's investigation. According to Mr. Gingrich,
                 he then relied on counsel to respond to and otherwise address issues and
                 concerns raised by the Committee. Mr. Gingrich, however, remained
                 ultimately responsible for fully, fairly, and accurately responding to the
                 Committee. 
<P>
                 47. Between on or about December 8, 1994, and on or about December
                 15, 1994, Mr. Gingrich delivered or caused to be delivered to the
                 Committee a letter dated December 8, 1994, signed by Mr. Gingrich in
                 response to the Committee's letter described in paragraph 44. 
<P>
                 According to testimony before the Subcommittee, the six-page December
                 8, 1994 letter was prepared by Mr. Gingrich's attorney and submitted to
                 Mr. Gingrich for review during the transition following the 1994 election.
                 In the December 8, 1994 letter Mr. Gingrich made the following
                 statements: <P><BLOCKQUOTE>

                      [The course] was, by design and application, completely
                      nonpartisan. It was and remains about ideas, not politics.
                      (Page 2). 

                      The idea to teach "Renewing American Civilization" arose
                      wholly independent of GOPAC, because the course, unlike
                      the committee, is non-partisan and apolitical. My motivation
                      for teaching these ideas arose not as a politician, but rather
                      as a former educator and concerned American citizen ....
                      (Page 4). 

                      The fact is, "Renewing American Civilization" and GOPAC
                      have never had any official relationship. (Page 4). 

                      GOPAC . . . is a political organization whose interests are
                      not directly advanced by this non-partisan educational
                      endeavor. (Page 5). 

                      As a political action committee, GOPAC never participated
                      in the administration of "Renewing American Civilization."
                      (Page 4). 

                      Where employees of GOPAC simultaneously assisted the
                      project, they did so as private, civic-minded individuals
                      contributing time and effort to a 501(c)(3) organization.
                      (Page 4). 

                      Anticipating media or political attempts to link the Course to
                      [GOPAC], "Renewing American Civilization'' organizers
                      went out of their way to avoid even the appearances of
                      improper association with GOPAC. Before we had raised
                      the first dollar or sent out the first brochure, Course Project
                      Director Jeff Eisenach resigned his position at GOPAC.
                      (Page 4). </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

                 48. On or about January 26, 1995, an amended complaint against Mr.
                 Gingrich was filed with the Committee. The amended complaint
                 encompassed the same allegations as the complaint described in
                 paragraph 42, as well as additional allegations. 
<P><P>
                 49. On or about March 27, 1995, Mr. Gingrich's attorney prepared,
                 signed, and caused a fifty-two page letter dated March 27, 1995, with 31
                 exhibits to be delivered to the Committee responding to the amended
                 complaint. The March 27, 1995 letter was submitted to Mr. Gingrich
                 shortly before it was filed with the Committee.

                 50. Prior to the letter from Mr. Gingrich's attorney being delivered to the
                 Committee, Mr. Gingrich reviewed it and approved its submission to the
                 Committee. The ultimate responsibility for the accuracy of information
                 submitted to the Committee remained with Mr. Gingrich. 
<P>
                 51. The March 27, 1995 letter contains the following statements: 
<P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>     As Ex. 13 demonstrates, the course solicitation . . . materials
                      are completely non-partisan. (Page 19, footnote 1). 

                      GOPAC did not become involved in the Speaker's
                      academic affairs because it is a political organization whose
                      interests are not advanced by this non-partisan educational
                      endeavor. (Page 35). 
<P>
                      The Renewing American Civilization course and GOPAC
                      have never had any relationship, official or otherwise. (Page
                      35). 
<P>
                      As noted previously, GOPAC has had absolutely no role in
                      funding, promoting, or administering Renewing American
                      Civilization. (Pages 34-35). 
<P>
                      GOPAC has not been involved in course fundraising and has
                      never contributed any money or services to the course.
                      (Page 28). 
<P>
                      Anticipating media or political attempts to link the course to
                      GOPAC, course organizers went out of their way to avoid
                      even the appearance of associating with GOPAC. Prior to
                      becoming Course Project Director, Jeffrey Eisenach
                      resigned his position at GOPAC and has not returned. (Page
                      36). </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
                 52. Mr. Gingrich engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the
                 House of Representatives in that: regardless of the resolution of whether
                 the activities described in paragraphs 2 through 41 constitute a violation of
                 section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, by failing to seek and
                 follow the lqal advice described in paragraphs 15 and 40, Mr. Gingrich
                 failed to take appropriate steps to ensure that the activities described in
                 paragraphs 2 through 41 were in accordance with section 501(c)(3) of
                 the Internal Revenue Code; and on or about March 27, 1995, and on or
                 about December 8, 1994, information was transmitted to the Committee
                 by and on behalf of Mr. Gingrich that was material to matters under
                 consideration by the Committee, which information, as Mr. Gingrich
                 should have known, was inaccurate, incomplete, and unreliable. 
<P>
                 53. The conduct described in this Statement of Alleged Violation
                 constitutes a violation of Rule 43(1) of the Rules of the United States
                 House of Representatives. 

<P>


                                      END OF STATEMENT 12-21-96

 <P>
This is a partial script for CounterSpin, the nationally
syndicated radio program of FAIR. 
<P>
Broadcast week: 5/17/96 through 5/24/96
 <P>
<font size=5>J</font size=5>anine Jackson: 
<P>
<I>Washington Post</I> columnist James Glassman was
absolutely unequivocal in his piece on the minimum wage back on
April 9, 1996. The article was headlined "Raise the Minimum Wage? No."
And Glassman offered some high profile support for his position,
saying "If you don't believe me, listen to liberal economists
William Baumol and Alan Blinder [whom Pres. Clinton appointed to the
Federal Reserve Board]. They wrote in their textbook: 'the primary
consequence of the minimum wage law is not an increase in the
incomes of the least skilled workers but a restriction of their
employment opportunities.'" 
<P>
Problem is: the text Glassman is citing
has been through five editions since the 1979 version he quotes,
and even its authors now disagree with it. This fact was pointed
out by none other than Alan Blinder himself in a letter to the
Washington Post--a letter which began "Readers of James Glassman's
'Raise the Minimum Wage? No" op-ed may come away thinking that I
oppose President Clinton's proposed increase in the minimum wage.
In fact, I support it." And Blinder also points out that the survey
of economists and the General Accounting Office study that Glassman
cites are also quite old and have been superseded by new
statistical evidence. 
<P>
As for his textbook, the section on the
minimum wage in the current edition notes that "Recent statistical
studies suggest that the undesirable effects of the minimum wage
laws are far less serious than previously widely believed." 
<P>
So:
James Glassman's main source for his argument against the minimum
wage increase actually holds a position opposite to that Glassman
ascribes to him. But you wouldn't know that from reading the Post;
they--amazingly--never ran Blinder's letter. 
 <PRE>   </PRE>
Laura Flanders: 
<P>
Maybe the <I>Post</I> should just do away with their letters page and
be done with it. On May 8, 1996 they published a column in which author
Robert Samuelson said he was perplexed why the GOP was pushing so
hard for Medical Savings Accounts. "The political puzzle is why so
many Republicans are obsessed with MSAs," wrote Samuelson. He
opened his column, "Just why some Republicans have chosen MSAs for
their latest crusade is a mystery known only to them."
 <P>
Ellen Miller, Executive Miller of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a group that regularly tracks the dollars in D.C., wrote to
the <I>Post</I> as follows: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"You don't need to be Nancy Drew or even the Hardy boys to figure
out this 'mystery'.... All you have to do is follow the money." 
 <P>
"The path leads to Indianapolis, Indiana, to the front door of
Patrick Rooney and his insurance company, Golden Rule Financial
Corp. Rooney subscribes to the Golden Rule of American politics: He
who has the gold rules. Rooney and his corporate PAC have flooded
the Republicans and to a lesser degree the Democrats with cash. "
 </BLOCKQUOTE>
According to Miller, In the 1994 elections, Rooney and his PAC gave
$912,892 to federal candidates.... Newt Gingrich received more than
$27,445 from the Golden Rule folks between January 1993 and June
1995. Golden Rule gave at least $150,000 to Gingrich's GOPAC.
Senate Majority leader Dole received $35,000 too. Another $40,000
went to the Democratic party. Only Amway and Philip Morris gave
more to the GOP in the last election cycle. 
 <P>
Miller goes on to say that 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Samuelson has written before that he
has a blind spot when it comes to the influence of big money on the
democratic process. Even if he lost all five senses it would seem
hard to ignore Golden Rule's massive contributions and lobbying for
MSAs. "</BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>
The answer to Samuelson's puzzle is that Dole and Gingrich owe
Rooney big time. As Ellen Miller put it, "Mystery Solved." Now just
guess whether that letter has appeared in the <I>Post.</I> No prizes for
the winners here.

<P>
The folks at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting appear to
have lost all sense of irony, not to mention shame, these days as
they fall over themselves to make non-commercial broadcasting more corporate-friendly. 
<P>
According to the May 13th issue of <I>Current</I>
magazine, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has prepared a
report entitled "Study of Commercial Activities in Public
Broadcasting"--and a CPB representative, Wendy Charleton, was
scheduled to give a talk on the report's findings. The talk was
entitled "How Commercial Should You Go?" Apparently the idea that
non-commercial broadcasting should not be at all commercial is
passe, or something. Reminds me of the old joke: we've established what they are, now we're just haggling over price.
 <PRE>    </PRE>
Laura Flanders: 
<P>
One of the reasons that non-commercial broadcasting is supposed
to exist is to insulate the medium from corporate influence. We
were reminded of that this week when the CNBC show "Inside Opinion"
canceled a planned segment on tobacco giant Philip Morris. 
 <P>
Philip Morris, you may know, recently proposed legislation that
would limit the marketing of cigarettes to minors <I>only if</I>  the Food
and Drug Administration abandons its attempt to regulate tobacco.
In preparing a segment on this proposal, Inside Business contacted
INFACT, the corporate accountability watchdog group best known for
its campaigns against GE and Nestle. INFACT was happy for the
chance to argue that, as executive director Kathy Mulvey put it,
"There is no place for Philip Morris in making health policy.
Period."--and to point out that letting a corporation direct
legislation that affects its own immediate interests would be a
very dangerous precedent. But then INFACT got a call saying the
segment was canceled, because, according to producer Diane
Quintero, they couldn't get Philip Morris to participate. Well,
duh, you might say, but CNBC said, No Philip Morris--No Story. <P>
When INFACT probed further, the producer revealed a bit more:
Philip Morris objected to [the show's] main anchor--his interview
questions, it seems, aren't softball enough--and the company said
it won't appear with him on the show. Even knowing that, CNBC still
said they won't do the story without Philip Morris because, as the
producer put it, they're the "main character." Funny, that's not
how they seem to do stories on women on welfare, or immigrants just
fine without inviting the protagonist into the studio. 
 <PRE>    </PRE>
Janine Jackson: 
<P>
The <I>New York Times</I> on May 14, 1996 ran a story on composting,
focusing on disagreements over the potential of compost dumps to
cause health hazards. Unfortunately, the <I>Times</I> threw out some
potentially important distinctions along the way. To underscore the
point that "some doctors believe the 1994 Health Department study
[which found no dangers] only touches on the health risks of
organic recycling" the <I>Times</I> tells the story of Harry Dobin, a Long
Island man who died after years of working near a compost site. But
the <I>Times</I> neglects to mention that the site near Dobin was not
organic, but was composting sewage sludge--a substantively
different thing. The differing health effects of different kinds of
composting might be a worthy topic for a follow up story, but we
won't....hold our breath?  Sorry.
 <PRE>    </PRE>
Laura Flanders: 
<P>
Finally, an article in the <I>San Francisco Bay Guardian,</I> May 8,
revealed a creepy fact.  Apparently all those folks defending the
death penalty have been trying to keep the details of their
killings dark. Literally. The public has a right to witness
executions under the first amendment. Reporters access to prisoners is supposed to be guaranteed as well. But before a federal judge
granted a last minute injunction, California's prisons were
applying restrictive new guidelines on who could witness what. 
 <P>
This February, San Quentin executed William Bonin by lethal
injection while reporters and other witnesses were prevented from
witnessing anything but the last minutes of the procedure. Pia
Hinckle reporting for the San Francisco Bay Guardian May 8,
revealed that under the restrictions, reporters were forbidden to
wear watches--so they couldn't record how long it took for
William Bonin to die. And they were denied notebooks. Now if the
death penalty's got the confidence of the State--what was the
California Department of Corrections trying to hide?
 <P>
By the time Keith Daniel Williams became the second person put to
death by lethal injection in the state, this May, the injunction
was in effect, but several restrictions still applied. Free Speech
advocates and media organizations are continuing to fight for their
rights.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  (Dec. 18, 1996)<BR>
 [Please copy, post and relay]<BR>
FAIR (Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting)<BR></CENTER>

<P>
<H4><font size=5>A</font size=5> national media watch group today released a report highly critical of major media reaction to the<I>San Jose Mercury News</I> series linking the CIA-backed Nicaraguan Contras to the spread of crack cocaine in urban America.
<P>
The report, to be published next month by FAIR (Fairness &
Accuracy In Reporting), focuses on three newspapers--the
<I>Washington Post, New York Times</I> and <I>Los Angeles Times</I>--which have printed lengthy articles attacking the <I>Mercury News</I> series.
<P>
Noting that the assessments by those three newspapers are "still
reverberating in the national media's echo chamber," FAIR's
report faults the papers for heavy reliance on official sources
inside the CIA and other agencies with vested interests in
undercutting the <I>Mercury News</I> accounts. FAIR's report (to be
published in the Jan./Feb. 1997 <I>EXTRA!</I>) also highlights a history of national media suppression and marginalization of the
contra-cocaine story in the 1980s.
<P>
FAIR's researchers found that <I>Mercury News</I> reporter Gary Webb
was frequently assailed for failing to prove what he had never
claimed in the first place. The report points out that Webb's
series did not assert the CIA was guilty of dealing crack in U.S.
inner cities. Some of the attacks harped on "what Webb had
already acknowledged in his articles--that while he proves
Contra links to major cocaine importation, he can't identify
specific CIA officials who knew of or condoned the trafficking."
<P>
"Journalistic critics of the <I>Mercury News</I> offered little to
rebut the paper's specific pieces of evidence"--including
testimony and law enforcement documents and comments--indicating that a pair of Nicaraguan cocaine traffickers "may
have been protected by federal agents."
<P>
Although the <I>Washington Post</I> in particular took issue with the
<I>Mercury News</I> for referring to the Nicaraguan Contras as "the
CIA's army," the FAIR report describes use of the phrase as
"solid journalism" that highlights a relationship "fundamentally
relevant to the story. The army was formed at the instigation of
the CIA, its leaders were selected by and received salaries from
the agency, and CIA officers controlled day-to-day battlefield
strategies." The report criticizes what it calls a "newsroom
culture of denial" that dodged such historical realities.
<P>
The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> joined the other two dailies in
downplaying the importance of crack dealer Ricky Ross, who was
supplied by a pair of Nicaraguan cocaine smugglers linked to the
Contras. Yet two years ago (12/20/94), the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>
described Ross as the "king of crack" whose "coast-to-coast
conglomerate" was responsible for "a staggering turnover that put
the drug within reach of anyone with a few dollars."  FAIR's
report notes that the <I>L.A. Times</I> reversal on Ross "reads like a show-trial recantation."
<P>
Depictions of African-Americans as prone to paranoia "quickly
became a stylish media fixation," the report charged. "This theme
of black paranoia accompanied all three of the major papers'
attacks on the <I>Mercury News</I> series." Ironically, FAIR concluded, top editors at the <I>Washington Post, New York Times</I> and<I>Los Angeles Times</I> ended up ignoring evidence that did not fit their preconceived outlook--"the true mark of the delusional mindset."
<P>
The FAIR report concludes that the high-profile attacks on the
<I>Mercury News</I> by the <I>New York Times, Washington Post</I> and <I>L.A. Times</I> "were clearly driven by a need to defend their shoddy record on the contra-cocaine story--involving a decade-long
suppression of evidence." In recent months, those papers have
promoted "the notion that Contra participation in drug
trafficking is old news--a particularly ironic claim coming
from newspapers that went out of their way to ignore or disparage
key information during the 1980s." (The obstruction of a 1987
report on Contra-cocaine links by <I>Time</I> magazine is also noted.)
<P>
Journalists can obtain copies of the full report--"Snow Job:
The Establishment's Papers Do Damage Control for the CIA,"
written by FAIR associate Norman Solomon--by calling
212-633-6700, extension 307.

The 1996 re-election of President Clinton is over. Partisan Republican "independent counsel" Kenneth Starr lunched with Republican Federal judges who appointed him and proceeded to spend $30 million bucks to turn up absolutely nothing on the President. Even Sen. Alfonse D'Amato announced he was chastened by the public backlash at his incessant Whitewater hearings. But Whitewater goes on and on. Undeterred, Mr. Starr is blithely doing the unheard of by appearing around the country in various public forums promoting dark allegations while taking no questions. Susan MacDougal is doing extra time in a Texas prison for refusing to appear before Starr's grand jury and being called a perjurer for telling the truth (see <a href="susan.htm"> Susan Speaks</A> below). This entire witch-hunt is something we expect in China or Iran, not the U.S.A. "Fools for Scandal" is a riveting report on the scandal-mongering of "above-the-fold" Whitewater journalism, especially how the <I>New York Times</I> got the story wrong from the start. Includes a journalist roundtable that will knock your socks off (no pun intended). Seriously, folks, this is an important book on the media. Order the paperback here in time for the holidays.

<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> <A HREF="http://hatewatch.org/"> HATE WATCH:</A>  Here's a telling sample from one of dozens of sites collected by Hate Watch: "You must no longer believe the lies from the Jewish media! We shall make our own media here on the Internet!" Notice the specific articulation of what is merely under the breath of some average Americans who castigate what they call the "liberal media" (liberals and Jews are tightly associated among hate groups and even some mainstream citizens)--the old anti-Semitic hoax that Jews supposedly control the media (along with banking and government) as a means of "controlling the world." In case you think this is peripheral stuff, this paranoid idea is the premise of Timothy McVeigh's favorite book "The Turner Diaries." 
<P>
On the other hand, they have a point about media being a serious problem, but it's not for the reasons they believe.
<P>
Access to cheap Internet communication allows hate groups to organize and spread their ideas. Says Don Black, ex-Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan and owner of
the white supremacist home page <A HREF="http://www.stormfront.org/"> Stormfront</A>, "[On the Internet] the access is anonymous and there is unlimited ability to communicate with others of a like mind." <A HREF="http://hatewatch.org/">Hate Watch</A> excerpts segments of their actual language. It's a riveting education. And where is any of this covered in the popular news media? Why do we have to wait until a bomb explodes to find out how these folks think? See <A HREF="parano1.htm"> "The Paranoid Frontier"</A> above.

<h3>YUGOSLAVIA: U.S. soldiers to begin aiding war crimes investigators</h3>
TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina - For the first time, U.S. troops this week will provide security and other limited support for U.N. war crimes investigators, the commander of the NATO-led peace force in Bosnia says.
<h3>City and Country Don't Mix in Sarajevo</h3>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina - War battered Sarajevo's buildings and tattered its tradition of multi-culturalism. But now that peace has come, many natives see a new threat to their once cosmopolitan city: the country bumpkin.
   For those born in Sarajevo, coexistence in their city is less a matter of who you are than where you come from. If you're from the city, you're OK, regardless of ethnicity. If not, you're not.
<h3>LEARNING AMID THE RUINS: The sun never sets on this university</h3>
WASHINGTON - Sgt. Metheus Miller has taken English in South Korea, government in Germany and now corporate theory in Croatia - a student-soldier who keeps the peace by day and studies by night. He's in the Army now, but soldiers like Miller, serving around the globe and in the war-ravaged former Yugoslavia, are earning college credits in makeshift University of Maryland University College classrooms. The fatigue-clad students are taught by a rare breed of professor, known as gypsy scholars, that has been holding forth amid rubble and ruin since the post-World War II reconstruction of Germany.
<h3>CHECHNYA: Yeltsin calls halt to combat operations in Chechnya</h3>
MOSCOW - Desperate to show voters he will stop the war that is sinking his presidency, Boris Yeltsin on Sunday announced a halt to combat operations in Chechnya, limited troop withdrawals and a willingness to hold indirect talks with the rebels' leader.
   But his long-promised peace plan stopped short of promising an end to the fighting and left scant hope for an imminent settlement.
<h3>CAMPAIGN '96: Clinton deposition has critics pondering TV ads</h3>
WASHINGTON - A court order for President Clinton to give videotaped testimony in a Whitewater criminal trial has producers of Republican attack ads pondering potential uses of the footage in the fall. Floyd Brown, maker of the infamous 1988 Willie Horton ad against Michael Dukakis, promises to "take a serious look" at any segments of Clinton's videotaped deposition that become public.
<h3>FIRST LADY: For a while, First Lady escaped troubles at home</h3>
DELPHI, Greece - In a cramped, steamy room toward the end of Hillary Rodham Clinton's long week in Europe, a Turkish lawmaker struggled for the right words of praise for the visiting first lady.
   Her trip was such a success that "we are going to keep you here as a hostage," joked Tayyar Altikulac, a member of Parliament.
   Rocking her head back, Mrs. Clinton laughed. "There's a certain interest in that," she said. "This is an election year and sometimes I wish I could be kept away from that."
   After eight days in southern Europe, with a quick side trip to a slice of Asia in Istanbul, Mrs. Clinton was returning home Sunday night after touring Delphi, home of the famed oracle _ a hostage again to her political troubles.
<h3>HONG KONG: Residents get last chance to apply for British passports</h3>
HONG KONG - Raymond and Grace Chan argued up to the last minute about whether to apply for British passports. He said it was like an insurance policy. She said it made her feel disloyal to her Chinese heritage.
   In the end they filed their application, two of more than 160,000 people who have mobbed the Hong Kong passport office this month to beat a midnight deadline on Sunday.
<h3>BLURRY SUDAN: Charges of terrorism, claims of democracy a murky mix</h3>
KHARTOUM, Sudan - The fundamentalist regime of Sudan is a pariah to the West and its Arab neighbors alike, which accuse it of sponsoring terrorism. The U.N. Security Council is expected to take up the charges next week and consider imposing sanctions. An Associated Press correspondent reports on the situation in Sudan, where theories, facts and rumors often blur together, like the landscape when the hot, choking dust blows from the desert.
<h3>SAFETY DERAILED: Government fails, and people suffer</h3>
WASHINGTON - For decades, the NTSB and other safety experts have repeated the same warnings: Fatal train accidents can be prevented by requiring special air brakes on the ends of trains and with automatic stopping systems. For just as long, the Federal Railroad Administration has taken the same position: No. An in-depth look at the issues in rail safety and how safety itself has been derailed.
<h3>AN APRIL FOOLS' DAY STORY: Hoaxing a talk show</h3>
CHICAGO - If you think no topic is taboo for TV's much-maligned talk shows, try this one: "Scam Artists Who Pose as Dysfunctional Guests." Of course, that wasn't the real title of an episode of "Jerry Springer" in which viewers were told a man was revealing to his wife that he'd been sleeping with their children's teen-age babysitter. The actual title was "Honey, Have I Got A Secret For You!" But the secret wasn't the one Springer and his producers had counted on. Turns out the philandering husband was really a Toronto comic, as were the rest of the "real people" who joined him on the show. The show's producers filed suit against the hoaxers, maintaining that their actions threatened the very integrity of shows like Springer's. But critics contend integrity is hardly these shows' strong suit, and they cite slimy and dishonest behavior by the producers.
<h3>WHITE ON BLACK: Opening minority schools to the majority</h3>
DURHAM, N.C. - Billy Jones insists he is just like every other freshman at North Carolina Central University. He goes to class, plays cards in the student union and tries to plot the rest of his life.
   But Jones is different. He's white.
   Brought into the university under a "minority presence" grant, Jones is part of a growing minority of white students on the historically and predominantly black NCCU campus.
<h3>GRIM DISCOVERY: Town shocked by drug tie in homecoming queen's slaying</h3>
WILLIAMSON, W.Va. - Michael Ann "Miki" Koontz was the darling of this small Appalachian coalfield town - homecoming queen, cheerleader, an above-average student whose bags were packed for college.
   But her many friends seemed unaware the 17-year-old was also a drug user. In reality, the teen was caught up in a drug ring whose leader believed she knew too much and allegedly ordered her killed just as federal agents were preparing to haul in the traffickers.

Myopic mainstream media overlook Forbes' racist adviser.

<PRE>   </PRE>

<font size=5>T</font size=5>homas Ellis, a lawyer from Raleigh, N.C. and a veteran of Sen. Jesse Helms' campaigns, was a member of the Steve Forbes Presidential PR marketing team. Also on the Forbes team, according to the <I>New York Times,</I> were former Helms advisers E. Carter Wrenn and John McLaughlin.
<P>
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with having worked for Jesse Helms. But one of these men is a worrisome character indeed. According to the <I>Times</I> (1-27-96), Tom Ellis had been selected by President Reagan to sit on the Board which oversees Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe. However, Mr. Ellis had to withdraw his name from nomination after it was revealed that he served for several years as director of the Pioneer Fund which financed research attempting to prove that blacks are genetically inferior to whites.
<P>
Only one other significant reference to Ellis appeared in the major print media and that came from a <I>Times</I> columnist Bob Herbert who is black. Needless to say Mr. Herbert was outraged about Forbes' tapping Ellis for a campaign adviser. But no one else has spoken up--then or since. 
<P>
Playing on Ronald Reagan's famous movie line, "Where's the rest of us?"
<P> 
All through the Republican primaries, I tried to interest the news media in pursuing this story but to no avail. (I'm white, by the way, in case your brain is turning). Not only was this a "missing story" involving a potential President of the United States, it remains a missing story. The irrepressible Scot, Mr. Forbes, got away Scot free without a peep of criticism from the major television news media for tolerating Mr. Ellis on his campaign team. 
<P>
Mr. Forbes association with Tom Ellis contradicts his alleged distaste for racism. The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> reported (2-2-96) that publisher Forbes ordered references cut out of his magazine asserting that blacks are inferior to whites in IQ. Nonetheless, despite his knowledge of Sen. Jesse Helms belief in such theories, Forbes had recently traveled to North Carolina to attend a Helms fund-raiser. Despite his knowledge of former Helmsman Ellis beliefs in such theories, Forbes selected Ellis to advise him on his premiere Presidential election team.  
<P>
Is Steve Forbes fastidious about racism only in print, while less critical when it comes to consulting with a racist pitbull to design a hard-hitting campaign to try to win the Presidency? 
<P>
The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> did not mention Ellis directorship of the racist Pioneer Fund. Instead, the <I>Journal</I> backed into Ellis racist views passively by quoting long-time Forbes friend Jude Wanniski who described Ellis as a good and wise man, a courtly Southern gentleman... Mr. Forbes is not going to ask Tom Ellis and Carter Wrenn,  What do you believe about the inferiority of the black race? Hes going to ask them, Can you produce the work that has to be done?  If they can, theyre all right with him. Mr. Forbes himself nimbly reversed field when he told the <I>Journal,</I> People who sign on to my agenda, and its very explicit, are welcome aboard.
<PRE>    </PRE>
<font size=5>M</font size=5>y own response to Forbes takes me back to the old movie Gentlemens Agreement which made the point that the only way to counteract bigotry is to be intolerant of intolerance, even among friends. In this era of white power skinheads and the murder of a black couple allegedly by white supremacist Army recruits in Fayetteville, NC, is Mr. Forbes tolerance of his advisers racist views the character quality we want in a President?
<P>
Steve Forbes reflects an amorality at the core of what is rapidly becoming the American corporate culture. He may have lost the race for this year's nomination, but he's persistent and he'll be back. His campaign--and his smooth deflection of profoundly serious moral questions--projected a dark image of Americas future as the corporate ethos of getting the job done turns a blind eye on bigotry and overtakes our traditional human value system. 
<P>
But wait a minute! How are we going to know what happened? Without widespread news about things like the Pioneer Fund and Forbes acquiescence to gentlemanly hatred in people like Tom Ellis, we wont even know what hit us, hurtling down the right track for America.
<P>
While the foremost business newspaper, the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, reported blithely on Forbes cynical pragmatism without batting an eye (we can bat our own eyes), at least <I>something</I> got reported, whereas most of the popular print and all the broadcast media didn't mention the disturbing Ellis-Pioneer Fund connection. On 2-7-96, ABC News <I>did</I> identify Ellis and Wrenn as having once worked for Jesse Helms and the phrase racist overtones was used to describe their highly successful political ads for Helms. But Ellis past at the Pioneer Fund was missing. So far as I know, among the majors and wire services, only the <I>Times</I> had mentioned that little fact as of early February 1996, just a week before the New Hampshire primary. 
<P>
Without the specific news about the Pioneer Fund--indisputable evidence of conscious and deliberate racism--we were left with only the vague aura of Ellis association with Jesse Helms, a cartoonish caricature of provincial bigotry, shrugged off as harmless by most people outside North Carolina. Those who dont shrug him off--who indict Forbes as racist merely by association with Helms--are indulging in same kind of prejudgment that underlies racism. 
<P>
<font size=5>F</font size=5>orbes acceptance of a racist does not mean that he is himself a racist. Its simply what makes racism persist and flourish. 
<P>
In this case, the popular news media left us to our own devices and made our democratic choices a matter of smudgy intuition based on incomplete information. 
<P>
95% of average Americans do not read the <I>Times</I> or the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>. What is the use of freedom of the press if that freedom is not used to document and distribute these insights into Forbes and his team beyond a few exclusive news outlets? Why are we enslaved to partial news, to processed news that trickles down through the newswire pipeline? 
<P>
We are flooded with breathless news about the GOP primary horse-race but told nothing about Steve Forbes choice of advisers that reflects, if not racism, perhaps something worse: a chilling Machiavellian amorality. 
<P>
Huh? All I heard about was the flat tax.

<PRE>    </PRE>

<font size=5>T</font size=5>here is something odd about Steve Forbes. He has a relentlessly cheery, dimpled smile. He never blinked as he rattled off his plan looking straight into the camera. Poor Ted Koppel was exasperated on Nightline when he tried in vain to get Mr. Forbes to wander off his programmed groove into reflections on anything outside of dollars, cents, and his solves-all-problems flat tax. If youre going to keep saying the same thing, over and over, said Koppel, you could issue a tape. 
<P>
Mr. Forbes appealed to some who believed his unpolished performance on TV made him seem more human. I didnt feel that way. Seem is the key word. A man who had adopted a seemimgly anti-racist editorial policy (for what reason we dont know, perhaps because advertisers want to appeal to the growing black consumer market) while he welcomed aboard a racist is not more human. He is less human. 
<P>
He is a charmingly awkward hypocrite.
<P>
He didn't make it to the nomination this time, but he gave it the good ol boy try. The Forbes campaign trio of Ellis, Wrenn and McLaughlin were <too</I> good at negative advertising--<I>too</I> good. They throw real punches," said Ken Duberstein, President Reagans chief of staff. "They play hardball. They play tough-guy conservative, no holds barred. They make Lee Atwater look like a softie. They are skilled right-wing practitioners and not much is out of bounds."  Theyve kept Sen. Helms in office for years.
But their tactics backfired when the public rejected the nasty tone of Forbes' campaign ads and tactics of "push polling." 
<P>
The fact that Forbes allowed such a crew to spend his money this way says a lot about the man. Why did the patrician Forbes pick such a shabby bunch to associate with? The selection of this trio had a subliminal effect. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, media analyst and dean of the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, told the <I>Times</I>, "It telegraphed ideology in ways you don't have to make explicit. Who you pick as an adviser is a signal, and in Forbes' case it was an interesting signal." 
<P>
A frightening signal, Id say, and even more frightening when the signal was not amplified as an educational alarm throughout the information system of our everyday news media so that average voters could know as much as <I>Times</I> and <I>Wall Street Journal</I> readers know about who theyre voting for.   
<P>
Steve Forbes may flash and wane but he'll leave a stain, even if we don't know it.	
<PRE>  </PRE>
<font size=5>I</font size=5>n the meantime, while Forbes benefitted by a napping media "watchdog" on Ellis, <BR>Pat Buchanan got hell for his campaign adviser Larry Pratt's embrace of anti-Semitic <BR>white supremacists like Pete Peters.
<P>
One might wonder a number of things about the difference in media treatment between Buchanan and Forbes, all of which may be spurious. But these thoughts come to mind:
<P>
Forbes has come on as a mainstream business guy, entirely within social/political norms, within which his tolerance of racism is folded neatly, as if into his inherent naivete about life in general, the over-protected son of a wealthy and eccentric scion, an unspoken denial held close to the boardroom chest, within the gated secrecy of a privately financed campaign. Whereas Pat Buchanan is an in-your-face visceral figure, a street fighter, a bully, an extreme reactionary whom many have referred to as a fascist for years, "so here's the proof in Pratt," quote unquote.	
<P>
In these two cases of press coverage of the moral terpitude of Forbes and Buchanan--not unequal except in style--the story of intolerance seems to work successfully through the news media where it is <I>consistent</I> ("I'm not surprised) with an established image, as in Buchanan-Pratt, and that image is further dramatized, even glorified, as when Buchanan defended Pratt during the New Hampshire debates--and he still won the New Hamphire primary. But where the truth appears <I>inconsistent</I> with the projected facade of a respectable family man and businessman from the moneyed class, where the facade of publisher of a respected business magazine might cover an insidious intolerance, the story is not making it through the media against the grain of the image. There is also the question of an unconscious denial that such a blase attitude of intolerance exists at the heart of our corporate culture upon which we as Americans so much depend.
<P>
It's a mystery.      
<PRE>   </PRE>
<I>Addendum for "The Real News Page":</I>
<P>
I leave you with two exchanges of letters which reveal at least part of the problem with keeping up with information about characters like Forbes. These letters show that the "mystery" may boil down to <I>undone research</I> and <I>unasked questions</I>. 
<PRE>    </PRE>

E-mail Letter Feb 28, 1996 from JWP
<P>
To Ms. Elizabeth Farnsworth, "NewsHour with Jim Lehrer"
<P>
In your segment tonight, Paul Wantanabe and Doris Kearns Goodwin both asserted the idea that voters might find Mr. Steve Forbes a refreshing electoral choice in part because, spending his own money on his campaign, he is unaffected by special interests and "this kind of money makes him unbought and unbossed."
<P>
However, it was pointed out earlier today (2-28-96) on National Public Radio ("Which Way L.A." with Warren Ulne) by the Center for Public Integrity in Washington, DC,  that Mr. Forbes is actually only <I>loaning</I> money to his campaign and he is <I>reimburing himself</I> by seeking and receiving contributions from special interest groups in banking and other corporate areas who would like to see him become President.
<P>
Therefore, in effect, Mr. Forbes may be just as beholden as anyone else to special interests--but secretly so because these "private contributions" do not have to be reported. 
<P>
I believe this fact was reported briefly elsewhere previous to today, as well.
<P>
I am disappointed to find that one of the nation's premier newscasts, with a least a rudimentary research staff, failed to bring up this fact about Mr. Forbes' campaign financing in response to the unanimously erronious impression of your two guests--in turn feeding the erronious impression that many voters already have about Mr. Forbes.
<P>
Additionally, in light of the revelations about Mr. Patrick J. Buchanan's co-chairmen, one of whom  (Larry Pratt) has been reported (by the Center for Public Integrity) to have repeatedly associated with anti-Semitic Christian Identity leaders and white supremacists and another co-chairman (Michael Ferris, <I>LA Times</I> 2-26-96) who attended a banquet celebrating the heroism of violent anti-abortion crusaders including Paul Hill, the murderer of a doctor who performed abortions, why is Mr. Steve Forbes not questioned about his campaign advisor Thomas Ellis who (according to the <I>NY Times</I>, 1-27-96) once directed the Pioneer Fund which funded research trying to prove blacks are genetically inferior to whites?
<P>
Mr. Forbes, be prepared, <I>has</I> been asked about Ellis on two isolated occasions that I know of, and he has answered these two ways:  
<P>
1) <I>Forgiveness method:</I>  "Every saint has a past and every devil has a future" (Dec 95 <I>Time,</I> re-quoted in a deep paragragh in 2-12-96 <I>Time</I>, amounting to a joke and never followed up).   <P>
2)<I> Reversing field method:</I>  "People who sign on to my agenda, and it's very specific, they're welcome aboard! "  (<I>Wall Street Journal,</I> 2-2-96).  
<P>
No one, so far as I know, has pressed Mr. Forbes beyond these glib responses. 
<P>
I am curious about the marked difference in news coverage between Mr. Forbes and Mr. Buchanan in regard to tolerance of intolerance. 
<P>
I would appreciate a written response to my comments if you have a moment.
<P>
Many thanks for your otherwise superb work on the Lehrer Newshour.

Handwritten letter from Elizabeth Farnsworth, Chief Correspondent, <BR> The Newshour with Jim Lehrer, 3-28-96: [<I>Note my e-mail took one month response. Letters are better.</I>]
<P>
Dear Ms. Prettyman,
<P>
Thank you for your e-mail which was forwarded to me.
<P>
I wish I <I>had</I> mentioned that Steve Forbes is trying to raise money to reimburse himself. <BR>It will be interesting to see how well he does.
<P>
I'm not sure why Forbes wasn't pushed harder about Thomas Ellis. I have not interviewed Forbes myself, but I would agree that he didn't get as many questions about Ellis as did Buchanan about Pratt and Ferris.
<P>
I appreciate your comments. Many thanks.
<P>
Yours,
<P>
Elizabeth Farnsworth

Letter from JWP to Center for Public Integrity, Washington, D.C., 2-29-96<BR>
<P>
I want to thank you for your research exposing Larry Pratt's associations. 
<P>
1) However, on the subject of Steve Forbes, I notice that your report made no mention of his campaign adviser Thomas Ellis who was reported by the <I>New York Times</I>, 1-27-96, to have headed the Pioneer Fund which financed research trying to prove blacks are genetically inferior to whites. This info has been reported elsewhere in the past, as well.
<P>
I am disturbed by this lacuna in your report because these facts were available long before your report went to press. Since then, Buchanan has received a lot of (well-deserved) negative coverage on Pratt while Forbes has floated through the primaries Scot free in terms of accounting for his tolerance of intolerance in his adviser Ellis. Why did your report not include the Forbes-Ellis connection as well as information about who Ellis is and what he was?
<P>
2)  I also want to thank the Center for Public Integrity for bringing out the information on Forbes reimbursing himself for his campaign expenses. Your spokesman mentioned this fact yesterday (2-28-96) on the radio program "Which Way L.A." with Warren Ulne. 
<P>
Otherwise, the popular news media, including Elizabeth Farnsworth yesterday on "the Newshour with Jim Lehrer," have failed to make the public aware of this fact. Mr. Forbes benefits greatly by the false impression that he is spending his own money on his campaign and is not "beholden" to contributors. In fact, he may be exceedingly beholden. Do you have any further information on this matter?
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Jane Wardlow Prettyman
<P>

E-mail letter from Center for Public Integrity, 3-8-96<BR>
<P>
Jane,
<P>
Sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you. I was on vacation.
<P>
We didn't include the Ellis connection to the Pioneer Fund in our report because (to be honest) the researcher who investigated Forbes missed that information. It was after Bob Herbert wrote a column about Ellis in the <I>Times</I> that we sent him an advanced copy of the Buchanan section of our report with the Larry Pratt stuff. [This is apparently how Pratt's associations with hate groups blew into public revelation--JP].
<P>
On the issue of Forbes financing his campaign, you are 100% right. He is only loaning this money to his campaign. Hypothetically, the money he raises can be repaid to him through the campaign. If you want to get more information about this, call Kent Cooper at the FEC (202) 2-9-4140.
<P>
Thanks,
<P>
Mishi Ebrahim,
CPI, Washington, D.C.

They illustrate exactly how he coalesced (folded together) a seemingly benign little college course called "Renewing American Civilization" with a major political manipulation that came to be called a "revolution":</font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<P> "To renew American civilization, we will replace the welfare state with the opportunity society."

<P>
"The Democrats are the party of the welfare
                           state."
<P>
(Elsewhere, outside GOPAC memos, he further defined Democrats as "the enemy of normal Americans.")
<P>
Let's review: From the above statements, what Mr. Gingrich is actually saying is: "To renew American civilization, the Republican party will replace the (enemy) Democratic Party." In other words, the college course "Renewing American Civilization has a partisan objective.

[Note: Political propaganda is not illegal. However, using tax-exempt funds to develop & disseminate political propaganda<BR><I>is</I> illegal. Mr. Gingrich's brilliance in designing a college course that could serve double-duty as political propaganda backfired because the college where he developed and presented his course was supported by tax-exempt funds.

Mr. Forbes stated that reading the entire report convinced him that Gingrich was cavalier in his approach to the ethics charges.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<font size=5>A</font size=5>fter two years of repeatedly denying ethical wrongdoing and calling charges "partisan" and "silly," on December 21, 1996 Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-GA) carefully admitted to improprieties outlined in a report issued by the House Ethics Committee 4-member investigative panel, with assistance from special prosecutor James Cole. In a plea bargain arranged with the Committee by Gingrich attorneys, the Speaker simultaneously released a nuanced admission to the panel's mild allegations as the allegations were being reported. 
<P>
The 4-member investigative subcommittee (called the "grand jury" in the media) is evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. 
<P>
As a result of the plea bargain, the Ethics Panel "pulled its punches" by not making any specific judgments of wrongdoing. Instead:
<P>  1) The Ethics Panel chided Mr. Gingrich for not seeking legal advice so as to avoid  having improperly used tax-exempt foundations to finance political activities, even though such improper activity was factually evident in documents before the Committee as a result of the investigation by Special Prosecutor Cole (see The Ethics Report and Dec 24 AP story below). They merely noted that Mr. Gingrich failed "to take appropriate steps to insure that the activities" were legal. 
<P>
In addition to alleged use of tax-exempt funds from a foundation at Kennesaw State College and from the Progress & Freedom Foundation to finance development, class presentations and distribution of an ideological college course to further a partisan agenda, in one of the more cynical allegations against Mr. Gingrich, in 1990 the Abraham Lincoln Opportunity Foundation, a tax-exempt entity dedicated to helping inner-city youth, began paying for television broadcasts described elsewhere by the overtly partisan group GOPAC as intended to bring voters into the Republican party. 
<P>
2) The Ethics Panel noted that Mr. Gingrich had submitted false information to the committee which he "should have known" was erroneous, but they did not charge him with willful deception. 
<P>
Mr. Gingrich quickly signed a "statement of alleged violation," agreeing with the Committee's relatively benign findings and admitting to ignorance of tax laws and lack of intent to deceive the Committee.
<P>
Notably, he regretted that he had "brought down on the people's House a controversy that could shake the faith people have in their government." A "controversy" is a difference of opinion, whereas he did not mention the word "dishonor." He disingenuously insisted (and his supporters have echoed) that there was "no personal financial gain," despite evidence in the Committee's possession (outlined in its <A HREF="ethics.htm">report</A>) that he had accrued political power at the people's cost.
<P>
One point of information about Mr. Gingrich's supposed ignorance of "arcane tax laws": According to Jonathan Kaufelt, a tax expert in Los Angeles who wrote a letter to the <I>New York Times</I> appearing on Dec 25, 1996, it takes attorneys and accountants to set up a 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt foundation and operate one. It is standard procedure for all principles (such as Mr. Gingrich) to be fully informed of the rules against partisan activities. "It is not plausible for Mr. Gingrich to say that he was not told the rules."
<P>
Indeed, on December 27, while GOP pressure mounted to rush the punishment deliberation to completion before the Jan 7, 1997 Speaker vote,<A HREF="ap12-27.htm"><BR>an AP story reporting on findings by the <I>Atlanta Journal Constitution</I></A> revealed that internal memos showed that Mr. Gingrich <I>did</I> have legal advice on tax-exempts, contrary to his statement to ethics panel.</A> Among other examples contradicting Gingrich professions of ignorance about the propriety of mixing tax-exempts with partisan activities, "Documents obtained from Kennesaw State College [supported in part by tax-exempt public funds] show that while Gingrich was organizing a course there called "Renewing American Cvilization," he continued to consult one of the attorneys who had advised him three years earlier against such projects." 
<P>
The <I>Journal-Constitution</I> reported that in a memorandum to a college dean, dated five months before the course began, Mr. Gingrich introduced Gordon Strauss as his "lawyer for all
finance, ethics and legal questions." The newspaper reported that the same lawyer had said in a 1990 letter to GOPAC that charitable and educational groups were barred under tax laws from engaging in political activity. Although Mr. Gingrich has disputed that his college course constituted "partisan political activity" (and in his apology still called it a "controversy"), the clearly partisan nature of the course was boasted by Mr. Gingrich himself in GOPAC documents in which he anticipated significant partisan recuitment of supporters, especially among college students, as part of his effort with GOPAC to achieve a Republican majority in the House elections in 1994 (Further to this theme, see <A HREF="ethics"> the full text of the Ethics Panel Report</A> and the <A HREF="http://wp1.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WAPO/19961224/V000270-122496-idx.html">Dec 24 AP story</A> below). Responding to this report about legal advice, Mr. Blankley stated that the Committee found that while Mr. Gingrich sought the advice of counsel, "he did not seek the advice of lawyers with the necessary expertise at the appropriate time." 
<P>
Since release of the Ethics Committee's <A HREF="ethics.htm">report</A> and Mr. Gingrich's contrite "mea culpa," a whirlwind of well-orchestrated media PR spin by GOP leaders (chiefly Mr. Armey, Mr. DeLay, Mr. Boehner, Mr. Shays and Mr. King) has swept through the major television Sunday talk show circuit and the phone lines of print reporters. 
<P>
AP on Dec. 27 quoted Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley as saying that he wasn't worried about the Ethics Committee's effect on the Speaker vote. "A statement by Dick Armey that he expected a unanimous vote is the best indicator of what the vote will probably be," Mr. Blankley said. However, some trepidation appeared to be developing among conscientious House Republicans such as Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina who said that his vote remains uncertain. Mr. Sanford pointed out that there can't be a double-standard between the Gingrich case and that of former Speaker Jim Wright, a Democrat. "In essence, he [Gingrich] made his career on an ethics charge," Mr. Sanford said. "He has to be held to the same standard. You can't have two standards--one for Wright and another for Newt." 
<P>
Shortly thereafter, one of the most loyal supporters of Newt Gingrich, Rep. Michael Forbes (R-NY) became the first Republican to break ranks and announce that he would not vote for the re-election of Gingrich as Speaker, saying that after reading the full <A HREF="ethics.htm">Ethics  Report</A> he had concluded that Mr. Gingrich was cavalier in his handling of ethics matters.
<P>
Meanwhile, major newspaper reporting of the comprehensive facts of Mr. Gingrich's many questionable actions and probable wrongdoing has failed to penetrate into local newspapers or popular broadcast outlets. The<A HREF=ethics.htn"> Ethics Report</A> has not yet been published in the popular media at the national or local level.
<P>
Average Americans in local communities are therefore lacking the information necessary to participate in their democracy by writing their House representatives in an informed manner regarding Mr. Gingrich's behavior, the Ethics Committee process, and their own recommendations on punishment and on the upcoming vote for a new Speaker on Jan 7, 1997.
<P>
That's why we put up this page and why we have provided the complete <A HREF="ethics.htm"> Ethics Report</A> here with the recommendation that you print it off to share with friends who are not on the Internet.
<P>
At this writing (12-28-96), the 10 members of the Ethics Committee  are about to meet in a (probable) public hearing to decide on a punishment for Mr. Gingrich. His supporters are desperately trying to pressure the Ethics Panel to complete this deliberation process before the January 7, 1997 House vote on the Speakership. They hope this matter can be put behind them with a simple "reprimand" (slap on the wrist in the form of a written admonition) for Mr. Gingrich.  If the Panel recommends a more serious "censure," party rules would prevent him from serving as Speaker. Censure may be unlikely, given the soft Ethics Panel conclusions which left up in the air any conclusion as to illegality and stopped short of actually accusing Gingrich of outright wrongdoing. But your letters could make them look deeper and go farther.
<P>
This "punishment" phase is important--and so is your study of the facts before the Committee, even if they did not conclude wrongdoing from these facts in their report. You can conclude for yourself what you think is appropriate. 
<P>
Fortunately, as of late Dec 27, the sentiment of many Republicans appears to support public rather than secret deliberations on the punishment phase.
<P>
When you write your letters, you might:
<P>
1) urge the 10-member Ethics Panel to take time for careful deliberation of all the evidence, even if the hearing goes beyond Jan 7, 1997, and
<P>
2) hold their hearing in PUBLIC, televised on C-SPAN, so that all American citizens can have access to the truth and make informed decisions as they participate by letter, e-mail or phone in the decision-making on punishment for Mr. Gingrich.
<P>

With all this in mind, we have gathered together the following information to assist you with getting up to speed on the story, such as is known--which is not to say absolute truth, but better than the cursory blurbs that are being run in most local newspapers:
<PRE>   </PRE>
These first four items are probably the best sources to acquaint yourself with the known facts fairly quickly:
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif">  1) <A HREF="ethics.htm"> Official Statement of Alleged Violation</A>, herein called "The Ethics Report," issued on December 21, 1996 by the Investigative Subcommittee of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in the Matter of Rep. Newt Gingrich. This is the full listing of facts and questionable actions to which Mr. Gingrich completely assented.
<P>
         
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> 2) Associated Press news analysis on Dec. 24, 1996,  <A HREF="http://wp1.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WAPO/19961224/V000270-122496-idx.html"> "Panel Avoids Gingrich Judgment,"</A> by Larry Margasak, the AP Congressional ethics correspondent, which contains the most comprehensive rundown of the facts outside the actual Ethics Report. As the title indicates, the Ethics Panel's "soft" treatment of Mr. Gingrich becomes quickly evident in this analysis. Interestingly, not much of this kind of detailed treatment of the story has trickled down into local newspapers with the exception of a few dribs and drabs.

If you have further suggestions for good informational resources on the Gingrich ethics matter, please <A HREF="mailto:openmind@rain.org">drop us a line</A>. Frankly, there is already almost too much here. Our aim is not to overwhelm but to provide quality information (in some cases full texts of original documents) upon which you can base a moral decision and form a moral opinion. After all, it's a matter of ethics. 
<P>
The fact that we must rely to such an extent upon news media accounts is somewhat disturbing, but we've tried to be discriminating in editing the selections. Giving credit where credit is due, we're lucky to have these particular pieces--and we're lucky to have the Internet to access them so easily, especially the <A HREF="ethics.htm"> Ethics Report.</A> It's a bit of a spin & propaganda war wherein, for us average citizens, clear information is our only weapon.
<P>
Hopefully you will find these materials helpful to inform your letters to House members--and to share with friends who may be trying to equate Mr. Gingrich's actions with Mr. Clinton's by indulging in the fallacy of "twinning." The Clinton matter may have its own merits but don't let distract you from the matter of Mr. Gingrich.
<P>
Time is of the essence. The House vote on the Speaker is Jan. 7, less than two weeks away. Educate yourself and write to Congress immediately to . . . <BR><H1><font color="#2F4F2F">let your voice be heard!</font color="#2F4F2F"></H1>

<font size=5>T</font size=5>hese first 4 items are probably the best sources to acquaint yourself with the known facts fairly quickly:
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif">  1) <A HREF="ethics.htm"> Official Statement of Alleged Violation, </A> issued on December 21, 1996 by the Investigative Subcommittee of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in the Matter of Rep. Newt Gingrich. This is the full layout of facts and questionable actions to which Mr. Gingrich completely assented in a signed and sworn statement released simultaneously in the plea bargain arrangement. The Panel concluded that Mr. Gingrich had violated only one House rule, to wit, he did not conduct himself creditably. It is for this House Rule violation that the Ethics Committee is now meeting to decide on a punishment to recommend to the full House of Representatives.
<P>
        
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> 2) Associated Press news analysis on Dec. 24, 1996,  <A HREF="http://wp1.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WAPO/19961224/V000270-122496-idx.html"> "Panel Avoids Gingrich Judgment,"</A> by Larry Margasak, the AP Congressional ethics correspondent, which contains the most comprehensive rundown of the facts outside the actual Ethics Report. As the title indicates, the Ethics Panel's "soft" treatment of Mr. Gingrich becomes quickly evident in this analysis. Interestingly, not much of this kind of detailed treatment of the story has trickled down into local newspapers with the exception of a few dribs and drabs. The full narrative as written in an even-handed manner by Mr. Margasak is shocking and compelling. This piece, more than any other, will make you get up and go to your pen and paper--or your computer or typewriter--to write a letter to the Ethics Committee and to your House representative, <I>like today</I>.

This revelation is startling because it appears to indicate that Mr. Gingrich dissembled with the Ethics Committee even as he and the Committee were negotiating his plea bargain agreement.

David Bonior as "Gingrich's leading critic," he is now called "the leading Gingrich antagonist" (not only here in the <I>Times</I> but also AP and across the board of printed media). Whereas "critic" connotes some degree of objectivity, "antagonist" implies an opponent or an enemy who harbors personal animosity, a loner on a personal vendetta. This coincides almost exactly in time with a major effort by GOP supporters of Mr. Gingrich to characterize Mr. Bonior's outrage as a "fixation" or an "obsession" in order to discount its merits.
<P> 
As for this particular story, "Panel Concludes Gingrich Violated Rules on Ethics," for a completely different (and better) handling of the same theme, see (as cited above)<A HREF="http://wp1.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WAPO/19961224/V000270-122496-idx.html"> "Panel Avoids Gingrich Judgment,"</A>  an AP news analysis by Congressional ethics correspondent Larry Margasak, Dec 24, 1996.

This revelation will be a tough one to overcome because, if true, it implies that Mr. Gingrich dissembled with the Ethics Committee even as he and the Committee were negotiating their plea bargain agreement.     
<P>
December 29, 1996, NYT: <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/washpol/1230gingrich.html">First Major Gingrich Supporter Announces He's Not Voting for Newt as Speaker.</A> Rep. Michael Forbes (R-NY) became the first Republican to break ranks and announce he would not support Newt Gingrich for re-election as Speaker. He said that Gingrich's explanations for admitted ethical lapses simply did not ring true. His mind was changed by reading the full 22-page Ethics Committee Report issued on 12-21-96 which is still not readily abailable to the public as of 12-29, except on the Internet. Mr. Forbes stated that reading the entire report convinced him that Gingrich was cavalier in his approach to the ethics charges. 
<P>Referring to a section of the law dealing with tax-exempt organizations, Forbes said: "Anybody who has even passing understanding of 501(c)(3), knows you are not to mix political advocacy with tax-exempt foundation activities. Gingrich has <I>created</I> tax-exempt foundations! Then he hires an attorney and for two years they go on the offensive and say there was no co-mingling, and now he says he didn't know the attorney had said that?" 

<P><IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> December 30, 1996, Washington Post: <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1996-12/30/060L-123096-idx.html"> "Ethics Resolution Unlikely Before Jan 7, Says Ranking Demo." </A> Rep. James McDermott (D-WA) said that he and five other committee members were "shielded from all information" while the four other members worked with Cole to develop facts on the complex financial transactions and determine that there was reasonable cause to believe Gingrich violated House rules. "At this point, none of the six of us is clear what really occurred. If there are to be public hearings before we set the speaker's punishment, we have to be prepared to ask intelligent questions." McDermott was unable to see how they could be prepared in time [before Jan 7 Speaker election] to deliberate on punishment for Mr. Gingrich. Also, technically the committee ceases to exist at noon Friday, Jan. 3," the last day of the 104th Congress and there remains the unresolved question as to whether current Ethics members will continue to serve in the next
Congress. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif">  December 31, 1996, NYT:  <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/washpol/1231gingrich-georgia.html">"Gingrich Georgia Supporters Feel Uneasy."</A> The Times reported: ... Somewhat surprisingly, given the prestige and the pork that come with a hometown speaker, some people interviewed said they would not have voted for Gingrich in November had they known that he had violated ethics rules. Just like Rep. Michael Forbes, the New York Republican who broke ranks on Sunday and announced that he would not support Gingrich for a second term as speaker, several voters said Gingrich should step down in order to preserve the integrity of the Republican congressional agenda. "I'm embarrassed to say I voted for him," said Wesley Arnold, manager of a used-car lot, who said he had consistently supported Gingrich in the past. "No one will ever have confidence in Newt Gingrich anymore." Richard DeSantis, a small-business owner, also said he would not have voted for Gingrich if the House ethics subcommittee had ruled before Election Day. "I think he needs to step down," DeSantis said. "What he did is wrong. When you drop your attorney, that's bad. But when your attorney drops you, something is wrong." Others Gingrich supporters played down the Speaker's ethics problems.  One said, "The charges are so minor. He didn't put the money in his pocket. If he had put the money in his pocket, then you're talking about a whole different thing." Many also said they respected Gingrich for admitting his offenses, which, they often added, seem to pale in comparison with the fund-raising questions engulfing the White House. 
The Times reported that although the ethics subcommittee's findings may have clarified questions of impropriety, many of Gingrich's constituents are still struggling to understand the facts. (See the <A HREF="ethics.htm">Ethics Committee Report</A> and print it off for friends who are not on the Internet so that they can "understand the facts.")
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> December 31, 1996, NYT:  In a <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/washpol/1231gingrich-forbes.html">NY Times article in the same issue</A> as above, Republican Rep. Michael Forbes is reported to be receiving accolades from most of his constituents on Long Island, NY, for announcing his decision not to vote for Mr. Gingrich for Speaker. "I think it was very brave," said Ms. Doyle, a Republican. "A lot of people in his district aren't that happy with Gingrich."

The best investigative reporting on the Progress and Freedom Foundation and its octopusian relationship with Gingrichian projects is <A Href=http://www.rollcall.com/newsscoops/gpstory1.html"> Glenn Simpson's excellent article in Roll Call</A>. 
<P>
NOTE:  On December 21, 1996, as part of a negotiated settlement ending the Ethics Committee's investigation of him, Gingrich agreed with the Ethics Panel's charge that he should have sought legal advice to ensure that a college course he taught <I>advancing his political agenda</I> was not improperly drawing on tax-exempt contributions, which cannot be used for political ends. The PFF mission statement declares: "The Foundation is a private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center organized under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code." 
If, as many observers conclude, Mr. Gingrich's course "Renewing American Civilization" is actually an integral part of a partisan plan to recruit Republican political candidates and supporters, as suggested by references in GOPAC documents and by the Ethics Panel report issued Dec 21, then this PFF Website is an Exhibit of evidence of frank violation of Federal tax laws which prohibit the use of tax-exempt funds for advancement  of a partisan agenda. It's still up and running as of 12-29-96, more than a week after the ethics report came out. Is it still running on PFF 's site because Mr. Gingrich only admitted to a "controversy" and to take it down might be interpreted by PFF (their attorneys) as an implied admission of wrongdoing all during the time the course has been running? A head-shaker. One of PFF's directors, by the way, is Arianna Huffington.

Editor's Note: Just in case network news skips coverage of the carefully scripted 4-day "programming"--including elaborate videos--designed by GOP convention planners, they will telecast their own GOP-TV show with their own "reporters" on The Family Channel and USA Network. This article doesn't mention it but the Demos could do something similar. The issues are at the heart of media-politics.

By JAMES BENNET
<P>
<Font size=5>S</font size=5>AN DIEGO, Calif. -- Planning even for the networks' commercial breaks, Republicans have scripted a four-day political television program, which they are calling a convention. Now the question is whether the networks will broadcast it for them. 
<P>
For at least two decades, the high points of political conventions have been foregone conclusions, plotted as much for television viewers as for the delegates. This year, though, the delegates themselves seem like afterthoughts, or perhaps props. 
<P>
The Republicans have joined communications technology to new
sophistication about network news, infomercials and entertainment to
plan a tightly disciplined, fast-paced television variety show. 
<P>
"Instead of putting on a news event they hope the networks will cover,
they have come to the point where they're putting on a TV program,
hoping they can get much of it past TV journalists, unfiltered," said Tom
Hannon, the political director for CNN. 
<P>
The paradox is that the Republicans have planned all this for the greater
glory of Bob Dole, who, more than any other major-party candidate in
recent memory, disdains the scripts and the set pieces of television
politics. 
<P>
From his skybox facing the podium, Paul J. Manafort, the political
consultant who has masterminded convention preparations for Dole, will
have direct telephone lines to the officials on the platform, to keep them
moving through their brief, tightly scheduled speeches. He will also have
direct lines to each state delegation. 
<P>
          "I want to move Governor Whitman from New Jersey over to California, so that CBS can do a picture," Manafort said by way of example, waving toward the floor while touring his box Wednesday afternoon. "I'll ring down, she'll get the message, we'll have somebody there to escort her." 
<P>
Referring to the customary challenge of whipping delegates into line,
Manafort added, "If there are any political issues, which there won't be in this convention, I'll also have the capacity to do that from here." 
<P>
Such thorough programming is risky. By planning so carefully and
transparently, the planners could prompt restless journalists to pounce on
any deviation from the program, like delegates' dissent over abortion. 
<P>
"They just need to keep in mind," said Hannon of CNN, "that we're
producing our coverage and they're not, and they're managing their
convention and we're not." 
<P>
But the planners are managing their convention for Hannon's audience. In
a reflection of how little emphasis has been placed on those actually
attending the convention, the cramped San Diego hall is, as one
Republican official put it, "the worst place in America to watch it." More
than 7,000 Republicans with convention passes are expected to sit in
rooms outside the hall and watch the proceedings on television. 
<P>
Even within the hall, print journalists, and many Republicans in
"hospitality" skyboxes, will be unable to see the podium, their view
blocked by pillars and other obstructions; they too will watch television
sets. 
<P>
From the platform itself, Haley Barbour, the Republican national
chairman, will be able to monitor coverage of the proceedings on a
five-inch RCA set mounted in his desk. 
<P>
The gray, muslin-covered podium is flanked by 15-foot-square "video
walls," which will offer carefully produced presentations of speakers and
scenes from across America. Convention planners want those screens to
function like Trojan television sets. They hope the networks will happily haul the video presentations into living rooms nationwide, so that millions of viewers will watch what the delegates watch. 
<P>
The networks say they have no intention of simply rebroadcasting what
Barbour has taken to calling "a festival of Republican ideas." 
<P> 
"We're not there to be an unmediated conduit for their promotions," said
Jeff Gralnick, vice president of ABC News and executive producer of
that network's convention coverage. 
<P>
But Manafort predicted that the networks would carry many video
presentations, because they are integral to the convention's messages.
"There's a moral responsibility to at least allow us to communicate with
the American people," he said. 
<P>
Network producers say they have a public-interest duty to convey the
kickoff of the presidential campaign to the public. They do so with
thorough coverage of both parties' conventions, "to help people to form
opinions in choosing their president," said Steve Jacobs, executive
producer of special events for CBS News. 
<P>
But Jacobs said it was "longstanding CBS policy not to carry the
infomercials, like the eight-minute biographies that parties make of their
candidates." He said he hoped to get advance copies of the Republicans'
videos, to evaluate each for news value. 
<P>
For example, Jacobs is eager to review a videotape about Ronald
Reagan, planned for showing Monday night. The public has seen so little
of Reagan recently, he said, that "it probably represents news" and is "not a political commercial." 
<P>
Having studied the rituals of network news, the Republicans have
included some video presentations that they expect the networks not to
carry. That filler material is intended to provide time for commercials and such. 
<P>
"We analyzed television coverage of the conventions over the last 20
years," Manafort said, "and there is a pattern as to when the anchors
would be on the air, when they would do cut-aways to commercials,
when they would go to correspondents on the convention floor. It
averages about 15 to 16 minutes" an hour. 
<P>
In between, Manafort has scheduled 45 minutes of hourly programming
he wants the networks to feature. While convention planners have long
worried about television angles and whether delegates' signs should look
homemade, conventions until now obeyed some pre-television rituals.
That meant long-winded speeches that pushed back the schedule until
notable speakers -- the nominee, say -- were addressing prime-time
viewers only in Guam. 
<P>
This time the Republicans have not only selected a roster of moderate
speakers, many of them women, but also limited almost all to less than
five minutes. Rather than present a laundry list of issues, each speaker is scheduled to address one subject, as part of an 8-to-12-minute "issues
segment" on crime, welfare, and so on. 
<P>
To insure that the message gets out, unfiltered, the Republicans are
covering their convention with their own cable production company. The
coverage will be shown on two cable networks: the Family Channel and
the USA Network. Those telecasts are being paid for by the San Diego
Convention and Visitors Bureau, partly with $1.3 million from Amway
Corp. 
<P>
But much of the fare is also likely to prove irresistible to the broadcast
networks, said Roderick P. Hart, professor of communications and
government at the University of Texas at Austin. 
<P>
"What would television want but good television?" Hart said. "It will be
attracted to the bauble."

<CENTER><font color="#0000FF"><I>Column by Jane Wardlow Prettyman</I></font color""#0000FF"></CENTER>
 
<PRE>   </PRE>

Edward R. Murrow, the celebrated newscaster of the 1940s and 50's, looked ahead at the future of television and saw its potential to be "the world's greatest classroom." He said, "This instrument can teach, it can illuminate, and yes, it can inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends." 
<P>
Mr. Murrow would be rolling in his grave today to see what actually came about.  If Murrow were here, he might make the following suggestions along the lines of what he meant:
<P>
The news and commentary media could broaden our minds by, for example, promoting a concept of fairness that genuinely reflects heart, compassion, and worldliness, rather than a form of fairness that becomes the butt of jokes about "political correctness." The media can model a more sophisticated understanding of give-and-take.  I don't mean "balance" plopped down 50-50 on the table.  I mean the willingness--the <I>insistance</I>--that we will agree, we just have to keep negotiating.
<P>
Instead of this, we have a counter-productive situation wherein the "wedging" and "splitting" tactics of cunning political partisans coincide too nicely with media sales techniques to fan flames.  Without enough time on TV or enough space in print to analyze issues and give them context, it's too easy to be saddled with demagogues these days.
<P>
The media have a Faustian struggle with "doing the right thing." They haven't had this struggle in earnest yet, not in public anyway, but there are signs of life: dozens of reporters and editors around the country are uncomfortable with the pressure for profits; some are beginning to question its impact on reporting.  They are beginning to ask: 'What are we doing?" 
<P>
"Let's encourage them," Murrow would say.  Kudos should go to Kathryn Van Sant, for example, a regular columnist for the Santa Barbara <I>News Press</I> who wrote a gutsy piece on the media March 9, 1995. She goes to work every day as a journalist, yet
she asked some tough questions of her brethren.
<P>
Edward R. Murrow would be too nice a guy to brag about it, so I'll remind you myself that in 1954 Murrow and CBS News director Fred Friendly faced down the famed demagogue Sen. Joe McCarthy who had, over a period of <I>years,</I> cost people's lives and livelihoods for the sake alone of paranoia.
<P>
Murrow might say it's worthwhile remembering, as we look into today's media-political stew, that "splitting" to create polarized enemies was a basic part of the fascist political style in the 1930's and '40's.
<P>
Murrow might also note, having observed it first-hand, that Hitler got away with the slaughter of millions because he convinced the German people that those who were different politically were "the enemy of normal Germans." Today's media certainly wouldn't promote such thinking consciously.  They just <I>quote</I> people who promote it, <BR> then grilling Mr. Gingrich on what he meant by "normal" and never questioning what he meant by "enemy."
<P>
Murrow would certainly suggest that the media could do a better job at encouraging basic values we all can agree on.  For example, the media could promote a better appreciation of the capacity to change one's mind and for compromise.  It's now thought "weak" to compromise or change position.  Changing policy is looked upon not as flexible strength but as "waffling." As an educator, I think these are not mega-ideas that are healthy for the mind.  It's perfectly absurd to think we can deal with our worldly problems while not being skilled in cooperating or fine-tuning direction on new information.
<P>
For better or worse, the media in so many ways guide our instinctive thinking about life and public affairs.  This in turn shapes all of our thinking in everything we do.  In part, not all.  Our thinking is shaped directly and interpersonally, too.  Perhaps there needs to be more of this, more get-togethers, "salons" and discussion groups that do not rely on media.
<P>
Edward R. Murrow had a voice that sounded like he was talking to the future. This I think was because he spoke for basic values we all can agree on and because he showed how active we must be to keep them alive.
<P>
Prophetically, Murrow always ended his newscasts by saying "Good night and good luck."

So what we've got now, this far down the road, is the entire national press and a good bit of the Republican Party--metaphorically speaking--setting off on a canoe trip down a river.  We've gone through two Whitewater shoals, and somebody has finally figured out that we forgot the food and we don't have any damn tents.  Now we've got two possibilities.  We can either drag the canoes back upstream and start all over again, or we can leave the canoes by the side of the river and hike out to civilization.  It seems to me what the majority of the press has decided to do instead is to try to protect themselves, protect their credibility, keep the story going--grab a burlap sack and a club, and go out in the woods to hunt snipe.

TRUDY LIEBERMAN,<BR>
Columbia Journalism Review<BR>
<P>
When I first came to the Whitewater story, I had no involvement in any of the Whitewater issues other than as a casual reader and television watcher.  The one thing that struck me, even as a casual observer, was that there seemed to be a lot of media attention centering on what appeared to be the personal venality of President Clinton.  What I was very curious about, in my casual reader stage, was why was so much attention being given to this at the exclusion of some other issues that I felt warranted more attention.
<P>
At that time I was asked by the <I>Columbia Journalism Review</I> to look into what was behind the Whitewater coverage [see reference above to her article May-June 1994].   I began doing a Nexus search, that is, a search through the on-line archives of all published news stories.  The Nexus search was extremely revealing.  The themes that were appearing in the stories about Whitewater were all curiously the same.  There was a certain sameness to all of the allegations, a certain sameness to the reporting, a certain sameness to the conclusions that would lead one to believe that something was going on here, something was behind all of this sameness that was appearing in Whitewater news stories.  There were a number of charges made, accusations, innuendoes, and suspicions about what the Clinton did and didn't do that were simply plopped down on the pages of these stories without any context, evaluation, analysis, and often with only the most rudimentary explanation of what was really involved in any of the Whitewater tangles.  Various tidbits were thrown down as conclusions as though to prove whatever point the writer wanted to make.  
<P>
Usually the story ended with a "question raised" which was never quite answered.
<P>
I think one good example of this was Hillary Clinton's letter seeking power of attorney to clean up the Whitewater affair in 1988.  The letter was used widely by many in the news media to prove that, contrary to the Clintons' assertions, they had been actively involved in the Whitewater Development.  The thing that I found very strange about this was the possibility that perhaps her seeking power of attorney had something to do with the fact that she was actually interested in <I>cleaning up</I> the mess, since McDougal at that point was ill and incapable of handling the affairs of the project.  Neither this or any other explanations for why she may have been seeking power of attorney ever got into the news columns, and so a sinister implication of cause and effect was simply made and allowed to stand without any other possible explanations given.
<P>
The inference, of course, in all this that the public could draw was that the Clintons were lying.  That's what one might reasonably assume, not from <I>what</I> was reported but the <I>way,</I> it was reported.
<PRE>	 </PRE>
MY INVESTIGATION led me to explore the link between the Whitewater news coverage and the involvement of Floyd Brown's "Citizens United." I had visited Citizens United, and one of their personnel David Bossie had tried to interest me in writing a story about "Lot Seven" in Arkansas which was a complicated real-estate transaction in which a real-estate developer had apparently made a lot of money and the Clintons were supposed to have been nefariously involved.  What was interesting to me is that the Nexus search turned up an <I>LA Times</I> story written several weeks earlier.  This story had gone into great detail about Lot Seven. 
<P>
The thing that was striking to me was that the vocabulary used in the <I>LA Times</I> piece was very much the same vocabulary that was used by Floyd Brown's Citizens United in trying to interest me in the story---the same words, the same themes, the same types of conclusions, the same suggestive language implying a shady deal.  
<P>
If the <I>LA Times </I> had gotten the story from Citizens United, they didn't tell their readers that.  Instead the story referred to their sources by citing "fundamental allegations by critics" whom they didn't name.  The <I>LA Times</I> story mentioned "Developer Chris Wade's apparent windfall which was raising eyebrows among those examining the Whitewater matter." This same phrasing had been used by Citizens United during my visit in their offices.  At that point I began to become suspicious about who these "critics" were, whose eyebrows were indeed being raised, and how the Clintons were benefiting from all of this.
<P>
Those kinds of phrases peppered much of the Whitewater coverage that I examined.  The charges, the factoids, the conclusions that had been plopped into these stories were often framed in terms of "charges made," "critics observed," "scandalous odors," "ethically suspect sweetheart deals," "questions raised," questions persist," instead of the political agenda being actually laid out for readers.  
<P>
The implication drawn from all of this, I think, was to imply that the Clintons were involved in some kind of criminal behavior and moral lapses----at least this was the conclusion that many casual observers or readers could draw from these stories.
<P>
I'd like to talk a little bit about using Floyd Brown as a source--and using anybody as a source---because that's something we journalists all deal with, it's our stock in trade, and sources invariably have agendas on a spectrum of the sincere or the sinister.  Obviously journalists are free to use any kind of source they want, however unsavory or virtuous they may seem to be.  Certainly there is nothing wrong with looking at any documents or studies or other information a source provides.  I think what is wrong is <I>not identifying the source</I> of these documents or, even more important, not identifying--especially in a story about a political figure--the political motivation, agenda and character of the source.  
<P>
Frankly, what was going on here, I think, is that much of the time the source of the Whitewater data was not disclosed and certainly the political agenda of the people giving this information was not disclosed either.  There's nothing wrong with any of us taking information even from a convicted perjurer.  But I think the reader might want to know that the information supplied in a particular story or television piece was supplied by a convicted perjurer.  The reader or listener can then make up his or her mind.
<P>
One thing might be helpful in judging the credibility of the source in this Whitewater matter and that is:  how much does the source have to gain or lose by the information being provided?  I sometimes draw the distinction between a source of the Floyd Brown variety and, say, a whistleblower in the government or a corporation.  In the case of the whistle-blower, he or she has everything to <I>lose</I> by going public with a particular allegation of illegality or wrongdoing.  In the case of Citizens United, they had everything to <I>gain</I> because their agenda and motivations were being spread throughout the press and I think that is probably what they wanted.  
<P>
The aim of Floyd Brown, David Bossie and Citizens United apparently was to discredit the President of the United States by attacking his character and somehow implying his guilt in various parts of the Whitewater affair--and to a large extent I think the press helped spread that message.
<P>
Toward the end of the height of the Whitewater frenzy, along about mid-March 1994, some of the press did begin to identify Brown as the source of the information.  The <I>Wall Street Journal </I>and the <I>Chicago Tribune,</I> for example, and later the<I> New York Times, </I>ran stories that drew a connection between Brown and some of the information that was being fed to the press.  In addition, some of the news magazines were briefly mentioning Brown's name in connection with the Whitewater affair.  But by that time, Brown's message had already been widely and deeply spread in popular consciousness through the news media, and whatever damage Brown wanted to do had been done---perhaps unalterably---in the public's mind.
<P>
I'm not a great fan of President Clinton.  But I have approached my study of Whitewater as a journalistic professional and from this point of view, I can't help thinking that the Whitewater coverage has had considerable bearing on how the public views Clinton right now.  The polls tell us almost daily that citizens have doubts about him, they don't trust him, and his general standing has decreased.  One can only wonder how much Whitewater has contributed to this deterioration of the President's image with the electorate, even among those who voted for him.
<P>
LEWIS LAPHAM:  For the benefit of those who might not know, Trudy, who is Floyd Brown and what sort of organization is Citizens United?
<P>
TRUDY LIEBERMAN:  Floyd Brown is the head of Citizens United which is a right-wing grassroots political organization that lobbies on behalf of conservative causes and gets their money through fundraising from conservative interests.  You might remember the Willie Horton ad that was run during the 1988 Presidential campaign, the one that actually used the face of Willie Horton on-screen.  That was produced by Floyd Brown's group.

TOM HAMBURGER,<BR>
Minneapolis Star-Tribune</I><BR>
<P>
What strikes me in Mr. Lyons' critique of the <I>Times</I> Whitewater coverage is more than what it says about specifically the New York Times or even about Whitewater, but what it says about the norms of journalism, about what we do as Washington reporters every day, particularly in an election year.  As I re-read Gene's piece in <I>Harper's,</I> I was struck by how many similarities there are in the practices we bring to covering the health insurance reform effort or examining public issues in general.  I think it's time that we question our instinctive reactions in the way we go after stories.
<P>
The Times-Mirror Center reported that more than 70% of the American public rates journalists at a lower level than they do members of Congress. 70% of those surveyed reported that they felt journalism is getting in the way of helping the nation understand and solve its problems.  Only 21 % felt we were a constructive force.
<P>
So, what are the norms of journalism that led to the "scandal approach" of our coverage of Whitewater and Hillary Clinton's commodities investments?  While we would agree that reporting on those deals was important, what drove the "scandal approach" in a direction that produced some inaccurate reporting, such as we saw in the <I>Times</I>?  What gave these stories "legs"?
<P>
These norms--these bad habits of modern journalism are as old as the Broadway play "The Front Page":  The first rule is "Don't get scooped, get there first." And the second rule is "If you are scooped, dont get left behind by the pack." Eugene McCarthy once likened reporters to blackbirds on a telephone wire:  "One lands, they all land," he said.  "When one takes off, they all take off."

<P>
The third norm is the focus on conflict.  Conflict is considered to be news, and conflict takes priority over substance.  You're seeing a lot of reporting on conflict in these mid-term election campaigns of 1994, more than ever.  The dogfight is featured more than what candidates actually stand for.  There's a feeling you're watching a sport rather than a careful review of what candidates actually believe.  
<P>
The phrasing in stories is very much about "he's up, she's down, he's delivered a blow, she's coming from behind." The "race" is literally dominating campaign coverage almost completely, the "horserace.   Its exciting, more exciting, we reporters think, than the dull review of a debate on the issues.  "Get something new is another norm that gets in the way of reporting substance.
<P>
So how did these norms apply to Whitewater?  In an election year, when we cover public officials, the special norm of "Don't get scooped" strongly applies.  To get something new, you look for problems that a political candidate may have had in his or her past.  Journalists have to display some extraordinary pyrotechnics to use the term "scandal"--or even the more favored phrase "<I>hint</I> of scandal"--to get the thing on the front page.  You can't just say "Bill Clinton had a questionable land deal," period.  You have to show, for example, that the candidate used his or her public office for personal gain, that there was a misuse of the public trust.  This is what Gene Lyons calls the "smoking quid pro quo."
<P>
We saw an example of this in the so-called "Troopergate scandal"--even the attached "-gate" suffix in itself propels the story forward,  it's really redundant with the word "scandal"--when the <I>LA Times</I> published the allegations of the state troopers in Arkansas regarding Clinton's alleged romantic liaisons.  Until that point, until the <I>LA Times</I> story appeared, the mainstream press had been reluctant to touch that story.  
<P>
What allowed the <I>LA Times</I> to get the trooper story out front
--to sneak it past customs, as it were--was that the troopers had reported that they had conversations with Clinton about getting a job; in other words, by sheer <I>juxtaposition</I> of the troopers' statement, with no analysis as to how the interplay actually worked or whether the statement was true.  Presented this way, Clinton appeared to have abused his public office.  Trudy used the word "plop." The appearance was simply plopped down under the pretense that readers would "make up their own minds." This involved the cynical presumption that readers would conclude the worst.  The troopers were presented as neutral figures without mention of their motivations.  It was written in such a way that there were no innocent alternatives to consider.
<P>
If we go back to the very first Whitewater story that appeared in the <I>Times</I> during the campaign in March 1992, we can see an example of this election year norm taking place.  The lead of the March 8, 1992 story that Jeff Gerth wrote was: Bill Clinton and his wife were business partners with the owner of a failing savings and loan that was subject to state regulation early in his tenure as Governor of Arkansas."  That lead--and the story and stories that followed--suggested that there may have been some abuse of Clinton's powers of governance to benefit this S&L and to benefit Clinton's personal financial interests and those of his friends.  
<P>
That lead propelled the story onto the <I>Times </I>front page.  I read it and admired the story, and my paper carried it as part of the <I>Times </I>wire service which channels its stories to local papers all over the country.  It was admirable because it was the <I>New York Times </I>which is thought of as a paper that adheres to fairly high journalistic standards--conservative, as it were, journalistically--while also somewhat liberal in its political soul, both of which meant that if the <I>Times</I> was saying these things about Clinton, there must be some serious truth to them.
<P>
The problem with that lead, as Mr. Lyons has detailed, was that when Bill and Hillary Clinton made their investment in Whitewater in 1978, Jim McDougal wasn't involved in the S&L business, nor was Bill Clinton governor.  The suggestion--made by a misleading juxtaposition of phrases in that lead that the governor had somehow used the state regulatory powers of the state of Arkansas to benefit this S&L--was a critical part of propelling the story onto the <I>New York Times</I> front page and throughout the news media nationwide.  
<P>
The story was propelled through the entire media system, both print and electronic, not only by the suggestion of quid pro quo or misuse of office but also by the preeminent reputation of the <I> New York Times.</I>  That story even affected--perhaps even brought about--the Congressional hearing process.  Rep. Jim Leach, when he raised this issue in Congress, talked again and again about "the regulatory powers of the state of Arkansas."
<P>
A close examination, however, of the regulatory history of this S&L provides no evidence to suggest that the S&L received benefits by Arkansas regulators.  It is a myth to suggest that it received favorable treatment.  In fact, the S&L received very tough treatment.  We know this because we at the <I>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</I> did our own legwork, something apparently few other papers did.  We assigned one of our reporters to examine the records of Madison Guaranty in the Arkansas Securities Department.  What we found was evidence that the institution had been regulated appropriately, and that Beverly Bassett Schaffer, who had been appointed by Clinton, had in fact showed regulatory diligence in looking at the S&L. [Schaffer was finally able to tell her story for the first time four years later in early 1996 at the Senate Whitewater Hearings--where she was denigrated ruthlessly by Sen. Alfonse DAmato.]
<P>
Then we called the Federal regulator who was primarily responsible for regulation of this particular S&L.  We were told that the facts in the Arkansas records which we found and Bassett Schaffers account of her regulation of this S&L were, in fact, accurate.  Yet at that time, no one as of March 94 had contacted this particular regulator Walter Falk.  The <I>New York Times </I>had gone ahead with its story without ever checking whether or not the regulation of the S&L was appropriate--or inappropriate, as their story insinuated.
<P>
The consequences for the image of President Clinton and his wife have been enormous, perhaps incalculable.  But as we examine the coverage of Whitewater, it may cause us to examine the norms we bring to political coverage and coverage of public officials generally.

JOHN CAMP,<BR>
Chief Investigative Reporter, CNN<BR>
<P>
Certainly the Whitewater story is a broad umbrella that seems to encompass all manner of sub-stories that bear upon Bill Clinton in general.  In the continuing saga, this past week in Washington we had an example of what I consider "high satire." 
<P>
As you know, the <I>Washington Times</I> [politically conservative newspaper owned by Sun Yung Moon] ran a front-page story  Trooper Recalls Clinton Seeking Loan Help." It's about an Arkansas trooper named L. D. Brown. The day after this ran, the <I>Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</I>--sorry Gene, we'll assume your column is a bright spot at that paper--ran a story "Arkansas Trooper Says He Saw Clinton Pressure Judge for Money." Side by side on the same page was a story Trooper Denies Story on SBA Loan." At the same time, the <I>Washington Post</I>--a paper whose reputation is revered nearly as much as the <I>New York Times</I>--was running its own story "Arkansas Trooper Offers Partial Support to Allegation of Whitewater Loan," quoting the <I>Washington Times</I> story.  Then, lo and behold, a couple of days later, we have the <I>Washington Post</I> running a retraction of its story that quoted the <I>Washington Times.</I>

<P>

You begin to wonder what's happening when you see all these birds landing on the wire and taking off again.  Certainly the <I>Washington Times, </I>especially in its coverage of Whitewater, has not been known
as a beacon of high-quality journalism. Yet here you have a very revealing and embarrassing situation of the <I>Washington Post</I>--in its fear of being scooped---coming in with its own story quoting the questionable sourcing of the <I>Washington Times,</I> only to have to retract it almost immediately.  That retraction, ladies and gentleman, was not on the front page but buried in its usual small print, unread by most readers as corrections and retractions are usually unread, unfortunately for the public record.
<P>
I was a johnny-come-lately to Whitewater coverage.  I was not a volunteer to go to Little Rock.  I was drafted into it in March 1994 because I happen to be senior investigative reporter on the special assignment staff at CNN.  I went to Little Rock with the notion that all the Whitewater bases had been covered by the national media, the <I>New York Times </I>foremost among them--and who would second-guess the <I>Times</I>?  
<P>
My producer/assistant Mart Sahl had been in Little Rock in advance of me and he had assembled two file boxes full of various and sundry documents from the Arkansas Securities Department and the Federal Home Loan Bank.  I spent a good part of three days doing nothing but reviewing all the documentary information that was available about the rise and fall of Madison Guaranty.  I emerged after those three days with a huge dilemma.  Was I going to believe the <I>New York Times</I> or believe my own eyes?  My choice had to be the latter because the documentary evidence did not support the premises of the stories in the <I>Times.</I>
<P>
I looked up Beverly Bassett Schaffer who had been Arkansas State Securities commissioner.  This was a person whom I came to believe, after reviewing the facts, had been ravaged by the <I>New York Times</I> in the course of this affair, not only in the March 1992 <I>Times</I> piece, but unconscionably in the December 1993 <I>Times</I> covering Vince Foster's death.  In a self-righteous <I>Times</I> editorial that followed the Foster story, an almost direct accusation was made that Schaffer had kept Madison Guaranty open long after it was insolvent as a payoff for McDougal's raising funds to retire debt for Bill Clinton.
<P>
Schaffer had been so burned by the national media that she had no intention of being interviewed on television because she felt the news media had latched on to a story they wanted to tell that had nothing whatever to do with the truth, and they were going to tell it no matter what she might say to set the record straight.
<P>
When I promised that we would try to bring some context to the story, Schaffer ultimately agreed to an interview and I spent ten hours with her.  Gene's article in <I>Harpers </I>which I believe is a very comprehensive and well-done analysis, leaves out what I consider to be one of the most important pieces of evidence in the entire coverage of Whitewater from day one.  
<P>
This was a 20- page memo Schaffer wrote to Jeff Gerth, delivered some 7 to 10 days before the <I>Times</I> printed the December 1993 story.  If you compared that memo with the body of the story, you would discover there was nothing quoted out of her memo. [<I>Editor's note:</I>  Jeff Gerth told me his quotes from Schaffer's memo "were cut for space by editors upstairs" and "offered nothing new."--JWP]  
<P>
Had that memo been quoted and context given to the whole affair, I venture to say that it probably would not have made the front page of the  <I>New York Times</I> or even the national political page of the <I>Times</I> because it basically undercut the entire quid pro quo and the "something to hide" premise of the story which, as Mr. Lyons and Mr. Hamburger have I think astutely suggested, are what drove this story to the front page and throughout every news wire in the world.  Had Schaffer's memo been considered and reported on fairly by the <I>Times,</I> then the discovery of Whitewater documents in Vince Fosters office following his suicide would certainly have had no great meaning since those documents had been sent there by Jim McDougal's attorney for the purpose of cleaning up the company and closing down in the course of establishing a blind trust for the Clintons after Bill Clinton became President.

BEHIND all these dark suggestions in the "Whitewater scandal" are perfectly reasonable explanations that were never reported.  Nowhere was the innocent context framed around events.  The White House was put entirely on the defensive, sputtering,  "...But, wait a minute ... but... but... hey, <I>wait</I> a minute! ...." trying to explain the facts, trying to put the facts in context.  Their attempts to do so were in themselves painted by the press as evidence of guilt.  This is exactly the same impossible situation that Senator Joseph McCarthy put thousands of Americans into during his inquisition in the 1950's.  If we had a Rush Limbaugh in those days, the Republic might not have survived, although we did have Walter Winchell who was almost as flagrant.  You really have to have a sense of history to understand how dangerous this pattern is.
<P>
The original <I>Times</I> story and their stories that followed have influenced everything else that's come along.  The <I>Times</I> stories are the lenses through which Clinton's entire governorship is viewed, which is unfortunate because the more we look at what Clinton actually <I>did</I> in Arkansas and see how he actually conducted himself as governor, we see a man who did a remarkably decent job.  Sure it's important we look hard at what could <I>appear</I> to be abuse of office, but when it's not there, it's not there--and <I>that</I> should be reported just as dramatically, after raising so much insinuating dust.  Set the record straight.  
<P>
It's important to report the positive story that is there in Clinton's case.  That story is completely lost in the news media's Whitewater shuffle.  It's really a loss to the nation because what we have now is a tainted view of our President.  The Presidency itself is diminished when it otherwise might be looked up to for the professional and political character of its occupant, no matter what one thinks of his personal character or his policies.  Watergate--the Nixon scandal that wounded the nation's heart so much and caused what I think has been a hyper-reflexive cynical response by the press to every move any President makes--the wound of Watergate can only be healed by recovering the trust we used to have when that trust appears to be warranted.  
<P>
We can be vigilant, too.  We can dig all we want.  We can investigate all we want.  But if nothing's there, we shouldn't automatically assume that something sinister is going on just because we haven't "exposed" it.  The press is encouraging cynical paranoia--and I think it's the object of popular anger about the news media today, although many people might at this point just blame <I>Clinton</I> for everything---because the media has convinced them that <I>hes</I> the bad guy.  It's much easier to lash back at an individual figure than an abstract amorphous entity called "the news media." It's really gotten out of hand.
<P>

Certainly I have questions about the <I>New York Times</I> coverage of this throughout.  But it's not only the <I>New York Times.</I>  Many of the news organizations that have utilized full-time investigative reporters to go look at this have accepted as gospel much of what was reported not only in the <I>Times</I> but in other major newspapers. The <I>LA Times</I> comes to mind.  One particular story ran in the <I>LA Times</I> later in the same month the first <I>New York Times</I> story appeared in March 1992.  This <I>LA Times</I> story had a lead that said that Clinton had been lobbied favorably on a bond issue for the state of Arkansas by an individual who had been convicted of drug possession and drug-use.  This individual was an investment banker named Dan Lassiter who supposedly ultimately earned $750,000 on the bond issue.  
<P>
Number one, Clinton was not lobbied by Dan Lassiter on the bond issue, he was lobbied on behalf of getting a communications system for the state police.  Dan Lassiter was not the lead underwriter of the bond issue and in fact earned $115,000, not $750,000, as one of three underwriter of the bonds.  As Gene Lyons would say, "Details, details.... "  This story escalated wildly.  As the story evolved, rather than a drug user, Lassiter was turned into a <I>drug-dealer.</I>  Next we see, we have a drug-dealer who made a million dollars off of bond issues from the state of Arkansas--with Bill Clinton impugned as somehow intimately involved, when in fact he wasn't involved in that situation at all.  
<P>
The LA Times finally printed a correction to clarify the story but, as I said, nobody reads corrections, and worse, the nature of these Arkansas deals is so complex that readers' eyes glaze over while the odor of scandal still hangs in the air.  The damage done with these stories is very difficult to undo.
<P>
My greatest concern and criticism is why don't some of these major newspapers do some of their own investigative reporting, rather than accept the information of the <I>New York Times,</I> the <I>Los Angeles Times,</I> or the <I>Washington Post</I>. It's important that we go out and do our own research rather than rely on research of other news organizations no matter how reputable.  I have a great deal of respect for the <I>New York Times</I> and these other newspapers, but they're as fallible as any of us. We've all got to do better.

<P>
There's sloppy journalism and maybe even deliberate falsification that appears every day in major papers, even in the <I>Post.</I>  Usually it's not actually the <I>Post</I> doing the falsifying, but we <I>quote</I> people who make false statements or provide misleading information.  Some of it results from not going back and checking basic sources, evaluating their political motives, as Trudy says, letting readers know something about the background of biased sources.....
<P>
We often see the news media allowing  public figures, like Ollie North, for example, to say something like he was never convicted of lying to Congress, and we go ahead and quote him.  The reporters are either too young to remember the facts of history while standing there on their feet, or they don't go back to check the historical facts to ascertain that North was not telling the truth.  Meanwhile North's quote runs unchallenged.  That kind of sloppiness seems to be allowed by supervising editors and it adds to the atmosphere we're talking about here.
<P>
(<I>Editor's Note:</I> In a classic example of this, the <I>LA Times</I> ran an alarmist quote by Ross Perot just before the Senate vote on NAFTA in which, contrary to the INS, Mr. Perot asserted that NAFTA would eliminate all visa requirements for Mexicans and their families who could, according to Ross, under NAFTA now freely cross the border into the US.  "Fasten your safety belts," he warned us, theyll be coming over in the hundreds of thousands and they can stay in the US for unlimited periods of time!  This was a hot-button in California, Perot pushed the button--and Southern Californias premier newspaper put the button in the paper.  No counter-view accompanied Perot's assertion.  Finally, two days later, the day of the NAFTA vote, buried in a long article, the INS was quoted as saying that Perot's statement was blatantly groundless.  When I wrote to the <I>LA Times</I> to ask why the newspaper had run Perot's misinformation without fact-checking it first, I got a letter back from Assistant National Editor Steve Bell who gave the following explanation: "The story was written by a non-Washington reporter who was not as familiar with the issues as those on our staff who generally covered the trade agreement debate.  It was written on a Sunday when the editors who are most familiar with Sunday issues were not on duty.---JWP)

<P>
Yeah, historical amnesia. You're right. Its rampant. It would have taken only one phone call to demolish Jeff Gerth's first <I>Times</I> story.  It would have been a phone call to the Resolution Trust Corporation and you would have asked one question: How many thrifts were closed down in 1894. Anybody know the answer to that?  The answer is nine.  How many in 1985?  Nine again.  In 1986, ten.  It wasn't until much later that you had thrifts falling right and left, but in 1984, it was kind of hard to argue that there was special treatment for this one thrift.
<P>
Years later, looking back through Gerths view of history, you were left with the impression that <I>everything</I> was being shut down all around and this <I>one</I> thrift was left standing there because of preferential treatment.
<P>
Why didn't anybody make that phone call to the RTC?  The quid pro quo insinuation worked partially because we had historical amnesia and no help from Gerth to remind us of the historic perspective of the era.

Where did that "$9 million loan" come from"  That's a follow-tip question I wish I'd asked.  I regret I didn't use my head, not just on history but on common sense.  I should have known right off that couldn't be true because there's no law in Arkansas that would have permitted the state government to loan that kind of money to a Fortune 500 company.  So right off the bat it had to be wrong.
<P>
My colleague Ernie Dumas, now a columnist for the <I>Times,</I> asked around to the state agencies and asked all of them "Did the <I>Times</I> con-check you on this $9 million loan?" "No, huh-uh." Couldn't find <I>anybody</I> that the <I>Times</I> talked to about this.
<P>
Where did this damned "$9 million" quote come from on the front page of the <I>New York Times</I>? That's something I'd like to know.  That idea had to be from a source outside of the public agencies.
<P>
Who was that source?


<PRE>    </PRE>
<I>Audience question to Gene Lyons:</I>
<P>
Much of the rationale of the news media for going after the Clintons so hard on Whitewater--the reason we hear over and over again--is because the Clintons didn't hand over the documents right away.  Why do you think they were so reluctant to hand over those documents?
<P>
<I>Gene Lyons:</I><BR>
<P>
Well, that's a good question, and youre right.  Their hesitancy turned the press into a pack of wild dogs.  I don't know the Clintons personally, but I think on a human level--and this part of the story never gets told, it's never even <I>asked about</I> in an open way, the way you just asked about it now, the human level was completely supplanted by the idea that they were hiding something and therefore were guilty as sin.  
<P>
I think what happened was Hillarys father died that spring and she was very close to her father.  She lost a significant source of moral support when he died, then Vince Foster who was a close friend of both Clintons killed himself totally out of the blue with a lot of media attention and mystery because suicide is the most mysterious thing there is. Then within 48 hours--and this is not a woman who had a great love for the media--on national radio Rush Limbaugh was saying she had Vince Foster <I>murdered,</I> then in December while her husbands mother is lying mortally ill with something that would kill her less than a month later, two days before Christmas comes the trooper scandal, and in the middle of the trooper scandal which dredges up a lot of dust about her husband's supposed romantic liaisons, in the middle of this obviously emotional time for her, everybody in the press--not the officials, they cooperated fully with officials--<I> the press</I> says "give us every piece of paper you have going back to your Girl Scout cookie records and we will determine whether or not you are innocent, whether or not you are morally worthy...." 
<P>
Remember. too, that Hillary is an attorney, a somewhat idealistic one at that, who probably took some offense at having to prove her innocence which is contrary to every principal in her idealistic being.  I think at that point, she got her back up and said, "Not if they tie me to a log and throw me in the Potomac River.  No way.  Theyre not gettin' 'em." This is all just background and I think it was a terrible miscalculation in terms of the reality of the way the press works.  But on the other hand, even what we've seen of how the press distorted the contents of available documents they had before their very eyes, there was no assurance that the press would not have fried the Clintons anyway, even if they had been forthcoming.

TALK-RADIO HOST,<BR>
<I>(in audience, name unknown)</I><BR>
<P>
Many of the listeners to talk radio think the <I>New York Times</I> is the mouthpiece of the Clinton administration and the most liberal publication in America.  So by the time talk radio--not only Rush Limbaugh but dozens of others like him around the country--got hold of the Whitewater story, with the esteemed and the liberal <I>Times</I> having run it first, the story was projected as <I>having</I> to be true and there was quite a lot of bemusement and joking about it because it was as if Clinton's <I>own people,</I> the high-brow intellectuals whom the <I>Times</I> represents in many minds, were shocked by these <I>awful crimes of their own guy</I> and the credibility of the story was absolutely burned into their minds by the <I>Times</I> being behind it.  The story, as you know, then moved into astronomical regions and went on into the Christian Right arena and Jerry Falwell's "Clinton Chronicles" video began to circulate, full of lurid tales of murder and all that.  I'd like you to comment on what begins to happen in other 91 parts of the media when the story leaves the respectable written press, that is, when the story went to greater heights of twisted facts and ridiculous charges....

<PRE>    </PRE>

JOHN CAMP, CNN:<BR>
<P>

The story certainly got impetus in other media from the <I>New York Times</I> which undoubtedly gave the story ironic credibility which was taken advantage of by those who already had strongly anti-Clinton views--they had a field day with Whitewater.  What you mention about the bizarre subjects and allegations that came up on the talk-show circuit--thats what I call the "grand umbrella" under which the "Whitewater scandal" came to encompass a whole variety of charges.
<P>
Everybody jumped on this story and it expanded into areas that had nothing to do with Whitewater per se--like Hillarys commodities trades....like Hillary supposedly having an affair with Foster.  Vince Foster supposedly being murdered by Hillary .... L. J. Davis doing an absurd story suggesting Clinton was arranging murders in Arkansas. It's taken totally bizarre twists and turns...
<P>
Driving to work I listen to the Atlanta talk show hosts and I just shake my head because of how absurd and outlandish this stuff is, the misinformation that's being conveyed--but hey, I'm <I>listening</I> and that's the point.  That's their modus operandi--sensationalism sells.
<P>
In this case, it also serves a political agenda for those who don't want this President to succeed. Its unfortunate that the print media--which is the one medium that has the time to check out: the facts--so badly blew the Whitewater story that it gave people in other media like the talk show circuit such an opportunity to continue the absurdities.
<P>
That's the danger of allowing all those unspoken spaces of innuendo to linger in the <I>Times</I>and other print stories.
<P>
Those spaces got filled in fast by those with their own agenda.

My Teacher Jean Houston

The latest media-political craze (as of 6-23-96 <I>Washington Post</I>'s excerpts from Bob Woodward's new book) is Hillary Clinton's work with Jean Houston, a respected leader in the human potentials movement who was once my teacher and remains one of my best friends. 

There are zillions of self-help "new age gurus" floating around. We've all heard of them, many of us have read their books. Some are a bit flaky, some are downright frauds. Jean Houston is the real thing and the best of the bunch. She holds Ph.D.'s in philosophy and history and over the years has been an advisor to university presidents, government leaders and the U.N.

Reasonable readers of The Real News Page--if they have not entered this site with prejudice--have by now probably formed the impression that I am not a kook. I've known Jean Houston since she first began her work in 1976, a full 20 years ago. I was one of the first participants in her human development workshops and reported on her work in my nationally circulated magazine <I>Dromenon</I> which went out to public school administrators and civic policy makers. This ought to correct any misimpression that Jean is a "psychic" or a "channeler with dead people." She is not. She is an educator and an extraordinary one. I was one of her students and much of what I learned with Jean shows in my accomplishments and in my success as a human being in relationship with others.

Looks like Hillary was also lucky enough to find Jean who helped Hillary access the "Eleanor Roosevelt-like consciousness" from <I>within her own psyche</I> to give her some tools to address the onslought of cheap criticism she has undergone at the hands of the media and political opponents. Not a bad idea, really. Maybe America isn't ready for this--even though the concept of tapping human potentials has been kicking around among perfectly respectable middle class folks for nearly 30 years--but Hillary could have done worse. If you have any admiration for Margaret Mead--and most people do--consider that Mead was Jean's primary adult mentor. As a child, another mentor of Jean was the renowned philospher Teillard de Chardin who inspired Jean to become the educator she is today.

With all this in my experience, I was amused to watch "This Week with David Brinkley" (6-23-96) and see Cokie Roberts--child of the family of conservative Hale Boggs--describe Hillary's work with Jean as "odd." Of course she would see it as "odd." Cokie travels on a concrete plane of conventional thinking that does not include much notice of the inner life or the potentials we have available to us that conventional education ignores. While David Brinkley opened the show with reference to Jean as a "psychic healer contacting dead people," we have Sam Donaldson to thank for clarifying the facts as reported by Bob Woodward--that Jean was not communining with "spirits" of the netherworld but helping Hillary to connect with her own inner strengths by imagining herself in the position of Eleanor Roosevely or Ghandi or Jesus or whatever figure had faced the slings and arrows of outraged media and political opposition.

You'll notice that at the end of The Real News Page, after "missing stories" and "better-late-than-never stories," I ask "What the New Story?" In this section I assert that it's not enough to critique the media or even become media activists, although these are important. We have to consider new ways of being and new ways of thinking. I feature Elaine de Beauport's work on accessing our multiple intellegences. Elaine was another of my teachers. I had also planned to feature Jean Houston's work, particularly her call for embarking of what Joseph Campbell called "The Hero's Journey."
I hadn't yet put up a section on Jean because I hadn't figured out her Web site yet. As soon as I do, you'll find Jean Houston on The Real News Page--and I say this with great pride.

Watch how this story unfolds in the media-political meatgrinder. I give you this information so you'll have the facts when you hear attempts to allude to Jean as a weird "psychic" or some other disparaging label. What the story says to me is that Hillary Clinton is even wiser than I thought she was.

<font size=5>T</font size=5>he latest media-political craze (as of the 6-23-96  <I>Washington Post</I> excerpts from Bob Woodward's new book) is Hillary Clinton's work with Jean Houston, a respected leader in the human potentials movement who was once my teacher and remains a dear friend.
<P>
In excerpts from his book <I>The Choice</I>, written in his usual fly-on-the-wall style, Woodward described several meetings between Jean Houston and Mrs. Clinton from December 1994 through 1995. 
<P>
The best part of the <I> Post</I> story was its headline: At a Difficult Time, First Lady Reaches Out, Looks Within. This in a nutshell wraps up a perfectly accurate description of the whole affair. 
<P>
From here on, it's been almost all downhill. As the narrative winds its way through other print and broadcast media outlets, we have every reference imaginable to otherworldly cult-like activities such as Hillarys Other Side and A Collector of People, Living and Dead, describing Houston (<I>Newsweek</I>) which ended with a quip about the "beyond. The terms spiritual advisor and psychic advisor are used repeatedly and the word seance has been blurted out more than once in newscasts and on talk radio. ABC's gossip-show "Extra" alluded to "get-togethers with the dead" and "talks with the other side" and dragged on a psychiatrist to speak ominously about what he called "the dangers of spiritualism." Nancy Reagan's astrologer Joan Quigley was on Alan Colmes' radio show (6-24-96), describing her own work as "scientific" as opposed to what she called Jean Houston's "seances," despite admitting she had no idea what Jean's work was about.
<P>
This thing is outa control and reveals, if anything, "the other side" of the American mind: that is to say, how ignorant we are as a society and the popular media strive to keep us that way.
<P>
I know Jean Houston. Jean Houston is a friend of mine. 
She is no seancer or psychic, although she may have <I>wished</I> she was psychic when she saw the media splash the day after Woodwards story appeared. She may wish she had seen ahead and given Bob Woodward a good instructive lecture on the <I>language</I> used to describe the work Jean does, to avoid precisely the misunderstanding that now plagues the account and leaves disparaging impressions about Hillary Clinton. 
<P>
In fact, an honest report of the story would say that Hillarys efforts to work with her inner life reflects the First Lady's idealism and strength of character. But we havent heard a word about these qualities because seances sell so much better on the newsstands and airwaves.
<P>
As to Jean, there are zillions of self-help "new age gurus" floating around. We've all heard of them, many of us have read their books. Some are a bit flaky, some are downright frauds. Jean Houston is the real thing, a teacher who evokes the best in people. Of teachers of this sort, shes the best of the bunch. She's a scholar and an innovative intellect. Her father Jack, whom I also knew well, was a brilliant Hollywood comedy writer and Jean herself did some stage acting in her youth for Joseph Papp in New York. No talking head, this one, Jean's an amusing and entertaining <I>performer</I> of her lectures. She holds a Ph.D. in psychology. We used to describe her as "the overgrown schoolgirl" because she always had her arms full of books--and still does. 
<P>
Her breadth of knowledge reveals a learned individual who uses her mind generously and helpfully to expand the minds of others. Over the years she's been an advisor to universities, civic associations, and the U.N. She's trained government workers in the Energy Dept. of the Bush Administration. 
<P>
Jean has done more than almost any single teacher in this country to develop the human potentials of thousands of individuals and improve the society we live in. 
<P>
Jean's accomplishments are so extensive that it sounds incredible to recount them. They're all true, yet media accounts have made her sound like a wacko. 
<P>
In fact, she's a lively, loving and benevolent person. It's no surprise at all to me--or to anyone who knows Jean--that Hillary Clinton would want to know her.
<P>
Jean Houston is suffering some of the same nonsensical criticism and implied insults to her reputation that the First Lady has undergone. Strong women are attacked even in America, so it's a good thing they're strong. In the long run, this story will probably yield a slow-rolling backfire that will enlighten the public on the special positive qualities of these two women. 
<P>
It's hardly worth wasting megabytes explaining who Jean is--except that <I>some</I> people, even fairly well educated, just might have missed Jean Houston. Since I happen to have one of the longest and closest views of a figure close to what is trying to become a White House mini-scandal, I'll continue a quick run-down:
<P>
Jean Houston and her husband are directors of the Foundation for Mind Research in Pomona, N.Y.  They have spent 35 years probing the potentials of human consciousness, including the monitoring of controlled scientific studies of the effects of LSD in the Sixties.  These studies were aimed toward finding alternatives to drugs and led to their book <I>Mind Games</I>--awkwardly named by their publisher--that offered exercises in non-drug imaginary journeys.  <I>Mind Games</I> is the subject of the Beatles song and reflects the beauty and depth evoked from the inner life when accessed through guided imagery.  It is absolutely benign and a pioneering work in human development because Jean took a path in the opposite direction from Timothy Leary who stuck obstinately to his literal notion of drug potentials. Jean Houston preferred to explore non-drug <I>human</I> potentials, those capacities we all possess in our own bodies and minds if only we can evoke them through education. 
<P>
Jean has been brilliantly designing such an education--from the Latin meaning "to lead out"--for the last three decades.
<P>
This brings us to another major interest of Jeans, the knowledge available in great literature and mythology which contain hundreds of generations of human learning distilled into stories ("legends" or "myths") that serve human survival and help us prevail and develop to become better people. 
<P>
The Mythic Life is the title of her well-named soon-to-be-published new book. If you followed the series of interviews with Joseph Campbell by Bill Moyers on PBS, youll understand the world Jean is exploring in The Mythic Life. In particular, she is picking up on ideas in Campbells famous book A Hero with a Thousand Faces which describes the heros journey.  The essence of the hero's journey is distilled out of dozens of myths from cultures all over the world which carry the same common knowledge as to how human beings evolve and grow through archetypal stages to their fullest and finest potential.
<P>
In 1980, I spent 14 days with Jean and 75 people from all over the world in a workshop in which Jean guided us through a series of brilliantly designed inner-journey exercises in re-enactment of all three books of Dantes <I>Divine Comedy</I>. This experience was very much of <I>this</I> world and not of any other. Jean just makes this world richer and more fascinating. She's also done <I>The Odyssey</I> which is the hero-journey of the Greek, Odysseus. I mean, really, what a way to experience literature and bring its best lessons into our lives. 
<P>
This is sophisticated stuff, not something the popular media easily understands or reports without a big dose of snide skepticism, most often to portray people in this field as mysterious cult figures. On Dateline NBC (6-23-96), Bob Woodward described Jean Houstons work as unusual--with a disapproving frown on his face.  He described Jean in the <I>Washington Post</I> excerpt as follows: (italics added for emphasis on misleading langauge)
<P>
.... co-director of the Foundation for Mind Research, which studies <I>psychic experience</I> and altered and expanded consciousness. Houston, 55, the author of 14 books, is one of the most high-energy seminar leaders in the country. She is a <I>believer in spirits, mythic and other connections to history and other worlds.</I> Houston believes that her personal archetypal <I>predecessor</I> was Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom.
<P>
Well, this sounds pretty flaky. Psychic experience sounds like Jean is a psychic which is anything but true. But Woodward (or his editor) preferred this phrasing to studies of the psyche which is more accurate. Its interesting--and probably calculated--that Woodward (or his editor) chose spirits rather than spiritual. Believer in spirits sounds like Jean is in contact with ghosts. In fact Jean believes in the continuity of all life and especially the <I>inner life</I>--as do I and most people I know. This includes spiritual life as well as the material world, as most people of religious faith believe. Athena is not her predecessor but simply her personal inspiration as a model of compassionate wisdom and leadership. My mythical figure who inspires me also happens to be Athena, although I relate to Artemis and Quan Yin as well--whats yours?  
<P>
Woodwards writing is unusually awkward in this paragraph, as if he (or his editor) tried to squeeze in the cultish terms spirits and other worlds. (He can't quite bring himself to speak of "inner worlds.") The phrasing is disjointed and runs on, describing Jeans [belief] in spirits, mythic and other connections to history and other worlds. The original sentence probably read more like spiritual and mythic connections to history." This, from my own experience and long acquaintance with Jean Houston, is far closer to the truth of her beliefs and her work.
<P>
Speaking as an experienced editor myself (formerly at the old <I>Esquire</I>) who knows the tricks of the editing trade, I daresay this paragraph--essentially the lead in describing Houston--appears to have been worked over by Woodward (or his editor) with a bent toward twisting Jean into an occult figure to spice up a story about a spiritual advisor to the First Lady. Yet elsewhere deeper in the excerpt, Woodward seems to express (or allows his source to express) a certain degree of understanding of the subject. 
<P>
Perhaps Im unusually sensitive to this story because I know Jean, I know exactly what went on technique-wise in her sessions with Hillary, I know what mincemeat the media can make of such delicate information (the supposedly well-educated <I>New York Times</I> called Jean a psychic right smack in the headline), and I know the secondary gain the media have for disparaging Mrs. Clinton. 
<P>
This story is just too loaded with the human potential for catty insinuendos for my inner Athena guide not to raise up her aegis in warrior-like protest.
<P>
As for my own experience with Jean Houston, reasonable readers of The Real News Page--if they have not entered this site with prejudice--have by now probably formed the impression that I am not a kook. I've known Jean since she first began her work with groups in 1975, over 20 years ago. I was one of the first participants in her human development workshops in New York and reported on her work in my nationally circulated magazine on education and human development called <I>Dromenon</I> which went out to public school administrators and civic policy makers, among others. This ought to correct any misimpression that Jean is a "psychic" or a "channeler with dead people in other worlds."  She is not. Psychics and leaders of seances do not play well among public school administrators. Jean is an educator and an extraordinary one.  Much of what I learned with Jean shows in my accomplishments, such as they are, and in my success as a human being in relationship with others, such as it's been.
<P>
Looks like Hillary was also lucky enough to find Jean who apparently worked with Hillary to access an "Eleanor Roosevelt-like consciousness" from within Hillarys own psyche (not "from beyond"). This was an intellectual (not "psychic") exercise done through a simple imaginary role-playing technique common to the preparation of athletes for major sports events. The goal was to help Hillary gain some inner resources to address the onslaught of cheap criticism Hillary has undergone at the hands of the media and small-minded political opponents. 
<P>
Not a bad idea, really. 
<P>
Maybe America isn't ready for this--even after the concept of tapping human potentials has been kicking around among perfectly respectable middle class folks for nearly 30 years--but Hillary could have done worse. If you have any admiration for Margaret Mead--and most people do--consider that Mead was Jean's primary adult mentor.

While David Brinkley opened the show with references to Jean as a "psychic healer contacting dead people," we have Sam Donaldson  (of all people) to thank for clarifying the facts as reported by Bob Woodward--that Jean was <I>not</I> "communing with dead spirits of the netherworld" but helping Hillary to connect with <I>her own living inner strengths</I> by imagining herself in the position of Eleanor Roosevelt or Gandhi or whatever figure had faced the slings and arrows of outrageous media and political attacks that Hillary has been facing for 4 years. 
<P>
This story may pass by quickly because if the media or Hillary's political opponents dwell on it for long, the vast majority of Americans will hear less the absurd terms like psychic and seance and hear more the depth of truth in this tale: that a human being--Hillary Clinton--has been trashed to such an extent that, despite being "like Mozart with his hands cut off, unable to play," she reached out and looked within and perhaps taught us all to do the same in our own lives.
<P>
Maybe part of Hillarys role is in teaching the public exactly this--how to learn grace under pressure from an inner source of inspiration.
<P>
The story is cresting and the tide is already turning toward sympathetic and even enlightened coverage, as in the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> on 6-25-96, when Richard Cooper reported on psychotherapists who defended Jean Houston's methods as well within accepted mainstream professional practice. Mr. Cooper wrote with refreshing fairness and accuracy that "There was no suggestion [in Woodward's account] that Mrs. Clinton believed she was literally communing with Mrs. Roosevelt's spirit--only that she was imagining what might have occurred if she had been able to discuss her painful experiences in the White House with someone who had faced similar difficulties." 
<P>
The most disturbing problem is <I>beyond</I> Woodward's account as the story twists its way through myriad other media outlets and suffers the distortions of the media telephone-game and meatgrinder of human prejudice. The <I>L.A. Times</I> is one of the few papers that produced text that fit the original <I>Washington Post</I> headline: "At a Difficult Time, First Lady Reaches Out, Looks Within." 
<P>
Taking this headline as a distilled little summary of the mythic saga of Hillary's hero journey--the hero must look within to survive and prevail--what the Jean Houston story says to me is that Hillary Clinton is even wiser than I thought she was. 
<P>

PS: Received this response to my column from Scott London, a colleague here in Santa Barbara who recently interviewed Jean Houston for his national radio interview show on NPR:
<P>
From: Scott London (london@rain.org)<BR>
To: Jane Prettyman (openmind@rain.org)<BR>
<P>
Dear Jane,
<P>
I spoke with Jean Houston during her recent visit to Santa Barbara and she mentioned that Woodward was planning to make this public. She was rather upset about it, chiefly because she knew what this would mean for Hillary Clinton. 
<P>
As for Jean herself, we all have a great deal to learn from her. She is one of these rare women who is way out in front, testing the waters, expanding the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding, and setting an example for those brave enough to follow. Like Margaret Mead, Teilhard de Chardin, Joseph Campbell, and others who have not only been her mentors but also
friends, she belongs to the highest tradition of cultural inventors and visionaries.
<P>
I agree with you that the whole thing speaks well
for Hillary.
<P>
My radio interview with Jean Houston will air nationally the first week of September.
<P>
Regards, Scott

<font color="#ff0000">AHA! THE EDITOR'S A LIBERAL! </font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<font size=5>Y</font size=5>ou'll notice some aspects of this page take the bull by the horns with a certain liberal-progressive flair. Although I used to be an editor in the New York magazine business, I make no pretense of being non-partisan as I approach<BR>  this  analysis of media. In fact, precisely to counter the prevailing "myth of the liberal media" and to shed light on the true essence of media operations, it seems important to be affected by my political views. 
<P>
You already got a bio (at the end of the Intro on previous screen), but you deserve to know where your editor is coming from politically, so here's a glimpse....
<P>
In some ways, I might have been a conservative 30 or 40 years ago, on, say, Eisenhower's platform. Today that vision no longer exists under the term "conservative," but does show up in some moderate liberals like myself. Briefly, I am conservative fiscally, liberal socially, and I err in favor of human beings where the two overlap. That makes me a Clintonian Democrat--and a proud one.
<P>
I don't understand the narcissicism of some of today's conservatives who act as if they'll never be in trouble, or who are ignorant of the vital value of American diversity. 
<P> 
A significant number of major corporations are beginning to see that their commercial self-interest is best served by doing well by their "human capital"--their workers. This is an important insight that we must nurture for all it's worth. This is, for me, one of the proofs that the best features of liberalism are smart in the long run.
<P>
That we allowed an angry child like Newt Gingrich to become our Speaker is a monumental embarrassment to our democracy. His ascendence came about partly with the acquiescence of the "free" press. So much for the media "watchdog." <I>Time</I> Magazine called Gingrich "master," "conqueror"--and finally "Man of the Year" for the sake alone of newsstand sales.
<P>
I want to have--and see others have--at least as much intelligence and fullness in the exchange of information as I had with my father when I was a little kid under the holly tree in the shade when I asked him, "Dad, what's gonna happen when progress progresses? Will progress make us sick? What's gonna happen to the trees?" ....  "Hey, Dad, who's minding the store?" .... "Hey, Dad, they don't ask these questions in school. Who's gonna ask 'em? Do they ask 'em in your job? Will they ask 'em in the newspapers?" 
<P>
That was 1956--forty years ago. I still have the same questions. 

<PRE>     </PRE>
<font color="#ff0000">DEEPER THAN POLITICS</font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<font size=5>T</font size=5>he media question goes deeper than politics--all the way into the core of corporate values. 
<P>
An April 1996 Roper poll of 139 Washington reporters found 61% calling themselves liberal to moderately-liberal, 30% moderate, and 9% conservative. Given today's extreme brand of conservatism, one might conclude this poll showed personal reasonableness. One could certainly <I>not</I> conclude--as some have concluded on the right--that liberal values prevail in the broader media hierarchy of  corporate media executives and owners/stockholders, high-tech companies and suppliers, financiers, insurers and bankers who are all part of Big Media. (Last count there were fewer than 28 corporations who own <I>all</I> of media--the figure drops every year with new media mergers). Nor could one assume that most Big Media today are anything other than essentially reactionary and afraid of truths that upset a world made safe for marketing. 
<P>
If anything, having more moderates and liberals than conservatives among reporters may work <I>against</I> liberal politicians because of the reporters' defensiveness to avoid the label of "liberal bias." The result is a thousand nasty little cuts at President Clinton and liberal leaders that assure an appearance of objectivity.  
<P>
"Attitude writing" prevails, such as this from the front page of the supposedly liberal <I>New York Times</I>: "Today Bill Clinton returned to Oxford where he didn't graduate and didn't inhale." He didn't graduate because he was on a Rhodes Scholarship for a limited course of study. He didn't inhale because he has a severe allergy problem which keeps him, to this day, from lighting his cigars.
<P>
True, there are many principled individual reporters and editors who manage to rise above corporate pressures and the imperatives of conflict and cuteness to serve the best interests of society. Still, the "free" commercial press as a whole--at its corporate core, bound by commercial imperatives--is systemically incapable of using its freedom in the best interests of society. 
<P>
Media and politics suffer from a frenzy of unconscious alignments-- and our own passive acquiescence as citizens and media consumers is partly responsible for the media-political mess we're in. Hence The Real News Page's accent on <A HREF="activism.htm"> media activism</A>--off the couch, out of the chair, speaking up, talking back, taking part in society and improving ourselves. Hence our protest against verbal geniuses who make us think we're thinking when we're not.
<P>
Hence the interest in the sociological views of <A HREF="putnmtv1.htm"> Robert Putnam </A> who reveals the decline of involvement in civic associations (and decline in voting) in direct correlation with the rise of television. Hence the airing of <A HREF="parano1.htm">"missing stories,"</A> especially about hate groups, because they may show up suddenly in explosive or insidious forms soon enough and find us unprepared. Hence the leap that must be made to <A HREF="newstory.htm"> "The New Story"</A>--where we go from here in terms of human development.
<P>
The Real News Page only scratches the surface of the immense and elusive subject of media, but deep enough that you wouldn't want it to happen to your car door. 
<P>
Fasten your seat belts, folks ....

<PRE>  </PRE>

<font size=5>S</font size=5>o you don't have to guess about the editor's politics, I'm a woman born in 1944 who walked with Gene McCarthy in the snows of New Hampshire in 1968, a writer and  educator of sorts who cares about the quality of thinking in our national conversation, <BR>most of which goes on within media. 
<P>
Rather than pretend to be "neutral" as an editor, in this election season it seems important to be clear about my point of view as a political citizen who happens to edit <BR>"The Real News Page."
<P> 
I'm voting to re-elect President Clinton and some of my reasons relate to his importance as a media figure. <P>
<P>
Presidents are, to me, mostly symbolic characters who project a vision, an ideal, a mood. Presidents are ideal fodder as media images to be manipulated and they in turn manipulate the media. "The President stands at the center of America's need to be entertained," said Russell Baker. We expect that--and we should also expect to pay attention to what we're missing when the news media ignore a President's best accomplishments because they have no conflict. 
<P>
Just like words and photos, people and their ideas and projects can be images too. They can tell a story that plays a role in the survival of society as something civil--or not. 
<P>
I like President Clinton because he has marshalled his resources on the level of this society's highest ideals. He thinks these things through in long speeches. He doesn't dribble out a few shiboliths. He's consistent. He's persistent. He believes this stuff in his intellect and his heart. Sure he's political. I don't hold that against him. He's not stupid. Still he has, in his major speeches, collected a literature of images that tell us how best to treat each other and govern ourselves. They are worth <A HREF="together.htm">reading.</A>   
<P>
Without money to spend, most of Clinton's projects are by definition symbolic, like AmeriCorps. But AmeriCorps is not covered much by major media, except in terms of the Republican desire to cut it. We see no film of AmeriCorps workers in their communities. This is one of our best stories but it is not shown. There could be a regular series, like "Cops," featuring AmeriCorps kids on the streets, in homes and in classrooms. There is no such series. 
<P>
Reporters, intimidated by the "liberal bias" tag, tend to portray AmeriCorps as a Clinton campaign commercial, so it gets short-shrift. On a commercial level AmeriCorps suffers from lack of conflict which sinks its prospects at the box office.
<P>
So who reports on AmeriCorps? Who speaks up? Who covers it? President Clinton does--which makes him a member of the national press corps. If it seems like a campaign commercial, so be it. AmeriCorps is a success which deserves to be seen and reported <BR>on its own merits. It's part of the national news.
<P>
I tout Clinton, with whom I don't always agree, but I am not his mouthpiece. He happens to represent more closely my values, ideals and outlook than anyone on the current scene. He certainly beats Newt Gingrich or Dick Armey. I'm willing to be open minded to reasonable opponents to Clinton's views. Speaking as a gay woman, I think Clinton is smart not to be suckered into the gay marriage controversy. He's done a lot for gays. Gay marriage has only just begun to be discussed this year and has years to go before being accepted. It's silly being petulant about it during this immediate election campaign.
<P>
This President has paid attention to how we talk to each other, and I like that.  After <BR>OK City he advised us not to resort to censorship but to instead use our freedom of speech to speak up against hate speech. (See <A HREF="together.htm">"Top Five Under-Reported Speeches of President Clinton."</A>) 
<P>
It's an important time for a man like President Clinton to exist because he offers a counter-argument that includes rather than excludes. 
<P>
It's also an important time to realize that some aspects of media limit our democratic freedom by manipulating information for commercial rather than educational purposes. <BR>In this game, society loses.
<P>
In fairness, I believe conservatives have made positive differences in disciplining the issues of fiscal responsibility and "family values." In fairness, too, corporations are not democratic. Equality and social responsibily must be attended to as well.  That's Clinton's role as President. Even if James Baker and Liz Dole make the Republican run, as they may, Clinton's still the better man for the job because--believe it or not--he's more sincere at the core where it counts.
<P>
Media-technology has its positive attributes but it's being swallowed whole without much education about its effects on us, especially on our children. It's not just program content, either. The <I>relationship with the TV set (or video game or computer) itself</I> lulls the child into a false sense of freedom. If this is the child's primary circle, media's conditioning of instant  gratification can, in some people, later meet life explosively when life doesn't let us use a remote or a mouse to get what we want. 
<P>
There have already been large effects. Harvard's Robert Putnam believes the <A HREF="putnmtv.htm">"Disappearance of Civic America"</A> not only paralleled the rise of television but was in large part <I>caused</I> by media technology. We're not stepping back and seeing the bigger stories.

<P>
Independent Television Service: Public Television for a Change
<PRE>      </PRE>
Hello everyone.
<P>
<font size=5>J</font size=5>ust a quick interruption of the flow of discussion to announce an event that should be of interest.  Premiering tonight -- Thursday 
July 11-- (and continuing on the next two subsequent Thursdays) at 10 pm ET on public television stations nationwide is the series 
<P>
<CENTER>"SIGNAL TO NOISE:  Life with Television." </CENTER
<P>
<P>Produced by Cara Mertes for the Independent Television Service (ITVS), Signal to Noise is a three-part series that analyzes and dissects the power, business, and allure of television. Each episode centers on a theme and consists of segments produced by independent producers. Check your local listings for times and dates in your local area.
<P>
Contact us at ITVS if you or your organization would like copies of the viewer's guide or have questions about the show.  
<P>
Below is a description of each program. It would be great to hear any comments or discussion people might want to generate about the issues included in the series.
<P>
Part 1 - "Watching TV Watching Us" "follows the money," asking how viewers fit into the business of TV, and tracing the relationship of audiences to advertisers and programming. We hear from TV viewers themselves in our 'TV Family' profiles, and independent producers take us behind the TV screen, from Super Bowl ads to soaps to Roseanne. The hour looks at the engine that drives television, as it keeps us glued to the set.
<P>
Part 2 - "TV Reality?" looks at how we get information about our world from television. TV has been called a "window to the world,"  but what kind of frame is around it? Cultural critics Susan Douglas, Stuart Hall, Herman Gray and Sut Jhally join journalists Linda Ellerbee, Ben Bagdikian, and Walter Cronkite as we look at how representation functions, and how the news has changed from being information-driven to being profit-driven. How have consultants affected the local news? Is there a difference between news and entertainment today? Does it matter that many people think Cops is more real than the news? Finally, whose stories are told, and whose are never told?
<P>
Part 3 - "Remote Control"  looks at the new media landscape, and asks what choices will viewers really have? How is the future being sold to us through the technologies being developed? Are democratic values capable of surviving the media onslaught? Critics and activists Janine Jackson, Dee Dee Halleck, Stuart Hall, and Ben Bagdikian look into the struggle between public and private interests as it has played out over the airwaves, and now on the "information superhighway."
<P>
Hope this will spur some dialogue.
<P>
Cordially,
<P>
Barry Madore <P>

<font color="#ff0000">WHOSE LANGUAGE IS THIS?</font color="#ff0000">
<P>
<H4><font size=5>C</font size=5>ritics from Coleridge to Kenneth Burke have recognized the power of naming. For Coleridge, a
word doesn't "convey merely what a certain thing is, but the very passion and all the circumstances
which were conceived as constituting the perception of the thing by the person who used the word."
One might paraphrase Burke to say that language does our thinking for us. Note, for example, the
different perspective invited by calling an action the "Grenada incursion" rather than the "Grenada
invasion," and by terming U.S. and allied actions the "Gulf War" rather than the "Oil War" or the
"War for the Sheiks." Along similar lines, one might argue that if the perspective of one campaign
infuses the vocabulary of reporters, that candidate has obtained a significant advantage.
<P>
Whereas in earlier political campaigns, one side or the other occasionally enticed the press into
embracing one of its words or phrases, in 1988 the Bush campaign managed to insinuate an entire
vocabulary about the campaign into press coverage. The reporting on the Dukakis record on crime
is illustrative. Here the Republicans secured the complicity of the press in renaming convicted
murderer William Horton, in redefining the relationship between Horton's Maryland victims, in
adopting such words as "torture" and "terrorize" to describe his actions while on furlough, in defining
the furlough program's purpose as dispensing "weekend passes," and in talking of the policy as a
"revolving door." 
<P>
Each of these acts of naming biased the discussion against Dukakis. Each was
inaccurate. To the extent that the Republicans were able to set this language in place, however, they
demonstrated the power of ads, reinforced by candidate speeches, and campaign hype, to
contextualize news.

<P>
________________________________________________</CENTER>
<P>
Although his given name is William, he calls himself William, court records cite him as William, a July
1988 <I>Reader's Digest</I> article identifies him as William J. Horton, Jr.,and press reports prior to the
Republican ad and speech blitz name him "William," the Bush campaign and its supporting PACs
identified the furloughed convict as "Willie" Horton. Even the crusading anti-Dukakis newspaper that
won a Pulitzer Prize for its exposé on the furlough program consistently identifies Horton as William
Horton or William Horton, Jr. When the Maryland man who was stabbed by the furloughed convict
contacted the Lawrence <I>Eagle-Tribune</I>, he too referred to Horton as William Horton.In his account
of the attack in the PAC ad, however, that man, Clifford Barnes, instead identifies the convict as
"Willie" Horton.
<P>
One might trace the familiar "Willie" to the naming practices of slavemasters, to our patterns of talk
about gangsters, or to the sort of benign paternalism that afflicts adults around small children. 
Whatever its origin, in discussions of murder, kidnapping, and rape, "Willie" summons more sinister
images of criminality than does "William." After all, it wasn't J. "Eddie" Hoover who hunted down
"Alphonse" Capone. And during his trial, the person to that point known as Willie Smith was
identified by family and attorney as either William or Will. After his acquittal on charges of rape, the
family reverted to the name by which he had been known before the trial.
<P>
The televised PAC ad titled "Weekend Prison Passes," as well as the PAC ads featuring Horton's
victims, all refer to him as "Willie Horton." When his mug shot appears on the screen of "Weekend
Prison Passes," the name under it reads "Willie Horton." Reporters reduced Dukakis on crime to the
Republican sculpted image of "Willie Horton." In news reports, "Willie" Horton's name was
mentioned more often by reporters than by George Bush or any of his representatives. Use of
dramatic, coherent narrative increases the likelihood of recall. Once the Horton narrative was
embedded in public consciousness, mention of his name should have been sufficient to evoke the
entire story.
<P>
By the campaign's end, even the Democratic candidates had accepted the Republican identification
of Horton (Lloyd Bentsen interview with Dan Rather, October 26, 1988; Dukakis interview with
Rather, October 27, 1988; Dukakis interview with Peter Jennings, November 9, 1988). The most
prominent exception occurred before Horton became a stock feature in Bush's stump speech and
the subject of PAC ads. In the <I>Washington Post</I> of July 8, 1988, Richard Cohen wrote about
"William Horton's Furlough." 
<P>
The dual labeling of the <I>New York Times</I> seemed to invite a Woody Allen to shout that the
czar and the tsar were the same person. An editorial on June 30, 1988, labels Horton "Willie
Horton." Yet pieces by Robin Toner on July 5 and Martin Tolchin on October 12 refer to him as
"William R. Horton." In Tolchin's article, it is Clifford Barnes who identifies Horton as "Willie
Horton." The difference between the two sets of articles appears to be that "Willie Horton" is written
about by anonymous reporters tasked with inside reporting and given filler space. By contrast,
"issue" pieces carrying bylines write of "William Horton." The contrast raises the unconfirmed
possibility that the more contact a reporter had with Bush campaign insiders, the more likely the use
of "Willie." The assumption falters on the editorial presumably written by someone safely anchored
to a desk in New York.
<P>
The press adopted the phrases "weekend furloughs" and "weekend passes" from the Republican
speeches and ads, which in turn located them in the Lawrence <I>Eagle-Tribune</I>. The phrases are
inaccurate. Furloughs in Massachusetts ranged from 1 hour to 74 hours in 1987 and from 1 hour to
170 hours in 1986, and furloughs could be granted for any day or days of the week. In 1987, the
median number of hours of leave per furlough was 19, 5 hours less than a full day and 29 less than a
weekend. Horton's approved 48-hour furlough began on Friday, June 6, 1986, which means he
should have returned to prison while most of us were still enjoying what we usually define as a
weekend.
<P>
Bush reinforced the notion that these were weekend events by averring that he says to criminals,
"Make my day!" while Dukakis says, "Have a nice weekend!" "Weekend" suggests that the
furloughs occur frequently, when in fact in 1988, as in 1986, a prisoner was permitted no furloughs
for the first half of his or her sentence and in 1988 could be furloughed only in the final three years
before eligibility for parole or release. As of April 1988 furloughs were ended for anyone who ever
was a first-degree murderer not eligible for parole.
<P>
Weekend is a time for recreation and leisure. This association suggests that the assault and rapes
were leisure activities for the prisoners. Bush suggested as much when he called on in his audience to
ask Dukakis why he had let "murderers out on vacation" (June 1988 speech to Illinois Republican
Convention in Springfield).
<P>
The Bush furlough ad is titled "Revolving Door" and speaks of Dukakis' "revolving-door prison
policy." Although the visual in the ad itself shows not a revolving door but a turnstile, reporters also
adopted the Republican announcer's characterization of the program as a "revolving-door" policy.
So, for example, Dan Rather asked Lloyd Bentsen, Democratic vice-presidential nominee: "Can't a
person, or can a person, be deeply concerned about revolving-door justice and laxity toward
criminals, even when the criminal happens to be someone who is black, and still not be a racist?"
(CBS Evening News, October 26, 1988).
<P>
In describing the ad, reporters adopted the Bush language as well. So, for example, in an article
examining inaccuracies in the ads of both campaigns, the <I>Washington Post'</I>s Lloyd Grove writes
"another Bush campaign commercial featuring hard-eyed men in prison garb streaming through a
revolving door" (<I>Washington Post</I>, October 31, 1988, p. A8).
<P>
Despite the use of the words "turnstile" or "gate" in all questions to our Texas focus groups, 36
percent of the respondents referred to the furlough ad as the "revolving door ad."
<P>
Here is an instance of the complexity of the visual-verbal relationship. The repeated use of the
phrase "revolving door" couples with repeated viewing of the image of the circling actors as convicts
to establish the visual-verbal link in memory. "Revolving door" also suggests a frequency and
casualness in the administration of the furlough program that did not characterize the Massachusetts
system.
<P>
From PAC ads made by Horton's victims, reporters adopted the words "slashed," "brutally,"
"terrorized," and "tortured." "For twelve hours I was beaten, slashed, and terrorized," says Clifford
Barnes, "and my wife Angie was brutally raped." "Horton went on to rape and torture others," says
the sister of the man killed by Horton. Bush helped set the language in place. On June 24, he stated,
"In no other state would a cold-blooded murderer like Willie Horton have been set free to terrorize
innocent people."
<P>
"Slashed," "terrorized," and "tortured" are not the words usually used by reporters to characterize
crime. Nor was it the language first used by the national press to describe Horton's actions. On
December 2, 1987, before the furloughs became a campaign issue, CBS aired a segment that "took
a hard look today at a standard procedure for many of the nation's prisons. Forty-five states," said
Dan Rather, "offer furlough programs which release inmates from prison for limited times to see how
they handle freedom." The language of the correspondent is the factual, calm, descriptive language
characteristic of crime reporting in network news. "William Horton did strike again in this Maryland
house where Cliff and Angela Barnes lived. He held them hostage for twelve hours. Horton raped
her twice, tied her husband up in the basement and stabbed him twenty-two times." But by June 26
and July 20, CBS reporters Jacqueline Adams and Lesley Stahl were calling Horton "Willie" and
adopting the tabloidlike language of "torture" and "terror."
<P>
Once the Republican language was in place, it became the optic through which the press saw, and
invited us to see, Horton's actions. The <I>Washington Post</I> favored the word "terrorized" (October 22,
1988; October 25, 1988; June 23, 1988, "terror"), as did columnist Tom Wicker (New York
Times, June 24, 1988). CBS reports ran the full range from "brutally" (Jacqueline Adams, June 26,
1988) to "savagely" (Bob Schieffer, October 7, 1988). <I>Newsweek</I> preferred to label "Willie
Horton" "the Massachusetts murderer who tortured a Maryland couple" (October 31, 1988, p. 16).
<P>
The <I>New York Times</I>, which on July 5 described "William Horton" as "a convicted murderer" who
"broke into the couple's home, bound and stabbed Mr. Barnes and raped his wife," by mid-October
had "Willie Horton" "viciously" attacking and also adopted Barnes' word "slashed with a knife"
(<I>New York Times</I>, October 10, 1988, "Convict's Victim Makes an Ad"). NBC's Lisa Myers
adopted the word "tortured" (October 24, 1988). On October 24, 1988, on the "MacNeil/Lehrer
NewsHour," Kwame Holman noted, "Cliff Barnes was tortured with a knife for twelve hours and his
wife, Angela, was raped twice by William Horton, an escapee from the Massachusetts prison
furlough program."
<P>
Academics embraced the Republican language as well. "The furlough program was emphasized,"
writes journalism professor David Myers, "because Willie Horton, a black man who had been
convicted of first-degree murder, had escaped to Maryland on a weekend pass, where he brutalized
a white man and raped his fiancée."
<P>
As interesting is the fact that when offered two different constructions of the relationship of the
couple assaulted by Horton, until late in the campaign the press adopted the more incendiary of the
two. At the time of the Horton attack, Clifford Barnes and his fiancée were living together. The first
PAC ad to air on the topic says accurately that Horton "kidnapped a young couple, stabbing the
man and repeatedly [twice] raping his girlfriend." That ad began airing September 9. On October 20
a second PAC ad was aired in California. This spot features Clifford Barnes, who is now married to
the woman who was his fiancée at the time of the attack by Horton. "My wife Angie was brutally
raped," says Barnes.
<P>

reinforced <BR><font color="#ff0000">the mistaken assumption</font color="#ff0000"><BR> that violent crime is disproportionately committed by blacks,<BR>

<P>

<P>
The sources that identify Angie as Barnes's wife at the time of the attack include CBS (December
1987), Cohen in the <I>Washington Post</I>, Holman of "MacNeil/Lehrer," and Toner in the New York
Times. Although in an October 23, 1988 report, ABC's Joe Bergantino identifies Barnes as her
"boyfriend," two days later ABC's Britt Hume identifies Barnes as her "husband." On NBC, on
October 28, this identification was reinforced in what I elsewhere define as a "newsad," a segment of
news that might as well have been paid candidate advertising:
<P>
     Ken Bode: George Bush was here [California] again today, again talking about crime.
<P>
     Bush: I believe in safe neighborhoods, and I say I believe it is time for America to take
     back our streets.
<P>
     Bode: Like everywhere else, the Democrats have been on the defensive about crime.
     Willie Horton's victims made a campaign commercial.
<P>
     Cliff Barnes in ad clip: For twelve hours I was beaten, slashed, and terrorized, and my
     wife Angie was brutally raped.
<P>
     Bode: But mostly, Bush's tough talk on crime works, because it fits with what
     Californians see on their news each day.
<P>
     Man: When you have gang murders in the headlines, day after day, I think the voters
     understand that there is only one candidate in this race who is truly tough on crime.
     Only one candidate for president who really supports the death penalty.
<P>
The Republicans' use of Horton shaped the visual portrayal of crime in network news in ways that
reinforced the mistaken assumption that violent crime is disproportionately committed by blacks,
disproportionately committed by black perpetrators against white victims, and disproportionately the
activity of black males against white females. In other words, the Republicans' use of Horton shaped
the visuals in 1988 network crime coverage in a way that underscored the Bush message.
<P>
James Devitt and I have systematically examined the ways in which alleged criminals were portrayed
in network news from 1985 to 1989. In 911 scenes of alleged criminals in 530 network news
stories, blacks were proportionately more likely than whites to be shown restrained and in actual
mug shots--the two visuals shown in the Horton PAC ads. Robert Entman has found the same
pattern in local news.
<P>
I suspect that this disproportionate exposure to black males in mug shots increases the telegraphic
power of the use of the Horton mug shot in the PAC ads. This finding raises the question, What
subtle chain of inferences or visceral responses might be invited by Senator Jesse Helms's showing
of a close-up still photo of his opponent Harvey Gantt? 
<P>
Our data also provide a baseline telling us about how often blacks are likely to appear as "alleged
criminals" in news and what visual forms this representation will take. By comparing the appearance
of blacks as alleged criminals in crime stories from 1985 to 1989 with their appearance in stories
about the issue of crime in the 1988 general election, we can determine whether the crime stories of
1988 differed significantly from contemporary norms. They do. The increase in the proportion of
blacks identified or shown as criminals in 1988 general-election stories about crime is statistically
significant. The number of female victims per news story doubled in the 1988 stories about Horton.
<P>
Just as the Bush campaign verbally primed reporters' discussion of crime, so too the issue of Horton
subtly primed producers and editors to include more blacks in their covering shots showing
presumed criminals. The most egregious example occurred on ABC on October 31, 1988. The
reporter was Ken Kashiwahara. All of the presumed criminals but one were black or Hispanic. All
of those who said they were afraid were white, and most were women.
<P>
To portray as a typical criminal a black male who was an accessory to a felony murder, assaulted a
white male, and raped a white female is inaccurate. Blacks run a greater risk of forcible rape,
robbery, and aggravated assault than whites. Low-income individuals are the most likely victims of
violent crime. Men are more likely than women to be the victims of violence. FBI statistics confirm
that, unlike robbery, rape and murder in the United States are primarily intraracial, not interracial,
phenomena. In 1988, for example, only 11.3 percent of the reported rapes involved a black rapist
and a white victim.
<P>
I do not intend to minimize Thomas and Mary Edsall's claims that a higher percent of the crime
committed by blacks is interracial and that in the categories of assault and robbery more than half of
the robberies committed by blacks have white victims. Rather, my point is that raising the fear of
whites that they are likely to be murdered or raped by blacks is unjustified. Identifying William
Horton's actions as somehow typical, as George Bush did in his speeches, is racist. 
<P>
Moreover, a disproportionate portrayal of blacks as criminals plays on racial fears. When network
news segments on crime visually cast blacks in disproportion as criminals, the news stories
themselves are priming both a pro-Bush and a racist response.
<P>
If candidates' ability to shape news coverage was the news of 1988, the news of 1992 is the ability
of candidates to bypass news entirely. The reason: the rise of talk radio and television.
<P>
The emergence of the talk show as a site of both substance and silliness suggests a system in
transition. By providing callers and audience members with direct access to candidates, the format
enfranchises. Participation rather than spectatorship is invited by its interactive form. Moreover, it
attracts an audience otherwise largely inaccessible to candidates.
<P>
But because the hosts range from dedicated partisans to entertaining lightweights, a skillful candidate
can transform many of these opportunities into "interview ads" or "newsads." And while callers ask
useful and often important questions, most are unskilled in follow-up. The opportunity to ask a
second question is usually not provided, in any event. In other words, while potentially productive,
the talk-show form is not likely, of itself, to elicit a high level of argument, engagement, and
accountability.

<P>
<H4> <font size=5>T</font size=5>hree protections stand between the voter and ad pollution: candidate use of free time, candidate
use of paid time, and the protections that come from an electorate able to secure information from
sources other than ads. Two of these require the help of the press. Using free time against paid time
usually means that the attacked candidate responds to the false ad at a press conference clipped into
broadcast and print news, or in a telecast debate. While of some value, reliance on news and
debates entails three problems. 
<P>
First, the audiences for ads and these two other forms differ. Far
more people see political ads than watch debates, digest a daily newspaper, or spend dinner with
Peter Jennings. Additionally, a debate or news piece will respond to the questionable ad once, while
the ad itself can air many times; repetition gives the ad a natural advantage. Moreover, news and
debates tend to use words as their weapons. In the contest between evocative pictures and spoken
words, pictures usually win. Finally, news coverage has more often been part of the problem than
part of the solution. Most newscasts in 1988 magnified the power of false advertising rather than
minimized it.
<P>
Candidate debates provide an opportunity for one candidate to hold another accountable for the
claims found in the ads. In 1984 Walter Mondale used this opportunity effectively in the New York
primary when he turned to his opponent Gary Hart in a debate and asked why he was saying in his
ads that Mondale favored killing kids in Central America. And one characteristic of the 1992
primary debates was the candidates' use of them to unmask false charges in their opponents' ads.
<P>
The second protection is a well-informed electorate. For a number of reasons that protection isn't
working. In a nutshell, citizens under the age of thirty are now less likely to read a newspaper than
are their parents and grandparents. And the electorate as a whole spends little time with the
substantive fare found on the "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour," in the "Frontline" documentaries, and on
C-SPAN.

Still, there are things the press can do for those willing to attend. We should expect the press to note
violations of the consultants' own "Code of Professional Ethics." In it, they pledge that they will "use
no appeal to voters which is based on racism or discrimination and will condemn those who use such
practices . . . will refrain from false and misleading attacks on an opponent or member of his family
and shall do everything in my power to prevent others from using such tactics . . . will document
accurately and fully any criticism for an opponent or his record . . . [and] shall be honest in my
relationship with the press and candidly answer questions when I have the authority to do so."
<P>
We also can support the "citizen jury" concept pioneered in 1990 by the Minnesota League of
Women Voters. A revivified form of the Fair Campaign Practices Commission, the juries involve
representative citizens from around a state eliciting candidate positions and holding candidates
accountable for the responsibility and accuracy of their claims.
<P>
The National Association of Broadcasters has urged stations to reject unfair or inaccurate ads
brought to them by political action committees. Interested citizens can remind stations of the NAB
position and reiterate the fact that stations are under no obligation to air PAC ads and can be sued
over misrepresentations found in them. Candidates whose records are distorted in PAC ads then
should sue both the airing station and the PAC. Such action should encourage stations to exercise
greater vigilance in screening these ads.
<P>
A dozen and a half states now have on their books laws governing campaign conduct. Some govern
only claims about an opponent; others (e.g., Minnesota and Massachusetts) include claims
candidates make about themselves. In most instances these laws were enacted as part of the state's
corrupt practices act. Wisconsin, both Dakotas, Utah, and Oregon are among the states whose
statutes permit removal of a guilty official from office. Interested citizens should encourage their
states to enact such statutes and encourage the responsible officials to enforce the law.
<P>
The process would be well served if candidates were voluntarily to accept the recommendation of
nationally syndicated columnist David Broder that soon after an ad begins airing, the sponsoring
candidate take questions on its content and accuracy. Consultants should be expected to air their
ads for the press and to make available documentation for the ad's claims. In 1990, for the first time,
most major consultants made such information available, in response to the rise of "ad watches" in
newspapers and on television stations.
<P>
I have serious reservations about the constitutionality and wisdom of the Clean Campaign Act of
1985, also known as the Danforth-Hollings Bill. This bill would require candidates to appear in their
own attack ads and would provide response time for those attacked. It would counterbalance PAC
and private third-party ads by giving the opposed candidate free response time, thereby providing an
incentive for stations to reject all noncandidate ads. The difficulty with this proposal is its built-in bias
toward already well funded incumbents; most oppositional ads are produced for less well funded
challengers. At the same time, it would raise thorny questions about what does and does not
constitute an attack.

<H4><font size=5>E</font size=5>mpaneled or not, reporters play a central role in presidential debates. As rhetorical theorist Robert
Scott argues, press coverage about whether Jimmy Carter would or would not debate created
expectations that disadvantaged the incumbent when such a debate finally occurred. By forecasting a
Carter who would be tough, incisive, and a master of detail, press accounts heightened Carter's
vulnerability when he instead appeared stiff and ill at ease. By making the fairness of ducking debates
an issue, by painting Carter as one who sought advantage in excluding John Anderson, press
coverage created a scenario in which "it was simple enough to perceive Reagan as long-suffering;
denied an early confrontation with Carter through his insistence on being fair to John Anderson and
finally granted a face-to-face encounter only when and under conditions that seemed upon the
surface to favor Mr. Carter." 
<P>
Within the debate itself "pushing hard to put Reagan on the defensive,
Carter fulfilled the prophecy of the press. His efforts looked strategic because they had been so
labeled well in advance for instant identification. . . . Carter's very presence in the debate after
standing aloof the first time, as well as his hard struggling, underscored beliefs like Tom Wicker's
wicked depiction of his 'hard won reputation for indecision, ineptitude and speed on the backtrack.'"
<P>
As its part of the equation, the press would cover the substance of debates as well as candidates'
strategies. If broadcasters opened a debate with a summary of the candidates' already stated
positions, the electorate would be better served. Analyses should begin by summarizing the
similarities and differences between the candidates, and then indicate what was added to that
knowledge by the clash of the debate. "What did we learn?" not "How, if at all, did they blunder?"
would be the central question asked by broadcasters.
<P>
Since reliance on print to correct errors and clarify discussion does little to educate those who do
not read newspapers, we need to find a way to move information now carried in print to the
broadcast media and then to tie it to the analysis of the debate itself. "You can say anything you want
during a debate," observed George Bush's press secretary in 1984, "and 80 million people see it."
But when reporters demonstrate that a candidate misinformed, "so what? . . . Maybe 200 people
read it, or 2,000 or 20,000."
<P>
To inform the 80 million debate viewers requires that the national broadcast news channels do as the
best newspapers have done and correct misstatement of fact, clarify points of ambiguity, and point
to non-answers. There is no reason that the networks cannot follow the pattern Jim Wooten of ABC
set in 1988 and analyze debate inaccuracies on the news the next evening. This process would be
eagerly aided by the campaigns, which in the past three presidential elections have assembled
research teams to control the spin on news reports. In the clash of competing claims about who lied
about what, reporters can locate some of the areas worthy of public clarification.
<P>
Reporters should abandon the win-lose mentality that pervades coverage of debates. At 
minimum, the possibility that both candidates have won should be considered. After all, the esteem in
which most viewers hold both candidates rises after each debate. Occasionally, the campaign
insiders concede as much: A team of Carter's 1976 advisers concluded that those debates "helped
both candidates by diminishing, if not eradicating, the general public's negative perceptions of each."
<P>

<P>
More important, "winning" is in large part not a function of actual performance in the debate but is
the by-product of audience predispositions. We tend to distort the positions of the candidates we
favor and posit more agreement with them than we actually share. So, for example, in 1980 Carter's
supporters magnified their agreement with Carter, and Reagan's supporters did the same with
Reagan.
<P>
An ideal debate model presupposes a disinterested audience able to act as an impartial judge
swayed by the merits of one case rather than another. Instead, the audiences for debates turn on
their television sets primed to see their favored candidate vindicate their belief in his or her
competence and virtue. Accordingly, 82 percent of those who supported Reagan for president in
1980 thought he had won the debate with Carter; 69 percent of Carter's supporters disagreed,
believing that their candidate had done the better job.
<P>
If the supporters of one candidate are more likely than those of the other to watch the debate, then
national surveys reveal little other than which candidate had the larger number of viewing partisans.
This was the case for Reagan in 1980, when 86 percent of his supporters and 81 percent of Carter's
watched the debate. The CBS/Associated Press poll gave Reagan the debate, by 44 percent to to
Carter's 36 percent. Had a larger number of Carter's supporters been watching, the results would
have been closer.
<P>
The tendency to view Reagan as the winner was magnified by ABC's use of a methodologically
flawed telephone survey to assess outcome. "Probably the most influential post-debate event was
the telephone call-in conducted by ABC," recalled Reagan debate adviser Myles Martel. "Although
Carter's aides were quick to assail its methodology--and justifiably so--tens of millions of Americans
saw Reagan outdistancing Carter in the poll by a 2 to 1 margin before they turned off their television
sets. Additional millions of voters were exposed to lead stories about these results the following
morning in the newspapers and on television news programs."
<P>
The sample of callers who paid for a call to ABC was self-selected. The fact that it cost money to
call undoubtedly discouraged the poorer Democratic constituency. Since ideologues are more likely
to engage in active communication behavior, the response could also indicate that Reagan's
supporters felt more strongly about him than Carter's did about him---a rating on intensity, not an
accurate representation of total support. We know from a Harris survey that Reagan's supporters
were more intensely partisan than Carter's.
<P>
These facts of political behavior led communication scholars Leuthold and Valentine to postulate
three principles governing perception of who won a debate:
<P>
   1. The candidate with the most supporters in the debate audience is likely to be considered the
     winner, all other things being equal. This means that a candidate with a substantial lead in the
     polls is likely to be considered the winner, and to profit the most, if he performs as well as his
     opponent. 
<P>
   2. If the numbers of supporters of each candidate are equal, the candidate with the most intense
     supporters is likely to be considered the winner. The intense supporters will be more likely to
     watch and to declare their candidate the winner. 
<P>
   3. If the numbers of supporters are equal, the conservative Republican candidate is likely to be
     declared the winner, because his conservative Republican supporters will be more active, and
     this activity will include watching the debates and declaring their candidate the winner. 
<P>
The notion that we can immediately know who had made the best case should also be suspended.
Initial appearances can deceive. As Edwin Yoder, Jr., of the Washington Post observed in 1984,
Reagan at first appeared to many to be the winner: "Responses were deft, and brilliantly crafted for
the limited attention level of television." Yet when analyzed carefully after the debate, Reagan instead
seemed "underinformed and imprecise about vital matters of detail."Support for Yoder's observation
comes from an unlikely source: After watching the Reagan-Carter debate, Reagan's pollster Richard
Wirthlin concluded that Reagan had won. When he read the transcript, he observed, "Thank God it
was on television."

<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>

<font size=5>A</font size=5>fter reading the full text of the  <A HREF="ethics.htm">Ethics Committee Report</A> and other materials on the Gingrich matter, I am most dramatically alarmed by the ease with which Mr. Gingrich formulated (way back in 1989) a propaganda strategy using cunning linguistic concepts and code language with outstanding electoral success for himself and his party. It's his success that bothers me, not because he achieved success but because of <I>how</I> he achieved it. 
<P>
Using tax-exempt funding was only part of his means. The words he used were another fraud.
<P>
If you watch the shell game carefully, youll notice that defenders of Mr. Gingrich quickly point out that he did not benefit by personal financial gain. But it is obvious to me that Mr. Gingrich is not interested in money but in power. This affair is not about penny-ante corruption to line his personal pockets. This is corruption of our democratic safeguards against partisan political ascension at public expense. This is a gigantic no-no.
<P>
Given his position and responsibility to the essence of our free democracy, I personally consider this a high crime.
<P>
It is not a crime to be a demagogue, but his skill at demagoguery has distracted our mental focus from perception of his actual crimes.  Mr. Gingrichs soft-shoe defense of his actions, saying he was naive and unaware of the tax laws and blaming it on his attorney are only minor examples of his talent for evasion and manipulation. It has since been reported that, contrary to his assertion of being naive, attorneys had indeed warned him early on against financing partisan activities with tax-exempt foundation funds. So, what we may be looking at here is arrogant negligence.
<P>
Many will comment upon those specific ethical lapses. My interest is in discussing how we got here, how we got into a situation in which we (and even the Ethics Committee itself) have been buffaloed by an entire gestalt of falsity, flim-flammed by several years of rhetorical conditioning calculated to keep us from thinking critically.

Mr. Gingrich, more than most politicians, uses demagogic language and calls it "ideas." He makes us think we're thinking when we're not. He employs calculated touchstones of linguistic association, such as playing on "the welfare state" to catch that old hatred of "the communist state" and then tightly associating the welfare state with Democrats.
 
<P>     The point is, he knows how to play us--and, unfortunately, we're
playable. He's playing on our lack of critical thinking, our longing for pride in our nation, our attraction to verbal geniuses, and our gullibility to quick "smart" solutions. His manipulation is masterful.
<P>
While coming off as a sweet pudgy guy who likes pandas, he would achieve power by capitalizing upon the fissures in the nation that thrive on fear, resentment and hatred. He says "Your fear of government is appropriate" and "Democrats are the enemy of normal Americans." He has an audience and they (we) are listening and he knows it and his hungry ego thrives on it. 
<P>
     He pushes dangerous buttons and--for all his intelligence--he doesn't think of the consequences. He is like a pre-pubescent child whose neuronal connections in his brain have not yet hooked up firmly with the limbic-emotional part of his brain to give him the capacity to appreciate emotional consequences or to feel guilt over such things as skirting the law--that is to say, to be a moral adult. My God! He dissembled smack in the face of the Ethics Committee. 
<P>
He's outa control. 
<P>
     In Gingrich, we've been conned by a technological intelligence, one who has been himself seduced by Toflers speedy  outlook, that snap-your-fingers instant-fix that Ross Perot is famous for under the hood of his car--but it's thin, shallow, artificial. It lacks human depth, doubt, consideration, reflection. It does us no good, but it <I>does</I> get Newt elected along with the rest of his strident crowd--and it helped set the stage for our current blithe receptivity to his wrongdoing.
<P>
In Newt, nothing is just itself, simply. Every third word is a superlative adjective, giving away enormous self-doubt but not the sort of doubt that slows him down to consider the slower vibrations of life and serious thought. Its inflated. It's fast. It's giddy. It's manic. 
<P>
I appear to be disturbed most by Newt's pathological style of thinking and that is because he seems to me to reflect a pathology of thinking among us all. Otherwise he would not be where he is. We would not have bought it. Given his position in our government, it's a problem of democracy.
<P>
     The importance of the "Gingrich ethics matter" has been downplayed by the popular media, by his partisan supporters and by sincerely non-partisan citizens, chiefly through the fallacy of "twinning" his situation with a mountain of "raised questions" about President Clinton. I find this interesting and very worrisome. "Twinning" is a style of fallacious logic we seem to have become conditioned to, perhaps out of longing for justice & fairness, but still the habit concerns me. Not only because I believe the Clinton questions are massively overblown and certainly yet to be proved in terms of his personal venality in the way Gingrich's wrongdoings have been nailed to the door. By twinning, we end up examining neither and--in the Gingrich case--we are missing a huge story about the misuse of power which, if we don't get this story now, will repeat itself again and again with others of even worse motives than this (I believe) ill little man from Georgia. 
<P>
     It's not about Gingrich. Gingrich is simply the match thrown on the dry tinderwood  of uncritical minds. It's about <I>us</I> and who we accept and who we elevate and who among us we follow and whose demagoguery we swallow whole without gulping. 
<P>
As a lapsed Republican (lapsed because the party has been ruined for me by figures like this one), Im particularly furious that we have allowed Newt Gingrich to infect a whole spectrum of conservatism with fast facile thinking as deep as a dime.  We allowed him to foster a mentality that took us to appeals to our worst instincts and to fiscal extremes that forgot human beings.      
<P>
By accepting his grandiose phrase Renewing American Civilization, we have let Mr. Gingrich sucker us into a backhanded insult to anyone among us who qualifies as someone whose civility is slightly suspect, who is--heres the coded milieu of the phrase--uncivilized, who is living on welfare in the ghetto, a drug addict, a pregnant teenager, someone outside the norm of the ideal of Newts civilized world.
No renewal for them, Im sure. So what is this renewal thing? Does renewal mean "getting rid of" something, "removing" something unwanted from our society in order to achieve a "truly civilized" state? Does "renewal" mean achieving an "opportunity society" in which the sink-or-swim abandonment of human beings is codified as "a good thing"?
<P>
Obviously I was a liberal Republican when I was one, but it seems to me that "Renewing American Civilization" is really a euphemism for "Screwing American Civilization." 
<P>
Mr. Gingrich couldn't do it all by himself. We let him do it. I dont know what to do about our having let him do it, but its something were going to have to look at, no matter what his fate at the hands of a timid if not complicitous Ethics Committee which deserves (certainly Johnson) to be served with an ethics complaint of its own. We have the <A HREF="ethics.htm">facts</A> of his abuse of power staring us in the face and we are paralyzed. Right in the middle of his contrite "apology" to the Ethics Committee Mr. Gingrich fudged his language to side-step moral responsibility when he regretted that he had "brought down on the people's House a controversy that could shake the faith people have in their government." A "controversy" is a difference of opinion, whereas he did not mention the word "dishonor." I haven't seen a single media observer or political leader object to this. He pulled another fast one and nobody noticed. 
<P>
We have our own reflecting to do about how we allowed Newt to happen to the real American civilization, the one that reveres law and justice and fairness for all of its people, a civilization that values human life and discerning, questioning--even protesting--intelligence. If Mr. Gingrich has succeeded in rising to the top of our greatest democratic institution by means of a stealthy strategy of consciously designed polarization and by a sense of entitlement to cheat the public treasury to pay for its dissemination, then it is certainly true that our civilization needs renewing as soon as humanly possible.
<P>
The soul of the Republican Party may yet be intact in some quarters. It was heartening to see that on Dec. 29, Rep. Michael Forbes (R-NY), a formerly enthusiastic Gingrich "lieutenant," became the first Republican to break ranks and announce he would not support Mr. Gingrich for re-election as Speaker. He said that Gingrich's explanations for admitted ethical lapses "simply did not ring true." His mind was changed by reading the full 22-page <A HREF="ethics.htm">Ethics Committee Report</A> which convinced him that Gingrich was cavalier in his approach to the ethics charges. Mr. Forbes' courageous decision reminded me of the better nature of the moral idealism of many conservatives that was, in my opinion, seduced and led down a garden path by Mr. Gingrich for cheap political gain. Ironically some of those who most fervently embraced the ideals Mr. Gingrich mouthed may be among those who turn away from him with the greatest disgust when Mr. Gingrich is shown to be a cipher of insincerity and dishonesty. 
<P>
     Although up to now I have honestly hesitated to say terribly nasty things about Mr. Gingrich because I have a suspicion that he may be suffering from a psychiatric illness such as a mild manic-depressive disorder, nonetheless now (having read the full  <A HREF="ethics.htm">Ethics Committee Report</A>) the time has come to speak as boldly as I know how, to say that as long as this man is the Speaker of the House, he is an insult to everything I believe in about America. He is an insult to the concepts of fairness and loving-kindness and personal responsibility I have fought for all my life--concepts shared by my reasonable Republican friends and by most Americans of every political stripe. 
<P>
Although more accurately I should say Mr. Gingrich reminds me of how we have insulted ourselves by letting him get this far, nonetheless we must remove him from this degree of power and we must do it now. We must act and do it ourselves before he resigns and slips off into the martyrdom of false heroism (a la Nixon) that will surely await him if he resigns, leaving behind a "controversy," and we will have learned nothing. 
<P>
     For all these reasons, I am imploring the Ethics Panel to recommend a minimum of censure if not expulsion from the House. 

        <P>

     That's a rant. And that's a wrap. 
<P>
     Regards to friends of The Real News Page and happy new year. Hope this sub-site is helpful to you and yours. <P>Pass around the URL.
<P>
Print out the <A HREF="ethics.htm">Ethics Report</A> and give it to friends who are not on the Internet. As you can see from <A HREF="gingeth5.htm">Rep. Forbes' (R-NY) statement</A> in the NY Times, this report is so shocking it is actually changing minds and firing folks into outraged action. Media-wise, the fact that this document is not available to (or being picked up by) popular and local media is almost as shocking as its contents.

  <font color="#ff0000">THE END OF EQUALITY</font color="#ff0000"><BR>
  By Mickey Kaus<BR>
  Basic Books, 1992, 293 PAGES</H3><BR></CENTER>

 <PRE>    </PRE>
   

   <font size=5>M</font size=5>ickey Kaus is an editor of <I>The New Republic</I> and a perceptive observer
   of American class divisions. In <I>The End of Equality,</I> he argues
   persuasively that the most serious threat to American democracy today
   comes not so much from the maldistribution of wealth as from the decay
   or abandonment of public institutions in which citizens meet as
   equals. Equality of income, he says, is less important than the goal
   of social or civil equality. 
<P>
Mr. Kaus points out that foreign observers used
   to marvel at the lack of snobbery, deference, and class feeling in
   America. There was "nothing oppressed or submissive" about the
   American worker, German economist Werner Sombart wrote in 1906. "He
   carries his head high, walks with a lissom stride, and is as open and
   cheerful in his expression as any member of the middle class." A few
   years later, the British historian R.H. Tawney noted that America was
   "marked indeed by much economic inequality; but it is also marked by
   much social equality." It is this culture of self-respect, Kaus
   suggests, that we are in danger of losing.
<P>
   The trouble with our society is not just that the rich have too much
   money, in Kaus's view, but that their money insulates them, much more
   than it used to, from the common life. It is the "routine acceptance
   of `professionals' as a class apart" and the "smug content" of the
   affluent and educated for the "demographically inferior" that poses
   the greatest threat to civic life, according to Kaus. 
<P>
Outlining a
   strategy of "civic liberalism," he insists that public policy should
   seek not to undo the effects of the market, which inevitably promotes
   inequality of income, but to limit its scope--that is, "to restrict
   the sphere of life in which money matters." Kaus distinguishes civic
   liberalism from "money liberalism," the traditional liberal strategy
   which aims to promote social equality by manipulating the distribution
   of income and reducing income differences. Where "money liberals"
   worry about distributing and redistributing income, Kaus writes,
   "civic liberals" worry about "rebuilding, preserving, and
   strengthening community institutions in which income is irrelevant"
   and about "preventing their corruption by the forces of the market."
<P>
 Mr. Kaus's proposals for developing a more egalitarian culture fall into
   two broad categories. First, he calls for strengthening the public
   sphere and institutions such as the draft, national service, and
   public schools, all of which function as social equalizers. 
<P>
Second, he
   argues that the problem of the "ghetto poor" underclass must be
   confronted since its very existence "represents a profound violation
   of social equality." The way to do this, he says, is through mandatory
   employment of all able-bodied adults who cannot find work on their
   own, the establishment of universal day-care facilities, and a
   national health plan. 
<P>
Further, all cash payments to those able to work
   ought to be eliminated. Kaus believes that the "solidarity-through-
   check-cashing" strategy, based on the idea that universal receipt of
   cash government benefits promotes social equality, has been as
   thoroughly discredited as the notion that distributing money to the
   poor will somehow end the indignity of poverty. These "check-mailing
   solutions" to ending poverty "have wound up sustaining, if not
   creating, the urban underclass whose existence precludes social
   equality."
<P>

<font size=5>I</font size=5> didn't want to come down here and talk about Whitewater. It's a story that has a lot of comedians' footprints on it already, but as long as the President [<I>sitting at the table with Keillor</I>] has brought it up, I'll say a few things. I know if I don't talk about Whitewater, some of you will think that I know something about it. I could say  that I've never been in Arkansas in my life, but some of you might ask: Why didn't you say that a month ago?
<P>
	
All I know is what I read in the papers, so Whitewater is a complete mystery to me, as is most of what goes on in Washington.  
<P>
There are so many people complaining about Washington and they don't even know the names of their elected officials.  Rush Limbaugh voted in a Presidential election for the first time in his life in 1988 when he was 47 years old.  I'm amazed by that fact! I guess it took him a while to figure out what he thought, and if I thought what he thought, I'd be puzzled too. It must be fun to say the things that Rush Limbaugh says, but imagine having to believe them and base your life on them.
<P>
I'm still astonished to have a President who is younger than me. I wasn't prepared for it. For so long it seemed that the country was run by old jowly guys in baggy brown suits who peered at television cameras like they were bombs and who read from note cards a prepared text saying that all reasonable steps had been taken and, though one couldn't be sure just what the outcome of the situation would be, they were keeping a close eye on the matter and there was basis for hope that all would work out eventually. 
<P>
And then suddenly we have a President who was young enough to have been as stunned by President Kennedy as I was, who was young enough to have the same draft problems I had, to have not inhaled--myself I choked and coughed like crazv--that was believable, hard to inhale while you're coughing and choking--who not only knew who Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles and Otis Redding and Roy Orbison and the Coasters were but who could have played a sax in their bands--this is astonishing....
<P>
... Whitewater is a carbonated scandal, less about what's real than about perceptions and preconceptions. It's all surface.  But people are into surface these days.  That's why they are so disillusioned by politics.  It doesn't look pretty.  How convenient for them--to grow up in a country that offers such opportunities and blessings as would be only a fantasy in most of the rest of the world--and then to check out in disillusionment.
<P>
I like this Presidcnt.  He's full of soul and he doesn't check out.  I like this President, even though I didn't go his church, and I think the country likes him. I admire his love of politics, the pleasure he takes from being in crowds, looking at people, shaking hands, and his great love of talk.  
<P>
A lot of smart-alecks in the media try to put him down by saying he likes to be liked, as if they didn't like to be liked.  He deserves to be liked. Let him have what he deserves.  They try to insinuate that he panders to folks just so they'll like him, but I disagree.  He's taken some seriously unlikable stands.  This President has been nothing if not bold in bringing major divisive issues into the public forum and declaring himself on them. He's gone into open forums on radio and television, and he's done it with dignity and humor, so that my son and daughter--who do not read the New York Times or watch MacNeil/Lehrer, whose interests tend more toward videos in which beautiful anguished people drift through banks of fog to music that sounds like chain saws cutting sheet metal--they feel a connection to this President.  That means a lot.  He is a President who can stand up in front of an audience and say what he thinks without the text on little cards and say it in complete sentences and often gracefully.  This is astonishing.
<P>
He's done this with great good humor, despite this difficult year with the carbonated case of Whitewater.
<P>
Nobody blames the press for enjoying stories about administrations in panic. White House staffers thin-lipped and pale in public, all because of hard-hitting reporting, though the stories may not exactly be true.  I'm not saying you enjoy it, but you may have gone to school with people who do.
<P>
Sometimes, in the news business, people create cliff-hangers where there are no cliffs and write about events with a tone of urgency that has no basis in fact.  I'm not saying that <I>you</I> do this, but you may know people who do.  And that is why some journalists' credibility depends largely on the forgetfulness of the American people.
<P>
There is a great danger when the press wanders from the facts.  If you do, you will be held to a different standard than one you're used to. 
<P>
Journalists are held to a standard of truth which is demonstrable, at least over the long run.  But when you slip into the field of fiction and entertainment, then you will be expected to be fascinating.  This is going to shorten your careers.  Nobody can be fascinating for long, but people can be accurate and responsible for an entire career.  
<P>
And I wish all of you long and distinguished careers.

<P>
George Will's advice to Dole (Column Right, May 12) is to "voice America's anxieties about the coursening of the culture and the Balkanizing of the citizenry." 
<P>
What exactly does "coursening of the culture" mean? Mr. Will underlines these code words by describing Hawaii's pending Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriages and California's racial preferences ban on the November ballot. 
<P>
Why does Mr. Will metaphorically compare the American democratic processes of negotiating citizens' rights with the warring factions within the former Yogoslavia ("Balkanization")? Does the refinement of American culture depend on the supression of the diversity in America?
<P>
He does a disservice to reasoned conservatism.

<P>
To the Editor,						
Time Magazine

<P>
Your March 25 Contents blurb described "a Senate majority leader and a President who must find some way of working together while trying to knife each other in the back."
<P>
Get me re-write: "...while speaking up for their differing views on the campaign trail," or just drop the whole phrase. 
<P>
Time seems bent on portraying a bitter--indeed violent--polarization. But let's face it. For these two men to find a way to work together is important for this country, no matter what the circumstances. We are waiting for them to do so. I call upon Time to encourage rather than discourage them. 
<P>
Sincerely,

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<font size=5>L</font size=5>ooking over old Whitewater articles, as I had occasion to do recently, can be an almost alarming experience--all that news gone to waste!  All those  now-forgotten  "revelations,"  all  those bureaucrats who were hauled
briefly before us and did not turn into John Dean. 
<P>
Here, for example, is a <I>Time</I> cover story from early 1994, alleging possible criminal interference by George Stephanopoulos  in the appointment of Jay Stephens to head the civil investigation of the failure of  Madison  Guaranty. . . 

<IMG SRC="wwline2.gif" height=380 width=590>

"Whitewater," the formless, dangerous thing hanging close to
the  President, is what the press helped create and what it
tends to perpetuate. The press protects the amorphousness of "Whitewater" as if it had a positive interest in keeping it
unfathomable, "complex," and eternally unresolved,
ignoring anything that might give it shape--real facts
about real scandals like the one recounted here.
<P>
In the summer of 1994, the former Vice President of the
RTC,  William Roelle, testified before the Senate Whitewater
committee.  The committee was investigating  the  tangle  of
allegations  regarding  contacts  between  the  White House,
Treasury Department officials, and  the  RTC  regarding  the
investigation  of  Madison.  But  Roelle  told the committee
about another "contact." He said that in 1992, his  superior
at  the  RTC,  Albert  Casey,  had  been contacted about the
Madison investigation by Boyden Gray, Counsel  to  the  Bush
White  House.   The  alleged  contact  happened very shortly
after Jeff Gerth's first  article  about  Whitewater/Madison
had appeared in the <I>New York Times</I>.  (Gray denies making the call; Casey has not commented.)
<P>
     Recalling that the 1994 hearings were largely devoted
to absurd wrangling about whether Treasury Secretary Under-
secretary Roger Altman had been <I>in a position</I> to influence
the  RTC investigation, and recalling that such matters were
of frantic interest to the press at the time, it's  extraordinary  that  Roelle's  testimony  about White House contact
with that same agency, made during a campaign season about
confidential information that had obvious political potential, was ignored by the mainstream press. 
<P>
 If the press had
been looking at something other than what it had been told
to look at by the many promoters of "the Whitewater scandal"--if it had been looking at the RTC instead of at the Clinton White House--it might have found itself an actual Whitewater story.
<P>
The RTC's chief investigator for Madison was  L.  Jean
Lewis of the RTC's Kansas City office.  Lewis' referrals,
her allegations about the Clintons and  others, and her
charges that her investigation had been impeded for
political reasons played a crucial role in creating "Whitewater" as a story.  No Lewis, very likely = no Whitewater.
<P>
Madison had been assigned to her caseload in the summer
of 1991, but the investigation of the collapsed S&L was not
slated to be opened until late in 1992.  In March of 1992--
right  after  the  first Jeff Gerth article appeared--Ms.
Lewis  moved  the  Madison  investigation  forward  in her
schedule, from late 1992 to April 1992.  She submitted criminal referrals from the investigation, mentioning the  Clintons as witnesses, in September of 1992.
<P>
     The referrals Lewis submitted in 1992 were rejected  by
the  U.S. Attorney in Little Rock, Charles Banks, a Republican appointee.  In October of 1992, Banks wrote a letter to
an FBI investigator which noted that the FBI was being pressured (by whom?) to proceed quickly with the Madison  investigation.   In  his  letter,  Banks  expressed  doubt  about
whether a successful prosecution could  be  mounted  on  the
basis  of  the  referrals and stated that to move forward on
the case might  amount  to  "prosecutorial  misconduct."  He
expressed concern that moving forward with the investigation
would lead to press interest which might  highlight  politically  damaging  but  unproven  allegations, and declined to
proceed on the matter before the  election.  
<P>
A  few  months later,  Justice  Department  officials concurred with Banks' opinion.  
<P>
Subsequent claims by Jean Lewis and  others  that
her  1993  investigation  was  impeded for political reasons
need to be evaluated in light of  the  fact  that  her  1992
referrals were turned down by <I>Bush administration</I> officials.
<P>
Jean Lewis went to considerable  effort  to  track  the
1992  referrals  through  the  justice system.  In Spring of
1993, after learning that the referrals  had  been  refused,
she  prepared  to  resubmit  them.   Records show that Lewis
devoted the great bulk  of  her  time  to  Madison,  despite
requests  that  she  turn  her  attention  to more important
cases.
<P>
     Lewis  was  (at  least  ostensibly)  removed  from  the
Madison  investigation  in November, 1993.  Rep. James Leach
has suggested that her removal was a political act, done  in
response  to political pressures.  
<P>
But the record shows that
the impetus for her removal came from the Senior Counsel  to
the  Kansas City RTC's Professional Liability Section, Julie
Yanda.  Yanda believed that Lewis' handling of two  previous
investigations had damaged both their outcome and the relationship of of the KC-RTC with other investigative organizations. In  her  November, 1995 testimony before the Senate Whitewater committee, Yanda gave a detailed account of  the immediate  cause  of  her request that Lewis be removed from
the Madison case.  She said that in 1994,  the  KC-RTC  had
been  deluged  with  Madison subpoenas from the U.S. Attorneys
Office.  Two RTC lawyers were assigned  to  respond  to  the
subpoenas,  but  they found it difficult to locate documents
in  Jean  Lewis'  Investigations  unit.   
<P>
The  USAO  became
annoyed  at  the delays, and issued a complaint about one of
the lawyers, Karen Carmichael.  On November 5, 1993,  Carmichael  learned  that the USAO and the FBI were sure that the
KC-RTC had several Madison  documents  which  had  not  been
surrendered.   That  afternoon, Jean Lewis' supervisor told
Carmichael that Investigations possessed aproximately one  hundred
boxes  of  Madison  documents  which they had not previously
revealed,  despite  the  inquiries  of  the  lawyers.  
<P>
 This
episode  confirmed  suspicions  in the RTC office that Lewis
had been hoarding and hiding Madison documents.  Yanda asked
for  Lewis  to be removed from the case because she believed
that her conduct was damaging both the investigation and the
KC-RTC office.
<P>
     It is clear, though, that Jean Lewis continued to  work
on  the  Madison  investigation after she was "removed" from
it.  Amidst an atmosphere of mounting rancor and  suspicion,
some of the KC-RTC staff began to suspect that Lewis and her
allies might be secretly taping  office  conversations.   We
know  that  Lewis  did  tape  one  conversation,  with April
Breslaw of the Washington RTC office.  Lewis has alleged  in
testimony that the conversation is evidence of pressure from
Washington to back off from the Madison investigation.  (Her
Senate  testimony includes the remarkable claim that she had
not intended to tape the conversation, but that her  machine
had  somehow  turned itself on.) 
<P>
The contents of the tape do
not support the Lewis allegation,  but  it  has  nonetheless
been  the  centerpiece  of  several  hearings.   The  tape's
existence was first revealed from the floor of the House  by
Rep.  James  Leach,  who  supported  Lewis'  version  of the
conversation (and used her edit of the tape).  Lewis' leaks
to Leach were another cause of dissension in the Kansas City
office; other staffers considered them a  serious  violation
of policy.
<P>
     In addition, Jean Lewis was suspected of leaking confidential information to the press.  In her November 1995 testimony, Yanda said that after  a  spate  of  "extraordinary"
coverage  of  Madison/Whitewater  matters in the <I>Kansas City
Star</I> which  included  extensive  quotes  from  the  criminal
referrals,  she  was  told  by the head of the Investigations
unit that Lewis was the source of the leaks.   There  is  no
direct evidence that she was, however.
<P>
     Lewis has claimed that her referrals  were  delayed  in
the  fall  of  1993  by  an  internal  Kansas City RTC legal
review, and that the review  was  a  response  to  political
pressure.  She reiterated the claim in the opening statement
to her November 1995 Senate testimony, which directly accused  Yanda
of  obstruction.  
<P>
 But, again, the record shows otherwise.  A
review  of  pending  referrals  by  RTC  legal   staff   was
instituted as general policy in June of 1993.  The review of
the Madison referrals did not cause a significant  delay  in
their  submission;  two  lawyers  Karen  Carmichael and Phil
Adams were given a deadline of about a week to  perform  the
review, and they met it.
<P>
     In her 11/30/95 Senate Whitewater committee  testimony,
Karen  Carmichael  said this about the quality of the referrals she was given to review:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     As I recall, there were  statements  like:   "This
     person  did this activity."  And yet the documents
     that were supporting it did not evidence the same
     things.   You  could  draw innuendo or try to jump
     from one conclusion to another, but they certainly
     didn't  state  conclusively  what they [the referrals' authors] were stating was a fact.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     In a summary of an unsworn  interview,  Carmichael  was
asked  about  her  statement  (in  e-mail)  that the Madison
investigation would blow up in the RTC's  face.   Carmichael
replied  that  she  did not believe "that there was anything
there" as  concerned  the  Clintons  and  Whitewater.   She
further  said  that the referrals seemed to be written so as
to imply that the Clintons and Whitewater  were  targets  of
the investigation, and that they included implications about
the Clintons' liability which were not supported by the  law
or the facts.
<P>
     The legal review did  not  result  in  any  substantive
changes  to the referrals, since the investigative staff did
not accept the changes that the lawyers suggested.
<P>
     This episode and that of Lewis' "removal" from  the  case
are  significant  because of the use Lewis has made of them.
In both cases, Lewis (and her Republican supporters)  recast
internal  office  procedures  and  professional conflicts as
political pressure and persecution.  This pattern  seems  to
apply, as well, to the process by which Lewis and two of her
superiors were placed on temporary administrative  leave  in
August  of  1994,  an  action which followed an ultimatum by
Yanda.
<P>
     Lewis, a self-described  conservative,  says  that  she
took  care to sequester her political views from the Madison
investigation.  The extraordinary steps she took in pursuing
and  publicizing the Madison investigation argues otherwise.
In addition, though, there is direct evidence  of  political
motivation.  A staffer has described a discussion with Lewis
in which she flatly said that Governor Jim Guy Tucker
would resign when he learned that he was named in the referrals, and from which he concluded that Clinton was the  real
target--that the referrals were a "roadmap" to Clinton's
removal from office.  Staffers have noted that the  drafting
of  the  referrals  conflates  targets  and witnesses to the
extent of appearing to  incriminate  everybody.   
<P>
Lewis  has
been quoted as saying that she was working on a project that
would "change the course  of  history."   RTC  lawyers  quoted
anomymously  by  David  Corn in <I>The Nation</I> (9/5/94) called
the resources devoted to the Madison  investigation  "unprecedented"  and  said  that "[t]his Madison case went forward
because of politics--that was no big secret"  and  "Jean's
own politics was driving it ...  She likes the limelight, is
very right wing, and this was a chance for her to  do  something."
<P>
     Further, there is the fact that Lewis has for some time
been represented by the Landmark Legal Foundation, an organization known for pursuing, and sometimes  creating,  
right-wing cause celebres.
<P>
     In 1992, U.S. Attorney Charles Banks  prevented  Lewis'
criminal  referrals  from  becoming  media fodder.  In 1993,
though, the submission of the referrals was  accompanied  by
ample leaking, first to the <I>Kansas City Star</I> and then to <I>The
Washington Post</I>, as  well  as  to  Rep.  Leach.   Lewis  has
claimed,  in  essence,  that  she  had to take extraordinary
actions in order to evade politically motivated obstruction.
But  it  seems  more  likely  that  what she calls political
obstruction were <I>professionally</I> motivated objections from
Yanda, Carmichael, Banks, and others, and that Lewis created
the chimera of "political obstruction" in order to justify her
extraordinary  actions.   It  was  necessary to leak Madison
material not because of obstruction but because  to  make  a
scandal, you must involve the media.
<P>
     Jean Lewis has  stated  that  the  indictments special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr  brought against the McDougals and Jim Guy Tucker vindicated her referrals.  But <I>nothing has emerged  to  justify
the  inclusion  of the Clintons in those criminal referrals</I>.
<P>
Jay Stephens' civil investigation has  supported  the  Clintons'  account  of their losses, cleared them of involvement
in irregularities, and put to rest a  number  of  subsequent
allegations as well.  Yet we all know that the trial in Little Rock is really about the Clintons, and it all began with
the  criminal referrals--which Jean Lewis' colleagues knew
were also really about the Clintons.
<P>
     This is why it's worthwhile to retrieve the facts about
the  RTC investigation--because one must do so in order to
understand "Whitewater," both the story and  "the  story  of
the  story."
<P>
 The press has shifted constantly in its estimations of what Whitewater is  "really  about,"  even  as  the
allegations  have shifted, been reshuffled, and recurred. To
call the result "inchoate" would be too generous.   Yet  for
all  the  noise,  the  commitment to definitively nailing the thing down is absent--and the neglect of vital
elements  like  the RTC story is proof of that.  
<P>
An overview
of the Jean Lewis investigation is replete with signs of the
kinds  of things that caused feeding frenzies when they were
alleged of the Clintons or the Clinton White House--politicization   of  investigative  agencies,  abuse  of  power,
"improper contacts," the possibility of  lying  under  oath,
even  concealed  documents and balky responses to subpoenas.
It looks more like Whitewater than Whitewater does.  But the
"questions  raised"  by  the RTC story are distinctly uncomfortable for the people charged to raise them.  If  the  RTC
investigation  was  a  political  sham  and  a shambles, why
didn't the press recognize it at the time?  And what was the
role of the press in turning a shambles into a scandal? 
<P>
Did the press act as a courier for Jean Lewis when it should have been blowing the whistle on her?
<P>
     Long before Jean Lewis' tape recorder  "turned  itself
on,"  the hallmark of Whitewater press coverage has been the
dogged pursuit of concocted  stories.   So  while  reporters
trudged  to  every news conference wherein D'Amato failed to
produce a rabbit out of his hat, the  testimony  that  Julie
Yanda  and Karen Carmichael gave to the Whitewater committee
was ignored.  The essential  functions of  the  press--to reveal abuses, to keep officialdom honest, to tell the truth, to tell <I>a</I> truth, to help us understand--all totter  in  the face of such omissions.  
<P>
The
mainstream press didn't want to tell any kind of truth about
Jean  Lewis  and  the  RTC investigation.  It didn't want to
reach any conclusions. It was incurious. The press was more interested in having a nebulous scandal hanging over the President's head than in bringing into crisp focus the <I>real</I> scandal at the RTC.

<center><blockquote>Columnist, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</blockquote></center>

<p><hr size="0.5" noshade>


<p><b>Since you wrote the Harper's piece, have you seen anything new to change your mind?</b> 

<p>I get more solidly reaffirmed every day. The inaccuracy of press accounts has now reached a standard of hysteria. They're writing things now that are so easily proven wrong.  

<p><b>For example?</b>

<p>The whole lying-Hillary-bitch theme. Everywhere you look on TV,  you see a clip of Hillary in her pink suit supposedly denying she did any legal work for Madison Guaranty. If you read her whole answer to the original question, she describes how she had pitched (Madison Guaranty owner) Jim McDougal the idea, signed on for the retainer of $2000 a month, and served as the billing attorney.  

<p><b>Not one of the biggest retainers one has ever heard of.</b>

<p>No. And again, one of the things the press does is feign the credulousness of a child. I mean, here is a highly successful corporate litigator in one of the biggest firms in the state -- $2000 a month was   a pittance. Which also goes back to that ridiculous statement of McDougal  -- who can't tell anything straight because he's mentally ill  -- that Bill comes by his office and begs for the business on the grounds that he's going broke. $2000 a month after expenses probably increased Hillary's monthly paycheck by $20. 

<p>Then there's Hillary's alleged mendacity in "Travelgate."  I don't think this was the Clintons' finest hour, but she never denied that she had taken an interest in the travel office.  The assertion that she lied is itself a bald-faced lie. 

<p><b>Why has the press got it so wrong?</b>

<p>The press mob is locked into a prosecutorial mentality. And reporters have careers at stake. Look at what happened to Woodward and Bernstein. There's blood in the water, and there's the opportunity, or at least the thought, of bringing a president down.  It's  now gone so far, they can't turn back. 

<p><b>But the Clintons do seem to have behaved a little oddly.</b>

<p>I understand. The suspicion that they're hiding something  has driven a lot of this investigation. First of all, Hillary Clinton has, basically, contempt for the press, and also great fear, because of all sorts of things done to them in Arkansas.  Then Whitewater comes up, and the press begins clamoring, "Prove your innocence."  And I think she drew herself up and said "Not if they tie me up and throw me in the Potomac River in the winter -- screw them!"  And the rest is history.  I don't think she's ever adjusted to public life. She wants to have it both ways. She wants to be on national TV every night, and she wants to keep things private also. You can't do that. 

<p><b>Besides the mishandling, could there be some wrongdoing, like Whitewater and/or Madison Guaranty money being illegally funneled into Clinton's gubernatorial  campaign?</b> 

<p>If you read the Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro report (done for the Resolution Trust Corporation), every single check that went in or out of the Whitewater Development Co. was scrutinized and traced to its origins. They concluded there was no evidence of hanky-panky. Maybe someone could say Hillary should have suspected there was something fishy going on with Madison  and gotten to the bottom of it, instead of turning away.

<p><b>So where is the story  going?</b>

<p>You don't know, at the end of the day, that there isn't some guilty secret in the shrubbery somewhere. I don't believe it. When the whole thing started, the focus was supposed to be, did the Clintons do something crooked for money or power. Now, since there's no evidence of that, we're asking things like, did Hillary lie about who approached who on some deal, and the answer is, who gives a shit? Maybe the story could stop right here, as an unsolved  mystery -- and people could say, my God those Clintons are good at a coverup. It could be like the Kennedy assassination.

<p><b>For you, what is the bottom line of this story?</b>

<p>It's frightening to me as a believer in our system that you've got what is essentially the unchecked power of the media to destroy.  It's shocking to me that people don't know better. But don't you think people are becoming more aware?  I'm alternately exhilarated and depressed. Some days I feel like I'm going to expose them all; it will all come out. Other times I feel like the Dutch boy with one finger in the dike.

The term "media" is an awkward plural noun that describes electronic and print mediums across an enormous spectrum of hundreds of outlets.  Yet all the media are owned by fewer than 28 corporations whose numbers diminish further with each new merger, forming a nearly monolithic singular noun as well.
<P>
This makes Rupert Murdock, for example, a more powerful man than simply his vast fortune.  He owns a huge chunk of that thing through which we in the public are conducting our national and global conversation.  He happens to be conservative.  
<P>
Sun Myung Moon owns the <I>Washington Times</I> which has been one of the chief injectors of innuendo-laden Whitewater muck into the mainstream media. The <I>Washington Times</I> is over-represnted on C-SPAN, as any regular watcher of the early-morning Washington Journal can attest.  Mr. Myung Moon happens to be very conservative.  His agenda of influencing Washington's actions in relation to his interests in Korea gives him a direct political stake in twisting the news to his agenda's advantage.  Character assassination of a President he doesn't like is only too easily done. Mr. Myung Moon certainly does not influence his reporters. He just hires them. This is a dangerous problem for <I>any</I> President--and its a <I>media</I> problem.
<P>
Intense pressure to produce corporate profits affects the newsroom.  On February 15, 1995, one of the most respected journalistic editors in the country, Geneva Overholser, resigned her position at the <I>Des Moines Register</I> over the squeeze of profits on the newsroom.  Interestingly, the Overholser story appeared on the <I>New York Times</I> front page--of the Business Section.  Media-on-media stories tend not to be covered as straight news in the first section.  The media are not comfortable looking at themselves.  Rather, in a classic example of "splitting," media-on-media stories are usually moved along the side-track of "business news," especially within the same medium.
<P>
Yet, in this very maneuver of covering the Overholser story as business news, we see a remarkable admission that news--and all of media--is big business that necessarily takes big bites out of editorial quality, factuality, integrity and even space.  But, played in the Business Section, the real story slides by us like a ship in the night.  In the News Section or even in the opinion columns, this "remarkable admission" might be noted, examined, commented on.  <I>Looked at.</I> The moral issue might be considered.  We might explore the dyseducation that results from the commercial warp to get consumer attention.  
<P>
However, when the story is skirted to the Business Section and discussed in terms of <I>Des Moines Register</I>-owner Gannett's performance on Wall Street, the "news" skips the problems of frayed morality and junky thinking to get to the bottom line.
<P>
Occasionally, you will see "media-on-media" stories on the
news front page, for example, the <I>New York Times</I> piece (3-14-95) about the Jenny Jones talk show which featured an encounter that allegedly led to murder.  But you'll notice this was a print-media newspaper doing a cross-species story on the extremes of <I>broadcasting</I> which is perceived to be miles apart, a comfortable distance from the association of being in essentially the same business.
<P>
Don't get me wrong.  I'm not a leftist anti-capitalist.  I think capitalism is fine, so long as we understand what we're letting capitalism do without adult supervision.  I have yet to hear an intelligent discussion of other options the media have for hawking their products.  This is where <I>we</I> come in, we who are the consumers of media, we who are the media market.  Why can't quality thinking be commercially successful?  Does this tell us how lazy we are and how poorly we have been educated?
<P>
We have to <I>want</I> something better than to be spoon-fed.  We have to <I>want</I> to think seriously with open minds, as some non-commercial (and even some commercial) programming asks us to do.  <I>Do</I> we want to?  Apparently not yet.  Only a minority of the country watches outlets like PBS.  The quality of PBS has to be commercially competitive which means we have to work toward making ourselves a majority--a <I>market.</I>  That's our job.
<P>
Ironically, even though the actual cost of media is the purchase of advertised products, most people think of commercial media as free or relatively inexpensive.  Easily accessible media is a double-edged sword.  When it's cheap, we pay less attention to its import.  If we treated media as a product in and of itself and gave our media experience value, we might be more intelligently attentive to media's content and tactics.
<P>
Shifting the media's source of revenue away from advertisers and directly toward consumers changes the media's focus from pleasing advertisers to pleasing consumers.  PBS operates this way, but the idea probably won't spread across the board to commercial media.  We're too far down the road and we're too comfortable with what we've got.  We think it's harmless, we think it's not affecting our lives.  Why take the trouble?
<P>
Some people tell me I'm crazy to try to stir up interest in the media to begin changing this situation.  "It would take 50 years," they say, "to educate and stimulate the public to think deeply about these issues, especially after all the media conditioning up to now."
<P>
Not being an optimist but certainly a believer in "beginners mind," I think it's worthwhile to begin looking at what weve got ourselves into with the media, even if we go on enjoying being in media-crity. We are not helpless to change the situation. We are the market. We hold the power.
<P>
This is the first day of the next 50 years.

<H4><IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> <A HREF="http://www.harpers.org/browse/bookshelf.html">  Fools for Scandal: How the Media Invented Whitewater </A> by Gene Lyons. The 1996 re-election of President Clinton is over. Partisan Republican "independent counsel" Kenneth Starr lunched with one of the Republican Federal judges who appointed him and proceeded to spend $30 million bucks to turn up absolutely nothing on the President. Even Sen. Alfonse D'Amato announced he was chastened by the public backlash at his incessant Whitewater hearings. But Whitewater goes on and on. Undeterred, Mr. Starr is blithely doing the unheard of by appearing around the country in various public forums promoting dark allegations while taking no questions--but getting a few tough ones from James Carville. Susan McDougal is doing extra time in a Texas prison for refusing to appear before Starr's grand jury and being called a perjurer for telling the truth (see <a href="susan.htm"> Susan Speaks</A> below). This entire witch-hunt is something we expect in China or Iran, not the U.S.A.
<P>
"Fools for Scandal" is a riveting report on the scandal-mongering of "above-the-fold" Whitewater journalism, especially how the <I>New York Times</I> got the story wrong from the start. Includes a journalists' roundtable that will knock your socks off. This is an important book about Whitewater and an even more important book about the media.

told by veteran journalist John Hofsess</H3>
</CENTER></font color="#0000ff">
<PRE>  </PRE>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size=5>H</font size=5>ere's a brief excerpt that, for the special interests of The Real News Page, captures the essence of one of the primary problems of media. You can substitute other issues in place of "the right to die": the effect is the same. Deborah Lipstadt, writing in the prologue to her masterful work <I>Denying the Holocaust,</I> makes an argument similar to the point made here, that an artificial standard of "fairness" in news reporting can bring to massive public view unenlightened ideas that hardly deserve to see the light of day, while ideas that demand our attention are trivialized. It's a moral dilemma, yet the media are morally unaccountable. --JWP, Editor, TRNP</font color="#ff0000">
 
<PRE>    </PRE>
<P>>> <font size=5>M</font size=5>ost coverage of "right to die" stories is appalling not because of editorial bias but because of the
mediocrity of the profession. Many journalists use the "ping-pong" technique of composition: one
quick and often garbled quote from a "right to die" spokesperson immediately followed by "reaction"
from a "pro-life" source. 
<P>
This usually results in trivializing what the first individual has to say--and it leads to the promotion of
"pro-life" groups far beyond their statistical constituency within the population as a whole. Journalists
do not use the same technique applied to other topics and groups: in politics, for example, coverage
often seems to be based upon standing in the House of Commons. But with euthanasia stories, it
seems to be a given that there are "two sides" and that each must be given equal time and space,
even if one of these "two sides" represents only about 17% of the population. It is due more to
intellectual laziness than dedication to "editorial balance" that most euthanasia stories are told in this
polarized manner. If conflict is the essence of drama--then manufactured conflict is the essence of
dramatic journalism. 
<P>
The media do more than create a false impression through such editorial policies: they also help to
create and/or reinforce the "pro-life" groups themselves, many of which would not even exist were it
not for the attention which the media pay to them. One of the absurdities of Canadian journalism
during the past few years is seeing the number of times someone like Cheryl Eckstein
(self-proclaimed head of the "Compassionate Healthcare Network" in Surrey, BC) gets quoted in
articles simply because she has become known as being an "anti-euthanasist." Apparently once you
become known as such, lazy journalists keep calling you for a quote, and pretty soon you become a
permanent fixture in the media's manufacture of "controversy". The general public is mislead and
misinformed by media intent upon presenting staged "conflict" as news-entertainment. 
<P>
This archive is dedicated to creating a public record of how the mass media treats "right to
die" stories and issues. It is the only such archive on the Internet. <<

<font size=5>I</font size=5>f Martin Luther King were to reappear by my side today and give us a report card on the last 25 years, what would he say?  "You did a good job," he would say, "voting for and electing people who formerly were not electable because of the color of their skin." He would say, "You have more political power and that is good.  You did a good job," he would say, "letting people who have the ability to do so live wherever they want to live, go wherever they want to go in this great country." He would say, "You did a good job elevating people of color up the ranks of the US armed forces to the very top and into top levels of the US government.  You did a good job," he would say, "creating a black middle class of people who are really doing well.  You did a good job opening up opportunity."
<P>
"But," he would say, "I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed.  I did not live and die to see 13-year-old boys get automatic weapons and gun down 9-year-olds just for the kick of it.  I did not live and die to see people destroy their own lives with drugs and build drug fortunes destroying the lives of others.  That is not what I came here to do.  I fought for freedom," he would say, "but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandon, not for the freedom of children to impregnate each other with babies and then abandon them, nor for the freedom of adult fathers of children to walk away from the children they created and abandon them, as if they didn't amount to anything." 
<P>
He would say, "This is not what I lived and died for.  I fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people.  I did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people on a daily basis."
<P>
The other day, the mayor of Baltimore, a dear friend of mine, told me a story of visiting the family of an 18-year-old young man who had been killed on Halloween.  He had a bunch of little kids along with him.  He always went out with the little-bitty ones so they could trick or treat safely.  And across the street from where they were walking on Halloween, a 14-year-old boy gave a 13-year-old boy a gun and dared him to shoot the 18-year-old my friend was walking with--and he shot him dead.
<P>
Elsewhere, right here in Washington DC--the symbol of freedom throughout the world--look at how that freedom is being exercised.  The <I>Washington Post</I> had a story about an 11-year-old child planning her own funeral.  "These are the hymns I want sung.  This is the dress I want to wear in my coffin.  I know I'm not going to live very long." 
<P>
That is not freedom--the freedom to die before you're a teenager is not what Martin Luther King lived and died for.  If you had told anybody who was here in this church--where Martin Luther King gave his last speech before he was assassinated--that we would have abused our freedom this way, they would have found it hard to believe.  
<P>
And I tell you it is our moral duty to turn this around.
<P>
There are changes we can make from the outside in--those are the job of the President of the United States and the Congress and the governors and state legislators and mayors, raising standards, community policing.  And there is something each of us here can do--from the inside out--and in the spirit of my faith I count myself as one of you to turn this thing around from the inside out as well as the outside in.  Otherwise the outside changes won't matter.  
<P>
Sometimes, there are no answers from the outside in.  Sometimes, the answers have to come from the values and the love and the stirrings and the voices that speak to us from within.  
<P>
Here, you as the respected leaders and ministers of your faith, play a crucial role.
<P>
From the outside, we're doing our best, but I do not believe we can repair the basic fabric of society until people who are willing to work <I>have</I> work.  Work organizes life.  It gives structure and discipline to life.  It gives meaning and self-esteem to people who are parents.  It gives a role model to children.... We cannot repair the American community and restore the American family until we have the structure, the values, the discipline, and the reward that work gives us....
<P>
... We have to make a partnership--all the government agencies, all the business folks.  But where there are no families, where there is no order, where we have lost jobs because we had to reduce the size of the armed forces after the end of the cold war, who will be there to give structure, role-modeling, discipline, love, and hope to these children? 
<P>
You must do that and we will help you.
<P>
The Scripture says, "You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world," that "if your light shines before men, they will give glory to the Father in Heaven." That is what we must do.  That is what we must do.  And I will work with you.

<I>Editors Note:</I> In an unusual comment, <I>New York Times</I> reporter Douglas Jehl wrote this about President Clinton's remarks:
<P>
"In Memphis today President Clinton broke out of the pattern of political speeches, of the expected and the calculated.  He spoke from within himself, responding in emotional terms to the appalling reality of violence in this country today.  The response he got shows that one thing Americans want a President to do is to speak out about wrongs, not always to have a 10-point plan or a graph but to <I>speak.</I> No one person can solve our problems of social decay but this President has made us face them.

Oklahoma City bombing put far-right, militant groups into the spotlight, and the experts thought the public's anger would shut them down. Instead, they're emboldened, and spreading.

    <!-- author & byline -->By  RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer<br>
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is five miles to State Highway 120, 15 miles to the county seat
of Claremont, 50 to the state capital of Concord and 500 to the federal
center of power in Washington.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Inside Ed Brown's two-story wood cabin between the Green and White
mountains, there is a government of one. His.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   A year ago, Brown was known to few around here. His place is up along
Blow-Me-Down Brook. His "No Trespassing" and "No Hunting" signs out front
ward off any motorists or hikers who happen by.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   But in the last year, the veil has lifted from around Brown's
reclusive life. His telephone now rings incessantly, so much that his own
phone bill reaches $700 a month. He has set up an office on the second
floor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Where he once pored over maps and paramilitary manuals, he now writes
anti-government speeches and leads a loose contingent of armed militias
in the backwoods of New England. Like the iron-gray pistol always tucked
tightly in his waistband, Brown has found a brand new sense of security.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   What happened a year ago to change everything was the bombing of the
federal building in Oklahoma City. The devastation in Middle America
turned a national spotlight on the country's militia movement. But a
strange thing took place.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Most law enforcement officials and private experts thought the
public's anger over Oklahoma City would all but shut down the militias
and other far-flung extremist groups.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   But today their numbers have increased, by some counts manifold, both
by new members joining their ranks and others, such as the 53-year-old
Brown, no longer afraid for the world to know their politics.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Among the public at large, the share of Americans expressing sympathy
for the militia movement--a minority, but a substantial one--has not
declined at all since the bombing. A Times Poll conducted just after the
bombing found 13% of Americans said they were at least "somewhat
sympathetic" with "armed citizen militia groups," including 3% saying
they were "very sympathetic." Now, the Times Poll, in a survey conducted
nationwide April 13-16, finds 16% saying they are sympathetic, 3% very
sympathetic--a change that is not statistically significant.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Similarly, the poll a year ago found 20% of Americans saying that the
"activities of the federal government" pose a "major threat" to the
constitutional rights of average citizens. In the current poll, 19% said
that.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Among the hard core of militia supporters, many groups have
reorganized into smaller units in the last year, spreading out in more
states. At the same time, dozens of local militias have coalesced under
the banner of a nationwide umbrella group. They have staged several
regional training sessions around the country in the last year. Pulled
together, they speak in a louder national voice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   To federal law enforcement and private monitors who track their
activities, the phenomenon has been a bewilderment that raises new alarms
over how far the movement will grow. Could the groundswell loosely called
the patriot movement be evolving into a significant part of the national
mind-set?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   "It's just becoming almost monumental. The numbers are quite
staggering," said Gerald A. Carroll, an adjunct professor at the
University of Iowa who has studied society's fringe element for the last
two decades. "Who'd have thought they'd still be increasing like this
after Oklahoma City?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   "But they're like a rattlesnake. If you step on a rattlesnake, it
shakes its coil and raises up to strike you."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mood of Disdain
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   The trend is seen as an odd reflection of the political mood across
the country that still holds federal authority in disdain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Most people do not embrace the radical theories put forth by the
hard-core militias about the coming one-world government. And they
deplore the attack against the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in
Oklahoma City, allegedly carried out by two defendants who had militia
sympathies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   But in many regions, public sentiment remains tolerant or even
sympathetic to the idea of bucking the powerful government role in
American life. Over the last year, this has helped to insulate the
militias from blame associated with the terrorist strike, while the
exposure they have received from the incident has only helped them
thrive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   "Unfortunately, they've literally been able to get their paranoid,
hateful message out to the world through this tragedy in Oklahoma," said
Danny Welch, director of Klanwatch in the Deep South organization.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Rather than being scorned, militia members have found a ready forum
for their views. The major blows in stature to their longtime nemeses,
the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and other federal
law enforcement agencies have emboldened them further. The current
standoff in Montana between fugitive "freemen" holed up on a ranch and
FBI agents wary of going in after them has done nothing to detract from
the image of strength.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   "We may not see shooting," says Carroll, musing about what the future
holds for the movements, but the militia may leave a lasting mark.
"Ultimately, we're going to see some major changes in our banking laws
and our tax code and other issues that the movement wants to make over."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   At least for now, the militias are clearly on a roll.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Even in Oklahoma, the state traumatized by the bombing last April,
militia groups are more vibrant, perhaps buoyed by a segment of public
opinion that shares their belief that the government had some role in the
blast.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   In New Hampshire, Ed Brown recently sat back in his chair next to the
wood stove, chain-smoking Ultra Light 100s, boasting about the movement's
successes and warning all the louder that change ("war," he calls it) is
coming.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   "Oh, boy, Oklahoma City," he said. "Oklahoma City brought us around. A
lot has been going on in the last year. Oh, boy, a lot. People are
becoming much more comfortable with us."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Selling of the Militias
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Elsewhere, others are touting their new clout:
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   * Extremist leader John Trochmann was the keynote speaker at a
Preparedness Expo last month in Las Vegas, one of countless conferences
he has appeared at in the last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   A top official of the Militia of Montana, the bearded, fiery-eyed
Trochmann emerged as the guru of the telegenic far-right after his debut
before a Senate panel convened in the wake of the bombing in Oklahoma
City. Now he drives the talk-show circuit. (He never flies; he said he
can't get his guns past the airport metal detectors.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   "Attendance is up," he declared in an interview in Las Vegas,
surveying the several hundred-person audience that was about to hear his
30-minute spiel in which he sells his books and videos.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   "We're having more meetings. I'm going to California for four days of
meetings soon. I'm on the road 40% of the time now. People want their
country back."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   * In West Los Angeles, Bob Fletcher has moved into a second-story
suite of rooms on Pico Boulevard. A former Trochmann associate in
Montana, he too gained fame as a witness at the Senate hearings and is
now putting together his own mass-market videos and radio spots, also
looking to cash in on the growing interest in the cause.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   His first five videos will deal with such anti-government topics as
CIA mind-control and new federal law enforcement weapons. "And I mean
weapons being planned to shoot us down," he said. Before the bombing, the
best gig he could get was the "Donahue" show.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   "I do special engagements now," he said. "I sell my video tapes. I've
eliminated all my debts."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   * Down the coast in Del Mar, Charlene Alden and Terry Sanders are
enthusiastic about a "Constitutionalists March" on Washington they are
planning for this summer, much like the "Million Man March" last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   They are veteran crusaders against big government, the tax code and
America's court system. "I've been in this for 25 years," Alden said. "I
felt back then I was like a voice crying on an island. Today I realize
that the American people know something is wrong and that the tide is
changing."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   * John Harrell runs a paint horse ranch in Eufaula, Okla. But his real
passion is spreading the word against government abuse, something he
finds comfortable doing even though he lives in the same state where 168
people died and 600 were injured in the federal building bombing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   He calls Atty. Gen. Janet Reno "the head killer." He asks: "Who do you
think pulled the trigger down in Waco?" He said he has helped organize 40
militia members to prepare for the people's final armed showdown with the
government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   "There's plenty of us," he said. "And there are more that are getting
smarter every day."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Views Vary
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   How many there truly are is difficult to gauge. The groups are
diverse. Some espouse racial hatred, while others want power returned to
the local sheriffs. Others call for taking up arms against a global
United Nations-controlled world they fear is forming.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   According to Klanwatch and the Coalition for Human Dignity, a
monitoring group in the Northwest, there are 25,000 hard-core white
supremacists in the United States. Another 150,000 active sympathizers
purchase literature and attend extremist group meetings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Militia leaders and other extremists say their numbers have multiplied
seven times over since the bombing, April 19, 1995. Some claim they are a
force of 250,000.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Regardless, they are more open, vocal and confident of their mission
than before.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Before the bombing, the militia phenomenon was slowly creeping into
the national mind-set.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Morris Dees, chief trial counsel for the Southern Poverty Law Center
and its Militia Task Force, has had success tracking hatemongers. Six
months before the bombing, he wrote Reno in Washington, warning her about
the "growing danger posed by the unauthorized militias that have recently
sprung up in at least 18 states."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   But two months after the bombing, according to the Anti-Defamation
League, which also monitors hate groups, militias alone--not counting the
other anti-government groups--were active in 40 states. Membership had
climbed to about 15,000.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   In a report last week, Dees' group identified 441 militias, double the
number it saw a year ago.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   In California, the ADL said, "more than 30 militias are presently
operating, apparently having benefited from the large amount of publicity
the movement has received in recent weeks" since the bombing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Federal law enforcement officials refuse to discuss the militias now,
at least not while the freemen standoff remains volatile in Montana.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   But a week before the bombing, the Dallas FBI office sent out a wire
advisory to its Texas offices, advising agents that they "may wish to
consider utilizing tactical resources" when dealing with militias. The
wire also noted that the bureau had "corroborated" that "law enforcement
officers are also involved with militia groups."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Immediately after the bombing, many of the far-right groups seized on
their sudden notoriety.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   On April 21, 1995, the day Timothy J. McVeigh and Terry L. Nichols
were taken into federal custody in the bombing, 600 people attended a
Christian fundamentalist meeting in the nearby Missouri Ozarks. David
Barley of the America's Promise Ministry in Idaho was already calling the
explosion the work of the government. "They say we are a bunch of white
supremacists," he told the crowd. "You bet we are."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   Many others have become equally brazen in their rhetoric. Much of it
is slanderous, hateful and fanciful.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   With Oklahoma City their bully pulpit, this is what they foretell:
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   JOHN PARSONS of Burke, S.D., head of the Tri-States Militia
fraternity:
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   "Here's our threat--that if there is a move to do away with our
Constitution and Bill of Rights, or to move us into some fuzzy global
world under the United Nations, we're going to fight and die with guns,
bullets and tanks and whatever we can get our hands on."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   CLAY DOUGLAS of Tijeras, N.M., publisher of "Free American," a
conservative newspaper with a wide national distribution:
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   "Anyone with any intelligence had to realize the government was
involved in Oklahoma City. When I saw it on television, I turned to my
wife and said I would no longer allow something like this to happen
again."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   ED BROWN, Plainfield, N.H.: "Nobody in America is going to dump on us.
Not you. We're going to dump on you. We're going to crush you and we're
not going to let you take our country."

Access to cheap Internet communication allows hate groups to organize and spread their ideas. Says Don Black, ex-Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan and owner of
the white supremacist home page <A HREF="http://www.stormfront.org/"> Stormfront</A>, "[On the Internet] the access is anonymous and there is unlimited ability to communicate with others of a like mind." <A HREF="http://hatewatch.org/">Hate Watch</A> excerpts segments of their actual language. It's a riveting education. And where is any of this covered in the popular print and broadcast news media? Why do we have to wait until a bomb explodes to find out how these folks think?

<PRE>   </PRE>
<font size=5>A</font size=5> professional newsman since 1941, Ben Bagdikian, the dean of American media
     critics and the former dean of Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism, is one of the most respected figures in American journalism. In 1983 Bagdikian published <I>Media Monopoly</I> which revealed the fast-moving media conglomeration that was putting more and more media corporations in fewer and fewer hands with each new merger. This work has been updated through several editions (through 1992) and is considered a crucial resource for knowledge about media ownership.

<PRE>   </PRE>
EXCERPTS FROM INTERVIEW:
<P>
     Q: Let me... ask how you became a media critic. 
<P>
     A: In the late 1940s, when I was a reporter for the <I>Providence Journal,</I> the publisher of
     the paper said to me: "Take the four leading news commentators--Drew Pearson,
     Westbrook Pegler, and a couple of others--and do a 15-week study of how accurate
     they are." That would be the equivalent today of examining Rush Limbaugh, Howard
     Stern, and Larry King. So I had these commentators taped and I listened to hours and
     hours of them--and then I tracked down the actual "facts." It was shameful! 
<P>
     Q: How so? 
<P>
     A: They were inaccurate to a degree that was inexcusable. And the inaccuracies
     overwhelmingly favored corporate life-the view of people in business and in higher tax
     brackets. A few years later, the publisher said, "Now take those damn newsmagazine
     and do the same thing." And I found a similar pattern. 
<P>
     Q: But what we hear about today is the "liberal bias" in the news media. 
<P>
     A: I think that's nonsense. That comes from people who feel that only the conservative
     view of the world is legitimate and anything that departs from the conservative view is
     seen as "bias." And the papers don't always report only the world as seen by a narrow
     sector of conservatives; they do see the world from a somewhat broader perspective. 
<P>
     Q: And that's when they get hit with the charge? 
<P>
     A: That's when they're called "liberally biased." And you don't have to stray very far to
     be hit with that charge. Now it's probably true that most journalists are somewhat more
     liberal than the public at large, but not as much as conservatives charge. Also,
     journalists are much more apt to be conscious of the difference between public facade
     and the reality behind that facade-in politics and public life, for example. But they don't
     report on it as much in business they should. 
<P>
     Q: Why not? 
<P>
     A: Because the news media--which is increasingly owned by large corporations--is not
     interested in investigating corporations, unless it's a billion-dollar scandal, which would
     probably be uncovered by a federal agency, not by the news media. 
<P>
     Q: Let's talk about your influential book, <I>Media Monopoly.</I> 
<P>
     A: When the first edition appeared in 1983, I was called an alarmist. But I've been
     appalled each time I've done a new edition because things have gotten much worse. I
     would never have thought they were going to be as bad as they are now. 
<P>
     Q: How have things gotten worse? 
<P>
     A: The power of a few corporations to control a larger reach of the standard, mass
     media continues to grow. In the early 1980s, when I started out on this project, about
     50 companies had most of the business in newspapers, magazines, radio, television,
     movies, and books. And in each edition of <I>Media Monopoly</I>, the number of companies
     has grown smaller and their reach has grown larger. The latest edition--1992--reported
     that 23 companies now control the media. The hard-boiled types on Wall Street are
     saying: "We're going to end up with about six companies in the world that have most of
     the media business." 
<P>
     Q: What would be wrong with that? 
<P>
     A: I think private ministries of information are just as dangerous as public ministries that
     control information. Concentrated media power is political power and it's social power.

His claim of being "naive" was--lo and behold--the core of the plea bargain that allowed Mr. Gingrich not to be charged with actual illegality. 
<P>
Why do you find this <A HREF="gingeth1.htm">sub-site</A> on TRNP? Because much detailed information on the Gingrich ethics matter is not trickling down to (or is not being picked up by) local newspapers and TV news. Instead, we're getting breathless spinning from Gingrich supporters on Sunday news shows and a lot of "twinning" of the Gingrich and Clinton "scandals" which robs us of a thorough examination of either. In the Gingrich case, the fact that average citizens lack the <A HREF="ethics.htm">full Ethics Panel Report,</A> for example, at a point in time when we could be writing informed letters to Congress, is a problem of democracy. <A HREF="gingeth1.htm">Take a look,</A> see what you think, and write to the House Ethics Committee, like <I> to-day</I> <BR>(their <A HREF="gingeth5.htm">names and addresses</A> are here, too).

Great quote from Salon's article by Mark Shapiro: "[In addition to reporters taking speaking fees] the real compromises lie deeper--in corporate sponsorship that defines the very parameters of what is considered acceptable discourse. Take the pundit talk shows, where a parade of center-to-right-wing talking heads appear each week to engage in what passes as political debate. From "This Week with David Brinkley" to "The McLaughlin Group," two corporate sponsors predominate: General Electric and Archer Daniels Midland, two of the biggest corporate recipients of subsidies, tax breaks and government contracts in the country."

<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> <A HREF="http://hatewatch.org/"> HATE WATCH:</A>  Here's a telling sample from one of dozens of sites collected by Hate Watch: "You must no longer believe the lies from the Jewish media! We shall make our own media here on the Internet!" Notice the specific articulation of what is merely under the breath of some average Americans who castigate what they call the "liberal media" (liberals and Jews are tightly associated among hate groups and even some mainstream citizens)--the old anti-Semitic hoax that Jews supposedly control the media (along with banking and government) as a means of "controlling the world." In case you think this is peripheral stuff, this paranoid idea is the premise of Timothy McVeigh's favorite book "The Turner Diaries." 
<P>
On the other hand, they have a point about media being a serious problem, but it's not for the reasons they like to believe.

Access to cheap Internet communication allows hate groups to organize and spread their ideas. Says Don Black, ex-Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan and owner of
the white supremacist home page <A HREF="http://www.stormfront.org/"> Stormfront</A>, "[On the Internet] the access is anonymous and there is unlimited ability to communicate with others of a like mind." <A HREF="http://hatewatch.org/">Hate Watch</A> excerpts segments of their actual language. It's a riveting education. And where is any of this covered in the popular print and broadcast news media? Why do we have to wait until a bomb explodes to find out how these folks think?

<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> <A HREF="corpangr.htm"> Study Shows Rising Public Anger at Corporations:</A> Extrapolating from this poll study, 68% of Americans believe big corporations are as responsible as, or more responsible than, government for the economic problems of the middle class.  Even among Republicans, a majority 55% say corporations are at least as big a problem as government. This is an important reversal of political ideas that have dominated America for 15 years. The study reminds us of a worrisome fact: that the "Gingrich Revolution's" focus on "government" has distracted the media from a focus on corporations and "corporate culture." The media are themselves corporations which makes reporting on corporations doubly difficult. For example, have you seen this study  on TV news or in your newspaper?

 <font size=5>E</font size=5>laine De Beauport is one of the foremost educators in the world. She studied at Smith and Georgetown, and received her Ed.D. from Farleigh
 Dickinson. She has taught every age from preschool through graduate school; this great range is
 represented in her thinking and writing. She founded the innovative Mead School for Human
 Development in Greenwich, CT, K through 9. 
 Of more than 260 alternative schools founded in the 60's and 70's, Mead is one of four to
 have survived. 
<P>
While she was director of the Mead School, she became interested in the emerging scientific
 work on how the right and left hemispheres of the brain give rise to different modes of learning. With
 further study, she became aware that there was more to the brain than the left and right
 hemispheres, that it was full of structures--an extraordinary complex of systems--and she reasoned
 these systems must have profound effects on the way humans learn and the way they behave. 
<P>
 She encountered the work of Dr. Paul MacLean, Chief of the Laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior at the National
 Institutes of Health. He had been researching and writing in technical journals on what he called the
 "triune" structure of the brain. But MacLean believed his work provided insight into social and
 psychological problems in humans, and should not be left in the laboratory or limited to specialists. He reached
 out to the public in a famous lecture, "A Meeting of Minds," given at an educators' convention in the late 1970's. 
<P>
 MacLean said there are essentially three brains, each of which developed during a particular stage
 of evolutionary history. The earlier part of the brain, found in reptiles, could be called the reptilian
 brain, or R-complex. In mammals another structure appeared: the paleomammalian brain, with a
 new range of particularly mammalian behavior--care of the young, affection, mutual grooming, etc. This is the home of the limbic system and the capacity for feeling and emotion, for the sense of smell and sexuality. With the
 development of human beings came the most recent evolutionary structure, the neomammalian
 brain--with a hugely expanded neocortex in the prefrontal lobes. The neomammalian or "thinking" brain brought with it the capacity
 for language, visualization, and symbolic skills unique to human beings. 
<P>
But evolution is economical,
 it didn't cast off the reptilian brain structure. It <I>added</I> the two more recent brains in layers one on top of the other. They are all intact in their evolutionary forms and functions. 
<P>
Although many problems arise because of
 a lack of coordination between what were originally three different brain systems, MacLean
 stressed that these structures are not separate, but rather are three systems integrated into one--hence, "triune." 
<P>
 MacLean argued that all the old structures are active in determining behavior, and that from these
 different-but-connected brains come not only different behaviors, but also many of the problems
 human beings face every day. 
<P>
Human behavior is similar to behavior observed in
 animals because it arises from those parts of the brain system, like the reptilian brain, that humans
 and animals share. Human beings share primal patterns of behavior with other animals, just as they
 share those brain structures. MacLean provided a list of behaviors. Among his examples, #1 is
 selection and preparation of home site, #2 is establishment of territory, #6 is patrolling the territory.
<P>
 Understanding that these tendencies exist helps to explain seemingly irrational behavior, such as
 teenage territorial violence, that otherwise seems to make no sense. If one understands that the brain contains
 these older structures, Dr. De Beauport would say, you have a better chance of recognizing and dealing
 with them. 
<P>
 <font size=5>S</font size=5>o, what Elaine and many others see is that while the older parts of the brain are necessary (they
 provide the drive for life and survival), they are not often integrated properly with the other brain
 structures. In Elaine's view, MacLean's physiological model of the brain has provided at least part of a
 psychological model or metaphor by which we can better understand our behavior. 
<P>
 The practicality of Dr. De Beauport's work was demonstrated when it was incorporated as "Self Care" into the standard orientation program for nurses under enormous stress at busy Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City. 
<P>
Elaine has lived in Caracas for the last several years. Her first book appeared in 1995 in Spanish, and an English-language version of <I>The Three Faces of the Mind</I> will be published by Quest Books in December 1996. She teaches frequent workshops throughout the US and in Venezuela. Contact info is found below.

<I> INTERVIEW:</I>
<P>
 SW: When you founded the Mead School you began with a focus on working with children, but
 then you shifted to adults, why? 
<P>
 ED: Well, there is a really profound philosophy behind that. We did some extraordinary
 things at Mead School in terms of expanding learning capacities and extending consciousness, but
 we noticed that our struggle was always with the parents.... The child wanted to be loved by the
 parents and please the parents. It became very evident that the limiting horizon was in the
 adult's mind, because anything we did with the child's mind was limited by what the
 parents would be able to grasp or appreciate and encourage -- all of the above. 
<P>
So I like to say the
 future of the world is not in changing the children, the future of the world is in changing the adult
 mind. 
<P>
 SW: So at the same time you began presenting workshops, you were also going into MacLean's work more deeply. What happened? 
<P>
 ED: If we have these other two brain structures inside us as MacLean suggests, the educational
 game is about how you get in there. And even in terms of psychology, it would be much more
 dynamic to understand and communicate with the limbic (emotional, feeling) part of the brain as a learning structure. It
 offers a perspective that is much larger; it isn't just about your relationship with your mother and
 father you have to get a grip on. It is really about developing your emotional quality of life. That is
 what interests me--that people can be educated to know they have an emotional brain and know they have a
 behavioral (reptilian) brain that reacts and interacts and forms patterns. 
<P>
 SW: So whatever your upbringing, your family life, the background in which you are set, being
 human entails particular physiological structures as well as particular psychological problems? 
<P>
 ED:  Let me put it this way: You know that you have a
 hand, you learn how you use your hand. Parents know you have a mind, so they send you to school. So
 you say, "Oh boy, I have a mind!" but they don't tell you about the two other important parts of the mind, the older brain structures.
 You have a limbic brain structure and a basic reptilian brain structure. These have to go to school too.
<P> 
I think the most original thing I did was to see the brain as energy. I
 think this is still the most important thing I am doing. All matter is energy. You and I are energy. Then
 I suppose you could say energy formed itself into a hand, an eye and nose and the three different
 brain systems. Once you see the brain is really
 energy, then you can propose processes and those processes can go from the thick and very
 evident, to the thin which can be invisible. Then I proposed ten different intelligences, each of which behaves in its own way and each of which can be educated. That's what is set forth in the new book. 
<P>
 SW: Your work struck me as very original. What
 convinced you to work in this way? 
<P>
 ED: I worked with individuals two or three years old for many years, then with individuals all the way through graduate
 school. When you do this, the dominating question becomes: how do people learn? I was also interested in violence and peace and this also drew me toward my current work.
<P>
 SW: How does the physiology of the brain help you do your work? 
<P>
 ED: Just about everything in life becomes different when you view it through the three different
 structures. On the first basic level, if you take MacLean's model
 of the brain stem and add the spinal column you get what could better be called the nervous system
 brain. "Reptile" just doesn't convey its significance. It permits me to look at the patterns of my own life in a more neutral way,
 with a kind of curiosity, to see this particular pattern of energy in the way this intelligence works in the oldest brain. 
<P>
The three-brain model gives me a freedom... Knowing that there are three brain systems can eventually be the healing of guilt itself. 
<P>
Another value is that it enables us to look at emotions without analyzing them. It's so tremendous: you see
 emotions as energy, then you can enter the emotional energy without thinking you have to act on
 them or thinking you have to think about them; you just feel your feelings. Then you can get in touch with
 the symphony or jazz inside you. To free yourself from analyzing your emotions or... yourself.
<P>
I
 don't know if I can get across how tremendous that is. To have the freedom to live your inner being
 without having to act it out, or analyze it, or intervene in it. I think this is the excitement...that
 emotions are really an energy scale from the subtlest and quietest to the most exuberant. I believe that's the only answer to violence. Because there is violence in all of us. It's
 impacted energy that's in there. This triune view allows us to access that impacted energy so that it doesn't have to express itself violently.
<P>
These three brains are multiple systems of complex chemistry and all of us have the chemistry that makes us
 hot. All of us get our power checked. For example, I want more cider, but there isn't any. Well, that
 frustrates me. The basic reptilian brain is our "power brain" really and when it gets checked, it gets frustrated. And it happens
 as soon as we get up in the morning. It gets frustrated. If you don't know you have a history of
 frustration, then you just level off at somebody, and then physically try to solve it. Well, I'll just get
 rid of you, I'll get you out of my way. Knowing that we've got three separate brain
 structures is going to let us look and say that intensity is part and parcel of the chemistry of the
 brain and we have ways to channel and educate it. 
<P>
 SW: What do most people want to get from your book? 
<P>
 ED: That they don't ever have to use the word "unconscious" again, that there are six ways into what
 they are now calling the unconscious, if they can learn them. That's the most important thing I want
 to communicate. They can also learn from the other intelligences that they can 
 develop their own intuitional ability. To never live their life again based on one intelligence. You can
 never be happy based on only one intelligence. 
<P>
 SW: There seems to be such chaos, political and cultural, in the US, if not over the world. 
<P>
 ED: It's all over the world. My perception is that the world is falling in on itself. The world is being
 drawn together in all senses: visually, economically, culturally drawn in, and in that falling in on itself
 there is hurt, violence, refusal and resistance. "Yes, a little of this, no, none of that." It's a very
 powerful time, everyone trying to protect themselves, and yet not being able to really get away from
 being in the process. 
<P>
 SW: But yet, you're optimistic. 
<P>
 ED: Oh yes, yes. There are ten pathways out of this--ten different intelligences we can develop. The kinks are coming from the human mind--which happens to emanate from three brain systems, not just one. These three brains can be educated, although only one half of one, the left hemisphere of the neocortex, is now being educated. Hence we see something like the left brain's specialty of technology going haywire. My work is toward a much fuller education of <I>all</I> our intelligences."
<P>
 In the last chapter of my book I do two things: I focus on social philosophy and individual action.
 The section on social philosophy talks about what religion, government and education have to do. I
 think the most important thing religion has to do is to allow its values to be updated. Because of its
 tremendous impact, democracy has got to change. It's a talking brain, and now the talk can be seen
 on TV, and so the lack of action is very obvious. In terms of the three-brain system, there is a
 tremendous amount we have to say to government, particularly to democracy. 
<P>
Living in Venezuela,
 one sees the impact the passionate limbic brain can have on democracy, with its long time pattern of
 dictatorship. In education, until every school system has a multiple intelligence center, a
 how-do-people-learn center, I don't think education will change. 

<P>
 SW: What are you going to do next? Your book <I>Three Faces of the Mind</I> will come out in December 1996, what then? 
<P>
 ED:  The book is an
 introduction to the adult curriculum I've been working towards since I left the Mead School. What
 I'm playing with in my mind is that I've seen a way of creating an adult school on a "new school"
 model, to take the curriculum and set it out in a Club Mind format, instead of a Club Med. A place
 people would come for an extended experiential learning vacation. A place where there is mastery, rather than just a little of
 this, a little of that. You'd know there was something more involved. That's what has me going
 now.

DIARY <BR>
APRIL 1995:<BR></CENTER>
<P>

<font size=7>A</font size=7>FTER OKLAHOMA CITY, America was brought into the Emergency Room, bleeding from an accident of intellect.  She had been in the ER waiting room several times before, leaving in a huff when there was no care available.



<P>
Searching for more information on the mind-set of the "patriot" movement, I went to the library where I found an old book written in 1987, <I>Armed and Dangerous: The Rise of the Survivalist Right</I> by James Coates.
<P>
Nearly a decade ago, Coates and several other researchers, including Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center, had already laid out the multiple connections that run through what had appeared to be isolated little extremist entities here and there along the survivalist frontier.  But these bands are anything but "isolated." And, in many instances, the beliefs and aims of militias and religious sects are not separated but mixed together.  One group, the Christian-Patriots Defense League, uses a hyphen to indicate that its members can be practicing Identity Christians or just secular patriots, or both.
<P>
While we were missing this chunk of consequential history, the connections have grown thicker.  An atmospheric pressure of fear and hate has been rising fast since James Coates' book went out of print for lack of interest.
<P>
I use the word "frontier" instead of "right" because the left has its history of terrorism, too, and because recent events transcend left and right.  The "last-stand" mind-set is just as common to the Unabomber and the Aum sect as it is to militia/survivalist/racist/religious sects in the U.S. The Unabomber doesn't appear to harbor religious fervency.  But among many other extreme groups, hate is cloaked in "religion" which transcends partisan labels and gives militancy and racism an appearance of righteousness.
<P>
The apocalypse is a big pull.  Where apocalypse has not yet occurred, it is hurried along in cataclysmic firestorms like Waco.  Apocalypse always seems imminent.  "The End Time of the last battle of Armageddon is near.  Be ready." The flyers of the Survivalist guru John Trochmann warn his militiamen to "GET READY!" He uses all caps. This imminence is one big pull to violent action that characterizes today's extreme frontier.
<P>
I use "frontier" to mean the mental edge along which ideas fly freely and are invented freely to suit the paranoid creation of a safe place to be--intellectually--to survive in the wilderness of a wild and threatened mind.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ready.gif"> </CENTER>
<BR><I>Note featured speaker: Buchanan's campaign adviser Larry Pratt in top left photo.</I>
_________________________________________________________________
<P>
We don't have to be living on the open range with tumbleweeds blowing across the yard.  We are all on a frontier of some sort, feeling defeated by large institutions like corporations and government.  In uncharted territory, we no longer know who are enemies and who are friends.
<P>
Not knowing, we tend to assume the worst.  We construct stories (conspiracy theories) to explain the innate sense of a sinister outlook, as if to say, "See: Here's the way it works.  Here's what happens.  Here's the plot." But, really, the stories and theories are merely extravagant ways of calming our fears with meaning.  An intensely believed story--"belief"--can also explain (if not instigate) cold-blooded murder, as we saw in Paul Hills defense of "justifiable homicide" when he slaughtered a doctor who had performed abortions.
<P>
Glorious tales of final battles--which we <I>win</I>--are a natural part of survival.  They pull us along on an imperative hope from day to day through the hopeless drudgery of life: the hope of ultimate triumph.  Such tales always have a couple of evil-enemy characters who are to blame for everything. Hitler and Goebbles were masters at this game.
<P>
For several years, the survivalist cult-favorite <I>Turner Diaries</I> have been telling the archetypal story of a battle against "evil government," culminating in the bombing of a large federal building.  A self-fulfilling prophesy?

<font size=7>A</font size=7>S I WRITE THIS, I refer to groups of people who use the word "they" incessantly, yet I must use "they" myself to describe <I>them.</I> In the absence of reported facts, a reverberating "Paranoia Americana" is developing--in myself and in the nation--partly as a result of the dominance of intuition over logic, partly as a result of false logic in the little logic we do.
<P>
Beyond the reach (beyond even the curiosity) of media (and cartoonized by partisans), an unexamined literature of convenient scapegoats and conspiracy theories (theirs and mine) gives meaning where meaning has been lost, bled away, or never born.
<P>
We and they--we're all getting paranoid trying to make sense of whats happening "to" us, be it personal economic or social failure and cultural disintegration, be it the explosion of the Murrah Building.  We're all looking for someone to blame for the loss or the trashing or the blowing up of something we held precious.
<P>
Dear Diary, I propose a deal: I will try to examine <I>my</I> paranoid frontier while I seek to examine <I>their</I> paranoid frontier.

MAY 1995:
<P>
<font size=7>W</font size=7>ACO WAS BADLY MISHANDLED by authorities who didn't understand the apocalyptic mentality.  Thus far, based on the arson investigation and analysis of films, it appears the final fires were set by the Branch Davidians themselves.
<P>
In the aftermath of Waco we became aware of an apocalyptic sect so devoted to their leader that they would willingly die for him and allow their children to die in a fiery conflagration foretold to be their moment of rising to God.  Several years before, we had seen 800 Jim Jones followers, when confronted by law enforcement, do essentially the same thing by ingesting toxic Kool-Aid.
<P>
The popular view saw the Jones cult as an isolated case of a charismatic madman.  But no.  The apocalyptic mind is hidden but pervasive and tenacious in its power. Waco was, before OK City, its most recent memorial of martyrdom and meaning.
<P>
<I>The New York Times</I> ran an article on May 25, 1995 about Timothy McVeigh's possible contact with Robert G. Millar's "Identity Christian" compound in Elohim City, Oklahoma.  The group was described as "an isolated sect" in a "remote pocket," a "homespun village" in an "out of the way place." Not reported was the fact that these bands are today more and more interconnected and inter-supportive. [See my letter to the <I>New York Times</I> and Associated Press <A HREF="elohim.htm"> "What's Going on At Elohim City"</A>].
<P>
Dozens of weird Weaver-style stand-offs strike our screens and news pages like haphazard bird-shot.  But where has the media examined the history, the interweave, the tapestry of thinking behind all these disparate events?  Tid-bit references can be caught by those who watch news reports like hawks.  But for the average American depending on average mainstream news, the <I>whole</I> story has not yet been outlined and given attention in depth.  Reporters have treated each episode and each sect uniquely and separately, as if there were no fabric of connection among them.  The shocker is how spiritually connected they <I>are.</I>
<P>
Among anti-government groups, Waco became the martyring ground for anyone who wished to believe a U.S. government conspiracy of evil was at large to quell individual rights.
<P>
After Waco, the research and intelligence were there but popular media did not report on the potent religious, political and symbolic effects that Waco was having on the radical survivalist frontier.
<P>
Then, boom!  The bombing of the Federal building allegedly by, among others, a young former Army sergeant who chose April 19--the anniversary of Waco--to do his deed.  This was ritual-religious behavior.  McVeigh's belief became so strong that he (allegedly) had to memorialize it.
<P>
I want to look at the stories that frame the cause of hate, the beliefs that sanctify and justify the cause, and the rhetoric that carries the cause across a bridge into average American lives.
<PRE>    </PRE>

<font size=7>A</font size=7>LTHOUGH THE "POCKETS" are separated geographically, the air between enclaves is thick with words and ideas.  Initiates and followers can get around easily in their RVs, fully appointed truck cabins and small planes.  They meet in tailgate parties at gun shows, at picnics, retreats, workshops, town meetings, in bars and diners, in family dens, living rooms and kitchens.  They buy weapons, sell weapons, and trade bomb-making techniques (as advertised in the Militia of Montana catalogue).
<P>
Modern technology allows adherents to communicate--<I>to get the story out</I>--not only by telephone, short-wave and broadcast radio, newsletters, cable shows, and faxes, but also on the vast--and morally wide-open--Internet.
<P>
Survivalist/religious sects are loose-knit.  Most observers are seeing them as loose.  Few are noting the knit--the tightly knitted consistency of the message, a scapegoating fantasy that solves all problems. Because they deliberately avoid the appearance of organization, it takes a mildly paranoid imagination to capture what they're up to.
<P>
The survivalist frontiersman has become a credible media image--something close to a hero--because of skillful manipulation of language and image in media.  He relies on being relaxed, leaning on a fence rail with his farm in the background: "I am the brave and independent freedom-loving man who raises my children according to God.  The culture around me is at odds with my values.  The culture impinges on me.  I will fight to the death to defend my way of life and our Holy Constitution." [He pulls a small copy of the Constitution out of his shirt pocket.]  "I will store up weapons and supplies to fight that final fight to the death." Thus, we have law enforcement--even county sheriffs--intimidated into hesitating to serve legal warrants on well-armed ranches and compounds for fear of a bloody shoot-out. [See the Freemen Siege a year after this was written wherein the FBI is being castigated for being too careful and not forceful enough, intimidated by Waco and Ruby Ridge]
<PRE>    </PRE>

<font size=7>N</font size=7>EWS REPORTERS HAVE PLAYED WILLING FOILS to spokesmen on the frontier who are especially adroit at foisting circular arguments.  For example, when Rev. Millar at Elohim City, Oklahoma defended his Identity Christian literature that says Blacks are subhuman, he happily explained to the <I>New York Times</I>, on the contrary, Blacks have "divinely endowed intellectual and physical capabilities that the most sophisticated robot is not able to equal." Last time we looked, robots were subhuman.
<P>
If you missed the word "robot" as you skimmed that sentence, jogged while hanging on a subway strap-handle, you'd think Millar thinks Blacks are magnificent.  Then you realize--with no help from the <I>Times</I>--that when Millar says Blacks are part of "all of God's creation," he means "all animals."
<P>
The most the <I>Times</I> could make of this was to say Millar "did not specifically deny those views." "That should be sufficient answer," he said, and the <I>Times </I>accepted that.  I realize many people, especially reporters, see through Millar's language instantly.  But as a simple matter of fact, as an answer to a reporter's question, it was not sufficient answer.
<P>
Language is most of what's going on in media.  If the "free press" doesn't use its freedom to crack open linguistic tricks and explore the truth beneath them, what is the use of its freedom?  Do we need an Edward R. Murrow to say, "Hey, Mr. Emperor, your language has no clothes"?
<P>
In this case, it's religious code language and there is a great deal underneath it that has been under-reported.  Too bad the <I>Times</I> didn't get what Millar had to say about his belief that Jews are descendants of Satan.  Or maybe it was a blessing. No, it was a curse because we're getting the hatred of Jews under the breath in myriad forms of code language and Millar and his ilk are getting away with verbal murder.
<P>
Millar himself issued the challenge when he said to reporters --apocalyptically--that "in the days to come, much will depend on your faithfulness in reporting what goes on here." On this particular story, the press was less than faithful to the spirit of Murrow.

<font size=7>F</font size=7>ORTIFYING OUR DEFENSES against the gnawing insecurity of prospective pink slips, we tend to blame something outside ourselves.  We used to have the Soviet Union to kick around.  In 1995, having no great foe abroad, some Americans are imagining a "Soviet Union" within America's borders. Newt Gingrich has thoroughly convinced 50% of Americans that America has become a "welfare state"--the standard phrase we used to use to describe the Soviet Union in the 1950's. 
<P>
These citizens are becoming receptive to an old story being retold in a uniquely American style.  The new villain is "government" and the perpetrators of evil are those perceived to be in control of government, media and banking.  So intense is the paranoid dread of this villainous situation that some new militants have armed themselves to the teeth.  At the other end of the spectrum of action, more and more average non-revolutionary middle-class Americans are attracted to these newly regurgitated old ideas and hatreds, walking across rhetorical bridges built by Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson, Newt Gingrich and others who are masters of politically correct hate speech and divisiveness.
<P>
The paranoid mind moves on a legend, on the momentum of an unfolding story.  A picture emerges of an interconnected sequence of actions and character that form a "plot." Thus we have elaborate theories, myths, legends, parables.  Thus we have the popular <I>Turner Diaries</I> whose plot is an apocalyptic Armageddon-style battle waged against the government, ending with the hero's glorious destruction of a Federal building. This was reportedly Tim McVeigh's favorite book which he proselytized like "The Tower" door to door.
<P>
The survivalist/militia/religious frontier is burgeoning now because adherents to various divergent beliefs are <I>telling the same story,</I> and telling it out loud.  It's a big story, a darker story than I ever imagined.  Many old tales, some long repudiated, are coming together into a New Story of a racial holy war of Armageddon.
<P>
Tamer, more secular phrases describing the same dynamic are seeping into average suburban political language and connecting with our well-taken complaints of frustration about "government." Looking about at the disintegration of the culture, the angry white male watering his front lawn coils his hose and vows to restore moral authority.  Belief in a compelling myth or story makes it a lot easier to "take up the arms of the Lord." We are seeing an uprising of the frustrated independent American frontiersman coming directly and indirectly out of a religious-mythic groundswell.
<P>
Fervency in any cause is an irresistible energy.  Those who feel it will work around the clock.  They will not eat or sleep if necessary.  They are on a crusade.  
<P>
I feel it myself in my own causes.

<PRE>    </PRE>

<font size=7>W</font size=7>E ARE BEGINNING TO SEE a meeting of minds--through transmitters like G. Gordon Liddy, Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson, John Trochmann, Helen Chenoweth, Newt Gingrich--between survivalist frontiersmen and law-abiding citizens in rural regions, suburbs, cities and other areas of civilization. The "nicer" they are, the more dangerous--notice John Trochmann is trying to transform himself into a slim version of Santa Claus to create a more attractive "media presence." Look how slick David Duke looks these days in his natty suits--Buchanan is Duke's best friend rhetorically and has done more than anyone to bridge Duke to the civilized world. These figures are transmitting correlative signals that connect with the  ultra-extremist fringe. Crusading for meaning from oppostite ends of civility, they are all bound together gloriously "against government," creating an arc of meaning, a bridge of hate, a fuse. 
<P>
This pre-ignition situation is not unlike 2000 pounds of nitrate fertilizer about to combine with an explosive amount of fuel oil.
<P>
Thanks to Mr. Coates' research, as well as the work of the Anti-Defamation League and Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center who have been watching hate groups and militias for decades, many odd things now make more sense.  Events have more context.  The "story" is unfolding.
<P>
We who have been hate-watchers for decades examine our own paranoia and realize that this is where our fear lies: someone's false belief is gonna kill <I>us.</I>

<font size=7>U</font size=7>NTIL OKLAHOMA CITY, when I began my quest to discover the secrets of the Survivalist mind, I had no idea what were the beliefs of Christian Identity or how deeply they had permeated the Survivalist frontier.  Not until I read James Coates book.
<P>
I had no idea so many groups believe the "Aryan white race" in America is descended from a "13th Tribe of Israel" that had migrated to the British Isles and Nordic countries.  "Identity" means they identify with the British Isles/Nordic racial tribe. They believe they are the "true Jews" while the Jews are actually "the children of Satan" descended from a mongrel tribe.
<P>
I had no idea so many believe the Founding Fathers were holy men because they were directly descended from the leaders of this "l3th Tribe."
<P>
I had no idea they believe the Constitution is a religiously sacred document, as sacred as the Bible, because it was created by the holy Founding Fathers.
<P>
I had no idea that they therefore do not recognize later amendments to the Constitution. This includes, of course, the income-tax amendment. Taxation is associated with "usury" which is associated with Jews.
<P>
I had no idea so many believe the Constitution was written primarily to preserve the white race.
<P>
I had no idea how literally adherents believe in the coming of the Apocalypse and the Battle of Armageddon as described metaphorically in the Book of Revelation.  I had no idea they were storing food, water and enormous stocks of weapons and ammunition to survive such a battle which they believe will be waged against "government."
<P>
I had no idea the depth of their anti-Semitism, even though I intuited (in my own paranoia) that the recent upsurge in Jew-hatred conveniently matched the notion of seeing "evil enemies" in banks who hold our mortgages, in media "poisoning our minds," and in "tax and spend" government. The idea itself of government is seen by Christian Identity adherents as an evil concept that serves "Jewish control."
<P>
I had no idea so many believe in the old conspiracy theory promulgated in the "Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion," a document forged by anti-Semites in czarist Russia which was foisted on the public for political purposes to try to "prove" that Jews were bent on ruling the world by controlling media, banking and government.
<P>
I had no idea modern-day anti-Semitic counterparts to the forgers of the "Protocols" believe that federal and state governments are "full of Jews intent on disparaging and annihilating the white race."
<P>
The Federal Reserve is thought to be a shadow entity of Jewish government to control bank loans.  "Look at Greenspan...," they say.  "He's a Jew, isn't he?  Because he raised interest rates, I'm about to lose my farm.  He's a Jew.  See what I mean?"
<P>
I had no idea the political scapegoating of Jews was currently so prevalent, albeit under a facade of virtually secret language.
<P>
Secret to us--under-reported--but widely known to believers.  Universally across the survivalist frontier, the U.S. government is referred to as "ZOG"--"Zionist Occupational Government."
<P>
The enemy used to be Communists in government.  Now the enemy is Jews in government: ZOG.
<P>
ZOG. Say it a couple of times: ZOG.  Sounds like the Beast in the Book of Revelation.  Sounds huge and ugly.  ZOG... Sounds depressing.  In fact, depressing is exactly what the Zionist Occupational Government is perceived to be doing to white males.  Pulling them down. (Jews, being Semitic, are considered non-white).
<P>
This was one of the creepiest bits of information I stumbled upon, Dear Diary, yet I haven't seen the word "ZOG" mentioned much in popular media coverage of extremist groups in the wake of OK City.  If mentioned at all, the users of the term ZOG are described as eccentric and "isolated." [On April 19, 1996, a full year after OK City, Morris Dees mentioned ZOG and described it at length for the first time in American history on ABC's "Nightline," a full year after bombers of the Murrah Building may have taken their hatred of "ZOG" to the murder of 169 innocent people]
<P>

<CENTER> <IMG SRC="zogsigns.gif"> </CENTER>
<P>
On posters nailed to fences of ranches, ZOG is the term of choice for the enemy known as "government." You would think the concept behind "ZOG" would be hot news to the public at large.  Too hot, maybe.  For some reason, the media is not touching it. [In March 1996, initial CNN video shots of a poster on the gate of the Freemen compound showed the lines "Warning Keep Out." On the bottom were the words "This means you, ZOG!" But later video shots cropped off the bottom of the poster. Why?]

<P>
"Liberal media" may, in some minds--consciously and subconsciously--refer to "Jewish-owned media," linking back to the old Protocols idea that Jews are out to control the world by controlling media, among other things.  It's worth looking into exactly who owns the media, but my sense is that Jews are a minority of owners.  Yes, the highly influential <I>New York Times</I> is owned by a Jewish family and so are a few broadcast outlets.  Disney's Michael Eisner is a Jew. Steven Spielberg is a Jew. However, the publishers of the <I>Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Newsweek,  Time, Washington Times,</I> and the major chains of Gannett and Knight-Ridder are not Jewish.  Most of the major TV and radio outlets are not Jewish owned or controlled.  Correct me if I'm wrong.
<P>
When Newt Gingrich went to a gun club in New Hampshire in June 1995 and talked to "his people," he excoriated "the elite liberal media establishment." Richard Stengel noted in the <I>New Republic</I> (7-3-95) the four words "elite," "liberal," "media," and "establishment" were chosen because focus groups showed these terms have pejorative meanings for voters.  Given the fact that many equate "liberal" with "socialist" or "Red," and some equate communists with Jews; given the fact that the phrase "banking elites" is code language used by Pat Robertson and John Trochmann (Militia of Montana) referring to Jewish bankers; given the paranoia about a Jewish conspiracy to control media, banking and government, no wonder Newt's catch words are loaded. Being the desperate little demagogue he is, no wonder he uses them.
<P>
Yet the effect is subtle.  The words are repeated in a low-key drumbeat.  The words have become epithets, commonly accepted adjectives.  The words flash by.  The meaning is left as an intuitive residual, unanalyzed but nonetheless absorbed on some level. The anti-tax rhetoric is part of this anti-Semitic code language. [In the primaries Steve Forbes spoke of "driving a stake through the heart of the IRS and killing it."] The effect is not simply that government looks bad.  Government <I>feels</I> bad on a gut-level.
<P>
In my own paranoia, evil--in whoever's heart at either extreme--is hidden in code language and smiles.  Where evil is hidden, paranoia abounds.  With "talk technology," language abounds.  We're swimming in an ocean of language, much of it spoken by verbal geniuses who make us think we're thinking when we're not.  We're drowning in mis-meaning, bad thinking--and hate.
<P>
It's a problem.

DIARY <BR>
JUNE 1995:<BR>
<P>


<font size=7>M</font size=7>Y PARANOIA:   Is anti-Semitism being unspoken in the same way it was unspoken and denied, even by Jews, in the years leading up to Hitler?  When something like this is unspoken, a slip of the tongue about "Jew boys" by Ed Rollins is a match thrown on centuries of tinder saying, "Speak." Rollins would never have spoken the way he did unless he knew he had a "gentleman's agreement" with most of his listeners.
<P>
It served Rollins' interests that his comment leaked.  It kept the Story rolling.  Rollins was berated in a politically correct manner, but the damage had been done.  The signal was sent to the city, to the heartland and the suburbs, "It's OK to say it out loud, but do it in dribs and drabs so nobody gets wind of the whole story behind our hatred."
<P>
Theres just as much viciousness and weird thinking about Blacks and other ethnic groups, too.  Fairly fundamental losses are occurring right before our eyes.  The <I>LA Times</I> on 6-24-95 reported, in a small story on a deep page, that spending cuts have meant civil rights laws cannot be enforced, plus there has been a 50% increase of civil rights violations.  A couple of big chunks of positive human progress are crumbling nearly overnight.

<P>

<font size=7>C</font size=7>ONTINUING WITH WITH BREAKING of my intellectual virginity post-OK City, I had no idea that adherents to the most widespread frontier group Posse Comitatus ("power of the county") believe there is no legal authority higher than the county sheriff.  No, the question of state's/county's rights vs. a central union was not settled with the Civil War.  It just went underground.  It went out West.  Now the "Republican Devolution" makes more sense.  Now I better understand the intense power of the pull from the federal to the local level.
<P>
I had no idea how many people in the U.S. military were being enticed into joining the survivalist bandwagon.  But it makes sense.  It's an ideal pursuit for idealistic warriors who want to feel they have some effect.
<P>
One survivalist leader was bright enough to recommend young men and women join the military to get military training so they can return to the compound and train others.  For someone on an anti-government crusade, this was a creative use of government, to be sure.
<P>
I had no idea they see the U.N. as part of an effort to form a one-world government that would "make us slaves." Some are convinced that military staging operations by "UN foreigners" are being carried out secretly right here in the US, "right over there in the hills."
<PRE>    </PRE>

<font size=7>T</font size=7>IM McVEIGH'S ARMY BUDDY Michael Fortier was reported by the Los Angeles Times (6-4-95) to have left the Army "a more solemn man, prone to citing selective passages of American history that reinforced his newfound love of guns and distrust of government." Fortier "spoke enthusiastically about the patriot and militia movement" that was "warning of a diabolical plot to establish one-world government and crush individuals' freedom."
<P>
Notice the themes of Fortier's behavior: citing selective passages, the way a preacher cites passages from the Bible; "newfound love," born again; the enthusiasm, the passion about a "movement," a crusade of brave warriors; and finally the apocalyptic warning about a Devils scheme.
<P>
The threat and the hope are presented in one Story.  The threat is necessary to make the hope necessary.  Fear invents the need for salvation--for being saved.  If accurately reported, Fortier's behavior displays a primitive religious instinct, something common in all of us at various points in our lives and a dynamic of all religions, benevolent or not depending on the quantity of hate in the Story.
<P>
In the Fortier coverage, the <I>Times</I> reporter avoided mentioning the perceived perpetrator of the "diabolical plot." Perhaps a mere editorial oversight, it is the same technique of ellipsis--the "not said"--practiced by the paranoid frontiersmen themselves.  In fact, the "diabolical plot" is believed to be a Jewish plot by "Jewish agents."
<P>
This is a direct overlay on the same hate-dynamic that occurred at the turn of the century when Catholic immigrants were said to be evil agents of the Pope who was supposedly trying to establish a one-world political government controlled by the Vatican.  It was this myth that Catholic Jack Kennedy had to dispel when he ran for President.

JULY 1995:
<P>
<font size=7>W</font size=7>ITHIN DAYS AFTER O. K. CITY, up the back stretch came the Unabomber, shouting out his own explosions of insistence that we pay attention to some well-taken thoughts: "We see today the effects of the lost gambles of scientists and engineers," said his manuscript, "--ozone depletion, global warming, cancer causing chemicals, overcrowding, noise, pollution, and the massive extinction of species." The Unabomber called for the destruction of the worldwide industrial system.
<P>
On April 26, the <I>New York Times</I> front page ran the Unabomber's letter alongside a big story on McVeigh and the Nichols brothers.  No comments were made on any analogies between the two stories, yet from entirely different directions, espousing quite different desires and values, the Unabomber and the alleged OK City Bombers came together to demand attention on the front page of our lives.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="nytimes.gif"></CENTER>
<PRE>    </PRE>

The <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I> finally put them together May 1, 1995 by observing that, while operating at different extremes, the Unabomber and the bombers of the Murrah Building seemed to share a fundamental fear: that a monolithic world order is robbing individuals of control.  Berkeley social psychologist Tom Tyler said, "Whether it's the technological elite or the government, it's the same basic idea, an exaggerated idea of a kind of secret, all-powerful group that's controlling people."
<P>
We've come a long way since one of the original patriots, Tom Paine, said, "My world is my country and doing good is my religion."

<PRE>    </PRE>

<font size=7>P</font size=7>AUSING ON MY QUEST, I look at our mutual paranoia and ask: Is this all part of our natural resistance to global economic and communication changes?  Is this a response to a perceived loss of our power as individuals and a threat of losing more power?  Is it not natural and understandable that many of us have suspicions about how power will be distributed in the new "global world"?  I do myself.  Yes, these are appropriate concerns to approach with an open mind.
<P>
The danger lies in the closed mind that projects a ready-made hate-justifying outlook, for example, in Christian Identity, a credo that pre-conceives others as enemies and lodges these pre-judgments in quasi-religious stories which are believed fervently, even unto death.

<PRE>   </PRE>

<font size=7>W</font size=7>HEN THE ENEMY is no longer over there, when the enemy is right here at home on the domestic scene, from my own radical frontier, forgive me for asking an outrageous but obvious Oedipal question: If guns are the ultimate phallic symbols in our society and restriction on guns is tantamount to castration.... If government is the father-figure, does the survivalist fear the father will castrate him?
<P>
Imagine asking this question on "This Week with David Brinkley."

<PRE>   </PRE> 
AUGUST 1995:
<P>
<font size=7>A</font size=7>S I TRAVELED by car across country earlier this year, I listened to dozens of radio call-in shows.  Several were religiously oriented, others were secular with a religious overtone in their vision of a "last battle." "I'll fight to the death for my right to bear arms." "I'll go down fighting for the Constitution."
<P>
G. Gordon Liddy--among many others--is a kind of "bridge," not himself an Identity Christian preacher but appealing nonetheless to an apocalyptic "last stand" frame of mind.  Liddy himself was, in his Watergate heyday, a bridge between treasonous anarchy and the President of the United States Richard Nixon.  Oliver North performed a similar function in the Reagan years.  That these men have become respectable and quite so fervently popular in the heartland was one of the early mind-twisters in my quest for information in this strange region of the American mind.
<P>
As I drove and listened across Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, I noticed that radio hosts and callers enunciated many of the phrases and ideas described by Mr. Coates and other researchers.  Some callers spoke of perceived government conspiracies foisted on "us hard-working Americans." "They just wanta crush us." Some associated government with liberalism and associated liberalism with Jews.  They asserted that the policies of liberal government--in their minds Jewish government--were "sapping our strength" with taxes, regulations and the courts. A Freudian analyst would interpret "sapping our strength" as a screen image for castration.
<P>
As I traveled across America and listened, the callers seemed besieged and victimized.  They spoke of the "liberal media trying to wear us down," the same people who "own the banks." "The courts are full of Jews." They spoke of GATT, the WTO, and the UN as "the devil doing the devil's work," as signs of "evil one-world government" bent on "stripping away American sovereignty"--another castration image.
<P>
Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson, Ross Perot, Newt Gingrich, among others, are actively constructing a rhetorical bridge between these ideas and the civilized world.  These figures are not themselves fascists but their political appeal to our worst instincts is fascistic.

<PRE>    </PRE>

<font size=7>B</font size=7>EFORE I READ COATES BOOK, back before the 1994 congressional elections, I had already begun to wonder whether hyper-conservatives along the
Gingrich/Kristol/Lirnbaugh this might be deliberately appealing to the bigoted hard right as a means of getting out votes, by pushing visceral buttons on a primitive level and faintly--ever so faintly--murmuring a secret hate shared in code language--ever so nicely or in "slips of the tongue."
<P>
Just so, the supposedly respectable Pat Robertson (whose Christian Coalition got out the 10% of the vote that made the difference in the Republican Revolution in 1994) wrote a book about the evil intentions of "The New World Order" in which he makes loose and very nice references to the power of Jewish bankers.  The point is: It doesn't take much to say, "I hear you, we're of like mind.  I just can't say it in public but you know what I mean."
<P>
My paranoia sees a wink and a nod between Pat and His People.
<P>
Even if disproportionately influential in our culture--as we can be grateful most Jews are--it never occurred to me that the intentions of Jews were anything less than benevolent.  I never personally knew otherwise.  I never heard a "story" to the contrary, nor did I know that belief in such a story could be so widespread.
<P>
Not until I read James Coates' book.

<PRE>    </PRE>

<font size=7>W</font size=7>HEN RONALD REAGAN SPOKE in his folksy way of the coming nuclear battle of Armageddon, I thought--naively--that his verbal flamboyance was just symbolic rhetoric.  I didn't know he was being <I>He really believed it.</I>  When Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as "The Evil Empire" and "The Great Satan," I thought he was talking to the Soviet Union, just to scare 'em.  I didn't realize he was talking to <I>us</I> here in America.  Who among us was he talking to?  To whom was he appealing? Who's language was he speaking?
<P>
Dan Quayle used to say, with a wink and a nod, "They know who they are and they know what I mean."

<PRE>    </PRE>
SEPTEMBER 1995:
<P>
<font size=7>W</font size=7>HILE HATE GROUPS are paranoid about government, Im paranoid about hate groups.  I fear their capacity to infect a public mind whose immune system has been depleted in the post-60's, post-JFK, post-Watergate, post-Vietnam, post Iran-Contra, post-OJ--<I>the post-traumatic depression of the national psyche.</I>
<P>
Has America--without actual war on her own soil, suffering abstract economic pressures unknown for generations--begun to become paranoid about "enemies everywhere within"?
<P>
Newt Gingrich has a knack for boosting this prospect by slipping in such pronouncements as "President Clinton and the Democrats are the enemy of normal Americans" and "The fear of government is genuine."
<P>
All you need is a brief phrase, "magic language"--and it's
a sound bite, an 8-second shot heard 'round the world.
<P>
Newt's remark genuinizing the fear (not just hate, <I>fear</I>) of government was especially skilled because he sanctioned paranoia, one outlook of which says--to a surprising number of nods--that evil agents in the government itself blew up the Murrah Building as a ploy to gain more power to suppress the freedom of patriots.
<P>
Thanks for the help, Newt.

<PRE>    </PRE>
OCTOBER 1995:
<P>
<font size=7>T</font size=7>HIS SUBJECT IS AWKWARD for an old liberal activist like me to think about.  As a demonstrator in the civil rights movement and anti-Vietnam protests; as one who believes JFK was probably killed by a small hit-squad that included renegade members of government; as someone who saw Nixon's Houston Plan to open American mail; as one who saw CIA director Bill Casey create an entire off-the-shelf "shadow government" to conduct covert operations; as someone who has grounds to be skeptical about what can go on at the government level, I find myself in an ironic position speaking up against those who would destroy the U.S. government.
<P>
Today's right-wing militancy mirrors similar activities by radical leftists in the 1960's such as SDS/Weatherman and the Black Panthers.  Nina J. Easton, writing in the June 18 <I>Los Angeles Times,</I> notes that "one revolution (in the '60's) was run from the cities; the other (today) has rural roots and distrusts urban centers.  One claimed to fight racism in every form; the other one is tinged with white supremacy." Yesterday's leftist slur on police as "fascist pigs" is today's right-wing slur on "Jack-booted government thugs." Rage at government authority fuels both ends of the political spectrum.  
<P>
UCSB sociology professor Richard Flacks believes the deceit in the waging of the Vietnam War gravely wounded America's trust in government.  "The Vietnam War showed us we don't have the kind of democracy we thought we had." 
<P>
The tragic massacre of innocent student protesters at Kent State was--for me--the end of innocence about trusting the process of democracy.
<P>
Easton notes that anti-Semitism was a strong element of the Black Panthers' world vision, while today the idea of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy feeds the notion of an evil one-world order in militia/survivalist circles.  Some of today's groups "don't appear to be driven by racism," says Easton, and she supports this statement by making reference to the presence of Blacks among militia ranks.  But she does not mention that anti-Semitism--a form of racism--is shared by Blacks today as well.  As long as <I>somebody</I>--like Jews or Catholics or Arabs or Asians--is on the bottom of the heap, some survivalist groups can afford to be liberally tolerant of Blacks.  But Blacks are certainly not "leaders" in Robert Millars Christian Identity whose ideas permeate many militias.
<P>
The paranoia cuts both ways and redoubles upon itself.
<P>
Timothy McVeigh is reported to believe a micro-chip has been implanted in his body.  Is his paranoia far off the mark if Sen. Dianne Feinstein wants to require everyone to carry "biometric" ID cards to prove citizenship?  And, coming back full circle, isn't proving citizenship an ironic bit of government control to be espoused by those who are against government?
<P>
Those who hate immigrants and hate being controlled by government may find themselves hoisted by their own petard by having to carry proof of their citizenship.  What goes around comes around.  Hate eventually causes a degree of lost freedom to the very people who think their freedom is being impinged by those they hate.
<P>
Having so deeply--sometimes loudly--questioned the policies and actions of government myself, the irony of observing today's events forces me to consider the common ground I share with those around McVeigh: for example, the importance of individual freedom unfettered by an authoritarian bureaucracy.
<P>
Would I go so far as to bomb the Murrah Building?  Never.  Government has its problems.  The federal deficit has come to symbolize government that isn't working--partly because it's been abandoned to politics and media.  But on social issues, despite the awkward solutions of busing and affirmative action, the fact remains that civil rights, for example, would not exist without the federal government to enforce basic civil rights laws in every state in the union.  We already know the alternative is apartheid.
<P>
Actually, if I had to choose between these two camps, I relate more to the Unabomber's ranting about industrial and technological "progress" threatening the existence of the biosphere and the human species. His manuscript was torturous to read, glancing close to imperatively important truths. I've had the same thoughts since I was 14 years old, when I wondered what the inevitable results of "progress" would eventually be. But he was stern and intellectually intolerant, determined to control exactly the way his vision would play out.
<P> 
Rush Limbaugh is losing no time trying to blacken the eye of Demos by making the Unabomber the poster child of liberalism, just the sort of intelligent angle we'd expect of good old Rush. Rush seals the death of contemplation of truths we need to contemplate if we're going to survive. Not the deadly <I>means</I> the bomber chose, but the sound warnings he hit upon.

Since the Unabomber began a dialogue with a social psychologist Tom Tyler at Berkeley, we've been listening to a larger-than life and very deadly talk show.  The Unabomber is an obsessive-compulsive wood-carving tree-loving cold-blooded sociopath, but somewhere between him and us lies the truth. 
<P>
Just in time for the millennium, is this the beginning of "apocalyptic politics"?  The OK City bombers and the Unabomber are beyond parties, yet they display telltale signs of the extreme right and the extreme left.  Will we find ourselves lining up with the OK City Party or the Unabomb ("Freedom Club") Party or the Waco Party or the Ruby Ridge Party? The latter two seem well represented in Helen Chenoweth's Republican Party.
<P>
The media have conditioned us to respond to expression when it is punctuated by conflict, high drama, or violence.  It's a set-up for a wild-eyed fanatic like the Unabomber to stop the country cold.  Tie up LAX and overnight it's imperative to understand 20 or 30 years of history we've given too little thought.
<P>
The Unabomber wants to force everybody to read something, to sway us to his point of view.  McVeigh wants everybody to read the  <I>The Turner Diaries.</I> The cost of our being behind the curve on these matters is that we are forced--at the point of a bomb--to listen to somebody else's interpretation.  Maybe their views hold water but they are presented by intimidation.  It's an intellectual mugging.  "Your attention or your life."
<P>
We lose a small but important freedom: the freedom to look at the world from our own point of view and to speak up--at the time--for our own interpretation.  Use this freedom or lose it.  If we do not use it as we live, on our feet in real time, they will take this freedom away--suddenly, terroristically--while were not looking. When it becomes "news," it's too late.  News has little reflection and almost no memory.  News, being hungry for headlines, will always have to wait for the explosion and begin looking only then, and then only in sound-bites.
<P>
If it's in time, it's education, if it's too late it's news.

NOVEMBER 1995:
<P>
<font size=7>M</font size=7>Y OWN PARANOIA sees in survivalist frontier paranoia an interconnected web of "average folks" talking to each other and thinking the same thing, keeping to themselves in little "Villages of the Damned" all over America.
<P>
Before OK City, I didn't know the "deep language," the "mythos," for example, of the latter-day creation myth of the "13th Tribe of Israel."
<P>
Considering what just happened in OK City, it's a sin I didn't know all this.  It's a crime all Americans didn't know it.  And we still dont know much.  My God.  So, we have to continue to rely on our intuition and continue to grow as paranoid as those who think so differently.
<P>
We poke around the edges--the NRA, the Christian Coalition, even most militias--not realizing these entities are rhetorical "bridges." Their specific activities (which may not be much to the naked eye) are less sinister than <I>what is in their minds.</I>  By bridging into the average middle class life, they communicate their image and credo.  Seductive permission is given to hatred and violence.  In themselves, these entities are conventional and law-abiding, but they are connecting us into a heart of darkness and, through the use of code language, bringing forth that darkness into an artificial light of righteous acceptability.

DECEMBER 1995:
<P>

<font size=7>W</font size=7>HERE MEDIA might have alerted and educated us, we've missed the story of the century.
<P>
The authorities are under pressure, mostly by media, to "nail the perpetrators" of the OK City bombing.  But the perpetration goes farther than the specific individuals who packed and parked that Ryder truck.  It's not so specific as one or two specific bombers.  It's the world, the mind-set, the cause, the fervent religion whose beliefs long for apocalyptic relief.

JANUARY 1995
<P>
<font size=7>I</font size=7>RONY OF IRONIES, Dear Diary, according to the <I>New York Times,</I> it turns out Timothy McVeigh was no untutored terrorist.  He got hold of James Coates book, <I>Armed and Dangerous: The Rise of the Survivalist Right</I>--the same 1987 book I had checked out of the library, the book that was out of print, the book that nearly turned my hair white.  McVeigh reportedly shared Coates' book with Nichols for inspiration and for instruction on the organization and activities of the racist hate group known as The Order.  They may have used it as a cookbook in their activities.  Knowledge cuts both ways.  And guess what?  <I>Armed and Dangerous</I> has been rushed back into print with a new Prologue about OK City.
<P>
If the alleged OK City bomber Timothy McVeigh was a "lone wolf," he is now--to those who "believe"--a <I>loved</I> lone wolf.  The question must be asked--as with Paul Hill who shot down a doctor in cold blood--<I>to whom is the killer a hero?</I>
<P>
Those are the perpetrators.  Catch them if you can. But be careful.  The paranoia you encounter may be your own.

Frontier Diary, April 1995--January 1996</I>
<P>
PS: Dear Diary:  Since last writing to you, I've read Michael Barkuns study <I>Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins and Development of Christian Identity</I>(Univ. of NC Press, 1994). U.S. Army recruits shot down a black couple in Fayetteville NC and Nazi flags and Klan literature were found in their room. Pat Buchanan's campaign chairman Larry Pratt was revealed to be a close associate of Christian Identity, Klan and other hate leaders. Another Buchanan campaign manager toasted the "heroism" of doctor-killer Paul Hill at a dinner honoring the militant anti-abortion movement. Steve Forbes' campaign advisor Tom Ellis once headed the Pioneer Fund which financed research trying to prove that Blacks are genetically inferior to whites. The Pratt story got a lot of play but the Forbes-Ellis story hardly a peep. 
<P>
In March & April 1996, we had the Freemen Siege in Montana, the Unabomber was turned in by his brother, and Morris Dees published his book <I>Gathering Storm</I> with his research on over 800 different militia/white supremacist/Christian Identity groups. Dees gave a talk at the National Press Club, talked about "ZOG" straight into the camera. 
<P>
Ill keep you posted. We aint seen nothin yet.

We will never know what went on inside that closed room.  But there are a number of facts we do know about Paula Jones beyond those walls.  She claimed that Bill Clinton asked here to perform sexual acts with him nearly five years ago while she was an employee of the state of Arkansas and he was governor.  There were no witnesses.  She asserts it happened "just once."  She charged that she was punished at work because she did not deliver sexual favors, hence the charge that Clinton abused his office.  However, this is contradicted by the fact that she received merit raises after the alleged incident.
<P>
Paula's sister Charlotte and brother-in-law Mark Brown told Sydney Blumenthal, writing for <I>The New Yorker,</I> that after work on the day of the alleged incident, Paula came over to their house, as she often did. having supposedly come from an incident that caused her severe distress.  "She was having a good old time, a great time," said Mark Brown.  "She was laughing and giggling, no big deal, like she always did.  She just talked about her job, things about the day.  She didn't say a thing about the Governor, nothing at all.  Then she went home .... Paula's suing over a stupid lie, and she knows it." He added, "It's a he, because of one woman wanting to be real wealthy, to be in the movies and be on TV.  This is a hell of a price to pay, a premeditated lie-by more than one person, too." Charlotte Brown stated, "I don't believe Debra Ballentine," Paulas corroborating witness.  Mark said.  "Paula hasnt done this on her own. by any means, no.  Paula didn't think this up all by herself. She's had coaching.  Debra Ballentine talked Paula into all this mess, I'm sure of it."
<P>
Charlotte Brown recounted to reporters that on May 5, 1994, a week before Paula traveled to Washington DC to stage her press conference, Paula had said to her, "Whichever way it went, it smelled like money." Charlotte stated on the Sally Jesse Raphael Show on May 20, 1994 that although she personally thought "it was possible that there might have been a little flirting, that was all.  I know my sister, and if anything had happened that day and she had been sexually harassed or seriously come on to, she would have done something about it then or she would have mentioned it.  That would have been news--but she didn't."
<P>
Paula Corbin Jones is the daughter of a millworker who was also a part-time preacher in the Nazarene faith, a religion which accentuates the virtues of denial of earthly pleasure.  She was a rebellious and rowdy teenager.  She held a string a five clerical jobs, none for long.  She failed to complete a secretarial course.  
<P>
In late 1991 she married Steve Jones, an aspiring actor and would-be Hollywood type who had once played the ghost of Elvis in a B movie.  As a Northwest Airline ticket agent, he reportedly enjoyed showing off photos he had taken of Paula in provocative, semi-clothed poses.  Steve loathed Bill Clinton and plastered "Bush-Quayle" stickers everywhere.  Nobody who knew him or worked with him at the time recalls Steve saying a word about the alleged incident with the Governor and his wife, although he talks about it with relish now, without the slightest embarrassment.
<P>
In January 1994, the right-wing and archly anti-Clinton magazine <I>American Spectator</I> ran a story by David Brock (who had previously written a trash-job on Anita Hill called "The Real Anita Hill") about tales told by Arkansas state troopers regarding Clinton's escapades.  One of the troopers mentioned a woman named "Paula" who, after meeting Clinton in a hotel room, offered to be "available" as his "regular girlfriend." Paula's friend Debra Ballentine showed Paula the article and Paula was reportedly furious with the trooper.
<P>
The next step was a big Jump.  Between the original "incident" and the Spectator piece, three years had passed during which time nary a word had come from Paula about any bad behavior by the Governor who was now President of the United States.  Now suddenly bingo!  How best to recover her reputation?  Accuse the President!  Ballentine took Jones to her close friend Daniel Traylor, a small-time real-estate lawyer.  Traylor immediately contacted the President's lawyer George L. Cook and tried to extract money from Clinton or else she would embarrass him publicly.  Cook said that Traylor knew his case was weak but he needed the money.  When Cook told Traylor the claim was preposterous, Traylor suggested "it would help if President Clinton could get Paula job out in California." Cook told Traylor that would be illegal.  Apparently, Paula's hope was that she could land a job with Clinton's friend, the producer Harry Thomason.  Cook said absolutely nix.
<P>
Rebuffed by the President, Paula and her lawyer then did an end-run to Clinton's enemies in Arkansas, the right wing extremes of the Republican Party, and the Christian Right. 
<P>
First stop was Cliff Jackson, a lifetime Clinton nemesis who had once been his pal at Oxford until things went sour somewhere along the line.  Jackson had made an exclusive arrangement to deliver anti-Clinton stories to the <I>Washington Times</I> and the <I>American Spectator</I> during the 1992 campaign and beyond.  Jackson had the bright idea of taking Paula Jones to Washington DC to attend the conservative Political Action Conference and to make her charges public from that forum where reporters would be around.  This they did on February 11, 1994.  An affidavit was handed out to reporters describing "unwelcome sexual advances" with no other details. With this kind of pressure on, Traylor again tried to extort money out of the President by fax, but he received no reply.
<P>
Traylor then took Paula to a gathering of the Legal Affairs Council, a right-wing fundraising organization headed by Richard Delgaudio who was Jesse Helms' top money raiser.  Delgaudio was also famous for the Oliver North Defense Fund a few years earlier.  Delgaudio told Sydney Blumenthal with predictable darkness, "I think there's potential here for impeachment of the President."
<P>
While in Washington, Paula, Steve and Mr. Traylor made the rounds of whatever available media they could get onto.  One was Reed Irvine's cable TV show.  He's famous for his group "Accuracy in Media" which attacks the press for "liberal bias." She told Irvine she had met with Clinton because "maybe I could get potentially a better job." "Well," said Irvine, pushing his insinuation, "he certainly had something in mind for you, didn't he?"
<P>
Paula's next stop was Pat Robertson's 700 Club on CBN where she embellished her story further, each stop raising the innuendo another notch.  "I felt dirty, I felt raped," she said, "whether he touched me or not." This left a bit of room over whether or not she was touched, although she left just as much room implying she'd <I>been touched</I>. Using the word "raped" was the operative action. That's what people heard who wanted to hear the worst. When she finished, Robertson spoke directly to his viewers: "I know if you feel like I do, you feel like the breaths been taken out of you." He then announced the 800 number, urging contributions to be sent to him.
<P>
On May 6,1994, Paula Jones filed suit against Bill Clinton in Little Rock. adding spectacular new details.  Mirroring the claim that had been made against Michael Jackson, her new lawyer Gilbert Davis asserted, "there were distinguishing characteristics in Clinton's genital area that were obvious to Jones."
<P>
Davis had been a Republican appointee whom Jones hired on the recommendation of Nelson Lund who had been a legal counsel in the Bush White House.
<P>
On May 12, 1994, in Washington, Reverend Patrick Mahoney, a leader of anti-abortion Operation Rescue who was up to his neck with indictments and huge court levies for blocking abortion clinics, saw a cause in Paula Jones and announced a Jones Legal Defense Fund.  "Bill Clinton," Mahoney told a rally in April 1994, "heads the most unchristian Administration in the history of the United States."
<P>
Next stop was Jerry Falwell, leader of Moral Majority, who had already produced "The Clinton Chronicles" videotape which accused Clinton of murder and drug-dealing.  Falwell featured the Paula Jones story in a special infomercial.  He stated in the infomercial, "The reason the liberal national news media wants to discredit Paula Corbin Jones is because they feel that Bill Clinton's socialist agenda is so important that they are willing to ignore, hypocritically ignore, the President's alleged repeated sexual harassment and misconduct." 

As Falwell said the words "socialist agenda," an image of two men kissing flashed on the screen.  An 800 number appeared and Falwell explained a bit sheepishly that "there were no plans to make this [Paula Jones] program available on videotape.  However," he continued solemnly, "a grass-roots explosion has occurred in America.... We were about to walk away from this thing, but multitudes are telling me, 'Jerry, don't quit now. 

When Joe Klein's <I>Newsweek</I> "National Affairs" piece  (we
assume no pun intended) was picked up by the
<I>Minneapolis-Star Tribune</I> (May 1994), at least the <I>Star-Trib</I> had the gumption to run Klein's diatribe in the "opinion" section, whereas <I>Newsweek</I> had portrayed it as "news analysis." But once it stood as "opinion" within the <I>Star-Trib,</I> the paper took the liberty of applying its own headline to make absolutely sure that readers' eyes stopped dead in their tracks. Yet in the odd polarization that exists in many newspapers between the editorial page and elsewhere, the <I>Star-Trib</I> has consistently run editorials giving Clinton more credit than any paper in the country.

A quintessential image of a big media problem: cute conflict and "attitude." Arms crossed in protective, defiant refusal to "give in" or compromise or deliberate with each other, with a brick wall between them to insure they can't even <I>see</I> common ground.
<P>
Notice the shift of metaphor from rifles in a "crossfire" (associated with assassination) to the image of the brutal but comparatively healthy all-American sport of boxing. "It's a left and a right and another left and another right" is an image of one side beating up the other. It's a pummeling.

Majoritarian thinking reflected by polling is a major feature of
the low-brow approach to discussing political affairs.  Polls simplify the drama for the media.  At 51 %, the announcer can say "most" and hardly mention the thoughts of the other 49%.  By the next broadcast, "most" has been dropped and we have "The American people apparently think..."
<P>
Majorities can be narrow, as they were in the 1994 Congressional races.  A closely divided electorate means we have a lot to talk about.  Yet, even though everybody's talkin, we're off in our opposing corners, singing to choirs our hymns of division rather than trying to figure out how the other half thinks and learn how the other half lives.
<P>
Majorities are not necessarily wise.  Majorities can be dead wrong.  Still, the media continually "bring us" polls that tell us only the top part of what we're thinking. 
<P>
It's the tip of the iceberg.
<P>
Sometimes polls vary markedly over a few days' time, showing nothing more than how confused we are.  The confusion is left dangling in the air as an oddity to be wondered at, its complexity never explored. We shrug our shoulders and surf to the next channel.
<P>
Polls are anonymous reflections of our passive opinions rendered without consequence.  Yet they appear to have profound influence on political activities in Congress and other places.  We watch or read a poll and think we have participated in democracy.  The "us-ness" that polls convey lures us into thinking we've been accounted for.  But polls are artificial statistical studies that are not the same thing as votes, not the same as letters, not the same as active engagement.
<P>
I particularly question the political use of polling via focus groups which can be turned into search-and-discover missions to find "wedge" issues, with the conscious and deliberate hope to spark negative reactions in voter's minds, stirring fear, resentment and bigotry.  These visceral appeals are power-grabbing tactics pure and simple.
<P>
An example of this was the Willie Horton story which was discovered in Lee Atwater's GOP focus groups in 1988 and rendered into the form of a campaign commercial by the muckraker Floyd Brown.  Notably, the Willie Horton ad was aired more often by the news media than by the Bush campaign. An ad became news.  What a concept!
<P>
These wedges capture attention, churn up a low-key smoldering anger, and get us into xenophobic and dys-educational territory.
<P>
By dys-education, I mean the modeling of junky thinking in the media.  The danger is that we are allowing language and images to define a surreality within which we think we're thinking when we're not.  This is a problem.
<P>
Perhaps there needs to be a Geneva Convention for media politics, to set down a few principles making certain propaganda tactics and sophistry unethical, to avoid crimes against humanitys mind.  I am not suggesting censorship.  I am suggesting self-imposed honor in the marketplace of ideas.

Before July 9, 1996 Deadline</font color="#2F4F2F"></H2>
 <P>
<font size=5>B</font size=5>elow is a article on the planned sell-off of "second tier" public
TV stations, an action alert on the critical situation in
Pittsburgh, which could set the precedent for a sell-off in many
more cities. The FCC requires opinions by July
9th, so if you want to voice your opinion about the sell-off of
public TV stations, now is the time to do it. 
<P>
Just as this article went online, this came to light: The newest wrinkle in Pittsburgh is that public TV there has now
joined forces with a local conservative religious TV station. A
secret deal was negotiated that could allow the public TV station
to swap channels with the religious station, which operates on a
commercial license, and thereby facilitate the sale of the PBS
affiliate to a private owner. The right-wing religious channel will
then share in the millions of dollars to be reaped from the sell-
off. It's win-win for Pat Robertson and the Christian Coalition,
who are allied with the religious channel, and lose-lose for public
TV.

 <P>

>From the May/June 1996 EXTRA!:
Triage at Public TV<BR>
"Second stations" may fall victim to budget cuts<BR>
<P>
By Barbara Bliss Osborn
 <P>
Public broadcasting is making plans for intensive and, according to
its proponents, life-saving triage. But when the system emerges
from the O.R., will the surgery have left the patient sicker than
ever?
 <P>
Early in 1995, leaders of the new Republican Congress made clear
that they planned to "zero out" public broadcasting. After a
Congressional battle, CPB funding was reduced but not eliminated.
The press declared public broadcasting the victor and dropped the
issue. Zero funding, however, remains a goal of congressional
leadership, and public broadcasting is forging survival plans based
on that assumption.
 <P>
Several of the new survival strategies focus on those markets--
about 30 in all--with more than one public TV station. In about 15
markets, two or more independent stations have signals that overlap
to some degree, such as WETA and WHMM in Washington, D.C.
<P> 
In other cases, a local institution holds one license for two
stations. There are nine of these two-station "duopolies" in the
PBS system, covering cities like Boston, Dallas,
Minneapolis/St.Paul, Pittsburgh and Milwaukee.
<P> 
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the quasi-governmental
agency that distributes federal funds to public broadcasters, is
advocating that overlapping stations consolidate. In essence, these
stations would become duopolies, with shared administration and
perhaps technical resources. Andy Russell, CPB's director of
station development, suggests that consolidation could save $100
million.
<P> 
Other proposals put the very existence of second stations in
jeopardy. They involve leasing time on the second station to
commercial broadcasters, or even selling the second station license
altogether. In New York City last year, the city-owned UHF station
WNYC-TV agreed to sell its license to ITT and Dow Jones for the
lucrative price of $207 million. The corporations plan to turn the
station into a business and sports channel.
<P> 
Leasing air time or selling off licenses would obviously reduce the
amount of public broadcast programming available in a market.
Second station schedules are generally designed to counterpoint
PBS's national programming, often airing more of the controversial,
niche-oriented programming that is public TV's mandate. 
<P> 
"You have to make your programming different," says Terrel Cass,
president and general manager of Long Island, N.Y.'s WLIW/Channel
21, a second market station. "If you don't, the first station,
which is usually a VHF station, always wins."
<P> 
Cass says that second stations are generally more responsive to the
local community and minority interests, despite the fact that they
have far fewer resources to invest in local programming. Cass
singles out the second stations in Atlanta and Washington, D.C. as
examples of affiliates that reflect the needs and interests of the
African-American population in those cities.
 <P>
Many second stations make use of programming provided by Program
Resources Group (PRG), an alternate program service that Cass
chairs. PRG provides 10 hours of programming a week, including the
British news program ITN World News; International Dispatches, a
Frontline-like international public affairs series; a world music
series; and other classical music and drama series and specials not
found on the PBS national schedule. 
 <P>
Second stations, particularly in the top markets, are "crucial" to
independents, says Rory O'Connor, president of Globalvision, the
company that produces Rights and Wrongs: Human Rights Television.
O'Connor points out that even in markets like Washington, D.C. that
carry Rights and Wrongs on both local stations, only the second
station schedules the series in primetime. 
<P> 
Second stations have also been important to the distribution of the
workplace series We Do The Work, which is now entering its sixth
season. In cities like Miami, Denver, Atlanta, Minneapolis/St.
Paul, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Dallas and Milwaukee,
secondary stations are the only outlet for the series. And in other
markets, We Do The Work was initially carried on the second station
before being picked up by the first. "The second stations often
serve as a testing ground," says Patrice O'Neill, executive
producer for California Working Group which produces the series.
<P> 
WGBH/WGBX Boston uses its second station for "local C-Span"
coverage of the Massachusetts legislature during the day. Many
second stations--like Milwaukee's WMVT--use their daytime schedule
for instructional programming designed for classroom use. 
<P> 
Not all second station programming is so high-minded, of course.
Some second stations fill certain parts of their schedule with
off-network reruns like Lawrence Welk and British sitcoms. But
regardless of the particulars of a station's schedule, the plans to
commercialize or sell second stations make many station managers
uneasy. "The plans are being built on the back of the second
stations," says WLIW's Cass. 
<P> 
Gigi Sohn, deputy director of the Media Access Project in
Washington, D.C., sees a trend in the focus on second stations.
"The larger stations are trying to squeeze the little ones out,"
she says. "It's bad for diversity. Don't get me wrong. It is a
question of survival, but [public broadcasting's] notion of
survival is survival of the fittest." 
<P> 
Dr. Willard Rowland, dean of the School of Journalism and Mass
Communication at the University of Colorado, contests the idea that
second stations provide a less valuable service and that somehow a
single public TV station can meet the diverse needs in a market.
The country ought to have "three or more [public] stations in every
city, one for public affairs, another cultural, a third
educational," he says. 
<P> 
Rowland calls selling licenses "a travesty. It's selling your
birthright," he says. "It reflects the continued inability to think
of public television as anything but a marginal service. No major
industrialized society in the world has only a single public
television channel. People don't seem to understand that. Even
American public broadcasters don't seem to understand it."
<P> 
"I'm a firm believer that we should not be advocating selling off
spectrum," says WLIW's Terrel Cass. "If you're talking about up to
500 channels of cable, public television is the only sane spot in
that dial. We should be talking about acquiring more shelf space."
Cass adds that although today's political climate is "horrible" for
public television, "it's not always going to be that way. I don't
think we should be giving up these things without a fight." 
<P> 
But for B.J. Lebber, communications director for Pittsburgh's WQED,
reevaluating the status of second stations, including the
possibility of selling them off, is simply sound fiscal management.
"We're looking at a $10 million debt," he said. "We have to look at
all our options."
<P> 
The idea of permitting stations to lease time (a plan that has been
dubbed with the oxymoron "commercial non-profits") draws somewhat
more support from within public television's ranks. Dave Foran,
director of public relations and advertising at Milwaukee's
WMVS/WMVT, suggests that leasing WMVT's primetime hours, now used
for public affairs programs, might allow them to hold on to their
daytime instructional programs. The station is considering
replacing its public affairs shows with sports.
<P> 
Yet another proposal, hammered out by America's Public Television
Stations (APTS), the association of PBS stations, would allow PBS
stations to make commercial use of future spectrum space.
Currently, the FCC plans to assign every station, both public and
commercial, new frequencies to use for digital, or advanced,
television (ATV)--frequencies that will allow broadcasters to
transmit several different programs at once. APTS proposes that the
second station sell its ATV allocation and put its programming on
the first station's allocation. That plan has received the
endorsement "in concept" of PBS, NPR and Public Radio
International.
<P> 
But WLIW's Cass fears that if commercial broadcasters use their ATV
spectrum for high definition TV broadcasts, public broadcasting
will be obliged to compete. In that case, there won't be room for
multiple station services. Others worry about gambling on
"technological fixes." New technologies, the University of
Colorado's Rowland warns, rarely develop in the way we expect. 
<P> 
A survival mentality reigns within public broadcasting, a sense
that however destructive these new-fangled plans, they are the
least worst option. The triage they call for, though acknowledged
and regretted, is minimized. 
<P> 
Outside the public broadcasting system and its save-the-ship
mentality, however, observers are more willing to calculate the
plans' costs in public service rather than dollars and cents.
"There are very few people in American public broadcasting that
have a larger vision," says Rowland. "There's discussion of
incentives for business efficiencies, but not to create multiple
program streams."
<P>
Within public broadcasting, he says, "there's a trained vision to
think small and narrowly," with an ever greater reliance on
market-oriented analysis. "They're worrying about cost elements
instead of worrying about what it's it all for," he says. "I
understand the fiscal exigencies. I chair the board of one of the
stations in Denver," he says. "I can feel the pain in my own
staff."
<P> 
A grassroots movement is being organized to establish a new funding
mechanism for PBS that would eliminate the need for further
dismantling of public broadcasting. Plans call for drawing up draft
legislation to be circulated among public interest and labor
organizations to enlist support.
<P> 
Says Henry Kroll, a key organizer in the effort and a member of
KQED's board of directors: "Our proposal calls for independent
funding of public broadcasting as was called for in the Carnegie
Commission report that established public broadcasting. Only with
independent funding will there be a true commitment to a public
broadcasting system. We have to have something on the table as
these other proposals get discussed."

>From the June 1996 EXTRA! Update:
Stop the Sell-Off of Public Broadcasting
<P> 
The last issue of EXTRA! (5-6/96) discussed the threat that public
television stations might be sold to commercial broadcasters. One
of the first such sales may be imminent--and now is the time to try
to stop it.
<P> 
Pittsburgh is one of 30-some metropolitan regions across the
country that is fortunate enough to have more than one public TV
station. WQED is the larger, VHF station, airing more standard PBS
fare; that station's board also controls WQEX, a UHF channel which
is more open to alternative public affairs programs, featuring
labor, minority and human rights perspectives.
>p> 
Due to extreme mismanagement, waste and inflated executive
salaries, the Pittsburgh public TV system has become mired in debt.
Like many non-commercial broadcasters around the country, top WQED
management has long seen the second channel as a redundancy that
could be cashed in for big money.
<P> 
The logic that more than one public channel is too many is
peculiar. It's as if to say that the public is entitled to no more
space on the TV dial than a corporation like Fox Broadcasting.
Indeed, there's movement toward allowing corporate broadcasters to
buy more than one station in the same market, even as public
systems may be downsized. 
 <P>
More fundamentally, the licenses that WQED and other public
television stations control are not their private property--they
are held on behalf of the public, and are specifically dedicated to
non-commercial broadcasting. Indeed, the legal restrictions against
airing commercials on such stations are what has prevented WQEX
from being sold off already.
<P> 
WQED is trying to get around these restrictions with a provision
buried deeply in the massive federal budget bill passed in April.
The station's friends in Congress--including senators Alan Specter
and Rick Santorum, and Rep. John Murtha--inserted a passage that
requires the FCC to give speeded-up consideration to a request to
commercialize WQEX's license.
<P> 
"It's a shame that WQED has used backroom politics to sell off a
community asset which has been entrusted to them to be held in the
public's interest, not for their own self-aggrandizement,"
communications lawyer Frederick Polner told the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette (5/2/96).
<P> 
As EXTRA! Update went to press, WQED reportedly was planning to
submit a formal request by June 1. The special law then gives the
FCC 30 days to respond. [July 9 is the current deadline]
<P> 
If the FCC allows one of the public stations in Pittsburgh to go
commercial, it could set a precedent for many other "redundant"
stations across the country. As these stations tend to air more of
the controversial, alternative programming that is public TV's
mandate, their commercialization would be a great loss.
<P>

For the last year or so, I have been wrestling with a difficult mystery. It is a classic brainteaser, with a corpus delicti, a crime scene strewn with clues, and many potential suspects. As in all good detective stories, however, some plausible miscreants turn out to have impeccable alibis, and some important clues hint at portentous developments that occurred before the curtain rose.
<P>
The mystery concerns the strange disappearance of social capital and civic engagement in America.
<P>
By "social capital," I mean features of social life--networks, norms, and trust--that enable participants to act together more effectively to pursue shared objectives. (Whether or not their shared goals are praiseworthy is, of course, entirely another matter.) I use the term "civic engagement" to refer to people's connections with the life of their communities, not only with politics.
<P>
Although I am not yet sure that I have solved the mystery, I have assembled evidence that clarifies what happened. An important clue, as we shall see, involves differences among generations. Americans who came of age during the Depression and World War II have been far more deeply engaged in the life of their communities than the generations that have followed them. The passing of this "long civic generation" appears to be an important proximate cause of the decline of our civic life. This discovery does not in itself crack the case, but when combined with other data,  it points strongly to one suspect against whom I shall presently bring an indictment.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="putnamtv.gif" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=215></CENTER>
<P>
Evidence for the decline of social capital and civic engagement comes from a number of independent sources. Surveys of average Americans in 1965, 1975, and 1985, in which they recorded every
single activity during a day--so-called "time-budget" studies--indicate that since 1965, time spent on informal socializing and visiting is down (perhaps by one-quarter) and time devoted to clubs and
organizations is down even more sharply (by roughly half). Membership records of such diverse organizations as the PTA, the Elks club, the League of Women Voters, the Red Cross, labor unions,
and even bowling leagues show that participation in many conventional voluntary associations has declined by roughly 25 percent to 50 percent over the last two to three decades. Surveys show sharp declines in many measures of collective political participation, including attending a rally or speech (off 36 percent between 1973 and 1993), attending a meeting on town or school affairs (off 39 percent), or working for a political party (off 56 percent).
<P>
Some of the most reliable evidence about trends comes from the General Social Survey (GSS), conducted nearly every year for more than two decades. The GSS demonstrates, at all levels of education and among both men and women, a drop of roughly one-quarter in group membership since 1974 and a drop of roughly one-third in social trust since 1972. (Trust in political authorities, indeed in many social institutions, has also declined sharply over the last three decades, but that is conceptually a distinct trend.) 
<P>
Slumping membership has afflicted all sorts of groups, from sports
clubs and professional associations to literary discussion groups and labor unions. Only nationality groups, hobby and garden clubs, and the catch-all category of "other" seem to have resisted the ebbing tide. Gallup polls report that church attendance fell by roughly 15 percent during the 1960s and has remained at that lower level ever since, while data from the National Opinion Research Center suggest that the decline continued during the 1970s and 1980s and by now amounts to roughly 30 percent.
<P>
A more complete audit of American social capital would need to account for apparent countertrends. Some observers believe, for example, that support groups and neighborhood watch groups are proliferating, and few deny that the last several decades have witnessed explosive growth in interest groups represented in Washington. The growth of such "mailing list" organizations as the American Association of Retired People and the Sierra Club, although highly significant in political (and commercial) terms, is not really a counterexample to the supposed decline in social connectedness, however, since these are not really associations in which members meet one another. Their members' ties are to common symbols and ideologies, but not to each other. 
<P>
Similarly, although most secondary associations are not-for-profit, most prominent nonprofits (from Harvard University to the Ford Foundation to the Metropolitan Opera) are bureaucracies, not secondary associations, so the growth of the "third sector" is not tantamount to a growth in social connectedness. 
<P>
With due regard to various kinds of counterevidence, I believe that the weight of available evidence confirms that Americans today are significantly less engaged with their communities than was true a generation ago.
<P>
Of course, American civil society is not moribund. Many good people across the land work hard every day to keep their communities vital. Indeed, evidence suggests that America still outranks many other countries in the degree of our community involvement and social trust. But if we examine our lives, not our aspirations, and if we compare ourselves not with other countries but with our parents, the best available evidence suggests that we are less connected with one another. 
<P>
Reversing this trend depends, at least in part, on understanding the causes of the strange malady afflicting American civic life. This is the mystery I seek to unravel here: Why, beginning in the 1960s and accelerating in the 1970s and 1980s, did the fabric of American community life begin to fray?
<P>
Why are more Americans bowling alone?

THE USUAL SUSPECTS
<P>
Many possible answers have been suggested for this puzzle:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    *  busy-ness and time pressure; <BR>
    *  economic hard times (or, according to alternative theories,                			material affluence); <BR>

    *  the movement of women into the paid labor force and the 					stresses of two-career families; <BR>

      *  television, the electronic revolution, and other technological 				changes.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The classic questions posed by a detective are <STRONG><I>means, motive, and opportunity.</I></STRONG> A solution, even a partial one, to our mystery must pass analogous tests.
<P>
Is the proposed explanatory factor correlated with trust and civic engagement? If not, that factor probably does not belong in the lineup. For example, if working women turn out to be more engaged in community life than housewives, it would be harder to attribute the downturn in community organizations to the rise of two-career families.
<P>
Is the correlation spurious? If parents, for example, were more likely than childless people to be joiners, that might be an important clue. However, if the correlation between parental status and civic
engagement turned out to be entirely spurious, due to the effects of (say) age, we would have to remove the declining birth rate from our list of suspects.
<P>
Is the proposed explanatory factor changing in the relevant way? Suppose, for instance, that people who often move have shallower community roots. That could be an important part of the answer to our mystery only if residential mobility itself had risen during this period.
<P>
Is the proposed explanatory factor vulnerable to the claim that it might be the result of civic disengagement, not the cause? For example, even if newspaper readership were closely correlated
with civic engagement across individuals and across time, we would need to weigh the degree to which reduced newspaper circulation is the result (not the cause) of disengagement. 
<P>
Against those benchmarks, let us weigh the evidence. But first we must acknowledge a trend that only complicates our task.

<PRE>   </PRE>

EDUCATION DEEPENS THE MYSTERY
<P>
Education is by far the strongest correlate that I have discovered of civic engagement in all its forms, including social trust and membership in many different types of groups. In fact, the effects of
education become greater and greater as we move up the educational ladder. The four years of education between 14 and 18 total years have ten times more impact on trust and membership than the first four years of formal education. This curvilinear pattern applies to both men and women, and to all races and generations. 
<P>
Sorting out just why education has such a massive effect on social connectedness would require a book in itself. Education is in part a proxy for social class and economic differences, but when income, social status, and education are used together to predict trust and group membership, education continues to be the primary influence. So, well-educated people are much more likely to be joiners and trusters, partly because they are better off economically, but mostly because of the skills, resources, and inclinations that were imparted to them at home and in school.
<P>
The expansion of high schools and colleges earlier this century has had an enormous impact on the educational composition of the adult population during just the last two decades. Since 1972 the proportion of adults with fewer than 12 years of education has been cut in half, falling from 40 percent to 18 percent, while the proportion with more than 12 years has nearly doubled, rising from 28 percent to 50 percent, as the generation of Americans educated around the turn of this century (most of whom did not finish high school) died off and were replaced by the baby boomers and their successors (most of whom attended college).
<P>
So here we have two facts--education boosts civic engagement sharply, and educational levels have risen massively--that only deepen our central mystery. By itself, the rise in educational levels should have increased social capital during the last 20 years by 15-20 percent, even assuming that the effects of education were merely linear. (Taking account of the curvilinear effect in figure 1, "Education and Civic Life," the rise in trusting and joining should have been even greater, as Americans moved up the accelerating curve.) By contrast, however, the actual GSS figures show a net decline since the early 1970s of roughly the same magnitude (trust by about 20-25 percent, memberships by about 15-20 percent). The relative declines in social capital are similar within each
educational category--roughly 25 percent in group memberships and roughly 30 percent in social trust since the early 1970s, and probably even more since the early 1960s.
<P>
While this first investigative foray leaves us more mystified than before, we may nevertheless draw two useful conclusions. First, we need to take account of educational differences in our exploration of other factors to be sure that we do not confuse their effects with the consequences of education. And, second, the mysterious disengagement of the last quarter century seems to have afflicted all educational strata in our society, whether they have had graduate education or did not finish high school.

<PRE>  </PRE>

MOBILITY AND SUBURBANIZATION
<P>
Many studies have found that residential stability and such related phenomena as homeownership are associated with greater civic engagement. At an earlier stage in this investigation I observed that "mobility, like frequent re-potting of plants, tends to disrupt root systems, and it takes time for an uprooted individual to put down new roots." I must now report, however, that further inquiry fully exonerates residential mobility from any responsibility for our fading civic engagement. 
<P>
Data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census 1995 (and earlier years) show that rates of residential mobility have been remarkably constant over the last half century. In fact, to the extent that there has been any change at all, both long-distance and short-distance mobility have declined over the last five decades. During the 1950s, 20 percent of Americans changed residence each year and 6.9 percent annually moved across county borders; during the 1990s, the comparable figures are 17 percent and 6.6 percent. Americans, in short, are today slightly more rooted residentially than a
generation ago. The verdict on mobility is unequivocal: This theory is simply wrong.
<P>
But if moving itself has not eroded our social capital, what about the possibility that we have moved to places, especially suburbs, that are less congenial to social connectedness? In fact, social connectedness does differ by community type, but the differences turn out to be modest and in directions that are inconsistent with the theory.
<P>
Controlling for such characteristics as education, age, income, work status, and race, citizens of the nation's 12 largest metropolitan areas (particularly their central cities, but also their suburbs) are roughly 10 percent less trusting and report 10-20 percent fewer group memberships than residents of other cities and towns (and their suburbs). Meanwhile, residents of very small towns and rural areas are (in accord with some hoary stereotypes) slightly more trusting and civicly engaged than other Americans. Unsurprisingly, the prominence of different types of groups does vary significantly by location: Major cities have more political and nationality clubs; smaller cities more fraternal, service, hobby, veterans', and church groups: and rural areas more agricultural organizations. But overall rates of associational membership are not very different.
<P>
Moreover, this pattern cannot account for our central puzzle. In the first place, there is virtually no correlation between gains in population and losses in social capital, either across states or across
localities of different sizes. Even taking into account the educational and social backgrounds of those who have moved there, the suburbs have faintly higher levels of trust and civic engagement than their
respective central cities, which should have produced growth, not decay, in social capital over the last generation. The central point, however, is that the downtrends in trusting and joining are virtually
identical everywhere--in cities, big and small, in suburbs, in small towns, and in the countryside. 
<P>
Of course, Evanston is not Levittown is not Sun City. The evidence available does not allow us to determine whether different types of suburban living have different effects on civic connections and
social trust. However, these data do rule out the thesis that suburbanization per se has caused the erosion of America's social capital. Both where we live and how long we've lived there matter for
social capital, but neither explains why it is eroding everywhere.

RACE AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS REVOLUTION
<P>
Some observers have noted that the decline in social connectedness began just after the successes of the civil rights revolution of the 1960s. That coincidence has suggested the possibility of a kind of
sociological "white flight," as legal desegregation of civic life led whites to withdraw from community
associations.
<P>
The erosion of social capital, however, has affected all races. In fact, during the 1980s the
downturns in both joining and trusting were even greater among African Americans (and other racial
minorities) than among the white majority. This fact is inconsistent with the thesis that "white flight" is
a significant cause of civic disengagement, since black Americans have been dropping out of
religious and civic organizations at least as rapidly as white Americans. <P>
Even more important, the
pace of disengagement among whites has been uncorrelated with racial intolerance or support for
segregation. Avowedly racist or segregationist whites have been no quicker to drop out of
community organizations during this period than more tolerant whites. 
<P>
This evidence is far from conclusive, of course, but it does shift the burden of proof onto those who
believe that racism is a primary explanation for growing civic disengagement over the last quarter
century. This evidence also suggests that reversing the civil rights gains of the last thirty years would
do nothing to reverse the social capital losses.

<PRE>  </PRE>

GENERATIONAL EFFECTS

<P>

Our efforts thus far to identify the major sources of civic disengagement have been singularly
unfruitful. In all our statistical analyses, however, one factor, second only to education, stands out as
a predictor of all forms of civic engagement and trust. That factor is age. Older people belong to
more organizations than young people, and they are less misanthropic. Older Americans also vote
more often and read newspapers more frequently, two other forms of civic engagement closely
correlated with joining and trusting. 
<P>
"Civic Engagement by Age" shows the basic pattern. Civic involvement appears to rise more or less
steadily from early adulthood toward a plateau in middle age, from which it declines only late in life.
This humpback pattern seems naturally to represent the arc of life's engagements. That, at least, was
how I first interpreted the data. But that would be a fundamental misreading of the most important
clue in our whole whodunit. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="putnam2.gif">
<BR>Figure 2."Civic Engagements by Age (education controlled)" shows civic engagement to increase with age.
_______________________________________________________________________
<PRE>  </PRE>
Evidence from the General Social Survey enables us to follow individual cohorts as they age.
If the rising lines in the figure indeed represent deepening civic engagement with age, we
should be able to track this same deepening engagement as we follow, for example, the first of the
baby boomers, born in 1947, as they aged from 25 in 1972 (the first year of the GSS) to 47 in 1994
(the latest year available). Startlingly, however, such an analysis, repeated for successive birth
cohorts, produces virtually no evidence of such life cycle changes in civic engagement. In fact, as
various generations moved through the period between 1972 and 1994, their levels of trust and
membership more often fell than rose, reflecting a more or less simultaneous decline in civic
engagement among young and old alike, particularly during the second half of the 1980s. But that
downtrend obviously cannot explain why, throughout the period, older Americans were always more
trusting and engaged. In fact, the only reliable life cycle effect visible in these data is a withdrawal
from civic engagement very late in life, as we move through our eighties.
<P>
The central paradox posed by these patterns is this: Older people are consistently more engaged and
trusting than younger people, yet we do not become more engaged and trusting as we age. What's
going on here?
<P>
Time and age are notoriously ambiguous in their effects on social behavior. Social scientists have
learned to distinguish three contrasting phenomena:
<P>
<B>Life cycle effects</B> represent differences attributable to stage of life. In this case individuals change
as they age, but since the effects of aging are, in the aggregate, neatly balanced by the "demographic
metabolism" of births and deaths, life cycle effects produce no aggregate change. Everyone's close-focus eyesight worsens as we age, but the aggregate demand for reading glasses changes little.
<P>
<B>Period effects</B> affect all people who live through a given era, regardless of their age. Period effects
can produce both individual and aggregate change, often quickly and enduringly, without any
age-related differences. The sharp drop in trust in government between 1965 and 1975, for
example, was almost entirely this sort of period effect, as Americans of all ages changed their minds
about their leaders' trustworthiness. Similarly, as just noted, a modest portion of the decline in social
capital during the 1980s appears to be a period effect.
<P>
<B>Generational effects</B> affect all people born at the same time. Like life cycle effects (and unlike
typical period effects), generational effects show up as disparities among age groups at a single point
in time, but like period effects (and unlike life cycle effects) generational effects produce real social
change, as successive generations, enduringly "imprinted" with divergent outlooks, enter and leave
the population. In pure generational effects, no individual ever changes, but society does.
<P>
Returning to our conundrum, how could older people today be more engaged and trusting, if they
did not become more engaged and trusting as they aged? The key to this paradox, as David Butler
and Donald Stokes observed in another context, is to ask, not how old people are, but when they
were young. The figure, "Social Capital and Civic Engagement by Generation," addresses this
reformulated question, displaying various measures of civic engagement according to the
respondents' year of birth. 
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="putnam3.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
Figure 3."Social Capital and Civic Engagement by Generation (education controlled)" shows an overall decline in social capital and civic engagement in the age cohorts that turned 18 after the 1940s.
__________________________________________________________________________
<PRE>  </PRE>

THE LONG CIVIC GENERATION
<P>
In effect, the figure on the bottom of page 43 lines up Americans from left to right according to their
date of birth, beginning with those born in the last third of the nineteenth century and continuing
across to the generation of their great-grandchildren, born in the last third of the twentieth century.
As we begin moving along this queue from left to right--from those raised around the turn of the
century to those raised during the Roaring Twenties, and so on--we find relatively high and unevenly
rising levels of civic engagement and social trust. Then rather abruptly, however, we encounter signs
of reduced community involvement, starting with men and women born in the early 1930s.
<P>
Remarkably, this downward trend in joining, trusting, voting, and newspaper reading continues
almost uninterruptedly for nearly 40 years. The trajectories for the various different indicators of civic
engagement are strikingly parallel: Each shows a high, sometimes rising plateau for people born and
raised during the first third of the century; each shows a turning point in the cohorts around 1930;
and each then shows a more or less constant decline down to the cohorts born during the 1960s.
<P>
By any standard, these intergenerational differences are extraordinary. Compare, for example, the
generation born in the early 1920s with the generation of their grandchildren born in the late 1960s.
Controlling for educational disparities, members of the generation born in the 1920s belong to almost
twice as many civic associations as those born in the late 1960s (roughly 1.9 memberships per
capita, compared to roughly 1.1 memberships per capita). The grandparents are more than twice as
likely to trust other people (50-60 percent compared with 25 percent for the grandchildren). They
vote at nearly double the rate of the most recent cohorts (roughly 75 percent compared with 40-45
percent), and they read newspapers almost three times as often (70-80 percent read a paper daily
compared with 25-30 percent). And bear in mind that we have found no evidence that the youngest
generation will come to match their grandparents' higher levels of civic engagement as they grow
older.
<P>
Thus, read not as life cycle effects, but rather as generational effects, the age-related patterns in our
data suggest a radically different interpretation of our basic puzzle. Deciphered with this key, the
figure on page 43 depicts a long "civic" generation, born roughly between 1910 and 1940, a broad
group of people substantially more engaged in community affairs and substantially more trusting than
those younger than they. (Members of the 1910-1940 generation also seem more civic than their
elders, at least to judge by the outlooks of relatively few men and women born in the late nineteenth
century who appeared in our samples.) The culminating point of this civic generation is the cohort
born in 1925-1930, who attended grade school during the Great Depression, spent World War II in
high school (or on the battlefield), first voted in 1948 or 1952, set up housekeeping in the 1950s,
and watched their first television when they were in their late twenties. <P>
Since national surveying
began, this cohort has been exceptionally civic: voting more, joining more, reading newspapers
more, trusting more. As the distinguished sociologist Charles Tilly (born in 1928) said in commenting
on an early version of this essay, "We are the last suckers."
<P>
To help in interpreting the historical contexts within which these successive generations of Americans
matured, the figure also indicates the decade within which each cohort came of age. Thus, we can
see that each generation that reached adulthood since the 1940s has been less engaged in
community affairs than its immediate predecessor.
<P>
Further confirmation of this generational interpretation comes from a comparison of the two parallel
lines that chart responses to an identical question about social trust, posed first in the National
Election Studies (mainly between 1964 and 1976) and then in the General Social Survey between
1972 and 1994. 
<P>
If the greater trust expressed by Americans born earlier in the century represented
a life cycle effect, then the graph from the GSS surveys (conducted when these cohorts were, on
average, 10 years older) should have been some distance above the NES line. In fact, the GSS line
lies about 5-10 percent below the NES line. That downward shift almost surely represents a period
effect that depressed social trust among all cohorts during the 1980s. That downward period effect,
however, is substantially more modest than the large generational differences already noted. 
<P>
In short, the most parsimonious interpretation of the age-related differences in civic engagement is
that they represent a powerful reduction in civic engagement among Americans who came of age in
the decades after World War II, as well as some modest additional disengagement that affected all
cohorts during the 1980s. 
<P>
These patterns hint that being raised after World War II was a quite
different experience from being raised before that watershed. It is as though the postwar generations
were exposed to some mysterious X-ray that permanently and increasingly rendered them less likely
to connect with the community. Whatever that force might have been, it--rather than anything that
happened during the 1970s and 1980s--accounts for most of the civic disengagement that lies at the
core of our mystery.
<P>
But if this reinterpretation of our puzzle is correct, why did it take so long for the effects of that
mysterious X-ray to become manifest? If the underlying causes of civic disengagement can be traced
to the 1940s and 1950s, why did the effects become conspicuous in PTA meetings and Masonic
lodges, in the volunteer lists of the Red Cross and the Boy Scouts, and in polling stations and church
pews and bowling alleys across the land only during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s? 
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="putnam4.gif"></CENTER>

<BR>Figure 4. "The Rise and Decline of a Civic Generation" shows that the civically-engaged generation born between 1911 and 1940 (and its sub-cohort born between 1921 and 1935) was at its greatest numerical concentration in 1960.
__________________________________________________________________________
<PRE>  </PRE>

The visible effects of this generational disengagement were delayed by two important factors. First,
the postwar boom in college enrollments raised levels of civic engagement, offsetting the generational
trends. As Warren E. Miller and J. Merrill Shanks observe in their as yet unpublished book, <I>The
American Voter Reconsidered,</I> the postwar expansion of educational opportunities "forestalled a
cataclysmic drop" in voting turnout, and it had a similar delaying effect on civic disengagement more
generally. 
<P>
Second, the full effects of generational developments generally appear several decades after
their onset, because it takes that long for a given generation to become numerically dominant
in the adult population. Only after the mid-1960s did significant numbers of the "post-civic
generation" reach adulthood, supplanting older, more civic cohorts. The figure "The Rise and Decline
of a Civic Generation" illustrates this generational accounting. The long civic generation born
between 1910 and 1940 reached its zenith in 1960, when it comprised 62 percent of those who
chose between John Kennedy and Richard Nixon. By the time that Bill Clinton was elected
president in 1992, that cohort's share in the electorate had been cut precisely in half. Conversely,
over the last two decades (from 1974 to 1994) boomers and X-ers (that is, Americans born after
1946) have grown as a fraction of the adult population from 24 percent to 60 percent.
<P>
In short, the very decades that have seen a national deterioration in social capital are the same
decades during which the numerical dominance of a trusting and civic generation has been replaced
by the dominion of "post-civic" cohorts. Moreover, although the long civic generation has enjoyed
unprecedented life expectancy, allowing its members to contribute more than their share to American
social capital in recent decades, they are now passing from the scene. Even the youngest members
of that generation will reach retirement age within the next few years. Thus, a generational analysis
leads almost inevitably to the conclusion that the national slump in trust and engagement is likely to
continue, regardless of whether the more modest "period effect" depression of the 1980s continues.<I>  (cont'd)</I>

To say that civic disengagement in contemporary America is in large measure generational merely reformulates our central puzzle. We now know that much of the cause of our lonely bowling probably dates to the 1940s and 1950s, rather than to the 1960s and 1970s. What could have been the mysterious anticivic "X-ray" that affected Americans who came of age after World War II and whose effects progressively deepened at least into the 1970s?
<P>
Our new formulation of the puzzle opens the possibility that the zeitgeist of national unity, patriotism, and shared sacrifice that culminated in 1945 might have reinforced civic-mindedness. On the other hand, it is hard to assign any consistent role to the Cold War and the Bomb, since the anticivic trend appears to have deepened steadily from the 1940s to the 1970s, in no obvious harmony with the
rhythms of world affairs. Nor is it easy to construct an interpretation of the data on generational differences in which the cultural vicissitudes of the sixties could play a significant role. Neither can
economic adversity or affluence easily be tied to the generational decline in civic engagement, since the slump seems to have affected in equal measure those who came of age in the placid fifties, the
booming sixties, and the busted seventies.
<P>
I have discovered only one prominent suspect against whom circumstantial evidence can be mounted, and in this case, it turns out, some directly incriminating evidence has also turned up. This
is not the occasion to lay out the full case for the prosecution, nor to review rebuttal evidence for the defense, but I want to present evidence that justifies indictment. 
<P>
The culprit is television.
<P>
First, the timing fits. The long civic generation was the last cohort of Americans to grow up without television, for television flashed into American society like lightning in the 1950s. In 1950 barely 10
percent of American homes had television sets, but by 1959, 90 percent did, probably the fastest diffusion of a major technological innovation ever recorded. The reverberations from this lightning
bolt continued for decades, as viewing hours grew by 17-20 percent during the 1960s and by an additional 7-8 percent during the 1970s. In the early years, TV watching was concentrated among the less educated sectors of the population, but during the 1970s the viewing time of the more educated sectors of the population began to converge upward. Television viewing increases with
age, particularly upon retirement, but each generation since the introduction of television has begun its life cycle at a higher starting point. By 1995 viewing per TV household was more than 50 percent
higher than it had been in the 1950s.
<P>
Most studies estimate that the average American now watches roughly four hours per day (excluding periods in which television is merely playing in the background). Even a more conservative estimate of three hours means that television absorbs 40 percent of the average American's free time, an increase of about one-third since 1965. Moreover, multiple sets have proliferated: By the late 1980s
three-quarters of all U.S. homes had more than one set, and these numbers too are rising steadily, allowing ever more private viewing. Robinson and Godbey are surely right to conclude that "television is the 800-pound gorilla of leisure time." This massive change in the way Americans spend their days and nights occurred precisely during the years of generational civic disengagement.
<P>
Evidence of a link between the arrival of television and the erosion of social connections is, however, not merely circumstantial. The links between civic engagement and television viewing can be
instructively compared with the links between civic engagement and newspaper reading. The basic contrast is straightforward: Newspaper reading is associated with high social capital, TV viewing with low social capital. 
<P>
Controlling for education, income, age, race, place of residence, work status, and gender, TV viewing is strongly and negatively related to social trust and group membership, whereas the same correlations with newspaper reading are positive. Within every educational category, heavy readers are avid joiners, whereas heavy viewers are more likely to be loners. In fact, more detailed analysis suggests that heavy TV watching is one important reason why less educated people are less engaged in the life of their communities. Controlling for differential TV exposure significantly reduces the correlation between education and engagement. 
<P>
Viewing and reading are themselves uncorrelated--some people do lots of both, some do little of either--but "pure readers" (that is, people who watch less TV than average and read more
newspapers than average) belong to 76 percent more civic organizations than "pure viewers"  (controlling for education, as always). Precisely the same pattern applies to other indicators of civic
engagement, including social trust and voting turnout. "Pure readers," for example, are 55 percent more trusting than "pure viewers."
<P>
In other words, each hour spent viewing television is associated with less social trust and less group membership, while each hour reading a newspaper is associated with more. An increase in television
viewing of the magnitude that the U.S. has experienced in the last four decades might directly account for as much as one-quarter to one- half of the total drop in social capital, even without taking into account, for example, the indirect effects of television viewing on newspaper readership or the cumulative effects of lifetime viewing hours. Newspaper circulation (per household) has dropped by more than half since its peak in 1947. To be sure, it is not clear which way the tie between newspaper reading and civic involvement works, since disengagement might itself dampen one's interest in community news. But the two trends are clearly linked.

<PRE>  </PRE>


HOW MIGHT TV DESTROY SOCIAL CAPITAL?
<P>
Time displacement. Even though there are only 24 hours in everyone's day, most forms of social and media participation are positively correlated. People who listen to lots of classical music are
more likely, not less likely, than others to attend Cubs games. Television is the principal exception to this generalization--the only leisure activity that seems to inhibit participation outside the home. TV watching comes at the expense of nearly every social activity outside the home, especially social gatherings and informal conversations. TV viewers are homebodies. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="putnam5.gif">
<BR>Figure 5. "The TV Connection" shows that group membership tends to decline as television viewing increases among those having twelve or more years of education. 
__________________________________________________________________________

<PRE>  </PRE>
Most studies that report a negative correlation between television
watching and community involvement (see figure "The TV
Connection") are ambiguous with respect causality, because
they merely compare different individuals at a single time.
<P>                                                             
However, one important quasi-experimental study of the introduction of television in three Canadian towns found
the same pattern at the aggregate level across time. A major effect of television's arrival was the reduction in participation in social, recreational, and community activities among people of all ages.
In short, television privatizes our leisure time.
<P>
<B>Effects on the outlooks of viewers.</B> An impressive body of literature suggests that heavy watchers of TV are unusually skeptical about the benevolence of other people--overestimating crime rates, for example. This body of literature has generated much debate about the underlying causal patterns, with skeptics suggesting that misanthropy may foster couch-potato behavior rather than the reverse.
<P>
While awaiting better experimental evidence, however, a reasonable interim judgment is that heavy television watching may well increase pessimism about human nature. Perhaps too, as social critics
have long argued, both the medium and the message have more basic effects on our ways of interacting with the world and with one another. Television may induce passivity, as Neil Postman
has claimed.
<P>
Effects on children. TV consumes an extraordinary part of children's lives, about 40 hours per week on average. Viewing is especially high among pre-adolescents, but it remains high among younger adolescents: Time-budget studies suggest that among youngsters aged 9 to 14 television consumes as much time as all other discretionary activities combined, including playing, hobbies, clubs, outdoor activities, informal visiting, and just hanging out. The effects of television on childhood socialization have, of course, been hotly debated for more than three decades. The most reasonable
conclusion from a welter of sometimes conflicting results appears to be that heavy television watching probably increases aggressiveness (although perhaps not actual violence), that it probably reduces school achievement, and that it is statistically associated with "psychosocial malfunctioning," although how much of this effect is self-selection and how much causal remains much debated. The
evidence is, as I have said, not yet enough to convict, but the defense has a lot of explaining to do.
<P>
More than two decades ago, just as the first signs of disengagement were beginning to appear in American politics, the political scientist Ithiel de Sola Pool observed that the central issue would be--it was then too soon to judge, as he rightly noted--whether the development represented a temporary change in the weather or a more enduring change in the climate. It now appears that much of the change whose initial signs he spotted did in fact reflect a climatic shift.
<P>
Moreover, just as the erosion of the ozone layer was detected only many years after the proliferation of the chlorofluorocarbons that caused it, so too the erosion of America's social capital became
visible only several decades after the underlying process had begun. Like Minerva's owl that flies at dusk, we come to appreciate how important the long civic generation has been to American
community life just as its members are retiring. 
<P>
Unless America experiences a dramatic upward boost in civic engagement (a favorable "period effect") in the next few years, Americans in 2010 will join, trust, and vote even less than we do today.
<P>
In an astonishingly prescient book, <I>Technologies without Borders,</I> published in 1991 after his death, Pool concluded that the electronic revolution in communications technology was the first major technological advance in centuries that would have a profoundly decentralizing and fragmenting effect on society and culture. He hoped that the result might be "community without contiguity." As a classic liberal, he welcomed the benefits of technological change for individual freedom, and in part, I share that enthusiasm. Those of us who bemoan the decline of community in contemporary America need to be sensitive to the liberating gains achieved during the same
decades. We need to avoid an uncritical nostalgia for the fifties. 
<P>
On the other hand, some of the same freedom-friendly technologies whose rise Pool predicted may indeed be undermining our
connections with one another and with our communities. Pool defended what he called "soft technological determinism" because he recognized that social values can condition the effects of
technology. This perspective invites us not merely to consider how technology is privatizing our lives--if, as it seems to me, it is--but to ask whether we like the result, and if not, what we might do
about it. 
<P>
Those are questions we should, of course, be asking together, not alone.

Getting what we want
by William Stevenson, Princeton University,  February 1996
<PRE>  </PRE>
In his article "The Strange Disappearance of Civic America," Robert Putnam argues that the most likely cause of the decline in America's civic capital is the television. Why does televison cause this? Look
at the medium and the message.
<P>
Civic capital is "the features of social--networks, norms, and trust--that enable participants to act together more effectively to pursue shared objectives," says Putnam in his essay. 
<P>
The decline is measured by a number of factors. In a survey done in 1965, 1975 and 1985 where people recorded all activities for a day, the average American spent time socializing (about 25%) and even less
time engaged in civic activities (about 50%) such as the fraternal societies and volunteer organizations. Furthermore, a General Social
Survey conducted every two years for over twenty years, notes a one-third drop in trust since 1974. 
<P>
Of many possible reasons television seems be the culprit. Analysing generational trends puts the decline's roots in the 1940s or1950s.
The average American watches four hours of television per day. This consumes over half of the average American's free time. The act of
watching television is inherently non-social.  Not only does it displace time which could be spent building social capital, it seems to inhibit doing so even when not watching. 
<P>
The reasons for television's negative impact on civic society two-fold: the medium and the message.
<P>
Television, with few exceptions, is a one-way medium. It is simply consumed. The viewer can only control which channel to watch, but he can't control information coming through that channel.  The information presented is in such a flux as to be difficult to even engage one's mind with the material. Quite simply television as a medium leads to quiescence. 
<P>
Telvision as a message presents a narrow view of life. Soap operas and talk shows mostly the negative side of people. The news, especially local news, seems to focus on death and destruction.
<P>
Yet, this is exactly the kind of programming people want. Yes, there is the Discovery Channel and PBS, but these are not the programs for which most people watch tv. Where does this desire for these programs come from if they didn't exist in the 50's? 
<P>
The present message from television is in its second iteration. To see why we must return to the medium.  People went from Beaver Cleaver to Sally Jesse Raphael because television, even without negative programming, destroys civic capital. The quiescence television
fosters disengages people from the community.  This disengagement in turn taints people's perception of society. This tainted perception produces a desire for the kind of programming we mostly see today. 
<P>
As we move into the third iteration of this reinforcing cycle, the programming will worsen. People get what they want.

PRESSURES OF TIME AND MONEY
<P>
Americans certainly feel busier now than a generation ago: The proportion of us who report feeling "always rushed" jumped by half between the mid-1960s and the mid-1990s. Probably the most
obvious suspect behind our tendency to drop out of community affairs is pervasive busy-ness. And lurking nearby in the shadows are economic pressures so much discussed nowadays, from job insecurity to declining real wages.
<P>
Yet, however culpable busy-ness and economic insecurity may appear at first glance, it is hard to find incriminating evidence. In the first place, time-budget studies do not confirm the thesis that
Americans are, on average, working longer than a generation ago. On the contrary, a new study by John Robinson and Geoffrey Godbey of the University of Maryland reports a five hour per week gain in free time for the average American between 1965 and 1985, due partly to reduced time spent on housework and partly to earlier retirement. Their claim that Americans have more leisure time now than several decades ago is, to be sure, contested by other observers, notably Juliet Schor, who in her 1991 book <I>The Overworked American</I> reports evidence that work hours are lengthening, especially for women. 
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="putnam1.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>Figure 1."Education and Civic Life" shows a strong correlation between social trust and group membership on the one hand and and years of education on the other.
__________________________________________________________________________
    
<P>
But whatever the resolution of that controversy, other data call into question whether longer hours at work lead to lessened involvement in civic life or reduced social trust. Results from the GSS show that employed people belong to somewhat more groups than those outside the paid labor force. Even more striking is the fact that among workers, longer hours are linked to more civic engagement. The patterns among men and women on this score are not identical: Women who work part-time appear to be somewhat more civicly engaged and socially trusting than either those who work full-time or those who do not work outside the home at all--an intriguing anomaly, though not relevant to our basic puzzle, since female part-time workers constitute a relatively small fraction of the American population, and the fraction is growing, up from about 8 percent to about 10 percent between the early 1970s and early 1990s.
<P>
But what do workaholics do less? Robinson reports that, unsurprisingly, people who spend more time at work do feel more rushed, and these harried souls do spend less time eating, sleeping, reading books, engaging in hobbies, and just doing nothing. Compared to the rest of the population, they also spend a lot less time watching television, almost 30 percent less. However, they do not spend less time on organizational activity. In short, those who work longer forego Nightline, but not the Kiwanis club; ER, but not the Red Cross.
<P>
So hard work does not prevent civic engagement. Moreover, the nationwide falloff in joining and trusting is perfectly mirrored among full-time workers, among part-time workers, and among those
outside the paid labor force. So if people are dropping out of community life, long hours do not seem to be the reason.
<P>
If time pressure is not the culprit, how about financial pressures? It is true that people with lower incomes and those who feel financially strapped are somewhat less engaged in community life and
somewhat less trusting than those who are better off, even holding education constant. On the other hand, the downtrends in social trust and civic engagement are visible among people of all incomes, with no sign whatever that they are concentrated among those who have borne the brunt of the economic distress of the last two decades. 
<P>
Quite the contrary, the declines in engagement and trust are actually somewhat greater among the more affluent segments of the American public than among the poor and middle-income wage-earners. Moreover, personal financial satisfaction is wholly uncorrelated with civic engagement and social trust. In short, neither objective nor subjective economic well-being has inoculated Americans against the virus of civic disengagement; if anything, affluence has slightly exacerbated the problem. Poverty and economic inequality are dreadful, growing problems for America, but they are not the villains of this piece.
<PRE>  </PRE>

THE CHANGING ROLE OF WOMEN
<P>
Most of our mothers were housewives, and most of them invested heavily in social capital formation--a jargony way of referring to untold unpaid hours in church suppers, PTA meetings, neighborhood coffee klatches, and visits to friends and relatives. The movement of women out of the home and into the paid labor force is probably the most portentous social change of the last half century. However welcome and overdue the feminist revolution may be, it is hard to believe that it has had no impact on social connectedness. Could this be the primary reason for the decline of social capital over the last generation?
<P>
Some patterns in the survey evidence seem to support this claim. All things considered, women belong to somewhat fewer voluntary associations than men do. On the other hand, time-budget studies suggest that women spend more time on those groups and more time in informal social connecting than men. Although the absolute declines in joining and trusting are approximately equivalent among men and women, the relative declines are somewhat greater among women. Controlling for education, memberships among men have declined at a rate of about 10-15 percent a decade, compared to about 20-25 percent a decade for women. The time-budget data, too, strongly suggest that the decline in organizational involvement in recent years is concentrated among women. These sorts of facts, coupled with the obvious transformation in the professional role of women over this same period, led me in previous work to suppose that the emergence of two-career families might be the most important single factor in the erosion of social capital.
<P>
As we saw earlier, however, work status itself seems to have little net impact on group membership or on trust. Housewives belong to different types of groups than do working women (more PTAs,
for example, and fewer professional associations), but in the aggregate working women are actually members of slightly more voluntary associations (though housewives, according to Robinson and Godbey, spend more time on them). Moreover, the overall declines in civic engagement are somewhat greater among housewives than among employed women. Comparison of time-budget data between 1965 and 1985 seems to show that employed women as a group are actually spending more time on organizations than before, while housewives are spending less. This same
study suggests that the major decline in informal socializing since 1965 has also been concentrated among housewives. The central fact, of course, is that the overall trends are down for all categories
of women (and for men, too, even bachelors), but the figures suggest that women who work full-time actually may have been more resistant to the slump in civic engagement than those who do not.
<P>
Thus, although women appear to have borne a disproportionate share of the decline in civic engagement over the last two decades, it is not easy to find any micro-level data that tie that fact directly to their entry into the labor force. Of course, women who have chosen to enter the workforce doubtless differ in many respects from women who have chosen to stay home. Perhaps one reason that community involvement appears to be rising among working women and declining among housewives is that precisely the sort of women who, in an earlier era, were most involved with their communities have been disproportionately likely to enter the workforce, thus lowering the average level of civic engagement among the remaining homemakers and raising the average among women in the workplace.
<P>
No doubt the movement of women into the workplace over the last generation has changed the types of organizations to which they belong. Contrary to my own earlier speculations, however, I can find little evidence to support the hypothesis that this movement has played a major role in the net reduction of social connectedness and civic engagement. On the other hand, I have no clear alternative explanation for the fact that the relative declines are greater among women, both those who work outside the home and those who don't, than among men. Since this evidence is at best circumstantial, perhaps the best interim judgment here is the famous Scots verdict: not proven.

<PRE>  </PRE>

MARRIAGE AND FAMILY
<P>
Another widely discussed social trend that more or less coincides with the downturn in civic engagement is the breakdown of the traditional family unit--mom, dad, and the kids. Since the family itself is, by some accounts, a key form of social capital, perhaps its eclipse is part of the explanation for the reduction in joining and trusting in the wider community. What does the evidence show?
<P>
First of all, evidence of the loosening of family bonds is unequivocal. In addition to the century-long increase in divorce rates (which accelerated from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s and then leveled off), and the more recent increase in single-parent families, the incidence of one-person households has more than doubled since 1950, in part because of the rising number of widows living alone. The net effect of all these changes, as reflected in the General Social Survey, is that the proportion of all American adults currently unmarried climbed from 28 percent in 1974 to 48 percent in 1994.
<P>
Second, married men and women do rank somewhat higher on both our measures of social capital. That is, controlling for education, age, race, and so on, single people--both men and women, divorced, separated, and never married--are significantly less trusting and less engaged civicly than married people. (Multivariate analysis hints that one major reason why divorce lowers connectedness is that it lowers family income, which in turn reduces civic engagement.)  Roughly speaking, married men and women are about a third more trusting and belong to about 15-25 percent more groups than comparable single men and women. (Widows and widowers are more like married people than single people in this comparison.)
<P>
In short, successful marriage, especially if the family includes children, is statistically associated with greater social trust and civic engagement. Thus, some part of the decline in both trust and
membership is tied to the decline in marriage. To be sure, the direction of causality behind this correlation may be complicated, since it is conceivable that loners and paranoids are harder to live with. If so, divorce may in some degree be the consequence, not the cause, of lower social capital.
<P>
Probably the most reasonable summary of these arrays of data, however, is that the decline in successful marriage is a significant, though modest part of the reason for declining trust and lower group membership. On the other hand, changes in family structure cannot be a major part of our story, since the overall declines in joining and trusting are substantial even among the happily married. My own verdict (based in part on additional evidence to be introduced later) is that the disintegration of marriage is probably an accessory to the crime, but not the major villain of the piece.
<PRE>  </PRE>

THE RISE OF THE WELFARE STATE
<P>
Circumstantial evidence, particularly the timing of the downturn in social connectedness, has suggested to some observers that an important cause--perhaps even the cause--is big government and the growth of the welfare state. By "crowding out" private initiative, it is argued, state intervention has subverted civil society.
<P>
Some government policies have almost certainly had the effect of destroying social capital. For example, the so-called "slum clearance" policies of the 1950s and 1960s replaced physical capital, but destroyed social capital, by disrupting existing community ties. It is also conceivable that certain social expenditures and tax policies may have created disincentives for civic-minded philanthropy.
<P>
On the other hand, it is much harder to see which government policies might be responsible for the decline in bowling leagues and literary clubs. Some community institutions sponsored, organized, or
subsidized by government, such as National Service, agricultural extension programs, and Head Start, may enhance trust and social capital. Which effect prevails needs to be resolved with evidence, not ideology.
<P>
One empirical approach to this issue is to examine differences in civic engagement and public policy across different political jurisdictions to see whether enlarged government leads to shriveled social capital. Among the U.S. states, however, differences in social capital appear essentially uncorrelated with various measures of welfare spending or government size. Citizens in free-spending states are no less trusting or engaged than citizens in frugal ones. 
<P>
Cross-national comparison can also shed light on this question. Among nineteen member countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for which data on social trust and group membership are available from the 1990-1991 World Values Survey, these indicators of social capital are, if anything, positively correlated with the size of the state. This simple bivariate analysis, of course, cannot tell us whether social connectedness encourages welfare spending, whether the welfare state fosters civic engagement, or whether both are the result of some other unmeasured factor(s). Even this simple finding, however, is not easily reconciled with the notion that big government undermines social capital.  <I>(cont'd)</I>

Dispite overwhelming controversy over gays in the military in early 1993--mostly negative--this positive 1993 RAND study never got news coverage when completed <I>at the time,</I> nor did Senator Sam Nunn's hearings call any witnesses to comment on the study which reportedly cost the Pentagon $1.2 million. The research is comprehensive, covering the successful integration of gays in numerous militaries throughout the world and giving specific recommendations on how gay personnel can be successfully integrated the U.S. military.
<P>
The abstract is found below. Suggest you order the study itself which is fascinating reading. RAND is one of the main think tanks of the Pentagon. It is located in Santa Monica. You can order the study via the <A HREF="http://www.rand.org/cgi-bin/Abstracts/e-getabbydoc.pl?MR-323"> RAND Web page site.</A>

Sexual Orientation and U.S. Military <BR>Personnel Policy: Options and Assessment.<BR>

ABSTRACT: This report presents the RAND study that resulted from a request to assist the Secretary of Defense Aspen in drafting an Executive Order to end discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the U.S. Armed Forces. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, a team of RAND researchers visited seven foreign countries and the police and fire departments in six American cities, seeking insights and lessons from analogous experiences there. The team considered the integration of blacks and the development of the current policy that prohibits homosexuals from serving in the military. It reviewed public opinion, including the views of current active-duty military personnel, and the scientific literature on group cohesion, sexuality, and related health issues. It examined a number of legal and enforcement issues, as well as the literature that deals with implementing change in large organizations. 
<P>
Based on the research findings, the study group found that the most promising policy option for achieving the President's objectives focuses on conduct and considers sexual orientation, by itself, as not germane in determining who may serve in the Armed Forces. As part of the study an illustrative "Standard of Professional Conduct" was also designed with the over-arching objective of maintaining the order and discipline essential for an effective military organization. The report also notes that if sexual orientation is regarded as not germane in determining who may serve in the military, it is equally not relevant to decisions on assignment, pay, military sociality, and benefits. The manner in which such a policy change is implemented could have a decisive impact on the acceptance of the new policy by the military. 
<P>
Based upon the research conducted in this study, key elements of an implementation strategy were identified: (1) the message of policy change must be clear and must be consistently communicated from the top; (2) the option selected should be implemented immediately; 
(3) emphasis should be placed on behavior and conduct, not on teaching tolerance or sensitivity; (4) leadership must send messages of reassurance to the force;<BR> (5) leaders at all levels should be empowered to implement the policy, with special training provided if necessary; and (6) a monitoring process should be established to identify problems early in the process and to address them immediately. 
<P>
The option presented in this report appears to meet the President's criteria, and is consistent with the empirical research and historical experience. By following the implementation strategy, the Department of Defense should be able to increase the probability that a policy that ends discrimination based on sexual orientation can be implemented in
a practical and realistic manner.

Political Communications<BR>
COURSE DESCRIPTION AND READING LIST
<P>
Instructor: Dr. Jonathan Rose, Queens University, Ottawa</CENTER>
<PRE>   </PRE>
Political communication may be defined in a number of ways. Denton and Woodward describe it in a Laswellian manner, "public discussion about the allocation of public resources (money), official
authority (who decides), and official sanctions (what is to be rewarded)". Murray Edelman sees political communication as a spectacle; the conscious or subconscious creation of images, problems
and antagonisms. Some Marxists, such as Louis Althusser, see political communication as part of the ongoing and pervasive set of communication practices which transcends classes. All definitions, to
some extent, explain how the state, explicitly or otherwise, uses communication apparatuses to ensure consent and legitimacy. 
<P>
Thus, political communication can take many forms, from the overt such as political advertising and propaganda to the subtle such as the creation and propagation of myths and symbols of the state. They can be embedded in the entertainment of popular culture or take the guise of  information found in news. This course is designed to introduce students to the variety of contexts in which
political communication takes place and help us understand how it affects our political institutions and democratic practices. 
<P>
The role of the mass media will also be examined in depth. Issues such as the influence of the mass media in agenda setting, the ability of the media to prepare citizens for the demands of a liberal
democracy and the effect of their ownership structure on news coverage will be some of the areas covered.

The balance of the course will be spent discussing issues and topics relevant to the study of political communication.  Each of the following weeks we will have two 30 minute seminar presentations, each followed by a student lead critique and class discussion.  The purpose of the student critiques is to help provide direction to the presenter's term paper.  Comments should thus be directed at argumentation, logic and use of sources.  

The readings accompanying the seminar topics are merely guidelines to steer the class for the assigned topic.  The assumption is that the presenter will have read more.  Students should consult with me early on for additional readings.

<PRE>    </PRE>
<I>Political Communication By Other Means:</I>

<P>
a) Popular Culture
<P>
What messages are communicated in television or movies?    How
does this reinforce/create stereotypes?  What are the democratic
ramifications of this?  Students wishing to write in this area
should familiarize themselves with the debates of this subfield.
See the debate between Cultural Studies and Political Economy in
the June 1995 issue of Critical Studies in Communications
<P>
b) The Editorial Cartoon
<P>
How do they differ across the country, or from country to
country?  What do they tell us about the way we think about
politics?  The Canadian Centre for Caricature in Ottawa is an
excellent resource.
<P>
c) Political socialization through television
<P>
How does television shape values and political ideas?  Is there
a liberating role for television?  A good starting place is
Michael Ignatieff, "Is Nothing Sacred?  The Ethics of
Television", Daedalus 114:4 pp. 57-78.
<P>
d) The Internet as "Samizdat"
<P>
The role of the internet has greatly increased access to many
new ideas to those who may have been politically alienated.  In
what way does the internet serve the role of an underground
communications system?  In what ways does it create community?
(See Howard Rheingold, The Virtual Community (New York:  Harper, 1993)  Does it provide those without access to the tools of
communication a ready made channel of communication?  To what
extent is it used as a subversive form of communication?  Is the
internet merely another vehicle for capitalism?  (On this last
question, see "Electronic Money... So Much for the Cashless
Society" in The Economist, November 26, 1994, pp. 21-23.
<P>
e)  "Political Correctness" and Communication
<P>
Is "political correctness" in communication a way of bringing in
previously disenfranchised citizens or a limitation of freedom
of expression?  See the special issue on this subject in Journal
of Communication (Spring 1992).
<P>
f)  Architecture and Politics
<P>
Archictecture is greatly influenced by politics and politics 
influences styles of archictecture.  In what way can architecture be seen as another means of state communication?  How are the values of architecture related to democracy?  Some intial sources include Marshall Berman, All that is Solid Melts Into Air, New York:  Viking, 1988 Chapter 5; Linda Hutcheon, The Politics of Postmodernism, Routledge, 1990;  Mike Davis, "Urban Renaissance and the Spirit of Postmodernism" in E. Ann Kaplan, Postmodernism and Its Discontents, London:  Verso, 1990,  Bertrand Russell, "Architecture and Social Questions" in his In Praise of Idleness and Other Essays, London:  Unwin,   1935.

<font size=5>T</font size=5>he Real News Page is not a periodical but a fluid center of thought-provoking analysis of the news media (and <I>all</I> of media), with particular focus on the effects of commercial media on politics and society. 
<P>
You'll find frequent updates up front in the "newsletter" section.  These are often time-dated items of current interest. FAIR's weekly "CounterSpin" radio scripts are here, for example. Sometimes updates are new discoveries of old stories. 
<P>
Below this you'll find a "library" of core pieces reflecting on the media in various ways. Most of these essays, articles, photos and links are essentially timeless and will remain up online for as long as they hold relevance. For many, that will be a long time. There is also an "archive." 
<P>
The intent of The Real News Page is to stimulate interest, learning, activism, vocality--to shake up the subject of commercial media and see what falls out of the pockets. We look again at the whole shebang. This collection is far from comprehensive but it's a start for people who want to get a handle on how to start thinking about this extraordinary subject.
<P>
"The Media Discussion Center" is a special feature, attracting average citizens as well as media professionals who can let their hair down behind screen names. 
<PRE>    </PRE>
<font size=5>W</font size=5>e're not going to get far until we as citizens/consumers realize that we are reponsible for what we get in media because we are the media's market. Seen from the point of view of media managment, we are a carpet of demographic statistics. But as the consuming market, we are actually <I>not</I> a passive surface to be walked upon--after all, we do the buying. We have a voice, a choice, a free and moral will that can be activated.  The Real News Page lights a candle--a torch--instead of cursing the darkness--and does so with a liberal flair.
<P>
This is not a quickie page.  The subject of media is awesome in its implications. <BR>This page is intended to be too much for one sitting, so you can think about it between sittings. You'll return several times before getting through it all, like going to school, and the page is refreshed frequently as a continuing education. 
<P>
The span of The Real News Page is broad and bristling:  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
From Robert Putnam's research associating America's decline in civic involvement (including voting) with the rise of televison and media technology ....  
<P>
.... to new work in human development to educate other brain systems  <I>in addition</I> to the left hemisphere whose talent for technology is running a bit haywire. 
<P>
From "missing stories" like caught-with-our-pants-down news coverage of  militias and Christian Identity's seething anti-Semitism and white supremacy.... 
<P>
.... to the budding "public journalism" movement around the country. 
<P>
From propaganda analysis of the loaded code words of Pat Buchanan, Newt Gingrich and Helen Chenoweth as they bridge directly into the small-minded "fringe" ....
<P>
.... to the frenzied coverage of Whitewater, summarized here as "Mediagate."
<P>
From the question of the child's artificial control of the TV set <I>itself</I> .... 
<P>
.... to the prospect of the creating Internet introverts in millions of our children
<P>
.... to the leap that must be made to "The New Story"--where we go from here in terms of human development. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Real News Page challenges media consumers to become active and to insist on better media products, while also calling for the news media to follow the good editor's advice (yes, there are good editors): "Don't make us money, make us <I>proud</I> and the money will come--by paying better attention to real news of real significance to human life." 
<P>
The Real News Page only scratches the surface of the immense and elusive subject of media, but deep enough that you wouldn't want it to happen to your car door. Fasten your seat belts, folks .... 
<P>
If it's in time, it's education. If it's too late, it's news.
<P>
Let's get ahead of the curve.
<P>
Enjoy!
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To my friends in print and broadcasting, you know who you are who do a great job, but you know we've got a problem with commercial media's effect on politics and society. This is one major focus of The Real News Page. 
<P>
Also featured are under-reported or "missing stories" on topics like hate groups and complex political matters such as the Gingrich ethics case where big city/national print and broadcast outlets may do important investigative reports but the information doesn't trickle down to (or isn't picked up by) local news media. In other words, we're dealing with a "constipated" system of news dissemination in addition to a situation at all levels wherein the breadth and depth of news content is limited by corporate/consumerist and time/space considerations. 

<P>James Fallows has written a good book on all this (<I>Breaking the News</I>)<BR>in which he argues that the news media (plural) are adversely affecting American democracy. Perhaps so. You decide--and get media-active.

<font size=5>T</font size=5>oday I want to talk about a subject that can provoke a fight in nearly any country town or on any
city street corner in America -- religion. Its a subject that should not drive us apart. And we have a
mechanism as old as our Constitution for bringing us together. 
<P>
This country, after all, was founded by people of profound faith who mentioned Divine Providence
and the guidance of God twice in the Declaration of Independence. They were searching for a place
to express their faith freely without persecution. We take it for granted today that thats so in this
country, but it was not always so. And it certainly has not always been so across the world. Many of
the people who were our first settlers came here primarily because they were looking for a place
where they could practice their faith without being persecuted by the government. 
<P>
Here in Virginias soil, as the Secretary of Education has said, the oldest and deepest roots of
religious liberty can be found. The First Amendment was modeled on Thomas Jeffersons Statutes of
Religious Liberty for Virginia. He thought so much of it that he asked that on his gravestone it be said
not that he was President, not that he had been Vice President or Secretary of State, but that he was
the founder of the University of Virginia, the author of the Declaration of Independence and the
author of the Statues of Religious Liberty for the state of Virginia. 
<P>
And of course, no one did more than James Madison to put the entire Bill of Rights in our
Constitution, and especially, the First Amendment. 
<P>
Religious freedom is literally our first freedom. It is the first thing mentioned in the Bill of Rights,
which opens by saying that Congress cannot make a law that either establishes a religion or restricts
the free exercise of religion. Now, as with every provision of our Constitution, that law has had to be
interpreted over the years, and it has been in various ways that some of us agree with and some of us
disagree with. But one thing is indisputable: the First Amendment has protected our freedom to be
religious or not religious, as we choose, with the consequence that in this highly secular age the
United States is clearly the most conventionally religious country in the entire world, at least the entire
industrialized world. 
<P>
We have more than 250,000 places of worship. More people go to church here every week, or to
synagogue, or to a mosque or other place of worship than in any other country in the world. More
people believe religion is directly important to their lives than in any other advanced, industrialized
country in the world. And it is not an accident. It is something that has always been a part of our life. 
<P>
I grew up in Arkansas which is, except for West Virginia, probably the most heavily Southern
Baptist Protestant state in the country. But we had two synagogues and a Greek Orthodox church in
my hometown. Not so long ago in the heart of our agricultural country in Eastern Arkansas one of
our universities did a big outreach to students in the Middle East, and before you knew it, out there
on this flat land where there was no building more than two stories high, there rose a great mosque.
And all the farmers from miles around drove in to see what the mosque was like and to try and figure
out what was going on there. 
<P>
This is a remarkable country. And I have tried to be faithful to the tradition that we have in the First
Amendment. Its something thats very important to me. 
<P>
Georgetown is a Jesuit school, a Catholic school. Secretary Riley mentioned that when I was there,
all the Catholics were required to take theology, and those of us who werent Catholic took a course
in world religions, which we called Buddhism for Baptists. And I began a sort of love affair with the
religions that I did not know anything about before that time. 
<P>
Its a personal thing to me because of my own religious faith and the faith of my family. Ive always
felt that in order for me to be free to practice my faith in this country, I had to let other people be as
free as possible to practice theirs, and that the government had an extraordinary obligation to bend
over backwards not to do anything to impose any set of views on any group of people or to allow
others to do so under the cover of law. 
<P>
<P><CENTER>________________________________________________________

__________________________________________________________</CENTER>
<P>
Thats why one of the proudest things Ive been able to do as President was to sign into law the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993. It was designed to reverse the decision of the Supreme
Court that essentially made it pretty easy for government, in the pursuit of its legitimate objectives, to
restrict the exercise of peoples religious liberties. This law basically said -- I wont use the legalese
-- that if the government is going to restrict anybodys legitimate exercise of religion they have to
have an extraordinarily good reason and no other way to achieve their compelling objective other
than to do this. You have to bend over backwards to avoid getting in the way of peoples legitimate
exercise of their religious convictions. Thats what that law said. 
<P>
That is the kind of thing Ive tried to do throughout my career. When I was governor of Arkansas in
the 80s, there were religious leaders going to jail in America because they ran child care centers that
they refused to have certified by the state because they said it undermined their ministry. We solved
that problem in our state. There were people who were prepared to go to jail over the home
schooling issue in the 80s because they said it was part of their religious ministry. We solved that
problem in our state. 
<P>
With the Religious Freedom Restoration Act we made it possible, clearly, in areas that were
previously ambiguous for Native Americans, for American Jews, for Muslims to practice the full
range of their religious practices when they might have otherwise come in contact with some
governmental regulation. 
<P>
And in a case that was quite important to the Evangelicals in our country, I instructed the Justice
Department to change our position after the law passed on a tithing case where a family had been
tithing to their church and the man declared bankruptcy, and the government took the position they
could go get the money away from the church because he knew he was bankrupt at the time he gave
it. And I realized that in some ways that was a close question, but I thought we had to stand up for
the proposition that people should be able to practice their religious convictions. 
<P>
Secretary Riley and I, in another context, have also learned as we have gone along in this work that
all the religions obviously share a certain devotion to a certain set of values which make a big
difference in the schools. I want to commend Secretary Riley for his relentless support of the
so-called character education movement in our schools, which has clearly led in many schools that
had great troubles to reduced drop-out rates, increased performance in schools, better citizenship in
ways that didnt promote any particular religious views but at least unapologetically advocated values
shared by all major religions. 
<P>
One of the reasons I wanted to come here is because I recognize that this work has been done here
in this school. Theres a course in this school called Combatting Intolerance, which deals not only
with racial issues, but also with religious differences, and studies times in the past when people have
been killed in mass numbers and persecuted because of their religious convictions. 
<P>
You can make a compelling argument that the tragic war in Bosnia today is more of a religious war
than an ethnic war. The truth is, biologically, there is no difference in the Serbs, the Croats and the
Muslims. They are Catholics, Orthodox Christians and Muslims, and they are so for historic reasons.
But its really more of a religious war than an ethnic war when properly viewed. And I think its very
important that the people in this school are learning and, in the process, will come back to the fact
that every great religion teaches honesty and trustworthiness and responsibility and devotion to
family, and charity and compassion toward others. 
<P>
Our sense of our own religion and our respect for others has really helped us to work together for
two centuries. Its made a big difference in the way we live and the way we function and our ability
to overcome adversity. The Constitution wouldnt be what it is without James Madisons religious
values. But its also, frankly, given us a lot of elbow room. I remember, for example, that Abraham
Lincoln was derided by his opponents because he belonged to no organized church. But if you read
his writings and you study what happened to him, especially after he came to the White House, he
might have had more spiritual depth than any person ever to hold the office that I now have the
privilege to occupy. 
<P>
So we have followed this balance, and it has served us well. Now what I want to talk to you about
for a minute is that our Founders understood that religious freedom was basically a coin with two
sides. The Constitution protected the free exercise of religion, but prohibited the establishment of
religion. Its a careful balance thats uniquely American. It is the genius of the First Amendment. It
does not, as some people have implied, make us a religion-free country. It has made us the most
religious country in the world. 
<P>
Lets just take the areas of greatest controversy now: All the fights over the past 200 years have
been over what those two things mean: What does it mean for the government to establish a religion,
and what does it mean for a government to interfere with the free exercise of religion? The Religious
Freedom Restoration Act was designed to clarify the second provision -- government interfering
with the free exercise of religion -- and to say you can do that almost never. You can do that almost
never. 
<P>
We have had a lot more fights in the last 30 years over what the government establishment of religion
means. And thats what the whole debate is now over the issue of school prayer, religious practices
in the schools and things of that kind. I want to talk about it because our schools are the places
where so much of our hearts are in America, and where all of our futures are. And Id like to begin
by just pointing out whats going on today and then discussing it if I could. And, again, this is always
kind of inflammatory; I want to have a noninflammatory talk about it. 
<P>
First of all, let me tell you a little about my personal history. Before the Supreme Courts decision in
Engel against Vitale, which said that the state of New York could not write a prayer that had to be
said in every school in New York every day, school prayer was as common as apple pie in my
hometown. And when I was in junior high school, it was my responsibility either to start every day
by reading the Bible or get somebody else to do it. Needless to say, I exerted a lot of energy in
finding someone else to do it from time to time, being a normal 13-year-old boy. 
<P>
Now, you could say, well, it certainly didnt do any harm; it might have done a little good. But
remember what I told you. We had two synagogues in my hometown.  There were no blacks in my school because they were in a segregated school.
And I can tell you that all of us who were in there being "religious" never gave a second thought most of the
time to the fact that we didnt have blacks in our schools and that there were Jews in the classroom
who were probably deeply offended by half the stuff we were saying or doing -- or maybe made to
feel inferior. 
<P>
I say that to make the point that we have not become less religious over the last 30 years by saying
that schools cannot impose a particular religion, even if its a Christian religion and 98 percent of the
kids in the schools are Christian and Protestant. Im not sure the Catholics were always comfortable
with what we did either. We had a big Catholic population in my school and in my hometown. So I
have been a part of this debate we are talking about. This is a part of my personal life experience. I
have seen a lot of progress made and I agreed with the Supreme Courts original decision in Engel v.
Vitale. 
<P>
Now, since then, Ive not always agreed with every decision the Supreme Court made in the area of
the First Amendment. I said the other day I didnt agree with the decision concerning the Rabbi who
was asked to give the nonsectarian prayer at the commencement. I didnt agree with that because I
didnt think it involved any coercion at all. I thought that people were not interfered with, and I didnt
think it amounted to the establishment of a religious practice by the government. So I have not
always agreed. 
<P>
But I do believe that on balance, the direction of the First Amendment has been very good for
America and has made us the most religious country in the world by keeping the government out of
creating religion, supporting particular religions, and interfering with other peoples religious
practices. 
<P>

__________________________________________________________</CENTER>
<P>

What is giving rise to so much of this debate today I think is two things. One is the feeling that the
schools are special and a lot of kids are in trouble, and a lot of kids are in trouble for nonacademic
reasons, and we want our kids to have good values and a good future. 
<P>
Let me give you just one example. Today, there is a new study of drug use among young people
being released by the group that Joe Califano was associated with -- The Council for a Drug-Free
America -- Its a massive poll of young people themselves. Its a an important study and I urge all of
you to get it. Joe came in a couple of days ago and briefed me on it. It shows disturbingly that even
though serious drug use is down overall in groups in America, casual drug use is coming back up
among some of our young people who no longer believe that its dangerous and have forgotten thats
its wrong and are basically living in a world that I think is very destructive. 
<P>
And I see it all the time. Its coming back up, even though were investing money and trying to
combat it in education and treatment programs, and supporting things like the DARE program. And
were breaking more drug rings than ever before around the world. Its very disturbing because its
fundamentally something that is kind of creeping back in. 
<P>
But the study shows that there are three major causes for young people not using drugs. One is they
believe that their future depends upon their not doing it; theyre optimistic about the future. The more
optimistic kids are about the future, the less likely they are to use drugs. 
<P>
Second is having a strong, positive relationship with their parents. The closer kids are to their parents
and the more tuned in to them they are, and the more their parents are good role models, the less
likely kids are to use drugs. 
<P>
You know what the third is? How religious the children are. The more religious the children are, the
less likely they are to use drugs. 
<P>
So whats the big fight over religion in the schools and what does it mean to us and why are people
so upset about it? I think there are basically three reasons. One is, most Americans believe that if
youre religious, personally religious, you ought to be able to manifest that anywhere at any time, in a
public or private place. Second, I think that most Americans are disturbed if they think that our
government is becoming anti-religious, instead of adhering to the firm spirit of the First Amendment
-- dont establish, dont interfere with, but respect. And the third thing is people worry about our
national character as manifest in the lives of our children. The crime rate is going down in almost
every major area in America today, but the rate of violent random crime among very young people is
still going up. 
<P>
So these questions take on a certain urgency today for personal reasons and for larger social
reasons. And this old debate that Madison and Jefferson started over 200 years ago is still being
spun out today basically as it relates to what can and cannot be done in our schools, and the whole
question, the specific question, of school prayer, although I would argue it goes way beyond that. 
<P>

So let me tell you what I think the law is and what were trying to do about it, since I like the First
Amendment, and I think were better off because of it, and I think that if you have two great pillars
-- the government cant establish and the government cant interfere with -- obviously there are
going to be a thousand different factual cases that will arise at any given time, and the courts from
time to time will make decisions that we dont all agree with, but the question is, are the pillars the
right pillars, and do we more or less come out in the right place over the long run.

<H4><font size=5>T</font size=5>he Supreme Court is like everybody else, its imperfect and so are we. Maybe theyre right and
were wrong. But we are going to have these differences. The fundamental balance that has been
struck it seems to me has been very good for America, but what is not good today is that people
assume that there is an anti-religious bias in the cumulative impact of these court decisions. So let me tell you what I think the law is today and what I have instructed the
Department of Education and the Department of Justice to do about it. 
<P>
The First Amendment does not -- I will say again -- <I>does not</I> convert our schools into religion-free
zones. If a student is told he cant wear a yarmulke, for example, we have an obligation to tell the
school the law says the student can, most definitely, wear a yarmulke to school. If a student is told
she cannot bring a Bible to school, we have to tell the school, no, the law guarantees her the right to
bring the Bible to school. 
<P>
There are those who do believe our schools should be value-neutral and that religion has no place
inside the schools. But I think that wrongly interprets the idea of the wall between church and state.
They are not the walls of the school. 
<P>
There are those who say that values and morals and religions have no place in public education; I
think that is wrong. First of all, the consequences of having no values are not neutral. The violence in
our streets is not value neutral. The movies we see arent value neutral. Television is not value
neutral. Too often we see expressions of human degradation, immorality, violence and debasement
of the human soul that have more influence and take more time and occupy more space in the minds
of our young people than any of the influences that are felt at school anyway. Our schools, therefore,
must be a barricade against this kind of degradation. And we can do it without violating the First
Amendment. 
<P>

I am deeply troubled that so many Americans feel that their faith is threatened by the mechanisms
that are designed to protect their faith. Over the past decade we have seen a real rise in these kind of
cultural tensions in America. Some people even say we have a culture war. There have been books
written about culture war, the culture of disbelief, all these sorts of trends arguing that many
Americans genuinely feel that a lot of our social problems today have arisen in large measure
because the country led by the government has made an assault on religious convictions. That is
fueling a lot of this debate today over what can and cannot be done in the schools. 
<P>
Much of the tension stems from the idea that religion is simply not welcome at all in what Professor
Carter at Yale has called "the public square." Americans feel that instead of celebrating their love for
God in public, theyre being forced to hide their faith behind closed doors. Thats wrong. Americans
should never have to hide their faith. But some Americans have been denied the right to express their
religion and that has to stop. That has happened and it has to stop. It is crucial that government does
not dictate or demand specific religious views, but equally crucial that government doesnt prevent
the expression of specific religious views. 
<P>
When the First Amendment is invoked as an obstacle to private expression of religion it is being
misused. Religion has a proper place in private and a proper place in public because the public
square belongs to all Americans. Its especially important that parents feel confident that their
children can practice religion. Thats why some families have been frustrated to see their children
denied even the most private forms of religious expression in public schools. It is rare, but these
things have actually happened. 
<P>
I know that most schools do a very good job of protecting students religious rights, but some
students in America have been prohibited from reading the Bible silently in study hall. 
<P>
Some student religious groups havent been allowed to publicize their meetings in the same way that
nonreligious groups can. Some students have been prevented even from saying grace before lunch.
That is rare, but it has happened and it is wrong. Wherever and whenever the religious rights of
children are threatened or suppressed, we must move quickly to correct it. We want to make it
easier and more acceptable for people to express and to celebrate their faith. 
<P>
Now, just because the First Amendment sometimes gets the balance a little bit wrong in specific
decisions by specific people doesnt mean theres anything wrong with the First Amendment. I still
believe the First Amendment as it is presently written permits the American people to do what they
need to do. Thats what I believe. Let me give you some examples and you see if you agree. 
<P>
First of all, the First Amendment does not require students to leave their religion at the schoolhouse
door. We wouldnt want students to leave the values they learn from religion, like honesty and
sharing and kindness, behind at the schoolhouse door, and reinforcing those values is an important
part of every schools mission. 
<P>
Some school officials and teachers and parents believe that the Constitution forbids any religious
expression at all in public schools. That is wrong. Our courts have made it clear that that is wrong. It
is also not a good idea. Religion is too important to our history and our heritage for us to keep it out
of our schools. Once again, it shouldnt be demanded, but as long as it is not sponsored by school
officials and doesnt interfere with other childrens rights, it mustnt be denied. 
<P>
For example, students can pray privately and individually whenever they want. They can say grace
themselves before lunch. There are times when they can pray out loud together. Student religious
clubs in high schools can and should be treated just like any other extracurricular club. They can
advertise their meetings, meet on school grounds, use school facilities just as other clubs can. When
students can choose to read a book to themselves, they have every right to read the Bible or any
other religious text they want. 
<P>
Teachers can and certainly should teach about religion and the contributions it has made to our
history, our values, our knowledge, to our music and our art in our country and around the world,
and to the development of the kind of people we are. Students can also pray to themselves --
preferably before tests, as I used to do. 
<P>
Students should feel free to express their religion and their beliefs in homework, through art work
and during class presentations, as long as its relevant to the assignment. If students can distribute
flyers or pamphlets that have nothing to do with the school, they can distribute religious flyers and
pamphlets on the same basis. If students can wear T-shirts advertising sports teams, rock groups or
politicians, they can also wear T-shirts that promote religion. If certain subjects or activities are
objectionable to their students or their parents because of their religious beliefs, then schools may,
and sometimes they must, excuse the students from those activities. 
<P>
Finally, even though the schools cant advocate religious beliefs, as I said earlier, they should teach
mainstream values and virtues. The fact that some of these values happen to be religious values does
not mean that they cannot be taught in our schools. 
<P>
All these forms of religious expression and worship are permitted and protected by the First
Amendment. That doesnt change the fact that some students havent been allowed to express their
beliefs in these ways. What we have to do is to work together to help all Americans understand
exactly what the First Amendment does. It protects freedom of religion by allowing students to pray,
and it protects freedom of religion by preventing schools from telling them how and when and what
to pray. The First Amendment keeps us all on common ground. We are allowed to believe and
worship as we choose without the government telling any of us what we can and cannot do. 
<P>
It is in that spirit that I am today directing the Secretary of Education and the Attorney General to
provide every school district in America before school starts this fall with a detailed explanation of
the religious expression permitted in schools, including all the things that Ive talked about today. I
hope parents, students, educators and religious leaders can use this directive as a starting point. I
hope it helps them to understand their differences, to protect students religious rights, and to f ind
common ground. I believe we can find that common ground. 
<P>
This past April a broad coalition of religious and legal groups -- Christian and Jewish, conservative
and liberal, Supreme Court advocates and Supreme Court critics -- put themselves on the solution
side of this debate. They produced a remarkable document called Religion in Public Schools: A
Joint Statement of Current Law. They put aside their deep differences and said, we all agree on
what kind of religious expression the law permits in our schools. My directive borrows heavily and
gratefully from their wise and thoughtful statement. This is a subject that could have easily divided
the men and women that came together to discuss it. But they moved beyond their differences and
that may be as important as the specific document they produced. 
<P>
I also want to mention over 200 religious and civic leaders who signed the Williamsburg Charter in
Virginia in 1988. That charter reaffirms the core principles of the First Amendment. We can live
together with our deepest differences and all be stronger for it. 
<P>
The charter signers are impressive in their own right and all the more impressive for their differences
of opinion, including Presidents Ford and Carter; Chief Justice Rehnquist and the late Chief Justice
Burger; Senator Dole and former Governor Dukakis; Bill Bennett and Lane Kirkland, the president
of the AFL-CIO; Norman Lear and Phyllis Schlafly signed it together; Coretta Scott King and
Reverend James Dobson. 
<P>
These people were able to stand up publicly because religion is a personal and private thing for
Americans which has to have some public expression. Thats how it is for me. Im pretty
old-fashioned about these things. I really do believe in the constancy of sin and the constant
possibility of forgiveness, the reality of redemption and the promise of a future life. But Im also a
Baptist who believes that salvation is primarily personal and private, and that my relationship is
directly with God and not through any intermediary. 
<P>
Other people can have different views. And Ive spent a good part of my life trying to understand
different religious views, celebrate them and figure out what brings us together.

<P>
I will say again, the First Amendment is a gift to us. And the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution
in broad ways so that it could grow and change, but hold fast to certain principles. They knew that
all people were fallible and would make mistakes from time to time. As I said, there are times when
the Supreme Court makes a decision, and if I disagree with it, one of us is wrong. Theres another
possibility: both of us could be wrong. Thats the way it is in human affairs. 
<P>
But what I want to say to the American people and what I want to say to you is that James Madison
and Thomas Jefferson did not intend to drive a stake in the heart of religion and to drive it out of our
public life. What they intended to do was to set up a system so that we could bring religion into our
public life and into our private life without any of us telling the other what to do. 
<P>
This is a big deal today. One county in America, Los Angeles County, has over 150 different racial
and ethnic groups in it -- over 150 different ones. How many religious views do you suppose are in
those groups? How many? Every significant religion in t he world is represented in significant
numbers in one American county, as are many smaller religious groups -- all in one American county.
<P>
We have got to get this right. We have got to get this right. And we have to keep this balance. This
country needs to be a place where religion grows and flourishes. 
<P>
Dont you believe that if every kid in every difficult neighborhood in America were in a religious
institution on the weekends, the synagogue on Saturday, a church on Sunday, a mosque on Friday,
dont you really believe that the drug rate, the crime rate, the violence rate, the sense of
self-destruction would go way down and the quality of the character of this country would go way
up? 
<P>
But dont you also believe that if for the last 200 years we had had a state governed religion, people
would be bored with it, and they would think it had been compromised by politicians, shaved around
the edges, imposed on them by people who didnt really conform to it, and we wouldnt have
250,000 houses of worship in America? I mean, we wouldnt. 
<P>
It may be imperfect, the First Amendment, but it is the nearest thing ever created in any human
society for the promotion of religion and religious values because it left us free to do it. And I
strongly believe that the government has made a lot of mistakes which we have tried to roll back in,
interfering with that around the edges. Thats what the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is all
about. Thats what this directive that Secretary Riley and the Justice Department and I have worked
so hard on is all about. Thats what our efforts to bring in people of different religious views are all
about. I strongly believe that we have erred when we have rolled it back too much. And I hope
that we can have a partnership with our churches in many ways to reach out to the young people
who need the values, the hope, the belief, the convictions that come with faith, and the sense of
security in a very uncertain and rapidly changing world. 
<P>
But keep in mind we have a chance to do it because of the heritage of America and the protection of
the First Amendment. We have to get it right. 
<P>
Thank you very much, and God bless you.

<H4><I><font color="#0000ff"><CENTER>A scaly dissent from Scalia by Rev. Jan Nunley+
</CENTER></font color="#0000ff"></I>
<PRE>  </PRE>


 

<font size=5>S</font size=5>calia's dissent is an appalling document, though not unexpected. In reading
it, I found myself hearing echoes of the kind of defensive polemic launched
by the National Socialists against the Jews of 1930s Germany: lesbians and
gays "reside in disproportionate numbers in certain communities" (Jews are
"cosmopolitan"); they have "high disposable income" (Jews are "rich"); they
"possess political power much greater than their numbers" and "enjoy enormous
influence in American media and politics" though "composing no more than 4%
of the population" (Jews "control" the banks, the media, etc.). 
<P>
No wonder Scalia refers, in his first sentence, to the battle over gay rights
as a "Kulturkampf." I'm reminded of Molly Ivins' reaction to Pat Buchanan's
1992 speech at the Republican National Convention: "It sounded better in the
original German." What's next, the "Protocols of the Elders of Castro
Street"?
<P>
Almost laughable is his analogy to the prohibition of polygamy in five
Western states, particularly the passage where he refers to "polygamists, and
those who have a 'polygamous' orientation . . ." Nowhere in the annals of
psychology or psychiatry is there any such "polygamous orientation"! This
rhetorical attempt to broaden the clear definition of sexual orientation
beyond all recognition is a favorite tactic of the Right. Usually, it's used
to imply that certain repugnant paraphilias (pedophilia, necrophilia, etc.)
will be able to find shelter under laws prohibiting discrimination against
lesbians, gays and bisexuals. This is the first time I've seen it used with
regard to a religious sexual-behavior choice, i.e. Mormon polygamy, but I
suppose it's consistent with Scalia's attitude that there is no true sexual
orientation besides his own, and all others are aberrant "choices" to be
universally despised as deviant.
<P>
What's also intriguing is the faux-populist stance he takes: that his fellows
on the Court reflect an "elite class" from which they are selected. This is a
particularly demagogic gem: "When the Court takes sides in the culture wars,
it tends to be with the knights rather than the villeins--and more
specifically with the Templars, reflecting the views and values of the lawyer
class from which the Court's Members are drawn." This, for a Court with a
Republican majority, appointed in the main by Presidents Reagan and Bush,
champions of the erstwhile "villeins"?
<P>
No, Mr. Scalia, it wasn't the "villeins" but the villains who went down to
defeat: those who would use the tyranny of the majority to deprive a minority
of their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--and deprive
local communities like Aspen, Boulder and Denver of the right to protect
those minorities if they so choose. If Amendment 2 had been upheld, who would
have been next on the Right's hit list? 
<P>
Mr. Scalia supposes that the Court's ruling somehow disables democracy. In
fact, it stands squarely in the face of mob rule and says: This you may not
do.
<P>
Faithfully,
<P>
The Rev. Jan Nunley+<BR>

To be honest with you, I think Garry Wills put it best in his <I>New York Review of Books</I> piece (4-18-96) when he noted that the press didn't get Clinton on philandering (couldn't because BC/HRC diffused it early on), so they went after him on conventionally acceptable economic stuff, the pettier the better to show sleazy character. So in a sense, the whole Whitewater story is a transposition from the Flowers story. 
<P>
Maybe. At least this explains some of  the bizarre media behavior.  Clinton is being punished, not for Whitewater but for the white fluid spilled outside his marriage--and I think he knows this, which is one reason he puts up with it. The medias withholding of exculpatory reports from Jay Stephens/RTC et al conveys a twisted cruelty that smacks of conscious punishment for something more than a lousy little land deal.  Jim Leachs pompous pronouncements about ethics of our time are out of proportion to Whitewater, but they may fit the scarlet letter he wants Bill Clinton to wear for sexual shame.
<P>
Ironically--and lucky for Clinton--most of the voting public, acting on quite different motives than those of reporters, editors and corporate news management, don't seem to give much of a damn about Flowers and whoever else--as shown by Clinton's election in 1992 in the face of the worst of it, the Flowers tapes, etc. The public for the most part is not following the  media's transposition from sexual infidelity over to Whitewater and they are by and large uninterested in ancient Arkansas loans or even failed savings & loans. 
<P>
So there's a two-tiered experience here: the press/political opponents' relationship with Clinton and the public's relationship with Clinton.  One may trash him, the other may--or may not--forgive him and re-elect him. 
<P>
Why are so many people <I>with</I> Clinton rather than against him, despite the error of his ways? Because ironically Clinton is a moral man. People sense he has made mistakes, has faced his mistakes, has gone through hell over them, has struggled with his inner demons. People sense his depth because of his struggle. People sense his humanness. He is like us. What is a moral man if he has not transgressed and changed his life? Do you suppose Newt Gingrich has faced his brand of inner truth: of preserving his virginity by getting head in the front seat of his car so he can tell his wife he "never slept with her." That's the essence of today's cheap moral man, whereas Clinton faced his wife and his daughter and 50 millions TV viewers on "60 Minutes."
<P>
Extending from this essence, Clinton is a moral leader--perhaps even a great one to those who are listening. His speech to black ministers at Memphis in November 1993 stands among the best in American history. It was a "Lincoln moment." Clinton went to Memphis as Lincoln went to Gettysberg. Instead of the War Between the States, Clinton spoke to the War Against the Self. Someone had to go there and do that. No one else went there and did that. Clinton did. Clinton spoke. Clinton wailed from the pulpit in the full essence of his office and his own humanity. Where did that humanity come from?
<P>
Some of it came from the mistakes he's made and the pain he's felt and the pain he's caused others and probably regrets.
<P>
Clinton's political adversaries certainly hate to see his moral popularity soar, so they will do everything they can to denigrate his morality, his "character." They play endlessly on the concrete sexual transgression but they can't touch the deeper moral core of the man.
<P>
Clinton's opponents benefit by the media's unforgiving motivations. As Wills implies, Bill Clintons history of illicit sexuality has been translated into popular press lingo as the "character issue" and pursued most tenaciously--and conveniently--in Whitewater. This little Arkansas business deal is so remote and convoluted that it can soak up whatever dire negative projections anyone wants to throw at Clinton about <I>anything.</I>  Whitewater can be written about endlessly for consumption of the whole family, whereas sex has its limits at the family kitchen table. 
<P>
White-collar economic crime plays across the board, whereas hits on Bill Clintons sexuality run out of gas pretty fast. Sure, some will whisper behind their hands, but transactions regarding the President--the ultimate public figure--really have to take place in public. Although character is repeatedly used as code language for Clintons personal life, at some point it is counterproductive for the press to hammer on his infidelity while hes the President of the United States and while Hillary sticks with him. The media and his opponents are cut off by their own hestation to trash the office and even the marriage. So they and the media hit every other front that bears on coded character questions: his decision-making status, his draft-status, his inhaling status, and, of course, his Whitewater status.
<P>
You can tell it's not about Whitewater if real-life investigatory clearances like the Jay Stephens-Pillsbury-Madison-Sutro reports are not making the papers. It's about something else. You can also tell how strong Clinton is by how little effect Whitewater is having on his essential popularity. If Floyd Brown, David Bossie, Lauch Faircloth, Jesse Helms, Kenneth Starr, Alfonse D'Amato, Jean Lewis and that guy who runs the Mellon Fortune have all put their dirty heads together--and they <I>still</I> can't bring down this President--you know you've got a strong horse on your hands.
<P>
Still, the sexual thing is powerful and may be having as much reflection on society at large as on Bill Clinton who may simply be carrying the projection for the the rest of us. Wills suggests a strain of puritan judgment of sexuality on the part of the news media (Jacob Weisberg and Frank Rich have also written about this, all these reporters themselves being exempt, one assumes)--an interesting point and one I've sensed myself over the years, since the belated exposure of Kennedy, etc--so that now the media have today evolved into natural alignment with Ralph Reed. We are speaking in immense generalities here. Perhaps we should admit to a "hint" of puritanism. It's subtle. The press is disguised in their modus operandi, forcing Clinton to wear a "W" around his neck (for Whitewater or white-collar) instead of an "A" for adultery. 
<P>
I far prefer the joke in the mouth of Don Imus--"A" for astro-turf in Clinton's pick-up truck--because the sexual jokes are far more honest and interesting and sophisticated and adult than D'Amato's and Leach's prim and whining little insinuations that would allude to the same thing roundabout. We've lost our sense of humor. Such is the nature of puritanism as we enter this New new age of sexual repression.
<P>
Taking the transposition further, the D'Amato/press insinuation that the Clintons are "hiding something" may play out in public consciousness not in reference to Whitewater files---but to the truth of the Clintons sexual relationship which cannot be attacked frontally so long as Hillary stands by Bill's side. She may sense the transposition, too. Coupled with her natural reticence and pride of privacy from her upbringing, she may resent having to explain not just Whitewater, but how she has accepted her husband's infidelity. I dont blame her. Someday it may be said that Hillary Clinton enabled this Presidency to happen. The fact that she managed to do this is, in my opinion, to her credit.
<P>
I sometimes think that there may be a bit of jealousy on the part of some men among Clintons opponents and among males in the media that he can get women. There is something about the viciousness of the hatred towards him by some in the media and in politics that makes me think this may be true.  But this doesnt explain the attacks on Clinton by some women politicians and females in media. I'm not sure how the difference between men and women works. I only know there <I>is</I> a difference. Coming back the other way, there is certainly something going on with male hatred of Hillary on a popular, political and media level that would make Freud throw his lunch.
<P>
All of this has very little to do with "files."
<P>
Personally, I admire both Clintons, Bill's history of flings notwithstanding. Despite his unusual decision-making style (understandable as the son of an alcoholic), he's the best President I've known of in my 51-year lifetime. 

President Bush had--and possibly still has--his mistress Jennifer Fitzgerald who has had enough class to keep her mouth shut. Never was Bush touched on this issue--by the press or even by his opponents (such gentlemen we were in the old days)--whereas it is entirely possible that the <A HREF="paula.htm"> Paula Jones</A> case may go to court before the November 1996 election. 
<P>
It's interesting that among people I meet, men tend to believe Ms. Jones, whereas women don't. From my understanding of the known facts, Paula Jones is a fraud. Even if we allow the possibility that Bill was a cad (perhaps elsewhere but with Jones I doubt), that still leaves the possibility that he is being punished unfairly in this Jones deal. The point is: <I>he's being punished.</I> But by the larger standards that waft aloft about the heads of those who squint their eyes in a certain puritan absolutism of character, it won't really be unfair, really, when you consider he's still being punished for the old stuff. So it all works out. The fires of hell are opening to him, Jerry Falwell is waiting to scrub Bill's soul with brimstone--and so is our super-modern supposedly secular press. Perhaps the greater the man, the higher the stakes in the human game, the greater the punishment for human failing, and--in puritan America--the least forgiveness.
<P>
I'm rooting for Bill partly because I dislike smallmindedness--and small concrete minds are coming out of the woodwork right and left in the Clinton era. That's why I believe his legacy will be left in the realm of morality, because he faces the questions of morality in his own life and as a public figure in the Presidency he speaks up and helps us face moral questions in our society where even James Carville is saying "it's morality, stupid!" 
<P>
The morality play between Clinton and Gingrich was more important than people realize, yet people sensed it was important. In the Budget Battle, Clinton insisted on a premium beyond the "bottom line," a subjective human premium of values. This was a profound move. It was a moral move. He will be remembered for it, even by his enemies. Why? Because that's what it's all about. Because of it, the Great Gingrich is in the dust.
<P>
Morality requires a bigger mind, a bigger heart. Yet hardly anyone is talking or writing about precisely this that I'm writing about here. Instead, we have people like (the "reporter") Joe Klein writing narrowminded diatribes like "The Politics of Promiscuity" in the middle of <I>Newsweek</I>. (See "Trashing the Prez" in the <A HREF="photogal.htm">Photo Gallery</A>). Thanks but<BR> no thanks. Perfectly dumb. 
<P>
Judgment is not the same thing as morality. Pat Buchanan and Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson call this a "Christian nation." America has that capacity in the sense I mean but not as articulated by these smallminded men. I'm a Jew but I understand the generosity of spirit of forgiveness at the core of the Christian message. In this respect, Clinton is something of a Christic character, crucified by those who know not what they do.
<P>
The only recourse in such a situation is to be honest with himself. He appears to be a man of faith and reflection, capable of facing himself. With this, he will survive and prevail--and we may all survive and prevail a little better for watching him in his struggle. Anyone who thinks Bill Clinton's great challenges are about "files" should know they are really about moral matters such as these for which he is better prepared than most.
<P>
Little did I realize when I began responding to your note that I would get into quite such a discussion of sexuality and soul in the President of the United States. But honestly, I think Garry Wills has a compelling point.
<P>
Regards,
<P>
Jane

<PRE>  </PRE>

In July 1994, Senator Lauch Faircloth and Judge David Sentelle lunched together in the quietly elegant Senate dining room. Just days later, a three judge panel headed by Sentelle removed Robert B. Fiske Jr., a moderate Republican, from his position as independent counsel in the Whitewater affair-and replaced him with an active Republican partisan, Kenneth Starr.
<P>
Sentelle was supposed to be making his decisions free from political
influence. Faircloth was a leader of the Republican charge against the
Clintons on Whitewater; just weeks before, he had written Attorney General Janet Reno to complain about Fiske. So the lunch raised considerable controversy: Had Faircloth used the occasion to lobby or pressure Sentelle? Fiske's axing-after nine months and $2.5 million worth of work that had yet to produce material damaging to the Clintons-was precisely what Faircloth was after.
<P>
A year later came the news that approximately five months after the lunch and Fiske's replacement, Faircloth had hired Jane Oldham Sentelle, the judge's wife, as a receptionist for his Senate office. She had started in January 1995 at a salary of $20,000, which was later raised to $22,500.
<P>
That's more or less equivalent to the amount Rose Law Firm earned from its work for Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan in the mid eighties-work that has come under intensive scrutiny partly because then-Governor Bill Clinton may have helped steer it his wife's way. As the recently released billing records show, the firm earned approximately $21,000 from representing Madison Guaranty; Hillary Clinton's take was about a third of that total.
<P>
Hillary Clinton used poor judgment by participating in an apparent
conflict-of-interest; she may have even been modestly on the take. But the same could be said of the Sentelles. At the least, a senator and a ranking federal judge had thumbed their noses at the principle of keeping special prosecutors insulated from even the appearance of political pressure-the principle the Sentelle-led panel had cited in replacing Fiske, who had been appointed by Janet Reno.
<P>
And so for a Whitewater-fixated press corps avidly sniffing long-dead trails between Hillary Clinton and Madison like bloodhounds, Sentelle's hiring should have been a story with legs. Instead, the story of Jane Sentelle's job got almost no play.
<P>
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I> ran a 28-word item on the front page in its
"Washington Wire" Column. The Associated Press sent out a story by veteran reporter John Solomon that included comments from analysts criticizing the hiring.
<P>
But <I>The Washington Post, The New York Times,</I> and <I> The Los Angeles Times</I> did not pick up the AP story, even as a blurb, nor did they assign their own reporters to probe it. "I hate to say this," Andrew Rosenthal, Washington editor of <I>The New York Times,</I> told me when I asked him about the story, "but I don't remember it." "We should have had something on that," said <I>The Washington Post</I>'s Al Kamen, who added that the story was discussed in the newsroom but never made it into the paper. Editorial writers and columnists were almost uniformly silent. The only exception: a guest op-ed by Gilbert Cranberg in <I>The New York Times,</I> where he argued that the judges that appoint independent counsels should have to abide by the judicial code of ethics.
<P>
The press treatment of the Sentelle-Faircloth indiscretion was no aberration. Whitewater has been characterized by a strange bifurcation: While a zealous press corps chases every lead about the Clintons, it ignores hints that the GOP investigation may be suspect as well.
<P>
Whitewater isn't only about what the Clintons did or didn't do; it is also a story of the system being used and abused by the Clintons' political opponents. Many of those opponents have the scent of conflicts of their own-and the stench of partisan agendas. Sentelle has rock-solid Republican credentials. He's best known as the judge who overturned Ollie North's Iran-Contra conviction, and he had built a reputation before joining the federal bench as a firebrand Republican county chairman in North Carolina. He was the protege of another strongly anti-Clinton North Carolinian, Jesse Helms, who also dined with Sentelle and Faircloth that day in the Senate dining room.
<P>
The panel Sentelle headed appointed a man with some possible conflicts of his own. Kenneth Starr was U.S. Solicitor General under the president Clinton defeated. Just prior to his appointment, Starr had announced he was at work on a friend-of-the-court brief in the <A HREF="paula.htm"> Paula Jones</A> case; the brief was to argue that Clinton's incumbency did not shield him from civil lawsuits. Starr is also an active contributor to Republican campaigns, and he has done legal work for the Republican National Committee since becoming independent counsel.
<P>
Then there's Lauch Faircloth. A North Carolinian and former Democrat, he has gone to extraordinary lengths to demonstrate his Republican bona fides. He has pushed Whitewater arguably harder than any other member of Congress; indeed, he has been so aggressive that Al D'Amato had to rein him in. Like other Republicans, Faircloth has seized on Bill Clinton's possible conflict-of-interest when he was governor of Arkansas and technically in charge of regulating the savings-and-loan of James McDougal, his partner in the Whitewater land deal. The press has dutifully followed Faircloth's lead, though reams of copy have yet to prove that Clinton abused his position.
<P>
But Faircloth has a possible conflict of his own. He sits on the Senate
Banking Committee, which oversees all banking legislation (as well as the Whitewater hearings). And as of 1993, according to a recent Business Week report, he owned $850,000 of bank stock. Accusing Faircloth of using his position to enhance his stocks would be premature. But given the scrutiny Clinton has received for a similar situation involving far smaller amounts of money, it would be fair to look into it.
<P>
A telling comment about the way Whitewater has been played came from a paper that did mention Jane Sentelle's hiring. <I>The Washington Times,</I> which frequently headlines with the latest Whitewater mini-scandal, mentioned Jane Sentelle's job in Greg Pierce's "Inside Politics" column. "It remains to be seen," Pierce wrote of the hiring, "whether politicians and the media will lose their lunch over this."
<P>
They didn't. Senate Democrats said nary a word about the hiring-and neither did a reactive media. In the Whitewater affair, the press has been herded by whoever cracks the loudest whip, and that's usually been the Republicans. After all, Whitewater itself didn't become a story overnight. Clinton adversaries like <A HREF="FILL IN">David Bossie,</A> formerly of the right-wing lobby Citizens United, pushed for months to get it serious attention in the mainstream media. Where is Bossie now? The same place as Jane Sentelle-on Faircloth's payroll, as an assistant to the senator.

<font size=5>M</font size=5>errimack, NH: April 26, 1996 -- For the past two years, this New Hampshire town has been embroiled in bitter, divisive controversy. Residents of this quiet, picturesque New England town had lived together peaceably for decades. Their public school system, regarded as one of the best in the state, was a source of great community pride. In 1994, two candidates ran for seats on the School Board, claiming to be nothing more than concerned citizens. Joining with a sitting member, Chris Ager, they formed a Majority Bloc that acted and voted as a monolithic political unit, with Ager as its newly elected Chairman.
<P>
Immediately after the election, the masks came off, and this Majority Bloc began enacting the agenda of the Radical Religious Right. One by one, the items came up for consideration -- school prayer disguised as a moment of silence, creationism in the science courses, removal of psychological counseling services, and opposition to Goals 2000.
<PRE>   </PRE>
RADICAL RELIGIOUS RIGHT LOSES, THEN RETALIATES
<P>
After a year of rancorous School Board meetings, the town rejected this radical agenda. By the largest margins in the largest turnout in town history, they elected Ken Coleman and Brenda Grady, who opposed the Majority Bloc. 
<P>"Stunned by the size of their loss," remarked Coleman, "they resorted to the Radical Religious Right's favorite weapon-- homophobia--to regain control." Their tactic since losing the election has been to scare the town into accepting the Radical Religious Right agenda. 

<P>Within two months,
Chairman Ager proposed Policy 6540, the most severely restrictive anti-gay policy anywhere in the country. Despite unprecedented opposition from parents, teachers, religious leaders, and medical professionals, the Board approved the Policy. 

<P>A group of parents, teachers and human rights organizations have filed suit in US District Court, claiming violations of their Constitutional rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

<PRE>    </PRE>
THE SMOKING GUN
<P>
In the April 29, 1996 edition of <I>Time</I> Magazine, Rev. Lou Sheldon, head of the Traditional Values Coalition, boasted about coaching people in Merrimack on how to speak effectively to the media about Policy 6540. 

<P>By his own admission, this national political activist has taught local followers how to present the Policy in ways that would make it palatable to the general public. He said to <I>Time,</I> "We walked them through the whole process--philosophically, legally and morally --so they could be grounded in the information that would make them sound far more credible on radio or television. That's the way we do it." 
<P>The <I>Nashua Telegraph</I> reported on April
25, 1996 that he had traveled from California to Merrimack, not once, but many times for the purpose of training local activists.
<P>
"We now have the proof we've been looking for," said Coleman. "Indeed, outside forces actually <I>have</I> been enacting a national agenda in Merrimack. One of the prime leaders of this concerted attack is none other than Rev. Lou Sheldon of the California-based Traditional Values Coalition. Undoubtedly, he has many allies we still do not know about."
<P>
As evidence slowly built proving the intense level of outside activism at work in Merrimack, Ager and his supporters have attempted to blame Coleman and his supporters for causing the strife and acrimony surrounding the School
Board. For example, after months of speeches by parents opposing the Majority
Bloc's agenda, Ager published a list of "Depraved Citizens" who in his
opinion had spoken too often to the Board. At the same time, the Majority
Bloc systematically denied any involvement of outside Radical Religious Right
groups. "For the past two years, Merrimack has been subjected to a fire storm
of controversial issues that have never been a part of our town. Sheldon's
involvement with Ager and many others in town proves conclusively that all of
these problems have been coming to us from the outside. The Radical Religious
Right has planned this attack on our town step by step, using fear and hate
to subvert our local political process for their own national agenda,"
concluded Coleman.
<PRE>   </PRE>
AN ARMY OF RADICAL RELIGIOUS RIGHT GROUPS
<P>
Merrimack has been under a ferocious attack by the Radical Religious Right.
The sheer number of state and national leaders who have targeted Merrimack
and have made repeated trips to our town is astounding. "To list the Radical
Religious Right organizations and their national leaders who have not been
involved in Merrimack would be easier than listing those who have," observed
Coleman. 
<P>
When Rev. Paul Norwalt wanted to force creationism into the
curriculum, he immediately brought Duane Gish from California to speak twice
in Merrimack. Board Member Shelly Uscinski's membership in the Christian
Coalition might be acceptable. Her national activism for them, particularly
her training seminars on cloning her stealth tactics for winning local
elections, demonstrates a more clandestine level of Christian Coalition
involvement in Merrimack. 

<P>Since Sheldon revealed their tactics in <I>Time,</I> it's not so clandestine anymore.
<P>
The presence of Christian Coalition officers,
including Paul Nagy (New England Field Coordinator), George Fellendorf (NH
President), and Ray White (NH Executive Director) at Merrimack School Board
meetings proves they have strong interest in pushing their issues.
<PRE>    </PRE>
SHELDON JOINS THE FRAY
<P>
Now, the outside origin of Policy 6540 is beyond doubt. It never was a local
issue, but always has been an expression of an extremist national agenda. The
words are exactly the same as the failed Smith-Helms amendment to the 1994
Education Act. 

<P>Sheldon boasted both in <I>Time</I> magazine and in the <I>Nashua
Telegraph</I> that he instigated Policy 6540 in Merrimack, and is attempting to
do the same in many other communities. He refers to U.S. Senators Bob Smith
(R-NH) and Jesse Helms (R-NC) by their first names and claims credit for
having written the actual language of the amendment. 
<P>
More specifically,
Sheldon proudly states that he spoke to Merrimack School Board Chairman Chris
Ager last July, and sent him the policy which Ager subsequently presented.
According to Sheldon's remarks in the <I>Telegraph,</I> Policy 6540 "brings clarity
to the whole school district that this type of behavior is not acceptable."
He also bragged about numerous trips (as recently as February, 1996) to
Merrimack to coach his local activists. His purpose was to give them more
media polish and to "share with them our expertise in policy development and
how to frame the issue." 
<P>Clearly, Sheldon has total disregard for local
control over school policy because he has a national agenda to enact through disrupting local elections.
<PRE>    </PRE>
OUTSIDE AGITATORS: PATTERNS EMERGE
<P>
Ager admits to consulting Sheldon for advice. Ager also has offered to send
to high school students copies of hate-filled anti-gay propaganda videos
promoted by Sheldon . Ginny Cadarette, the candidate supported by the local
Radical Religious Right activists, strongly supports Policy 6540, along with
many other of their key issues (abstinence-only health education,
phonics-only reading, no public kindergarten, and no student representative
to the School Board). Clearly defining the purpose of Cadarette's candidacy,
her campaign manager, Bert Tenhave, proclaimed in the <I>Telegraph</I> on Feb. 7,
1996, "I see the next election as the Christian Coalition vs. the gay and
lesbian agenda." 
<P>
 She has invited three state Senators closely allied with
the Christian Coalition to speak at her campaign fund raising event. Like
Ager, Uscinski, and Twardosky before her, she claims as a candidate to have
no set agenda, and no particular plans to improve the schools. Strangely,
enough, she supports every issue they have pushed as Board Members. Is
Cadarette another stealth candidate?
<PRE>    </PRE>
MANIPULATING PUBLIC OPINION
<P>
Clearly, Sheldon has been busy in Merrimack during these tumultuous months,
coaching his acolytes and polishing their media presence.

<P> Christian Coalition
activists Nagy and Uscinski appeared on a local radio station to repeat all
of the "party line" arguments. Tenhave, an unknown, suddenly started
appearing on television news interviews to promote Policy 6540. Prior to
that, he had not attended School Board meetings.

<P> Soon after, well-known
conservative activist and former NH Supreme Court Chief Justice Chuck Douglas
interviewed him on "Right For New Hampshire," a television program produced by
the ultra-conservative, ultra-secretive John Stark Foundation. Douglas
interviewed Sheldon himself on a subsequent show.

<P>Tenhave quickly became a close associate of Ager, and started publishing a
conservative newsletter. He now manages the campaign of Ginny Cadarette,
Ager's hand-picked candidate to succeed him. 

<P>From Sheldon to Ager to Tenhave
to Cadarette, the chain of command and the flow of ideas and information is
indisputable. This attack on local politics in Merrimack now appears to have
been planned and orchestrated by Lou Sheldon as a field operation of his
California-based Traditional Values Coalition. This field operation was
conducted with the apparent knowledge and support of a variety of Radical
Religious Right groups, including the Christian Coalition.
<PRE>   </PRE>
MEDDLING BY BIG MEDIA
<P>
The <I>Manchester Union Leader</I>, and its editorial writer Richard Lessner, have
frequently meddled in Merrimack School Board matters. Although they have
rarely endorsed any school board candidates in Manchester--or any other
city in the state--they have endorsed Ager, Uscinski, and Ginny Twardosky
in the past. At the same time, they have criticized Coleman and other voices
of moderation for opposing the Radical Religious Right agenda, usually
describing them as "flaming liberals causing trouble." 

<P>On April 25, 1996,
Lessner endorsed Ginny Cadarette's use of three state Senators allied with
the Christian Coalition to speak at her campaign fund-raising event, thus
contradicting the paper's longstanding position on "local control."
The <I>Union Leader</I>  has been driving its own national agenda through activities
such as endorsing Pat Buchanan for President and calling for the dismantling
of the Department of Education. 

<P>Supplementing its support for the Radical
Religious Right, the paper has frequently published editorials calling for the
Merrimack School Board to adopt the moment of silence, creationism, and other
items advanced by outside activists. They have strongly supported the
anti-gay Policy 6540 written by Sheldon. All of these activities reflect
attempts to enact a national agenda, and have nothing to do with the local
control the paper claims to advocate.
<PRE>    </PRE>
FRINGE CULTS FIND MERRIMACK
<P>
Other organizations, such as Scientologists and followers of Sun Myung Moon, also have been
looking at Merrimack. For example, Uscinski does not limit her activism to
the Christian Coalition. Beyond teaching stealth tactics to school board
candidates around the country, she serves as a Commissioner on the Human
Rights Commission. Though its name sounds innocuous, this group is a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Church of Scientology. Its announced purpose is to
remove all psychological and psychiatric counseling services from the
schools, one of Uscinski's major goals on the School Board. Since the Church
of Scientology hides behind a cloak of secrecy, we do not know what Uscinski
might select from its agenda to enact in Merrimack in the future.
<P>
On April 18, 1996, Rev. Sun Myung Moon personally presented Uscinski with a
National Service Award from his newly created <I>Washington Times</I> Foundation, a
branch of his Unification Church. Rev. Moon, a convicted felon, spent time in
Federal prison for tax evasion.  The cult-like nature of the
Unification Church disturbs many people, including parents of children who
have been recruited as "Moonies" and later had to undergo de-programming. In the award citation, Rev. Moon's Foundation
specifically honored Uscinski for her work in stopping the health curriculum,
and for passing Policy 6540. Presiding at the ceremonies was Baptist
clergyman Rev. Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority, creating a
bizarre confluence of competing ideologies.
<PRE>   </PRE>
STEALTH AND DELIBERATE DECEPTION
<P>
What has emerged in Merrimack is a textbook example of how the Radical
Religious Right targets a town for takeover. They make no secret of their
goal, which is to get their candidates elected to local offices all over the
country. What they hide is the connection of their candidates to these national
organizations, and what their ultimate agenda will be once elected. 
<P>In the
words of the Christian Coalition's Executive Director, Ralph Reed, after the
Christian Coalition's victory in the San Diego school board elections,
"Stealth was a big factor in San Diego's success. But that's just good
strategy. It's like guerrilla warfare. If you reveal your location, all it
does is allow your opponent to improve his artillery bearings. It's better to
move quietly, with stealth, under cover of night. I want to be invisible. I
do guerrilla warfare. I paint my face and travel at night. You don't know
it's over until you're in a body bag. You don't know until election night."
<P>
In Merrimack, all of these candidates have persistently denied membership in
any of these organizations. When advocating specific policies, particularly
Policy 6540, they have continued to deny any knowledge of them. Instead, they
throw up a smoke-screen by criticizing their opponents as troublemakers
working for outside organizations. We now know these denials and
countercharges to be lies, deliberate deceptions designed to mislead the
general public.
<PRE>    </PRE>
SPINMEISTER SHELDON
<P>
Lou Sheldon's spin control has left its fingerprints all over Merrimack.
 Though Policy 6540 does not use phrases such as "promotion of homosexuality"
or "teaching homosexuality in the schools," its backers always use these
phrases in public debate.  They claim the opponents of the Policy want to
"promote" homosexuality or even "teach" about homosexual sex acts in the
schools.  "When I offered an amendment to Policy 6540 that would prohibit
promotion of any sexual orientation or activities, the Majority Bloc turned
it down," recalled Coleman.  "They needed the precise wording of Sheldon's
Smith-Helms amendment to accomplish their political agenda."
<P>
"Until the interviews with Sheldon in <I>Time</I> and the <I>Nashua Telegraph,</I> most
people in Merrimack did not believe that the town has been under continuous
attack by outside agitators," Coleman said. "Those who did believe it had no idea how extensive the meddling and interference actually have been. All of the bitter, divisive controversy has been artificially contrived by outside agitators from the Radical Religious Right. <BR> Now, the truth is out."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- MAY 14, 1996<BR>

<P>
MERRIMACK VOTERS REJECT RADICAL RELIGIOUS RIGHT AGENDA<BR>
Pro-Education Candidate Rosemarie Rung Wins by Landslide<BR></CENTER>
<PRE>    </PRE>
<font size=5>M</font size=5>errimack, NH -- After two years of turmoil, the voters of Merrimack, NH have
regained control of their School Board. Pro-education candidate, Rosemarie
Rung, won election by a stunning landslide in the largest turnout in town
history. 
<P>
By winning this seat, Rung has completed the process started last
year when Ken Coleman and Brenda Grady were elected by the largest margins in
town history. The controlling majority (Chris Ager, Shelly Uscinski, and
Ginny Twardosky) that came to power in 1994 has lost, and no longer can force
the agenda of the Radical Religious Right on Merrimack. 
<P>
"This election has
brought back local control of the School Board," observed Rung. "The people
of Merrimack have spoken loudly and strongly. We have rejected the extremist
agendas of outside activists--and their followers on the Board. At last, we
can return to the real business of operating our schools wisely and
efficiently."
<PRE>    </PRE>
TWO YEARS OF POLITICAL TURMOIL
<P>
Immediately after seizing control, the majority started enacting the national
agenda of the Radical Religious Right. The willingness of the controlling
majority of the School Board to enact these outside agendas was shocking.
<P>
First came school prayer disguised as a moment of silence. Next came
creationism in the science courses, with debate so heated that it drew
international media attention. Removing guidance and psychological counseling
services, a favorite issue of the Church of Scientology, surfaced just before
the 1995 election. 
<P>
After failing to gain new seats, the majority enacted the
infamous anti-gay Policy 6540. For the past two years, Merrimack has suffered
through bitterly divisive debate over non-educational "hot-button" issues
such as these. At the same time, the School Board has neglected the basic
issues of education.
<PRE>     </PRE>
LOCAL CONNECTIONS TO NATIONAL ACTIVISTS
<P>
The range of individuals and organizations using Merrimack to advance their
agendas is truly astonishing. After the election, Uscinski joined the
Christian Coalition and now travels around the country giving training
seminars on how to win elections by stealth. Top executives of the Christian
Coalition (Paul Nagy, George Fellendorf, and Ray White) appear at Merrimack
School Board meetings. Uscinski also serves as a Commissioner for the
Commission on Human Rights, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Church of
Scientology. Recently, Rev. Sun Myung Moon, of the Unification Church,
presented her with an award from his newest front organization, the
<I>Washington Times</I> Foundation. Ager, who did not dare to run for re-election,
has acknowledged his contacts with Rev. Lou Sheldon of the California-based
Traditional Values Coalition. Sheldon has boasted of his frequent trips to
Merrimack to speak at local churches to stir up local support for the
anti-gay policy.
<PRE>     </PRE>
CLEAR CHOICE IN 1996
<P>
With only one seat open in 1996, the voters had a clear opportunity to defeat
or support the controlling majority. Rosemarie Rung, the pro-education
candidate, offered a three-point platform emphasizing Strategic Planning,
Curriculum Improvement, and Building Partnerships with Business and Industry.
She also rejected the past two years of dabbling with "hot-button" issues,
including Policy 6540.
<P>
     As the campaign gathered momentum, the controlling majority began to use
the anti-gay Policy 6540 as their wedge issue. Bert Tenhave, campaign manager
for the losing candidate, Ginny Cadarette, framed their approach when he
said, "I see the next election as the Christian Coalition vs. the gay and
lesbian agenda," (<I>Nashua Telegraph</I>, Feb. 7, 1996). Cadarette claimed to have
no set agenda, and no particular ideas about running the schools. Although
she denied any connections with the Christian Coalition, she supported all of
their fundamental issues, pledging to continue the work of the current
majority if elected. Specifically, she supported Policy 6540, and would not
change or repeal it.
<PRE>    </PRE>
VICTORY FOR THE PEOPLE
<P>
After the resounding people's victory tonight, Rung remarked, "This election
proves that the citizens of Merrimack have the moral courage to reject the
politics of fear and divisiveness. What the Radical Religious Right failed to
realize when it moved into Merrimack advocating its agenda, from creationism
to Policy 6540, is that we truly believe in freedom of speech, and equal
protection of the laws. We respect the rights of all of our citizens. We have
strong family values, and we do not exclude others solely because of
political or religious differences. 
This robust moral fiber in our town is
what Paul Nagy and Ray White of the Christian Coalition, and Lou Sheldon of
the Traditional Values Coalition didn't anticipate when they came to
Merrimack," concluded Rung.
<PRE>    </PRE>
RESISTING THE RADICAL RELIGIOUS RIGHT
<P>
Merrimack clearly has been a textbook example of how the Radical Religious
Right targets a town for a takeover. People of other communities can learn
from the events in Merrimack. The Christian Coalition has made infiltrating
the school boards of America a major political goal (more important than
winning the presidency according to Ralph Reed). Lou Sheldon bragged in <I>Time</I> Magazine
and the <I>Telegraph</I> about his involvement in many other communities around the
country.
Whether the current wedge issue is creationism, school prayer, homophobia,
phonics, or Goals 2000, the players are always the same. 
<P>
"Make no mistake,"
advises Rung. "The activists of the far right are not coming to your town.
They are already working behind the scenes to subvert your school board,"
Rung warns. "In Merrimack, it took just two elections for them to gain
control by stealth tactics. We then suffered through two years of furious
attacks on our schools, and complete inattention to education. Never allow
the merchants of fear and hate to infiltrate your town and use your community
for their personal political and financial gains. Stand up to them, and drive
them out," Rung urged. "We did it in Merrimack, just as the people of San
Diego, CA; Vista, CA; Helena, MT; and many other towns did. You can defeat
them in your town, too. Our schools, and your children's futures, depend on
your involvement."
<P>
Final vote tallies as called in from the polls at 8:50 pm, May 14, 1996:<P>

The problem with "violence of television and films" is not just the "content" of violence on-screen but the lack of a frame of affect among characters in the story itself.  By this I mean someone's feeling in response to violence, the emotional consequences, seen for example in Jodie Foster's character in "Silence of the Lambs." She was constantly conveying her emotional response to the killings, so that the victims remained human, having value; despite being dead, they were not merely objects that could be trashed, or could have always been trashed.  She was shocked.
<P>
Why was Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven" given an Academy Award?  In fact, the film glorified several cold-blooded psychopaths, one of which--the hero played by the crusty Mr. Eastwood--was only slightly less cold-blooded than the others. Nonetheless, he blew them all away in the end.
<P>
Where was the frame of emotional consequence in Mr. Eastwood's film?  Who was shocked?  Who registered and projected for us the scene's moral transaction?  Where was the frame of basic values we can all agree on, if only one: life is sacred.  Is there a way of making this fundamental frame commercially successful without being schmaltzy? There must be if an enormously successful film like "Silence of the Lambs" could pull it off.
<P>
How did we do it in the old days?  Gary Cooper was a movie hero of the 40's and 50's whose face constantly reflected how he was feeling about the violence around him.  
<P>
We don't glorify the shooting of 14 people standing unarmed in a room in "The Unforgiven"--even if they're the bad guys--solely for the sake of the thrill of watching with our own eyes the horrific breaking of society's greatest taboo.  We have a process of laws to achieve justice.  We don't glorify vengeance.  We don't glorify taking the law into our own hands.
<P>
But no. We do.  We do....
<P>
Westerns are popular movies partly because frontier life was still pre-law.  Individualism was geographic, with one farmstead separated by miles from the next.  Individual families preserved themselves through values nurtured and passed on from generation to generation.  But outside the family ranch or farm, in between their homesteads and in the sparse towns that dotted the landscape, there was a flimsy system of law and justice, as "government" began slowly to invent itself.  In the public spaces of the range roved vigilantes, gangs, gunslingers, creating fear and terror in certain quarters.  Everybody had a gun of some sort to defend themselves from lawlessness.
<P>
Now we have militias training to defend themselves, not against lawlessness, but against the enforcement of law by the government.  This is a different kind of individualism from the frontier days. The word starts with an "i" but it's infantilism. President Clinton, speaking at Michigan State on May 6, 1995 put it simply, "There is no right to resort to violence when you don't get your way." Yet Clint Eastwood splashes just this value across the screen--and gets rewarded for it.
<P>
Speaking of getting your way, ever tried to get a child to stop watching TV?  Again, the problem lies outside TV's content--in <I>the child's relationship with the TV set itself.</I> This relationship, made possible by the easily flicked remote, gives the child a sense of <I>unlimited control.</I> Does this artificial "power"--conditioned by TV and video games--interfere with parental  attempts to instill Iimits and boundaries on the child? Does it interfere with the parents' job to educate the child in the appropriate social ways of using of power? Does it frustrate the parents' responsibility to prepare the child for cooperative and responsible adulthood?  Does the adolescent's post-TV frustration (in not finding it easy to have control or power in real life--"not getting your way") contribute to criminality?  Does the child "miss the briefing" while watching TV or spending hours at the video game or on the Internetcomputer?
<P>
Questions, questions. We should not wait for corporate media to answer them, not when their livelihood depends upon the TV set itself, the box that delivers everything. We'll have to use our own common sense in our own livingrooms, eh? 
<P>
<I>This</I> is individualism.

<PRE>    </PRE>
<font size=5>T</font size=5>here is a dark side of the Internet, a side beyond the issues of censorship and copyright protections. Its what happens to people who spend 12 hours a day scrolling and chatting and downloading, isolated from people, from social functions, from the breeze of a spring day, the touch of Grandmas hand, the cold of Spots nose.
<P>
Forget the weirdos and political posturing. We are in danger of creating a generation of Internet introverts.
<P>
Internet introverts are not computer nerds. Computer nerds are people whose social existence revolves around computers. Internet introverts are socially dysfunctional: they write online, talk online, view the world from online, order books and pizza online. They use a cloak of computer-based anonymity to say what they want, view what they want, read what they want. They replace the day-to-day obligations created by social mores with the world they find inside a personal computer. Their numbers are growing as access to the online world increases.
<P>
A social phenomenon, very different from the social or real world, is birthing itself online. So wed best stop the creation  of new Internet introverts, one at a time, now.
<P>
I am online and have been since 1985. I do research, correspond, buy books, and occasionally I just roam the Net. I have twin 4-year-old sons who love to play on the computer when I allow it, which is no more than two hours a week in half hour sessions. Why? Because they are kids and should be out roughhousing, touching, experiencing the real world.
<P>
In a few years, the online world for consumers will have voice and video, which will reverse the current paradigm and force introverts to show their faces.
<P>
In the interim, vigilance against creating new introverts means more involvement by parents. Vigilance means learning about the Net. It means doing the two hardest things to do: setting limits and finding time to do yet another thing with our children. 
<P>
We find by giving our sons limits <I>and</I> rights, they understand the limits because they also know they have rights. We do the same with food (they choose their meals and can have treats on the weekends), and play activities.
<P>
This vigilance must be better than what we have mustered so far. The online world isnt like a VCR that only plays tapes we rent or we buy; it is not a place where our laziness allows our children to watch things they know are, for the most part, pretend. The Internet is an alternative world, an artificial non-tactile place that defies years of human evolution. Its a world and society where the endgame, for some, is a one-dimensional party that feels better than the real, more loving and more frightening world outside.

<font color="#ff0000"><I>A preview of Microsoft's new cyberzine "Slate" <BR>by Jane Prettyman</I></font color="#ff0000"><P> Go straight to <A HREF="http:/www.slate.com"> Slate</A></CENTER>
<P>
<font size=5>T</font size=5>he watcher watches the watchers watching the media watching politics and so forth, <BR>all from the Microsoft "campus" in Seattle.... 
<P>
At least the editor Michael Kinsley is a mensch and one of my favorite writers--the main reason I read <I>The New Republic</I> for so many years. When Bill Gates swept him up and bundled him off to the Northwest, I felt like a Jewish mother, protective of my son. But Michael's a big boy who can give this endeavor the best shot of anybody in the editorial trade because he has intellectual conscience.
<P>
Still, it's worrisome.
<P>
True to its yuppie marketing strategy, individual printed copies of <I>Slate</I> will be available exclusively at Starbucks. I mean <I>reallllllly,</I> folks, this is just <I>tooooooooo</I> cool, too cute, too designy, too well-marketed to a precise segment of the population. The targeted readership of MS's new zine are the folks who have the brains to make enough money to own computers to get <I>Slate</I>. But will it educate them or will it simply and masterfully perpetuate the consumerist mentality? Will it get real and really rock the boat or will it give lipservice to the political angle of the moment and do it with such brilliance that nobody quite realizes that the real questioning--the real news--is effectively overlooked? Will it lead with flashy false shock-effect issues or will it take the slower less sensational road to consider the deep structure of the nation's political life?
<P>
A taste of Kinsley's opening description of the Webzine's sections: " 'Meta-news': the news about the news, a sense of how the weeks big stories are being played and perceived. 'The Week/The Spin' takes a dozen or so topics, from this weeks election-campaign developments to the latest big book from Knopf, and analyzes, as objectively as possible, the spin theyre getting, the sub-angles that are emerging, and so on. 'In Other Magazines' uses the covers and contents of Time, Newsweek, etc., as a handy measure of what the culture considers important. (We aim to have these magazines in SLATE even before they reach the
newsstands or your mailbox.) 'The Horse Race' tracks
the presidential candidates like stocks, as priced by the
opinion polls, the pundits, and a genuine market in
political candidates run out of the University of Iowa.
Our man William Saletan will compute and analyze
changes in the pundits index." 
<P>
Horse race? Sub-angles? Priced by opinion polls? Pundits index? Holy cow! This far, it sounds like the worst of modern media-politics, exactly what we don't need. Flashes of <I>Time & Newsweek</I> "as a handy measure of what the culture considers important"? Newt Gingrich as Man of the Year is considered culturally important? What the <I>commercial media</I> consider important to sales, is what he means .... This is not the same thing as "culture" even though <I>Time & Newsweek</I>--and maybe <I>Slate</I>--would like us to think so.
<P>
But on the other hand, <I>Slate</I> also features "The Varnish Remover" that strips the spin off issues and puts them out straight. Let's see what Kathleen Hall Jamieson thinks of this section. 
<P>
The commercial intervolvment is elegant and intimate, hand in glove--exclusive reprint rights for <I>Time</I> magazine, distribution in Starbucks, the whole shebang paid for by Microsoft... Kinsley scoffed at the <I>Newsweek</I> cover which featured him in a yellow rain slicker holding a fish--but he was quick to add that he "appreciated the publicity." He's got the commercial feel, he's caught the beat, he's learning how to play the game. I don't hold this against him. He has to learn it to operate within the bowels of the essence of commercial enterprise. But it puts him that much closer to the cynical edge where Joseph Campbell would say he has his "hero journey" cut out for him. Or that much closer to Joseph Conrad's heart of darkness. On everyone's inner lips is the thought: Will he betray his principles? Will he turn into a wild man in the corporate jungle? Will he lie to himself when he reports on what he sees?
<P>
<I>Slate</I> is free until Nov 1, just long enough to condition us to its hip insights into "what's happening." Five days before the election--after what will undoubtedly be a cliff-hanger campaign--just at that moment of greatest suspense, those who are addicted to the "pundits index" and <Slate's</I> call of the political horse race will avidly sign up. Why didn't they make the deadline Dec 1? Because the dropoff of interest in <I>Slate's</I> primary subject matter will be precipitous after Nov 5.
<P>
Kinsley's apologia about MS Corp "making the right noises" must be taken with a grain of salt when one considers that Michael's personal interest (not only in terms of money but his pride) in <I>hoping</I> Microsoft keeps its paws off his editorial sandwich. This project is every boy-editor's and girl-editor's dream. Kinsley's pride and hope for success could create blindspots for him, the first one being that Microsoft has <I>already</I> gained its advantage by doing <I>Slate</I> in the first place with a quality guy like Kinsley at the helm. It's like a great big ad in the sky. "We're cool. We think deeply. We let Kinsley say what he wants, even if he says something off-color about MS." 
<P>
Arnold Gingrich (no relation) discovered the same tactic and came to use it, somewhat less cynically, when he launched <I>Esquire</I> in the early 1930's. He managed to create the panache of gentlemanly intellect expressed in a combination of fashion, great fiction writing and journalism--with a dash of the Vargas girl--in a magazine targeted to a narrow well-moneyed audience during the Depression when money was scarce. Gingrich saw the security advantage of imbedding the magazine in a larger corporation of diversified products. As the magazine took hold (with the help of popular writers like Hemingway, Faulkner, Dorothy Parker and fabulous art direction), he encouraged independent thinking in the magazine's writing and sold corporate management on the idea that the uniquely independent aura of <I>Esquire</I> was ultimately in the corporation's best interests and worth more than anything that could be achieved by manipulating editorial content. 
<P>
As the decades went by, the corporation lost millions in actual <I>Esquire</I> magazine sales but the magazine's controversial yet high-quality journalistic and literary reputation spread the corporate name worldwide. Not everybody actually <I>bought</I> the magazine but everybody <I>knew about</I> the magazine, if only from having perused a single smashing issue on someone's coffee table. By sheer association in corporate schmoozing, Esquire Inc. ended up reaping huge profits on all its other products, one of which was the immensely successful fashion magazine <I>Gentleman's Quarterly</I>. 
<P>
It was a bargain with the devil and a balancing act which <I>Esquire</I> finally lost when management lost its courage and imagination (after Gingrich died and <I>Esquire's</I> bold editor-in-chief Harold Hayes left). Management then insisted on making money on <I>Esquire</I> per se. On those terms, <I>Esquire</I> couldn't maintain the outspoken, sometimes outrageous qualities that made it great. To make money, the magazine had to appeal to broader demographics on the newsstand. This lowered the threshold for acceptance of the mediocre, the predictable, the upwardly mobile, the commercial, the merely sensational and the merely sexual...  The rest is history. 
<P>
<I>Slate</I>'s position is not dissimilar. But today the corporate mindset is much more developed, the marketing angles far more sophisticated, the bottom line more imperative, and individual editors, writers and artists far less respected than they used to be. 
<P>
The tactic of asking up front "Is Microsoft Evil?" is a classic maneuver to take the heat off. <I>Slate</I> couldn't have done anything <I>else</I> but come out with the obvious question. Watch for this ongoing "forum" to be--possibly--a crafty means by which Microsoft gets its commercial agenda and justifications across while seeming to be undergoing rigorous scrutiny. Just <I>participating</I> is good for the MS image--and image is everything.
<P>
Just keep an eye on this whole juggle. Bill Gates is no fool. He bought a feisty guy to edit <I>Slate</I> and my guess is Gates plans to make sure that <I>Slate</I> has the effect of being a feather in his cap that makes money for his other enterprises by means of PR image and aura from projects like <I>Slate</I>, even if <I>Slate</I> in itself doesn't make a dime. He's not old enough to know who Arnold Gingrich was but he has the potential of being his reincarnation--or just another corporate hack. This is a dramatically symbolic little media premiere we're watching here. Let's see how it unfolds. 
<P>
Who knows? Maybe it'll turn out to be thought-provoking. Kinsley as editor assures some degree of that--if our brains haven't been so pureed by commercial media that we cannot appreciate authentic thinking. It's certainly a media phenomenon, right up the alley of The Real News Page. I'll try to keep an open mind. I dropped Michael an e-mail wishing him good luck.

<H1><font color="#2F4F2F"><CENTER>Susan Speaks</CENTER></font color="#2F4F2F"></H1>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><H4><font color="#0000ff"><CENTER>On Nov. 15, 1996, Susan McDougal called in to the Alan Colmes radio show. <BR>Here's what Susan had to say, some of it not new but most of it quite shocking and almost nothing of it reported in the mainstream news media. <P>Prologue by Jane W. Prettyman.
</CENTER></font color="#0000ff">
<PRE>  </PRE>

<font size=5>S</font size=5>usan McDougal, by way of background, is the former wife of former Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan president James McDougal. Both are former partners with the Clintons in the Whitewater land development, beginning long before Jim McDougal ever owned a savings bank and long before Bill Clinton became governor of Arkansas. This time line is unknown to most news consumers who have bought into the impression fostered by the news media and President Clinton's political opponents that the Clintons were somehow embroiled in and therefore hypocrits in regard to the nationwide 
<BR>S & L disaster. Few more negative impressions can be imagined. 
<P>
Mr. McDougal is currently (as of October-November-December 1996) "cooperating" with special prosecutor Kenneth Starr in hopes of turning enough "evidence" against President Clinton to get a reduced sentence after his conviction on several charges of bank fraud several months ago. Susan McDougal has refused to "cooperate" with Starr (for reasons she recounts below). Because of this, she has been sent to jail for an extra two years for contempt of court on top of her sentence for wrongdoing related to Madison. As of December 1996, Susan McDougal is in a prison in Texas.
<P>
Beforehand, it is worthwhile remembering that Jim McDougal is known to suffer from manic-depressive illness which is characterized by wild mood swings, a marked tendency to exaggerate his actions and influence, and a pathological tendency to inflate his importance. This illness probably helped lead to his bizarre business practices while he managed a savings bank and boasted of having an "inside track" with Bill Clinton while Clinton was governor of Arkansas, a track he did not have so far as anyone knows. 
<P>
This includes any "inside track" McDougal might have thought he had through Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the Arkansas bank regulator appointed by Gov. Clinton, who testified at length before Sen. D'Amato's hearings last summer. Schaffer's obvious personal integrity was a turning point in the D'Amato hearings because her testimony highlighted nearly four years of efforts by Clinton opponents to keep her testimony from coming forth. Ironically, when she did come forth, she made the hearings look like the kangaroo court it was. Interestingly, Jeff Gerth's original <I>New York Times</I> story had "cut Schaffer's statement for space." 
<P>
See <A HREF="mediagat.htm">Mediagate</A> for lots more on all this background and Gene Lyons' book <A HREF="http://www.harpers.org/browse/bookshelf.html">Fools for Scandal: How the Media Invented Whitewater</A> for the best analysis available in print.
<P>
Additionally, Jim McDougal's manic-depressive illness may well be distorting the truthfulness of any stories on the Clintons he is now trying to foist on Starr in exchange for a lighter sentence. The exaggerational nature of his manic-depressive condition is not being reported in the news media whenever reference is made to Mr. McDougal's cooperation with Starr. To disclose this might deflate the suspense of a "potential indicting witness" hanging over the President's head. Why jeapordize increased newspaper circulation and ratings by questioning the credibility of Jim McDougal? Just paint him as "a colorful character" and leave it at that. 
<P>
When Susan McDougal called the Alan Colmes show, she also added the information that "Jim had a stroke 10 years ago."
<PRE>   </PRE>
<font size=5>F</font size=5>or her own part, Susan had these things to say on the Alan Colmes show 11-15-96. Exact quotes are used wherever possible:
<P>
She spoke of the general effort by Starr and his assistant prosecutors to get her to testify before a grand jury. She quoted them as saying, "We want something on Bill and Hillary Clinton." 
<P>
"Starr has an agenda. They're out to ruin Bill and Hillary Clinton."
<P>
"If I answer questions in such a way that gives them something on Bill and Hillary, they'll make sure I don't have to spend a single day in jail. He [Starr subordinate] was begging me."
<P>
"Could I answer questions freely under these conditions?"
<P>
"I am allowed no lawyer to protect me in the grand jury."
<P>
"Judge Susan Weber Wright has no power to help. The judges with jurisdiction are the 8th circuit appeal court, the same three-judge panel that installed Starr over Fiske. They are all Republicans. They have turned down all my appeals."
<P>
"David Hale received $84,000 in free expenses while he cooperated with Starr. He got medical treatment and an apartment."
<P>
"Also Bill Watt got total immunity for cooperation."
<P>
"Ray Leon [a Starr assistant prosecutor] said he wanted my cooperation and I would be put on probation and not go to jail. I told him, 'I offered the truth. What do you want?' He said 'We want something on Hillary and Bill Clinton.' If my story doesn't match the story they want the American people to buy, they'll charge me with perjury. The Clintons are not guilty of anything."
<P>
"I can't just go in to the grand jury and answer one question. You can't answer only one question with these people. They'll keep on going, interrogating me for hours."
<P>
"Starr is associated closely with the right wing, with the Christian right. He was involved in the effort to advance Paula Jones. He thinks the Clintons are bad for America. He wants to get rid of them."
<P>
"The deal is, 'You ring them and you get your life back. You get probation instead of jail.' "
<P>
"These people are ruthless. They don't answer to anyone. What is wrong is threatening people with prosecution to get the story they want. They are threatening me with perjury if I say Bill Clinton told the truth."

<PRE>  </PRE>

From the point of view of advertisers who pay a fortune to seduce consumers to buy their products, editorial content ideally will attract and hold the consumer's attention.
<P>
In many media outlets, there's pressure from the advertising department on the editorial department to attract and hold as much of the reader's or viewer's attention as possible.  In print and on air, this means being cute, brief, readable, hearable, entertaining at the expense of informing.  The extreme form of this style is called the "tabloid." In London, Rupert Murdochs news tabloid features a large photo of a scantily-clad female somewhere in the first three pages.
<P>
You may think the tabloid is only a throw-away sheet you peek into while standing in line at the supermarket, but no.  The attention-grabbing tabloid style has now become totally cool in some of our most prestigious news organizations.  Blurring the line between news and entertainment (often through "attitude writing") allows these two quite different things to be mixed artfully on a daily and nightly basis.
<P>
Certain shows subliminally condition us to shallow thinking. They keep us in practice at the lowest level of acceptable convention--pushing the envelope every day.  They habituate us to voyeurism.  I'm not a goodie-two-shoes about voyeurism on occasion, but as a lifestyle I think it makes us passive.  It makes us let others act in our place.  It lets others think for us. Often	we enjoy these shows, saying "I want to veg out.  I've been thinking all day.  I don't want to think for a while.  I'm gonna watch 'Hard Copy.
<P>
We rest our minds in mindlessness--and that's OK, if it doesn't become a way of thinking.
<P>
"Hard Copy"--the name implies a tribute to the older medium of print on "hard" paper which conveys a sense of respectable credibility where none may exist.  This particular gossip show is a classic tabloid frontpage-in-motion.
<P>
The table of contents for one issue of "Hard Copy" featured these headlines, announced as teasers to entice viewers to watch the upcoming show (honest, I didn't make them up): "Ivana Trump, B.O.W. (Bitch on Wheels)"; "The Young Boy Who Accused Michael Jackson of Sexual Molestation, exclusive interview tomorrow, only on Hard Copy" (I switched channels and caught a teaser for a TV-movie "Backstab, tomorrow on USA"); "Marsha Clark's Custody Battle with Her Ex-Husband"; "The Sizzling X-Rated Show That Has Women Squirming: Women's Fantasies Are Steaming Up the Airwaves"; "Female Body Builder Kills Husband in Jealous Rage"; "Newt Gingrichs Secret Life and Indiscretions, tomorrow, only on Hard Copy."
<P>
Where the media interface with politics, as they do daily, nightly and completely, the tabloidization of political personalities--from the "waffling' Bill Clinton to the 'buffoon" Jesse Helms--makes a gigantic cartoon of life on earth at an especially unfortunate time. 
<P>
Commercial media's coverage of political matters is interested in keeping things "lively" rather than explaining issues in depth or, for example, giving us a simple list of all 82 programs said to be on the GOP chopping block.  Where can we get that list?  We write to our Congressmen who sends us back a form letter full of "accomplishments" but no list of 82 programs on the GOP chopping block. Tear through your morning newspaper, skim through every news channel--nothing--not a word about the 82 programs on the GOP chopping block, even though millions of Americans will be affected by them in some way or other. 
<P>
Do the media really care about whether millions of Americans--their consumers--are affected by politicals events? No. They care that we are affected by gossip about a White House aide's suicide, by whether his thumb or his forefinger was in the trigger, because these facts which are unknown and unknowable sell papers, sell air time, sell products. In-depth discussion of issues doesn't sell. 
<P>
The attention-grabbing tabloid is the ideal advertising vehicle and as long as we are a hyper-commercial consumer society, our media will always reflect the attention-grabbed tabloid mind--while our national "political conversation" wedges itself into available nitches on NPR or PBS or finds no place at all.
<P>
The media accentuate conflict and the build-up-tear-down of heroes,  personalities and Presidents.  They define "expectations" and then pounce on the predictable failure to meet those expectations.  They create "newsworthy" stories where no news exists. They do not often tend to be helpful.
<P>
Thus we had several days of the story of Bill Clintons haircut that supposedly held up scheduled air traffic at LAX when in fact--it turns out--no such air traffic was held up at all. Were the correct facts given once they were known? No. Not a word of correction has been seen in mainstream media about the haircut story. But a lot of papers were sold, a lot of jokes were told and air time sold on the Imus and Letterman shows. Worst of all, in the distraction of that ridiculous media flap, a lot of important matters went unreported.
<P>
Thus we had the story of Newt's mother quoting her son's "Hillary is a bitch" remark--which was unfair to Mr. Gingrich. The Connie Chung exchange lowered the standard of assessing Gingrich, when we should have been examining him on a much higher level of concern.
<P>
There is little subtlety in the tabloid mind, little appreciation of nuance, almost no tolerance for detail or differentness, not much knowledge of history, nearly no historical memory--even over a few days' time--and a great potential for the acceptance of demagogic and violent expressions. 
<P>
Crime news, for example, is perfect fodder. It's cheap to produce, emotionally gripping, and often has the effect of being racially divisive.  We learn nearly nothing from it.
<P>
Remember that the tabloid mind is <I>our</I> mind first.  The media pick up on and reverberate <I>our thinking</I>--capitalizing on our exhaustion getting home from work, "vegging out" or being alone and lonely.  We ask for the human mind to be rendered in the form of a tabloid page and we get exactly what we want.  We are the media inasmuch as we are the media's market.
<P>
Only <I>we</I> can change our mediated world.

Turn on, tune in.  Drop out.  Music, voices, gray of printed words.  Jump-cut video from face to face, talkin' heads.  Everybody's talkin'.  Is anybody listenin'?  Is anybody watchin' what's going on?
<P>
Everybody's talkin', gossiping over the back fence, telling stories:  "<I>Did ya hear?</I>" Knee-slapping stories.  Stories that make you laugh, stories that make you mad, stories that "raise questions"; stories about personalities, about sports, about sex, about political battles and scandals, each story one-upping the next, the way neighbors tell tales with hand over mouth, "This is exclusive. This is new.  This is <I>news.</I>"
<P>
Viewed from this perspective, the media are a dear part of our humanity, for we've been a species of gossipers for thousands of years.  There's no problem with that natural human enjoyment, except insofar as the backyard fence is now electronic airwaves and printed pages, our political decision-making is grounded in it--and the activity is financed by commercials.  We are involved, for better or worse, in a commercial ecology with the media.  We absorb media, we consume media and media's advertised products.
<P>
And the media consume us.  Critics of the media like to speak about the onslaught of the media on us, which certainly occurs.  Yet little is said about how passively we receive media's onslaught.  We complain and we let it go on.  We can pretend to be "civilized" by saying we disapprove of the O.J. Simpson coverage while, of course, most of us are secretly fascinated by it.
<P>
The O.J. story is a story about how important this story is to us. We're embarrassed to admit that we can relate to various chapters of the O.J.-Nicole saga only too easily.
<P>
We love to be entertained by stories, so it's natural that we have "news stories." It's a range of rings within rings around core stories that draw our attention, stories about stories, layer on layer, permeating even politics.  A cartoon caption said: "the only channel that doesn't have O.J. is the one Newt wants to cut."
<P>
The "story" is paramount, the moral parable having a beginning, a middle and an end.  We love to hear stories, especially heroic and anti-heroic stories.  Thus the media dished up hundreds of words telling the tale of the lone holdout Senator on the balanced budget amendment, while only a scant few words--mostly in slogan language--were devoted to what exactly his hold-out vote was all about.
<P>
That Senator's action created a "fuss," a conflict that carried a message about a refinement of thinking about the BBA, perhaps even re-thinking the whole thing as happened with health care.  But rather than open the message and read it, the media chose to feature the struggle, the sport, the comic-book battle of winners and losers.  
<P>
The winners and losers of what?
<P>
We are the media.  We are the media's consumers.  We are the media's market.  The media give us what they think we want.  Yet it seldom occurs to us to tell them what we want by writing directly to media owners and to national and local news and programming managers or even advertisers.  We are passive rather than interactive with the people who make the media.
<P>
The "media" are multiple and not all the same.  Some play close to the edge of the commercial game while still managing to make positive, stimulating and educational contributions to our lives.  Then there are the media that chatter along an immense range, from malicious or idle gossip, to expressions of some use to us.  It's all there.
<P>
The surreality of considering that "we are the media" is a useful meditation.  It forces us to look at how we contribute to what we get in the media because we're willing to buy it.
<P>
This doesn't mean we boycott the media, although boycotting advertised products could be useful.  I think first it means we become more aware of the media around us, learn more about how they work, how they affect the way we think, how we let that happen, how we let television baby-sit for us, how we rely on the media to fill spaces in between ourselves and life, even in relationships, that we are unable to live on our own.
<P>
A good book, for example, is <I>How to Watch TV News</I> by Neil Postman and Steve Powers.  A few other eye-opening explications of the media are available in the library, although it is surprising how little study has been done of this complex and important subject. (A year after this column was written, several new works are available. See below).
<P>
We tend to think of print and broadcast media as "background noise," harmless, silly, not really affecting us.  We dismiss it.  The media benefit by this because this means there is little cogent analysis of the media, and of course the media themselves are hesitant to analyze the media.  Yet we are affected immeasurably by impressions from the media, many of them false.
<P>
The best antidote to this would be to take the media seriously, to watch them carefully, and begin to notice the larger picture of what's going on.  For children, media education should begin in elementary school.  For parents, consider this: program content may be alarming, but <I>the child's relationship with the TV set itself</I> gives the child an artificial sense of unlimited control which interferes with the early parental relationship.  This in turn can give rise to frustration, anxiety and anger as the child soon finds out that control is sorely limited in the real world.  This conditioning must be scrutinized.
<P>
Watch the media's patterns, themes, and tactics.  Pay attention to the language, the music, the graphic design, the photos.  Be alert to media's appeal to conflict, division, xenophobia, and others of our worst instincts.  Watch the leads, headlines, and 
teasers that beckon you to "stay with us." Be aware of how your attention is sought at every turn, in every conceivable way.  
<P>
Attention to what?
<P>
Consider how values are formed and fortified through commercials and advertising.  Discern, as you watch with new eyes, how life expectations are shaped by promises of instant gratification if you buy a certain product.  Sales are at the center of media.  Point of purchase psychology prevails.  Watch the media operate.  Watch how you respond.  You may begin to wonder how you let it go on so long.
<P>
Consider, too, the viewings, listenings and readings that are enriching.  Encourage new modeling by giving the media credit where credit is due.  Watch your relationship with the media--and learn.
<P>
Start a "Media Watch Diary' to make notes on what you're noticing on TV or radio.  Make the media experience more <I>conscious.</I> Clip articles.  Watch the patterns and discern the techniques.  Analyze the media.  Study the media.  Believe me, the media are studying you.
<P>
Then write.  We need to engage the media more aggressively in writing--on good old fashioned paper.  "Letters to the Editor," sure, write 'em.  But also write letters to media management.  Prove wrong the notion that quality thinking cannot be commercially successful.  Write to advertisers.  Show the simple fact that intelligent and caring people who want better media are in many cases the very people who can afford to buy the medias advertised products. This is our power.
<P>
Media owners, advertisers, editors and managers <I>do read</I> and are likely to pay attention to an onslaught of reasonably written constructive letters from their market of media-watchers. 
<P>
Let's stop talkin'. Start watchin', listenin', readin'--and writin'.

<BLOCKQUOTE><H4><I><font color="#0000ff"><CENTER>Opening remarks by Jane Wardlow Prettyman, 10-12-95, <BR>Santa Barbara City College series on "Talk Media," <BR>convened in Faulkner Gallery 
</CENTER></font color="#0000ff"></I>
<PRE>  </PRE>


<font size=5>W</font size=5>e will be talking tonight about talk media and we will also be holding closely in our sensorium the potentials of unmediated communications in our everyday lives--and noticing the differences in tone, in quality, in degrees of helpfulness to us. 
<P>
  In an effort to shape the human context of electronic public talk," I want to start by asking a question usually left to the end:  Where will we go from here? Where we will go is home--to our families, our friends, our jobs, our community--and to our TV sets, radios and computers. From our discussion of media, we will go back to life--which includes media. The quality of how we (in life) meet the media (in the air) is what we want to advance here. The quality of ideas freely exchanged depends in part on the quality of this relationship. 
<P>
  I suggest the quality of ideas also depends on how much and how well we practice the live communication of ideas and practice listening in our own living rooms and kitchens, with our neighbors, within our civic associations, and even in such gatherings as our meeting here in the Faulkner Gallery. 
<P>
I am suggesting the encouragement of a marketplace of ideas as opposed to the medias marketplace of perceptions.
<P>
  Some of you may have heard about Harvard professor Robert Putnam's essay "Bowling Alone." Discussing civic associations, Putnam notes that we used to see people bowling in leagues or groups that met regularly--and now we see people bowling alone. Putnam promotes the notion of "social capital" and the importance of social connection engendered by civic projects. He believes these ties of shared effort and thoughtfulness of each other provide a ground of social belonging that gives rise to a natural motivation to participate in the culture and in the political process. He underscores a notion of accountability for one another that would exist in a bowling league or active civic association but would be absent in bowling or working alone. He calls this the practicing of "the habits of the heart."

<P>
 Putnam defines the investment of social capital as people rolling up their sleeves, getting their heads together and pitching in to accomplish the activities of common importance to their neighborhoods. He believes this activity constitutes the connective tissue of the body of society that holds the muscle to the bone. 
<P>
  Putnam proposes that successful social capitalism improves participation of citizens in the political process. They tend to vote. And the Santa Barbara <I>News Press</I> might be interested in Putnams idea that civic involvement tends to improve newspaper readership because people who are involved in the world are more interested in whats going on.
<P>
     In fact, it occurs to me that some of the most socially active people Ive met in Santa Barbara are some of the most annoyed by the sometimes inferior quality local news coverage by the Santa Barbara <I>News Press.</I> They seem eternally disappointed that their local newspaper is not in better touch  with the aliveness of the community  as  they know it. But if part of the fault is the <I>News Press,</I> is there not also fault in the majority of the rest of us who are not so involved in our community, the fault of our own isolation and passivity? Both ends are abandoning the middle.
<PRE>   </PRE>
   <font size=5>S</font size=5>tay with me, please, while I give some earthy body to the airy sky of talk media and media in general. Putnam points to the reciprocity and civic solidarity of community associations that were so prevalent in the 19th century. Far from being a by-product of socio-economic modernization, civic associations were a pre-condition to it. Alexis de Tocqueville observed that ubiquitous civic groups fueled Americas greatness. Yet participation in volunteer town groups is in serious decline.  Interestingly, the decline has paralleled the rise of the media age.
<P>
  I bring up Putnams viewpoint because, although sometimes talk media can be insightful, as a habit there is a danger that media in all its forms can let us escape the intimacy and occasional discomfort of the unmediated world around the house, on the street, in the town. Media experience allows us to have a vicarious social-like existence without actually being social, indeed a vicarious political life without truly being political. If we watch TV together, we are not really together. We are separately looking not  at  each  other  but at TV. 
<P> 
We think that "news keeps us in touch." We've been conditioned to the notion that electronic technology connects us in some substantial way, but it is an artificial connection, engendered for a "feel-good" marketing strategy for the selling of goods. "Reach out and touch someone," says AT&T. "Were in touch, so you be in touch," says Hugh Downs on 20/20, but whos he kidding? 
<P>
Television, radio, computers, and telephones allow us to withdraw from life and be comfortable alone or in the isolated units of our families. They allow us to veg out. They keep us company and fill in all our spaces. Instead of talking to other families, we are watching and listening to familiar strangers talking to each other. Its not Fahrenheit 451, but the handwriting is on the video-wall.
<P> 
     My comments here are an effort to swing the weight of attention around to another point of view--our inter-personal points of view,  unmediated, uncommented upon, unpolled--simply talking to each other. We can keep in touch without dropping a dime--and do a better job of communicating than the telephone game offered by most media. 
<PRE>   </PRE>
     <font size=5>Y</font size=5>ou would think it would be easy to be more civically active. Not only does holding two jobs leave us little time, but the media have conditioned us to be comfortable in our self-contained homes without going out into the community among our neighbors.  When we do go out, we are likely to engage in <I>more</I> media--the arts are a form of media, plays, movies. Even sports are a form of media--and the news media, in particular, are certainly a form of sport.
<P>
     Entertainment and appreciation of the arts are necessary for soul--and so is knowing who our neighbors are, who our husbands and wives are, who our lovers are, who our children are. That takes time, that takes speaking with each other, that takes relating.  By not being active in our neighborhood, in our town, even in our relationships, are we missing the practice of our greatest art?
<P>
      
 Beyond-the-family social activity constitutes the cultures social capital,  says Francis Fukuyama, author of <I>The End of History.</I> It is people reaching out and building avenues of trust from one group to another, so as to avoid the extremes of state gigantism (like the concept of big government and new world order) at one end or, at the other, family atomization (cult families, compounds). 
<P>
I submit that the media, too, constitute a sphere of possession that has its own potential for avoidance of ourselves as a society in civility.
<P>
   I started a regular discussion group called the "Open Mind Salon" about a year and a half ago and its a marvelous thing. We discuss media and current affairs. You can organize a salon or dinner group yourself on any or all subjects. Its not hard.  Make an effort to invite people you may not know well or people whose views may not be yours. Make sure you have delicious food. Erik Utne has been on to salons for years.

Our salon is not quite the same thing as a civic association, however. My primary goal is to encourage people to write, speak up to the media, be more vocal--and our group has certainly been successful in that regard. More than half our participants have had letters or op-ed pieces in the paper or have been on panels or other public forums. This is only part of the picture of civic activity, but it's an engaging and alive alternative to the passive experience of receiving media. We are making our own media.
<PRE>   </PRE>
     <font size=5>W</font size=5>e must recreate the rituals and places in our natural lives to practice the intellectual life of the city, that is, to practice listening and the art of deliberating. This means expressing our thoughts, ideas and concerns in the presence of others by pausing and allowing ourselves to come into the middle where the vibrations of discordant ideas find notes of modulation that can take on the richness of a cello. These are the "habits of the heart" that Putnam speaks of. Its a long way from most talk radio.
<P>
     If we do more actual talking to actual people--unmediated--and if Putnams vision of social activity is achieved--or re-achieved--bit by bit, we might then have a different relationship with media.
  As for civic associations, from the perspective of involved community, the media might become somewhat ephemeral, somewhat surreal, less important, less attractive, something to be selected, analyzed, viewed objectively, and employed to our benefit--rather than a medium that suckers us with appeals to  our  worst  instincts just to make a buck. Its an expensive buck. 
<P> From this perspective, talk radio and talk TV might be forced by consumers to address what is important because our taste for what holds our attention has changed. In addition to this, and most important for me, we cannot expect media to change until we shift some of our attention away from the media, towards each other and towards our city life together.
<P>
    Having said all these dire things about media, three local radio programs I like quite a lot are Scott Londons interview show Insight and Outlook; Frances Halperns show on art, books and creativity; and Mike Barrieres Talk of the Town. There are others. But the best talk of the town, for my money, goes on in our salon--which happens to be attended by all three media hosts. They are, after all, public citizens like the rest of us.

Jane Wardlow Prettyman has spent the better part of 30 years observing the media. She grew up in a household where reading and conversing were prized, and she didnt have access to TV until the age of 18. When she <I>did</I> get her hands on TV, she found it to be a phenomenon to be studied as much as watched.

"In Memphis today President Clinton broke out of the pattern of political speeches, of the expected and the calculated.  He spoke from within himself, responding in emotional terms to the appalling reality of violence in this country today.  The response he got shows that one thing Americans want a President to do is to speak out about wrongs, not always to have a 10-point plan or a graph--but to <I>speak.</I> No one person can solve our problems of social decay but this President has made us face them."

<H4> Four of the five speeches here and all the color photos were obtained remotely from the White House Web site. The speech at Memphis and the quote from President Clinton's speech in Ireland are from the <I> New York Times.</I>
<P>
Consider visiting <A HREF="realnews.htm">The Real News Page</A>, another Web site edited by yours truly, Jane Prettyman, a former editor at (the old) <I>Esquire</I> Magazine who is a private citizen with no official or unofficial connection to the White House. You are now standing inside a subsite (room) of "The Real News Page" where this collection is featured under the heading "Missing Stories": "The Top Five Under-Reported Speeches of President Clinton."
<P>
These speeches demonstrate that the infamous 1993 Time Magazine cover featuring "The Incredible Shrinking President" missed the essence of Bill Clinton--this is "The Incredible <I>Thinking</I> President."

On March 31, 1996 Project Censored, organized by former Sonoma State University communications professor Carl Jensen, listed the top 10 stories it said major media organizations failed to adequately report last year.
<P>
A panel of judges from universities and consumer groups made the selections, which have been announced annually for the last 20 years.
<P>
    1.  The Telecommunications Bill, signed into law in February 1996, won top prize because the public was not told how the new law will permit large concentrations of media power.
<P>
        2. The federal budget could be balanced by the year 2002 by cutting corporate welfare rather than slashing medical and social spending.
<P>
        3. Children in the United States are working in environments that are dangerous to their education, health and even lives.
<P>
        4. The federal government is gradually transferring the public Internet to private companies.
<P>
        5. The United States is spending billions on enhancing the power of its warheads while urging other nations to eliminate nuclear weapons.
<P>
        6. Newt Gingrich's think tank hopes to privatize the Food and Drug Administration's supervision of drugs and medical devices.
<P>
        7. For more than three decades, Russia injected billions of gallons of radioactive atomic waste into the earth.
<P>
        8. Medical fraud costs the U.S. economy billions of dollars every year, but no one is keeping track.
<P>
        9. The chemical industry is fighting the ban on methyl bromide, a pesticide highly toxic to humans and destructive to the earth's ozone layer.
<P>
       10. Promises made to U.S. and Mexican workers to pass the North American Free Trade Act have already been broken.

FROM THE LAST PAGE OF "PRIMARY COLORS": 
<P>
"Henry, come on," Stanton said, stretching his arms out across the desk toward me. His voice caught slightly. His eyes narrowed, burrowed deep, searching my consciousness, desperate to make a stronger connection. His brow, his nostrils, the veins in his neck, his arms, his fingers--everything was reaching out, <BR><font color="#ff0000">(((</font color="#ff0000"> everything was focused on me.<font color="#ff0000">)))<P>(infantile narcissism)</font color="#ff0000">. <P>I knew this moment so well; I had seen him do it so many times <font color="#ff0000">(judgment of insincerity and promiscuity)</font color="#ff0000">. He could talk all he wanted about an eternity of "false" smiles: His power came from the exact opposite direction, from the <I>authenticity</I> of his appeal, from the stark ferocity of his hunger. There was very little artifice to him. He was truly needy.
<P>
<font color="#ff0000">(I could talk all I wanted about "false smiles" and insincerity, <BR>but actually I was needy. I needed him to need me)</font color="#ff0000">
<P>
And now he truly needed me.

<font size=5>E</font size=5>ditors Note:  What follows is a  psycho-literary analysis of sections of Primary Colors by Joe Klein--who wrote under the pseudonym of Anonymous--with reference to Kleins relationship with his favorite subject, Bill Clinton. This analysis is either fact or fiction, as you prefer. The editor knows who the author is, so dont ask. Were not telling.

<font size=5> I</font size=5> thought for a couple of months that he was lying, but its good to have him out of the closet.... Klein was showing signs of weariness. He was ready to come out of the closet....

<P>
Don Foster was only one of several people speaking about Joe Kleins Primary Colors who used the phrase out of the closet. It was used as an innocent phrase. It may--or may not--be ironic.

<font color="#0000ff">Premise #2:</font color="#0000ff"> 
<P>
You can write fiction and journalism at same time... But what continues to trouble me is that the same guy, Joe Klein, using both the novel on one track and his published columns on the other track, was pumping out both fact and fiction, and using them both to drive home the same moral message about the same public figure, Bill Clinton. He couldnt help but know--especially as novel sales increased--that the novel was in a sense going to reinforce what hes saying in his columns which would be fine if the novel were not based in part on things he made up. So I think theres still a troubling matter here.....

<font color="#0000ff">Premise #3:</font color="#0000ff"> 
<P>
Joe Klein may have a personal transference ("hang up") on Bill Clinton that disqualifies him from any semblance of journalistic credibility. For reasons we dont know--perhaps because of a great disillusionment in his childhood that he might have transferred to the figure of Bill Clinton--Mr. Klein appears to be intensely fascinated by Clinton and also out to punish Clinton for "causing" his primal disillusionment. If this is true, his political analysis cannot be trusted.  
<P>
Mr. Klein rationalized in a recent issue of the <I>New York Times Book Review</I> that the Clinton-like character in "Primary Colors" had "good intentions," but this is a stretch. The portrait is still essentially a trash-job at the expense of the President. 
<P>
"I never had so much fun at a keyboard," said Mr. Klein.
<P>
The novel Primary Colors may well be a fairly conscious expression of Joe Klein's love-hate relationship with Clinton. And/or it may be revealing of his personal life in ways he may or may not have consciously intended. 
<P>
Some have theorized that the narrator Henry Burton is modeled on  George Stephanopolous. This may make surface sense in terms of the role the character plays in the novel. But it's a convenient distraction from a far more compelling idea: the true narrator is Klein himself. 
<P> 
This will sound outrageous to those who are not used to thinking this way, that is, thinking psychologically, but here goes:
<P>
The principle primal desire Klein describes appears to be an overwhelming yen for his Mother and Father to be united (in the form of the male-female androgynous figure of Clinton/Stanton) to acknowledge and love Mr. Klein as the sole focus of attention with absolute sincerity--solely, completely, purely, devotedly,  without promiscuity--the classic ideal infantile desire we all have about our parents. 
<P>
This ties in seamlessly with Klein's non-fiction fascination with Bill Clinton.
<P>
Did Klein lay an infantile personal trip on Bill Clinton in his news columns?
<P>

<PRE>    </PRE>

<font size=5>J</font size=5>ournalists have made a great hew and cry over Joe Kleins lie. Yet there's something even bigger he may have "made up." 
<P>
First, theres a question as to whether Klein is a journalist or an opinionator. He seems to be more the latter. He preaches. He outrages. He makes good points but he's moralistic. He disapproves. He longs for an ideal. He snarls in his thoughts when he does not find his Eden--and he takes it out mostly on Bill Clinton. 
<P>
The big possibility revealed in Klein's authorship of "Primary Colors" is that he may have always been not a journalist but a "journalistic novelist" pumping his fantasies into the news. This may be one reason why he wanted to remain anonymous, so the parallel patterns couldn't be observed between his non-fiction and his fiction.
<P>
Mr. Kleins <I>appearance</I> as a journalist (which implies fact checking, a standard of ethics, and a state of being fairly "clear" psychologically in personal relation to the subject), gives him a degree of credibility that he may not deserve. 
<P>
The lie may go deeper. In fact, it may go down so deep that only depth psychology makes any sense. By this I mean looking at Klein's projected version of his personal sexuality--perhaps one of many versions--and finding clues in his writing--whether "fact" writing or "fiction" writing, in his "news" columns or in Primary Colors. 
Which is which and is there any difference when it comes to Klein's psychological motives? 
<P>
This is a question about Klein's character. It's just as important as any of Klein's questions about Clinton's character. 
<P>
Examining the "art" created by a journalist (or quasi-journalist like Klein) may be the closest we ever get to truth in media. Reading the work on many levels as well as observing the man. This is an erotic reading here--apologies to the CDA--just a few "meaningful handshakes," as Klein/Burton calls his contacts with Clinton/Stanton in Primary Colors. The handshakes between these two men are far more erotic than any of Klein/Burton's interactions with women.
<P>
In May 1994, Joe Klein wrote a lengthy essay in the center of <I>Newsweek</I>. It was titled The Politics of Promiscuity. Despite the pun--perhaps because of the pun--it was run in the National Affairs section. It was a monumental trashing of the President but nobody seemed to mind. 
<P>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="gottalrg.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
In this essay (which the <I>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</I> reprinted in full and retitled "He's Gotta Have It"), Mr. Klein proposed a theory that Bill Clintons sexual promiscuity was reflected in his domestic and foreign policy decisions. Considering the relative success of many of Mr. Clinton's policy decisions, Klein may regret that he pinned policy and promiscuity together. 
<P>
Since Mr. Klein, the political analyst, opened the avenue of armchair psychoanalysis when he made a number of assumptions about Bills Clintons promiscuity, I feel comfortable in applying some of the same techniques. At worst, this is a wash of two ridiculous interpretations. At best, what you read here may expose something worrisome at the heart of media-politics among <I>all</I> "commentators."
<P>
I thought at the time I read Kleins 1994 National Affairs piece in <I>Newsweek</I> that there was more to his interest in Mr. Clintons sexuality than how it might show up--or not--in the Presidents decisions. Klein seemed personally angry at Clinton and also uncontrollably fascinated by Clinton. He wrote repeatedly about this President with repeated digs at his character, especially his "sexual character."  Whenever I saw Klein's byline, I knew there was a good chance he'd be writing about Bill Clinton and not kindly--in fact, unkindly, cuttingly, desparagingly, cruelly. He was very serious about Bill Clinton. He seemed to suffer with the meaning of it all, from a hurt point of view. 
<P>
Not long after he wrote The Politics of Promiscuity, Mr. Klein was a panelist on a forum of several columnists discussing President Clintons sex life. Joe Klein was considered an expert on the subject. It was a fascinating conference on the Presidents Sex Life, of course, and of course it was run in full on C-SPAN, our beloved "public affairs" network. 
<P>
When Klein's turn came to speak, he looked very serious as he described his disillusionment with President Clinton, especially after having initially liked Clinton so much. Several years ago, Klein was widely known as "pro-Clinton." This stance had in fact gained for him the trust of the 1992 Clinton campaign staff with whom he hung out and gathered material for his mocking portrait of that campaign called Primary Colors. Somewhere along the line, Klein's view changed profoundly. We don't know quite when or why. Mr. Kleins tone at the Conference on President Clintons Sex Life was somber and judgmental, his disappointment snippy. 
<P>
Although there was no evidence that Mr. Clinton was currently being promiscuous since becoming President, still, a grave sin had been committed, Klein felt, and the President could not be forgiven. He had to be punished. 
<P>
If youre now wondering who "he" is, you've arrived at the nexus of my analysis. <BR>Did Klein feel <I>he</I> had to be punished for his own primal desires? Did he project his guilt onto the figure of Bill Clinton?
<P>
It's a question.
<P>
The anger of disillusionment was profound in Mr. Klein. Something special had been lost and he took it very personally. 
<P>
No one knows entirely the truth of Mr. Clinton's sin, if there was one, or his repentance, if there has been any. Quite likely there was some degree of sin and some degree of repentance. But Klein's judgment is so one-sided, so fiercely punishing of a figure--himself and/or an ancestral figure who long preceded Bill Clinton in Joe Klein's life--that he takes little interest in <I>the actual life of Bill Clinton</I>. The lack of a more patient, reflective, circumferential view of Clinton--in Klein's columns, although better in "Primary Colors"--is one giveaway to Klein's personally vindictive motives. 
<P>
We dont know what the turning point was that turned Mr. Klein away from being an open admirer of the President. Whenever and whyever, it turned him into a simpering, caustically angry, finger-wagging observer of Bill Clinton. It turned him into someone who acted like a spurned lover. 
<P>
A few months ago, in the March issue of <I>The New York Review of Books</I>, Garry Wills (in a review of "Blood Sport") mused about whether the national press was becoming a bit puritanical in their judgment of the Presidents sexuality. He wondered whether they were going after Whitewater, in part, because they couldnt get at Clinton directly for his sexual transgressions. This question has come up before from other angles, with the idea for example that perhaps some male journalists are jealous of Clinton's sexual prowess. Clinton's unusual gender-gap has been called a "guy thing." 
<P>
Now we find that Mr. Klein wrote a novel which is believed to be more than thinly based on the 1992 Clinton campaign and the Clintons themselves. This "novel" shows a great deal of fascination with--and criticism of--"Gov. Jack Stanton's" sexuality. 
<P>
After the heartbreak that made him turn away from Clinton--whatever caused it---Klein didn't recuse himself from the case.  He went deeper into it, or so it certainly 
appears. It appears, in fact, that he went after Clinton with a vengeance. He indulged in writing an entire novel on the subject. 
<PRE>    </PRE>
<font size=5>B</font size=5>ill Clinton is a classic homoerotic object--with his ideal looks, his sunny handsomeness,  his sexuality, his style, his ease with women, his generosity, his intelligence, his young father image. He's got a lot of woman in him, too. He's certainly the most androgynous President since Kennedy. 
<P>
He's also a classic object for the anger of people who hate what they perceive as insincerity. Clinton's eyes move beyond you while he's speaking to you. He pays many attentions at once. He's a classic Leo. I know the breed. I'm a Leo, too, and it's incorrigible to some people. 
<P>
Klein in his columns and his fictional counterpart Burton in Primary Colors both do a lot of sneering at Clintons perceived insincerity.  But  NPRs Moira Lierson, whos been tough on Clinton from the beginning, noted 7-26-96 that when she observed the President moving among people one by one, even though some people  make jokes about Clinton feeling your pain,  when Clintons out there with folks, people are saying This man has a real capacity for sincerity. 
<P>
So point of view--and ones personal history--can make a difference in motive and how we see things like the Presidents sincerity. Moira was reporting matter-of-factly while Klein/Burton was subjectively judging Clinton, perhaps from an ancient personal grudge. 
<P>
Just now, gays are mad at Clinton for playing politics--or refusing to play--with the issue of gay marriage. Yet Clinton has done more than anybody ever imagined for gays. Their anger is, I think, a petulant response. I say this as a gay woman--an old one but a gay one--who understands these things. Klein, like many gays, may have idealized Clinton to such an extent--as such a hero--that the slightest crack in the ideal image caused sharp pain in Klein's heart. 
<P>
If this is true, even if Joe Klein is not actually gay (hes probably not),  his response to the breaking of an ideal image in the figure of Bill Clinton is gay-like and intensely angry. 
<P>
This is not literal homosexuality we're talking about here, although that would be fine. I'm not a concrete thinker. It's more interesting than that, more psychologically mysterious. This is <I>homo-eroticism</I>--an ideal emotion in the mind that surrounds the potential for sexuality. It's a very intense connection that's usually not physical. Plato encouraged high love between men as part of a healthy mind--if it's conscious, that is. It's the entertainment of a fantasy. "To entertain" is to hold the image in mind. What better entertainment than writing a novel? 
<P>
Consider that Kleins personal stuff" may have moved the heart of the pen that was writing pseudo-journalistic columns about "promiscuity" (a term more readily associated with homosexuals than heterosexuals) in the government policies (and, by implication, the current sexual practices) of the President of the United States. 
<P>
Are Klein's constant moralistic references to Clinton's "promiscuity" a gigantic projection of his own secret desires?
<P>
It's a question. 
<P>
Did Klein come out of the closet when his authorship of "Primary Colors" was revealed? Or did he come out of the closet when "Primary Colors" was published--and try to stay in the closet by remaining anonymous? 
<P>
Klein is focused on the real Bill Clinton <I>and</I> on the fictional Clinton/Stanton figure. He is fascinated by this figure, he is utterly absorbed by this figure. He loves and hates this figure at the same time. 
<P>
After glancing over the analysis below--just a few lines in the opening and closing pages to give you a feel for how imagery works--you can decide for yourself whether the question should focus not only on Kleins lie to journalists, but also on Klein's possible homoerotic attraction to President Clinton, a relationship so confused and contradictory, a push/pull--if it existed--so powerful that Klein had to express it through a symbolic system of fiction within which he could freely act out his fantasy. 
<P>
If this is true, then he would certainly want to remain anonymous, especially if he realized in retrospect what he had done and how obvious was his illicit attraction (he hates it) in the descriptions of his fiction. Especially if he personally knows the subject. If this is true, he wants most to be anonymous from his love-hate object, Bill Clinton. Klein must have winced when Clinton nailed him as the author at the White House Correspondents' banquet. As long as Klein was "Anonymous"--especially from Clinton himself--his fantasy was intact.
<P>
Meanwhile Klein was living a parallel life writing very serious, brooding, supposedly non-fictional critiques of the Presidency. His "journalistic" output repeatedly nagged Bill Clinton. 
<P>
He lets his love show more in the novel. 
<P>
It's a personal matter, from the beginning, perhaps even from Klein's beginning as a child. It's almost embarrassing to lay out what appears to be sensitive idealism gone awry. 
<P>
I'm no shrink but I've studied media and psychology for years. The Klein-Clinton affair may bring up a question about unconsciousness in the givers of "news." Never mind whether reporters and columnists are liberal or conservative. Are they self-aware? Does the slanting of "journalistic fact" through the filter of "personal stuff" endanger the quality of our information, especially as media increasingly relies on personality? 
<P>
We know it will always be this way, to a minimal extent, as long as we're human. We'll always have skewers of news. But when does it get out of hand? 
<P>
It's a question. 
<P>
An analysis of other Clinton-haters--or any commentators who "comment" with a hateful sneer, like William Safire, Emmet Tyrell, David Brock, Michael Kelly and a few others--might be revealing. The same goes for Clinton-lovers. They <I>all</I> might be revealing. What would the news look like with its projective filters removed? 
<P>
Klein's "lie to journalists," from this point of view, recedes into the background when we consider the possibility of another kind of lie which, as of July 26, 1996 has not been discussed in my earshot since the revelation of Kleins authorship of Primary Colors. If we are looking at an editorial motive based on frustrated love/hatred trying to punish its journalistic subject with pernicious darts of judgment, the question may become "What standards of personal self-knowledge should we expect in columnists, commentators, pundits, reporters--anyone in the media?" Should we ask them to analyze their personal stuff--get some therapy--before brandishing their swift swords of judgment about the character of public figures? Can a lack of personal insight distort our view of the public figure? 
<P>
Certainly it can and it does. All these impressions have impact on viewers and readers, especially when couched in "credibility" in <I>Time, Newsweek, New York Times, USA Today</I>, ABC, MSNBC, etc. This stuff is irresistible and it is irrisisted. This stuff sells books like "Primary Colors" and magazines like <I>Newsweek</I>. This stuff sells out. 
<P>
It's called gossip. 
<P>
The core of the problem is, as Don Foster put it, that Klein is "using both [journalism and fiction] to drive home the same moral message about the same public figure, Bill Clinton." Taken together, these are powerful parallel channels of potential misinformation. 
<P>
We know that some degree of personal bias about public figures--pro and con--goes on all the time. But Joe Klein covered the President for several years from an extremely high level of implied credibility in <I>Newsweek</I> and at CBS. In journalism, he was magnified, a big name. Yet in the fictional world of "Primary Colors" (called "a novel of politics" but really--perhaps--a novel of Klein's repressed longing), Klein produced the nearly mythic projection of a small man. 
<P>
Impotence is a primary (primal) theme. 
<P>
The novel's language is richest when Klein/Burton is describing his physical contacts with Clinton/Stanton. It is also the most conflicted--with continual mingling of male and female imagery in idealized bisexuality and drawbacks of impotence. Mr. Klein's character Henry suffers from the same disillusionment about the fictional figure based on the President (Jack Stanton) that Klein himself suffers and reports in his "commentary writing" about the actual President. 
<P>
Has Klein been tripping on Bill Clinton while pretending to be a journalist? "The Journalism of Unconsciousness" is just as good an area of inquiry as "The Politics of Promiscuity." 
<P>
Decide for yourself. 
<P>
Images are merely symbols, like notes on a sheet of music, and (in the next section of interpretation) I try to read them as universally as possible. This is how the images strike me in analyzing the novel as if it were a dream. They are, if you will, my own projections, hopefully fairly well-educated guesses. You will find your own meanings. This is just one sampling of how to shake it up and see what falls out of the pockets. 
<P>
The novel is brilliant, really, but perhaps not for the reasons Mr. Klein might want us to think. It's brilliant for how much it reveals of a man who thinks of himself as nobody. "By Anonymous" is really part of the title. This is the biography of the secret life of a small man. Is it fact or fiction? It is of course, as in all art, both.

<P>ROHNERT PARK, California (AP) -- Corporate welfare and how 
the new Telecommunications Deregulation Bill could create 
media monopolies were among the most under-reported stories 
in 1995, according to a watchdog group.</P>

<P>Project Censored, organized by former Sonoma State University

<P>The <A HREF="/US/9602/telecom_bill/index.html">Telecommunications Bill</A>, signed into law in February 
1996, won top prize because the public was not told how the 
new law will permit large concentrations of media power, the 
judges said.</P>

<P>Also listed in the "Top Ten Censored Stories:"</P>

<OL START=2>
<LI>The federal budget could be balanced by the year 2002 
by cutting corporate welfare rather than slashing medical and 
social spending.</P>

<LI>Children in the United States are working in 
environments that are dangerous to their education, health 
and even lives.</P>

<LI>The federal government is gradually transferring the

<LI>For more than three decades, Russia injected billions

<LI>Medical fraud costs the U.S. economy billions of

<font size=5>I</font size=5>'m a 51-year-old woman who wasn't exposed to television 
until the age of 18.<BR>My father thought that watching TV caused 
"lazy thinking."  When I finally got my hands on television, 
I found it a phenomenon to be <I>studied</I> as much as watched. 
<P>
This is precisely the tone of inquiry I want to encourage here, to look at all media as if we'd never seen them (plural) before. 
<P>
What do we notice? Whose interests do the media serve? How are they affecting our lives, our thinking, our freedom?
<P>
In asking Wheres the Real News? Ill be discussing news as we usually think of it and also the notion of real news--real and original thought of the inquiring mind (Im taking back the phrase) which is antithetical to what we commonly consume in the media. 
<P>
The media present a genuine problem of consciousness lost in commercial technology. Our freedom and politics are lost with it. We are left with commercial media where our freedom of thought and democracy used to be. Instead of a marketplace of ideas, we have the medias marketplace of perceptions. 
<P>
There is reason to believe, according to Harvards Robert Putnam, that once prolific civic associations have been ecliped by the virtual civic association of popular media (see Mr. Putnam's superb essay <A HREF="putnmtv1.htm">The Strange Disappearance of Civic America</A>). He believes the current lack of civic involvement may be related to the atomizing of family units around the television hearth, such that beyond-the-family community life is withering on the vine. Putnam may have a point. 
<P>
<A NAME="03">There are good things in the media</A> and we recognize them when we see them. For now, I'm examining the downside, the dark side. If one is a political activist today, one must be a media activist as well, and I will offer a few suggestions at the end of my remarks (below) about <A HREF="#02">media activism.</A>
<P>
Lets start with the basic pattern of how we think about media.
<P>
For example, reversing field and ground on a simple living room level, I've wondered not only about the <I>content</I> of television programming, but about <I>the child's relationship with the TV set itself and the TV remote</I> which gives the child a false sense of control and interferes with the parents' job of instilling limits and boundaries in the child.
<P>
I'm no psychologist but it seems intuitively obvious that no matter what contents on the screen the child skips through channel by channel and manipulates remotely click by click, this engrossing little circle of artificial power and instant gratification between the child and the TV/video game makes extremely annoying the intrusion of the parents. 
<P>
When we combine this with the fact that the limbic-emotional system in the childs brain is not fully hooked up to the pre-frontal lobes (creating an emotional sense of consequence and empathy) until well into puberty, whether or not the TV program content is violent, we may nevertheless be fostering in our children technological, remote, even violent ways of relating with other human beings. If we analogize between the TV remote.... the video game remote.... and the quintessentially remote device known as the gun....well, you get the idea....
<P>
The same thoughts also apply to the <I>computer</I>  itself.... Contents aside, between the TV remote, the joy stick, and the mouse, all that pointing and clicking and skipping and controlling is a conditioning in the neoteny of the child that is anything but preparation for real life.
<P>
Who knows? Im simply modeling a style of thinking here (and its not original with me), but this is one way of looking at things that I haven't seen discussed by the experts who populate popular media. 
<P>
Am I saying no TV and no computers for kids? No. I'm saying there's something here we're not looking at--and parents might want to consider the proportion of time a child spends at these technological devices to the exclusion of human (limbic) inter-activities.
<P>
The problem of the technological contraption itself may not get media attention because it strikes at the core of the whole bizarre media operation. To question TV's contents is not threatening to advertisers who can simply jump on the moral bandwagon and look good sponsoring healthy programming. Truly threatening to media and their merchandisers would be <I>to question the actual TV set itself, the vehicle that delivers everything.</I>
<P>
Interestingly, I came across this idea about the TV set/remote in a paid advertisement in the position usually occupied by the Mobil spot on the New York Times op-ed page several years ago. Someone paid thousands of dollars to get readers attention on this eccentric notion in the print medias most famous ad position--no doubt because he couldnt get anybody to write about it in the news or opinion pages.
<P>
So when we step back and consider the various frames, interests and motives of outlook, when we step through the looking glass and look at what's not being looked at, something whose interests are so imperative that we dare not look at it, we can get a hint of something so powerful that we must look again at all our old notions of freedom. 
<P>

<P>
Over the years as I looked at whats not being looked at, I began to find a shadow behind modern American life that stunned me, not being an anarchist or even a socialist, just a conventional American woman--once a magazine editor, yes--but since then simply looking. 
<P>
For all the American talk of freedom and democracy, I've come to question where our dependence on undemocratic unfree profit-motivated corporations may be leading us, especially as they gobble up media outlets like so many Big Macs. Now theyre hungry for the Internet as well, for its market potential while also wary of the Internets free thinking. I am not the first to notice a certain friction in the relationship between commercial markets--which require stability--and independent thought which upsets the apple cart. The ontogeny of the Internet recapitulates an entire century of media-market history. 
<P>
At the heart of our "free" democracy may lie a disturbing truth---that we are controlled by authoritarian corporate entities devoted to the commerce of material products--with authoritarian corporate media keeping us in line in something of a sheep-herding function. 
<P>
But "authority" may not seem like authority in media translation because it is conveyed in seduction, so often wearing a happy face. (See <I> Harper's</I> editor Lewis Latham's comments on the Disney-ization of America <A HREF="badnews.htm"> "Bad News Sells Good News"</A>). 
<P>
Hard-nose news media authority doesn't become obvious until it is questioned. In my experience over the years, two things keep coming up: 1) the news media insist they are right, offer elaborate excuses, manage to remain adamant, and exercise amazing convolutions of defensiveness to bolster their positions; 2) at the same time, the news media desperately want my business. 
<P>
For a couple of perfect examples of this dual situation, it's worthwhile telling the short and unhappy story of my two conversations with Jeff Gerth, the <I>New York Times</I> reporter whose early Whitewater stories set the tone for the entire news media, despite being misleading and one-sided. Jeff explained that "editors upstairs" had re-written his 3-24-92 lead so that it insinuated that Bill Clinton went into business with an S & L owner while he was governor of Arkansas. In fact, Clinton was not yet governor and McDougal was not yet an S & L owner. But the damage was done: Clinton was tarred with an S & L boondoggle, right off in the first paragraph, beyond which many readers do not read. Jeff explained, "Well, if you keep on reading, you can figure it out..." He went on to explain that Arkansas banking regulator Beverly Bassett Shaffer's lengthy memo "was not pertinent" and what little Gerth mentioned of her memo was "trimmed by editors upstairs." Perhaps he really was a pawn for "editors upstairs." I wrote to the news editors with no response. In any case, Shaffer was not able to tell her side of the story until <I>four</I> years later in the Senate Whitewater Hearings. 
<P>
Jeff Gerth closed our conversations pleasantly by saying, "Keep on reading the <I>New York Times.</I>" 
<P>
I looked at the phone receiver.....<I>Surreal.....</I>
<P>
But I haven't given up--and you shouldn't either. Who knows? Maybe someday, Jeff Gerth will question the judgment of the "editors upstairs."
<P>
Besides all this monkey-business about Whitewater files, there may be <I>another</I> explanation for the one-sided Whitewater onslought on Bill Clinton (see my column, <A HREF="scarw.htm"> The Scarlet "W."</A>)

<P>
The recent Telecom media deregulation law, written in part by media lobbyists, has the elegance of having pulled off hundreds of corporate coups, while conveniently avoiding the public reporting of its true implications by the very media who benefit by the law. If this was Watergate, an outside investigator would have to be appointed,  but this is Mediagate in which the media investigate themselves. 
<P>
In the Communications Decency Act, while we were distracted by news controversy about pornography, oops! we lost our freedom of social and political speech on the Internet and public access cable. While we were focused on the V chip, oops!  the Hyde amendment snuck in what amounts to gag rule on abortion speech. Attorney General Janet Reno has vowed not to enforce the provision, but hey, were in for an uphill battle. 
<P>
Where is this story in the popular media? Who among average Americans mowing their lawns even knows that freedom to discuss abortion is a controversy? I had to go into the Internet to find the truth  (see <A HREF="http://www.cpsr.org/dox/home.html"> Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility</A>).
<P>
While we were quibbling about consumer cable rates rising or falling, oops! we lost control of the quality of information coming to us through multiple media forms all owned by the same company, eventually most probably Disney/ABC Cap Cities. 
<P>
The healthy anarchy of independent voices is on its way out the window, while commercial entities are getting their foot in the door  to make money on the Net. Were being suckered, coming and going. 
<P>
This is a profound crisis. Its always been a crisis but now we can see it graphically, if we step through the media looking glass to see the other side of the surreality.
<P>

Im a fairly typical American who always thought capitalism was 
one of those unfortunate bargains with the devil that would work itself out so long as human beings exercised their best instincts at least as often as their worst. But at our current technological (neo-cortical and reptilian brain) speed, were losing this balance and slipping into an authoritarian quagmire. I question whether we have become conditioned to passivity by technology, by media, and in this way we are losing our freedom to a smiling "Jolly Tiger" of authoritarian power we can barely define.
<P>
Inquiries about the nature of corporate power have been so neglected that they have finally risen to national import only through the Presidential candidacy of the certifiable demagogue Pat Buchanan.  Yet Buchanan appeals to old neglected angry emotion and is discounted, as he should be, as a bigoted extremist-isolationist. His credibility is virtually nil. 
<P>
Its interesting that Buchanan is essentially a media-made and media-glorified phenomenon. Its as if the truth of the problem of Big Corp was embedded in a false personality whom the media magnifies, and we are led to disbelieve the innately correct message at the core. In whose interest is that disbelief? 
<P>
Broadcast news has become especially "big biz" since the Reagan administration stripped away FCC regulations which had previously limited commercials during newscasts. When Roone Arledge, who created the money-making graphic-pizzazz machine of ABC Sports, took over ABC News in the smoothest lateral transition in business history, "news as sport" was off to the races.
<P>
Today's corporate media values have overtaken journalistic and even social values with observably disastrous results. For example, crime news is sensational, fast and cheap to produce, but it distorts our view of society. Innuendoes and questions raised are sensational, fast and cheap to record but without proof, they distort our view of politicians and other public figures. 
<P>
The news media are having politics for lunch.
<P>
Jacob Weisberg, writing in <I>New York Magazine,</I> observed that "Reporters indulge in a self-satisfied mockery of politicians that passes for 'edge.' In fact they merely play into the popular notion--itself created by the press--that all politicians are scoundrels." [Update: see <I>LA Times</I> 3-part series April 17-19, 1996 <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/HOME/NEWS/FRONT/t000033888.html"> "A Negative Spin on the News"</A> for a frank effort by the journalism profession to face the cynicism of modern news media. Try the <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/HOME/"> LA Times Archive</A> if this link doesn't hold].
<P>
The media are not especially cordial with consumer advocates who, in essence, constitute a threat to their existence. If we found out that Ralph Nader was running for President on the Green Party ticket a full week after the fact as a rumor on the Internet, were not getting the real news. Of course not. Nader embodies the whole notion of independent anti-corporate thinking, so in his case, no news is the news. 
<P>
Finally, two days before the California primary--enough time for a couple of snapshots--Nader was on Meet the Press (therefore he exists, as Kant would say). But he was portrayed as an anomaly, as a quirky, "loopy" gadfly, or else over-rated as a threat to President Clinton. In the news medias handling of Naders candidacy, his somewhat contrarian but sensible--because sensible--core message is effectivly ignored.
<P>

<P>
The media are not interested in genuine politics which involve deliberation, common ground, give & take. Those stodgy practices dont sell. There's not enough conflict.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="tonya.gif"></CENTER>
<P>

President Clinton's record is unknown to many voters, even to some of his supporters, because most of his accomplishments have lacked political conflict. The Clinton health insurance reform plan was an exception. The plan had a lot of debatable turkey aspects, but it wasn't debated. It was propagandized by the insurance companies and by Clintons opponents, and sold by the news media as a War of the Worlds between socialism and capitalism. Most people thought it was single-payer. Where did they get that idea? For all the political blood spilled, too bad it wasnt single-payer.
<P>
Isnt that bizarre? Seven months of public deliberation on health 
care--an issue crucial to every American--conducted through the media over what? A <I>misunderstanding</I> of what it was all about. 
<P>
No wonder nothing came of it. We were grappling with shadows.
<P>                    		
<I>Harpers</I> editor Lewis Lapham has observed that <A HREF=" FILL">bad news sells good news</A>," the good news being the commercials--the happy fantasy of fulfillment associated with the acquisition of products--sandwiched between bloody shoot-outs in South Central Los Angeles. The bad news is necessary to make it all work. We're set up to want to escape--and guess where we go? To the friendly skies of United, to McDonald's where "you deserve a break today."
<P>
<I>Surreal.......</I>
<P>
Most of us know all this intuitively. We throw down our papers and magazines, kick the TV set, and let it go on. We treat the media as a disappointing annoyance, not realizing how intimately they are insinuating a way of thinking--<I>non-thinking</I>--into our lives. 
<P>

<P>
More and more, Im noticing missing stories that reflect medias blithe lack of conscience about bigotry. A gradually increasing tolerance of intolerance seems to be--correct me if Im wrong--becoming a hallmark of American corporate/media culture. 
<P>
For example, Steve Forbes "informal" top-level campaign advisor Tom Ellis once directed the Pioneer Fund which financed research trying to prove blacks are genetically inferior to whites. This story was reported by the <I>New York Times</I> and virtually nowhere else. Only Bob Herbert, who happens to be black, was outraged by it in his <I>Times</I> column.
<P>
The Forbes-Ellis revelation occurred exactly parallel with news about Buchanans pal Larry Pratt who was hanging out with anti-Semitic Christian Identity and white supremacist leaders, et al, yet Forbes was never once asked about Ellis is all those unflappable appearances on "Nightline" or anywhere else. Why not? 
<P>
Another example recently came via FAIRs "EXTRA!" to say that Disney/ABC had done nothing about Bob Grants promotion of racists groups on his WABC New York radio show,  although WABC fired (and effectively censored) Alan Dershowitz after Dershowitz criticized Grants support of racism and bigotry. [News flash on 4-18-96: Grant finally got sacked for a hateful comment about Ron Brown, but that didn't help Dershowitz].
<P>
Where were these stories in mainstream media when the worst offenses were being committed? Where there <I>was</I> outrage, where was the outrage coming from? From a Jew and a black man. To paraphrase Ronald Reagans most famous movie line: <I>Where's the rest of us?</I>
<P>
	<CENTER>*	*	*	*</CENTER>
<P>
The media love conflict but hate controversy. They resist or marginalize with jokes anyone who controverts ("turns against") the current or speaks up against the prevailing voice. Noam Chomsky comes instantly to mind. His politics are radically controversial and he is shunned by the media as though he were the Ebola virus. But his views on media are compelling. No wonder they cut him off in mid-sentence, he whose brilliant work in linguistics unlocked the deep structure of sentences. 
<P>
To be honest, I disagree with some of Chomsky's political opinions. I believe the center must hold somewhere. But he makes remarkable sense when he observes how modern mass media shape the way we think, which is to say--they corral and restrict independent thought, which is to say--they condition us to a preferred set of thoughts and values convenient to the owners of media, receptive to the products sold through the media, and consistent with various interests surrounding the media which work together in unconscious consort to avoid letting the boat get rocked. 
<P>
Rocked by whom?   <I>By people with minds of their own. </I>
<P>
News pundits like Ted Koppel and George Will use their verbal genius to make us think we're thinking when we're not.  They seem utterly reasonable and we want to believe there is intelligence in what they say. As a friend of mine John Strawn said recently, We want that intelligence that is forming those thoughts. We want to believe we understand what theyre talking about. We want to belong to that club. They do our thinking for us and they do it fast. Are we thinking for ourselves? 
<P>

<P>
The term liberal media is bandied about, but on the level of news management where decisions get made, the popular press is not liberal. It's pressured for time and desperate for material. It's commercial. It goes where the circulation and ratings are. Most (not all) mainstream media are devoted to maintenance of the buzz of the cultural trance. 
<P>
Some might argue this makes them conservative, conserving a lively status quo, making the world safe for consumerism. Although there are editorials and op-ed opinion columns, by and large most mainstream news reporting (much of it piped in from AP, Reuters, CNN) is politically soulless. 
<P>
What reporter today would stand up to Alfonse D'Amato the way Edward R. Murrow stood up to Joe McCarthy? The question is not whether Murrow as a member of the media was being political. 
<P>
<I>Murrow was being moral. </I>
<P>
My own moral position is that I wouldn't want to see any President or other public figure trashed for the sake of ratings and newsstand sales, or any society abandoned by leaving the edited-out truth on the newsroom floor.
<P>
Extreme--therefore "defined"--political opinions are dramatized in the media, creating the illusion of choice. They are not choices. They are cartoonized caricatures of thought. They are entertainments to keep us tuned in, which is to say, tuned out and distracted from the real questions, <I>the real news. </I>
<P>
What the "real news" is, we don't entirely know. These remarks are made to prompt the independent and open mind to ask. Never stop asking and never stop looking.

"Inter-active" sounds like a two-way street, doesn't it? We hear that phrase all the time. Inter-active this, inter-active that. It's a phrase designed to make us feel active in relation to our technology, and that's fine. 
<P>
But actually, more often than not we experience "inter-active TV" <I>passively</I>. This passive mood happens all across media--in the news, in sports, in educational programs. Shopping channels are supposedly "inter-active" because we push a button on our remote to select merchandise. We can "participate" in the program. But are we being active? Or are we simply on a one-way street, being parted from our money with more than the usual willingness?
<P>
Now there's nothing in the world wrong with spending money and lord knows we love to veg out. But we must take care not to kid ourselves about inter-active media.
<P>
Let's shift around the words "inter-active media" and add one of those "-ism" things, give the expression a bit of dynamic flair, add some <I>action</I>.  
<P>
<STRONG>MEDIA ACTIVISM:</STRONG> Aha! Now there's a robust phrase! Instead of describing media, we're decribing <I>our activism.</I> Now the street is going both ways and we're on it, <I>engaging</I> the media, <I>meeting</I> the media, <I>talking back</I> to the media, <I>writing</I> to the media (remember they're plural), <I>walking into</I> the offices of the media, <I>questioning</I> the media, <I>creating</I> our own media, <I>turning the media off</I> once in a while. 
<P>
Media activism is <I>active</I>. It's involved with yet independent of the media. It's all sorts of things you will discover as soon as you rise up out of the languid passivity of commercial media--and take a few vigorous steps...
<PRE>   </PRE>

<H4><IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Keep a Media Watch Diary to make the media experience more conscious. Make notes on what your observe in broadcast and print media. Have your kids do the same. Make it fun.
<P>
For just one of many examples, make note of the "teasers" employed by newscasters that lead up to the commercials, "when we come back..." Study those suggestive little questions they ask. Do they really have answers, or are their questions designed to be unanswerable so we have to come back to see what happens? We have to "come back" so that we see (or let's say "be exposed to") the commercials in the meantime. The newscaster doesn't need a break. The advertiser needs the break to show his wares. So the questions, the teasers, the build-ups are for the commercials. 
<P>
Then ask, well, what about the actual <I>effects</I> of those questions and teasers and build-ups? Do they make us doubt? Do they make us cynical? Do they disillusion us? Certainly there are appearances that deserve doubting and illusions that deserve disillusioning, but as a repeated technique, over and over, what effects do you notice? Etc, etc. Just break it all down and look at what you're seeing in this and dozens of other media techniques. 
<P>
Makes notes in your Media Watch Diary to share with others when you discuss media issues at least once a week or in whatever ongoing fashion you design.
<P>
<H4><IMG SRC="green_dk.gif">  Get your kids to be active as reporters for a family & relatives & neighbors newsletter you can put together on your computer. You can be a reporter too. The point here is to create your own media and be active rather than passive in relation to "news."  Research the "news" yourself and re-report it in your own words. Have your kids interview their grandparents and other relatives or neighbors, get oral histories, draw pictures, take photos for the family/neighborhood newsletter. Use e-mail to get reports from distant relatives and friends. 
<P>
<H4><IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Try to stretch beyond the family unit to neighbors and people in town. Meet new people, different people. Consider learning another language. Broaden your horizons.  Involve yourselves in civic activities and report on their happenings. Photograph them. Evoke their spirit.
<P>
<H4><IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> If your local newspaper approaches you to submit material to the paper, tell them nicely, thanks, you'll be happy to do so, so long as you make the key decisions on how the story is told because you are closer to the events. Request a small remuneration for your services because it is a fair exchange of value to the commercial newspaper for which you should be paid.
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Report not only on "what's happening" but on what your family, friends and neighbors are <I>thinking</I> about things. What are their thoughts? What are their memories? What are their ideas? What are their inventions? What are their hopes? What are their beliefs?
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Each child can write his or her own regular "column" which can include any sorts of thoughts and reflections as well as reviews/critiques on TV programs, movies, sports events, babies born, trips taken, bike-paths cleared and other happenings locally & anywhere else.
<P>
I had a little mimeographed newsletter when I was 14 and Ive been writing ever since. Which means I've been <I>actively thinking</I> ever since, for better or for worse. From mimeograph to the World Wide Web--wow--that's a stretch. And yet it's all the same. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Your family, friends and neighbors can collaborate on a Web page--<I>and</I> a newsletter. Good idea to keep one foot on the earth in print on paper, even if it costs a few trees. Only one person at a time can sit in front of a computer, it's a bit isolating, whereas scouting around, reporting, talking, listening, gathering news, and finally working as a bunch at a table putting together a newsletter or a video document is a robust social activity.
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Form a Media Salon (discussion group) of your friends and neighbors to discuss media and current affairs on a regular basis. Oddly enough, media as a central topic of discussion is rare, so most people welcome the opportunity. I moderate a Media Salon that meets monthly.  Bring your Media Watch Diaries. Bring articles or tapes of radio and TV programs to analyze as a group. Bring delicious food to share. Politics are bound to come up. Let them. If there are severe cross-currents of political disagreement, use the Native American talking stick method and make "I statements" only and avoid saying "you." If we lose freedom of speech on the Internet, we may have only such forms as salons to communicate freely. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif">  Take time on a regular basis (like weekly) to discuss media and current affairs in a reflective way within your own family. Select one of your least favorite TV programs and when that program airs, sit down for a serious inquiry into the real news. Think of it as counter-programming. Scheduling helps, whereas when we feel like it falls apart. Be your own newscast, your own analysts of current affairs.
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif"> Engage the media. Speak up. Be vocal. Don't hesitate. Don't wait for others to do it. Call talk shows. Call or fax C-SPAN. Your Media Watch Diary will remind you of specifics. 

Jump in and meet the media head on, even non-commercial media that tout themselves as "objective" or "fair-minded." For example, ask Brian Lamb why he uses the same polarized format of left/right opinionaters employed by commercial news media when they portray politicians. In fact, he employs journalists from commercial media to present political positions (the hyper-conservative <I>Washington Times</I> is over-represented, ever notice?). What's going on, Brian? Ask Ken Bode what's going on. Ask Jim Lehrer. Ask Ted Koppel. Look at the journalists and newscasters you consider the best and challenge them to be <I>better</I>. Be reasonable, not angry. Be persistent. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="green_dk.gif">  Write letters/faxes/postcards  (preferably) or make calls to:
<P>
 * Newspaper and magazine reporters, editors & publishers 
<BR> * TV and radio hosts
<BR> * Broadcast station managers
<BR> * Advertising sponsors
<BR> * Copy your letters to the <A HREF="bordform.htm"> Media Discussion Center</A> to encourage others.
<BR> * A couple of sample letters are given below
<P>Develop a full list of addresses, phones and FAX numbers. Faxing from your computer is fabulous.

To the Editor, Time Magazine
<P>
Your March 25 Contents described "a Senate majority leader and a President who must find some way of working together while trying to knife each other in the back."
<P>
Get me re-write: "...while speaking up for their differing views on the
campaign trail," or just drop the whole phrase. 
<P>
Time seems bent on portraying a bitter--indeed violent--polarization. But let's face it. For these two men to find a way to work together is important for this country, no matter what the circumstances. We are waiting for them to do so. I call upon Time to encourage rather than discourage them.

 <H2><I>A Political Reawakening:<BR>Internet Renews Passion for Politics
 </I></H2>
 <P>
 
 By Jim Buie
 <P>
 The messages flashed across my computer screen:
<P>
 "Clinton's a murderer!"<BR>
 "Hillary's a lesbian!"<BR>
 "Die, Clinton, die!"<BR>
 "Blacks are taking over America."<BR>
 "The Holocaust never happened."<BR>
 "The Jews control the media."<BR>
 "You will take away my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead
 hands."<BR>
 "The U.S. government is the enemy."<BR>
 <P>
 In the bowels of the Internet, I found my political reawakening. I
 had not been a serious political activist for nearly 20 years, since
 college. But surfing Internet message boards and newsgroups, I saw
 messages that angered, frightened and energized me. I had always
 been a strong advocate of the First Amendment to the Constitution
 and Freedom of the Press, but now every right-wing and left-wing
 nut, from neo-Nazis and militia groups to unabombers and
 neo-communists, could publish their bile for almost no cost and
 reach a world- wide audience with messages of hate and paranoia.
 <P>
 Reading so many hateful words over the Internet, I frankly was not
 as shocked as most Americans were when anti-government zealots blew
 up a government office building in Oklahoma City in the spring of
 1995.
 <P>
 "What is to be done?" I asked myself. How can free speech be
 preserved in the new medium of the Internet without leaving our
 society vulnerable to domination by extremists?
 <P>
 Trained as a journalist, I had sought in many of my published
 writings to be "objective"--to split the difference between what in
 the American political dichotomy was perceived as liberal and what
 was perceived as conservative--to achieve a kind of "balance" that
 criticized and complimented both sides with equanimity.
 <P>
 I never kidded myself that this kind of journalism, which grew out
 of economic necessity and a desire to achieve credibility with the
 broadest possible audience, was the "unvarnished truth." The
 practical reality was that a free press belonged to those who owned
 one. And the owner, or publisher, ultimately determined the truth he
 could afford to tell, or more importantly, sell.
 <P>
 With this new medium of the Internet, a free press is no longer
 reserved for those rich enough to own one. A vast number of average
 people, no longer sitting passively in front of their television
 sets, no longer spoon-fed mass American culture, can now interact
 with people around the world, and even become publishers themselves
 without the high cost of purchasing or leasing a printing press or
 chopping down a forest.
 <P>
 This great burst of publishing, and the rapid pace of change in
 computer technology is sometimes called "the big bang" into the
 Information Age. It has left many people feeling dizzy, disoriented,
 resentful, frightened. In many ways, people today can probably
 sympathize with the people of the Middle Ages, who experienced the
 first Information Revolution. Johann Gutenberg introduced moveable
 type to Europe in 1440, and printed his famous Gutenberg Bible in
 the 1450s. Printing lowered the cost of education, made newspapers
 and literature accessible and affordable to the common man. It also
 placed demands on people to conquer their own illiteracy. With their
 curiosity sparked, they learned to read. An explosion in
 intellectual curiosity occurred that shattered unthinking customs
 and ushered in an age of creativity and individuality we now call
 the Renaissance.
 <P>
 Many believe the Internet will do something similar. It almost seems
 we are back where we started in the 1600s. "...All the winds of
 doctrine were let loose to play upon the earth," John Milton wrote
 in his famous Areopagitica. With no mainstream media to set
 boundaries or filter out the "good" ideas from the "bad" ideas, the
 people will have to rely on their own critical thinking skills to
 avoid tyranny.
 <P>
 To preserve free speech in this new medium, in this new age, I
 believe we have to trust as Milton trusted. If "truth be in the
 field, we do injuriously by licensing and prohibiting to misdoubt
 her strength," he wrote. "Let truth and falsehood grapple; who ever
 knew truth put to the worse, in an free and open encounter."
 <P>
 This new Information Age may require us to ask again the question,
 "What is Truth?" To me it has less to do with modern journalistic
 convention and belief in "objectivity" and more to do with quiet
 reason, dialogue, and the honest articulation of personal
 experience. There is plenty of that on the Internet, too.
 <P>
 And so, when I was confronted with those virulent hate-filled words
 on the computer screen, I decided the thing to do in the chaos of
 the Internet is to start organizing the good guys. In 1993-94-95,
 the Internet seemed to be a pretty lonely place for moderate and
 progressive politically-minded people. I have since discovered an
 entire "virtual community" of like-minded people, many of whom are
 working hard to create a better world and more than a handful of
 whom I have since had the delight to meet face to face.
 <P>
 No, we can't stop the haters and the character assassins. But we can
 overwhelm them with our vastly larger numbers, and shine light in
 some dark corners. Let them vent their spleen. We don't need to feel
 helpless about it. With this new technology, we can network together
 to build communities of shared interests, shared goals, and stronger
 relationships. We can use Internet technology to easily participate
 in politics, interact directly with the ideas of leaders, and to
 create the future.
 <P>
 In their new book, <I>Taking Control: Politics in the Information Age,</I>
 Morley Winograd and Dudley Buffa estimate that more than 30 million
 Internet users around the world engage in over 20 million
 conversations a day in at least 14,000 on-line conferences. There
 can be little doubt that this new form of participatory democracy
 will significantly influence and alter the world's political
 culture.
 <P>
 During the Irish civil war, the poet William Butler Yeats wrote that
 his country had entered a time "when the best lacked conviction,
 while the worst were filled with passionate intensity."
 <P>
 If we do not do embrace this powerful new technology, we may be
 leaving it to those who <I>will</I> embrace it.

<font size=5>J</font size=5>im,
<P>
Superb piece, and yes, there are parallels for me, except that I <I>went to</I> the Internet
with my  (now zillionth) political re-awakening because, as a writer and former magazine publisher, the Internet offered, as you say, an inexpensive forum for expressing myself as a person. That sounds pompous and I mean it humbly. It's a big responsibility to do that, yet that is what I do in my selections as an editor for "The Real News Page" or other activities on the Net. And it took a conscious decision. In the anonymity of cyberspace, I use my real name, for example, although being Prettyman@aol.com draws some fire on the boards because some people think I'm a gay man. 
<P>
The Internet, by its nature full of joys and annoyances and shocks to the system, is healthy for its reinvigoration of political energy. It re-awakens me every day and I find my political self changing and growing like a long-legged adolescent, touching--in a post here, an insight there--an adult moment.
<P>
Before the Internet, I founded and moderated a lively Media Watch board on AOL. That experience caused me to look at all sides of everyone's argument and to meet conservatives halfway. It practiced me in the difficult art of finding that halfway place where we could <I>associate,</I> turn from confrontation to shoulder-to-shoulder yoking of a problem vital to us both. Even the most strident often had a morsel of insight and I went after it the way one eats crab, down to the meat in the claws. It helped to be focusing not on politics but on media, but still the politics sizzled. 
<P>
 Some came into the Media Watch board roaring like lions, spiteful, hateful, full of anger. First I had to overcome my own anger at them and then I would try to find a way to make them stay, slow them down, acknowledge their desires, let them know my own and let them see how similar we were. More often than not, they wanted that acknowledgement and once they had it, they stayed and turned and became quite reasonable and helpful compatriots on a common quest. 
<P>
Moderating a board was literally a moderating experience for me politically. 
<P>
I see the glass half-full rather than half-empty. I see Reasonable Republicans this way and, without intending to be condescending, I believe they deserve better than the leaders they currently have. I think Reasonable Republicans and Reasonable Democrats should have picnics together, get to know each other and help this country come back to its sense of commonality from the senseless extremes we've gone to.
<P>
There is something in the media, however, that does not love commonality, that makes endless jokes of Clinton's notion of "common ground," as did <I>Time</I> and <I>Newsweek.</I> Yet we will not survive if we do not find it. When we find it, we will prevail, not as liberals and conservatives, but as human beings. <P>
 Ego is a problem. The need to be right keeps us resistent to association, even on small points where we might begin to unwind the separations. We've got a lot of work to do.
<P>
OK City was a real shocker for me, a monumental re-awakening, and you can examine my response to OK City in my essay <A HREF="parano1.htm"> "The Paranoid Frontier"</A> (the lead item under "Missing Stories" on TRNP) which was written as a citizen's diary over a several-month period. It also appeared as a major op-ed piece in the <I>Santa Barbara News Press,</I> the first time this sweet little town ever saw the word "ZOG" in print and learned what it meant.
<P>
I think it's important that the extreme ideas are coming into evidence on the Internet so we can see them, and in knowing them know what commonalities we actually have. This I believe explains the new prevailing mood in America post-GOP "revolution." We saw the edge and said Let's find where the center holds. 
<P>
I would never advocate supressing or censoring extremist or hateful ideas. Their violence is profoundly unfortunate but the violence comes from their being unknown, unresponded to, seething while  pandered to by demogogues like Mr. Gingrich who says "Your fear of government is appropriate." They are ignored in our education, suppressed in our media. Commercial media is incapable of containing extreme ideas because they rock the beamy boat of the marketplace which relies on broad demographics. 
<P>
Murder on the streets is horrific but not extreme. It is commonplace and featured routinely in the news media. <I>Harper's</I> editor Lewis Lapham argues that <A HREF="badnews.htm">"bad news sells good news"</A> by setting up the reader/viewer for the escapist fantasy of the ads and commercials. 
<P>
But an organized hate group, however small and "leaderless," planning and executing the destruction of a large Federal building with the idea in their heads that the government is controlled by Jews and other aliens and "seeds of Satan," etc,--this stuff doesn't travel well in mainstream media, and so we remain--even after OK City--profoundly uneducated about the extremist mindset. This is dangerous and this is why I feature the subject on TRNP. (By the way, take a look at Morris Dees' new book, <I>Gathering Storm: America's Militia Threat</I> which makes up for a good deal of lost knowledge and does so with compelling narrative writing).
<P>That which is <I>different</I> (like different skin color) and that which is <I>extreme</I> share one feature: we have a history of casting them from our midsts.
In both cases we do so to our detriment. We lose our chance to learn and grow. We do not stretch. We become smug and rigid. Our minds harden and we age before our time.
<P>
Whether it is extreme "right"--really off the scale of "right"-- in the Order or other Christian Identity  groups, or off the scale of "left" (pathological) in the Unabomber--<I>we must get to know them</I> because somewhere between them and us lies the truth. I hate to use that word. I don't know what it means. But that is part of the mystery that lies between us. Maybe it's just US that lies between us, artificially separated and distracted from the real questions.
<P>
Never mind who are "they"? Ask "Who am I?" Never mind "How are they different?" Ask "How can I <I>be</I> different?" and "How can I make a difference?" 
<P>
As for being a journalist and "splitting the difference," ah yes, quite the impossible situation. Which is why I so relish the freedom of the Internet to publish my own page in which I've made the decision (it took me a while to decide) to come into the fullness of my political being in shaping and editing the page. Instead of hiding my views, my beliefs--my passion--in a crimped corner of my intellect, I have decided to climb fully into it and to wear my political robes not proudly so much as reverently and with a great sense of responsibility for standing for my political views and beliefs. It makes for a clearer editorial outlook for me. I make no pretense of speaking and choosing "for others" or try to second-guess what others want to hear. I speak and choose for myself and share that with others, for better or worse. 
<P>
(See <A HREF="http://www.us.net/indc/partisan.htm "> "The Return of Partisan Journalism" </A> by Michael Barone)
<P>
As an educator (originally, before the magazine biz--and always an educator really), there is a certain passionate hope in my outlook, an optimism, a belief that people can change if only we can connect with each other. That's not only communication but being in an honest mode, such as displaying my inner political light and being consistent with it. Having decided to be honest politically, I have to <I>stay</I> honest, so I've carved out quite a job for myself.
<P>
Here's a funny little observation, perhaps quite obvious, but you'll notice that some of the most interesting and insightful periodicals are outright boldly political--but carry few ads--whereas <I>Time</I> and <I>Newsweek</I> and most mainstream commercial newspapers and broadcasting outlets put on a front of being "objective" and "non-political" yet they are full of ads and commercials. The broad reach of commercialism has a dampening effect. Politics and especialy politicians (personalities) are a joke in popular commercial media, as Fallows has noted and so have I for years. Politics is not serious in popular media, for that would be to "take sides" and in taking a side, one loses a piece of the market. So the dampening blanket of commercialism dies down the passion which is replaced by cuteness and "attitude." It dampens the deeper thinking that could go on but doesn't much in mainstream media, which is too bad.
<P>
You said, "With no mainstream media to set
 boundaries or filter out the 'good' ideas from the 'bad' ideas, the
 people will have to rely on their own critical thinking skills to
 avoid tyranny."  It might be an exciting prospect for "the people" to rely on their own critical thinking if they indeed possessed such a faculty in a well-developed form in pervasive numbers. Until then, it's a problematic prospect, and education, awareness and enlightment of personal opinion must be advanced at all cost. This doesn't imply "the people" are incapable of thinking for themselves. But uneducated thinking is no help to anybody. And you can tell there's a lot of uneducated thinking abroad in the land if the nation by a slim majority fell for a propoganda plan cooked up by people like Dick Armey, Tom DeLay and Newt Gingrich. 
<P>
Talking egalitarian, can we learn from each other? Yes, but not if we're shouting. The "I message" is the most powerful way to communicate. When I say "you," I instantly anger my addressee. <I>Associative thinking</I> helps, finding a piece however small that I can link to in another's thoughts--and building on that association. 
 <P>
The Internet provides a means for this kind of education to make some headway because people such as yourself can speak up and others can hear you and consider you and learn. This is very  good and I commend you for it. As I said before, I think the component of political honesty helps rather than hurts and I commend that in you as well. 
<P>
This process is not direct. It's indirect. Being sincerely but not stridently political helps us to think with more of our resources and be more available, consistent, responsible to ourselves, to our political ideals. It helps us to be examples. The best education is the example, the model, the person wholly formed and wholly living, feeling, thinking and acting. We are not perfect but we are open, striving to be whole and perhaps giving a few others some confidence to do the same. 
<P>
In this respect, the question may not be "What is truth?" but "Who is truth?"
<P>

Regards, Jane

He's taken a beating, this guy. It's amazing how much he's been trashed. And he keeps going on. He seldom looks woebegon. He rises to every moment of national crisis. He's been prolific in his legislative leadership. His handling of foreign affairs has given peace rather than warfare a priority. He speaks well and he makes sense if you listen to what he's saying. He's like a professor, like a preacher, and like Elvis, too. Interesting guy. 
<P>
Bill has his faults but they're interesting faults that he seems to deal with pretty well. For me he's exactly the right guy for America right now. A great President.

<P>
<font size=5>I</font size=5> like Bill Clinton because he leads as President by asking us to take on the power on the inside of ourselves, as he did in Memphis when he encouraged black ministers to work from within while government does what little it can to help from the outside. AmeriCorps shows this Clintonian style, too. It strengthens self-reliance but goes beyond self-interest by putting young people in contact with community. This takes looking beyond ourselves, inside ourselves. Not only do we have little money to spend on the outer, its stronger when the inner comes along and helps.
<P>
President Clinton has been speaking to the best of ourselves all along. At Michigan State, after the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995, he said we should not censor but instead use our right of free speech to speak up against hate speech. With individualism on the rise, if government is no longer the nations conscience on matters of race, poverty and corporate hegemony, we must be sure that individuals have conscience.  Clinton is, for me, a model of this kind of awareness of the heart.
<P>
In his speech on Common Ground, President Clinton led us through a virtual therapy session by suggesting we overcome ego and find the places where we can associate peacefully, even as we speak to and about each other at a distance on talk radio, across the Senate chamber, across the dinner table, across a town hall.
<P>
When he speaks, this is a thoughtful man in the act of educating his listeners.
<P>
Hey, you can make a joke of his seriousness. I think hes great to be serious, to be reflective, to think deeply. Clinton has a conscience, a tested conscience to be sure, but a capacity to self-reflect nonetheless.
<P>
This is important to me. 
<P>
We may not always get what we want, but weve done remarkably well with this President. Many moderate-liberal-progressives dont even know all that Clinton has accomplished. Some of the best of his successes lacked political conflict, so the popular news media didnt cover them. That means they were widely accepted and agreed upon, but a lot of us never knew it because the media give us instead the news coverage of High Noon. 
<P>
This is kind of profound, in a negative sort of way. Its also one reason I launched <BR><A HREF="http://www.rain.org/~openmind/realnews.htm"> The Real News Page</A>--to examine the effects of commercial media on politics  and to recount, among other things, a few "missing stories" that provide the straight news on Bill Clinton. These include full reports on the absurd Whitewater scandal-mongering.
<P>
You may frown and say hes political and I say Hallelujah! 
<P>
It seems to me we do not choose our battles well if we go biserk over Clinton's stance on DOMA, for example. Speaking as a gay woman who is aware of Clinton's positive work for gays and who wants to see it continue, I think he's smart not to let himself get suckered by the right into a battle over homosexual rights going straight into an election. 
<P>
I can sort out the wheat from the chaff when it comes to political maneuvering. I understand Clintons welfare signing as a political as well as content move. So be it. He had to sign--and sign <I>now</I>--to show he was serious. Hell work to improve welfare and other important programs in his second term with a stronger Demo Congress. Most important, I think, he completely changed the way we think about welfare. Now, as he said, we can no longer blame the federal government. He brought it right smack home. Now we must ask "What do we do?" 
<P>
Clinton's political moves have a method to their madness. It's a little naive to take them literally.  Taken concretely, they do not mirror Clintons essential character. Taken at surface value, we miss a deeper strategy that may reflect the content of his character. Bill Clinton is, for the most part, doing what I would do if I were President and had his guts.  
<P>
Its an inner light that I like in Bill Clinton.  Im glad he knows 
how to do the political moves to bring this light into power.

<P>
<font size=5>A</font size=5>s a Republican for the past 28 years of being able to vote, I have been embarrassed at the untruthful pot shots at President and Mrs. Clinton.    A "family value" to me is not divorcing your wife, but working as a couple to make a marriage work, and value their love for their child.  I have met Chelsea and she is a sweetheart--very gracious, polite, and down to earth.  Someone taught her that--her mother and father.  
<P>
As someone who is self-employed, and married to a self-employed husband, we have for the last 32 years allowed our employees to take off for the birth of a child, a family emergency, a school play, a funeral, or whatever.  The result has been that we have experienced employees who are very, very loyal. They work harder.  They are appreciative and do <I>not</I> take advantage of our companies.  Financially, we have been fortunate to increase our employees
salaries AND our own for all these years, as our employees do not take advantage, but are grateful that we care enough to allow--and in some cases have had to force them to not to feel guilty for caring for their families.
<P>
As a 49 year old woman, I witnessed the death of a sorority sister from complications of an illegal abortion.  I swore on her grave that I would not allow her to have died in vain.  Regardless of anyone's opinions, abortion <I> is</I> a personal decision. No one should force women to return to illegal abortions performed by people who are not always physicians with experience in this medical procedure.
<P>
Three of my businesses are small, and I have always paid more than the minimum wage and have always prospered.  Those against the minimum raise apparently have never been in business for themselves, or if they were, didn't run them correctly, were in the wrong business, the wrong location, or ran them poorly.   
<P>
And, the most important reason I like Bill is that he is not willing to change the constitution or pander to the Christian Coalition.   I am a Baptist, and I want to remain a Baptist--and not change my religion because the government chooses one for me.  I also don't want my friends who are of different religions to be humiliated by being forced to pray Christian prayers.  It is only by my birth that I am a Christian. I could have been born a Jew, a Muslim, or any of the over a hundred other religions in America, and be persecuted by laws that do not allow my children to learn their religion in church--but in school.
<P>
This Repubican and her Republican husband, son, mother, and father, will all cast our votes for President Bill Clinton.

Try to imagine what a leader, committed to safeguarding democracy
 in times of rising class and race conflict within the country, and of 
shifting, potentially explosive power conflicts abroad, would do to guide 
the nation, and you come pretty close to a profile of <BR>Bill Clinton.
<P>
I like Bill because he is intelligent, clearly devoted to serving his country, and fortunately is possessed with a personality marvelously adapted to getting his message across and surviving the hate attacks. 
<P>
I think with his help, we will retain our constitutional democracy into the 21st century--with no thanks to the psuedo-religious right wing!

<P>
<font size=5>W</font size=5>ithin ten years Bill Clinton will be recognized as the second greatest president in the 20th century, behind Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and he will be second only by virtue of timing, as, had he to meet the challenges Roosevelt did, he would have met them as well as did he.
<P>
Put him beside Roosevelt, Truman, and Kennedy and observe his stature.
<P>
I like him because he has the guts and firmness and tenacity and
down-to-earthness of Truman, the idealism, humanity and magnificent
gallantry of Kennedy, the vision, concern, caring, resourcefullness, and
sheer intelligence of Roosevelt, and the never-flagging spirit and love of
country of all three of these great presidents.  And to this mix he adds
true humility, a sensitivity he is not afraid of, a wisdom that goes beyond his years, and an ability to maintain a central calm in the face of vicious and unfair attacks.  
<P>
This is a great man, make no mistake about it.  Who
else in this century has faced such powerful enemies as the NRA, the tobacco industry, the Christian Coalition, and did not blink?
<P>
His foreign policy has been magnificent, yet he gets absolutely no credit
from the Republicans or the press.  The Republicans whined that we would
only look bad in Bosnia--but look what happened.  Saddam thought that he
could carry off another round of bullying because it was election time here--and look what happened.  Republicans warned and warned that we could do nothing to restore democracy in Haiti, and look what happened.   
<P>
Clinton has used power properly and sparingly; no attacks on defenseless little places just to show that we remember how to shoot and kill and make a few points for the administration as happened under Reagan and Bush.
<P>
Never have I seen such attempts to trash a president.  Was even Roosevelt the subject of such abuse?  Can nothing be done to stop this run-away persecution of President Clinton by the Whitewater "independent" prosecutor?  This is insanity.  Frankly, I think it is treasonous.  
<P>
The press continues to print the tales of every crazy.  Perhaps we need to
establish a right of public figures to sue.  With so many people believing
that where there is smoke there is fire, it may make sense.
<P>
Four years ago I despaired that the middle class in this country could <I>ever</I> recover from the damage done by Reagan and Bush.  Now I have hope again, and because of Bill Clinton!  I thought that the anti-abortion fight had been won and pro-choice forces vanquished.  But now I think there is hope, because of Bill Clinton.  I thought that unions were too far gone to be revitalized, but now I have hope--because of Bill Clinton.  I thought that corporate greed and insurance companies had totally wrecked our health care system, but now I have hope--because of Bill Clinton!  
<P>
This is a great man.  People are beginning to realize it.  Maybe Lincoln
was right after all.  You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.  Things will turn in Clinton's favor, because what Lincoln said is really true.

was designed by & for adults, but why?  Everyone knows that we kids and
teens are the future & the Internet is part of our future, so why wait ten 
years for us to be grown up to let us have some say over what the Internet is 
like, by then it could be ruined, taken over by businesses, all ideas 
of fun & educational usage gone. So we need to be the designers, the 
creators, if we are going to take control then we 
should do it now!"</b> </center></p>

	     <h4>  Knowing that as an individual I am in isolation, and connected to a strong social fabric I am self-reliant and inter-dependent . . .<p>

	       I commit to work together with others who so commit to convene local citizen policy bodies in every city and county.  We will begin by re-affirming the 
Preamble and the Bill of Rights, and then co-creating a New Covenant of
Communication to serve as the ethical foundation for a durable structure of consensus 
building, policy making and action planning that allows us to . . <p>
	<ul>
<li>- form a more perfect union . . . by linking people of potential mutual benefit to one another, supporting the development of long-term productive relationships, and providing tools for quality of life improvement and economic sovereignty.<p>

<li>	- establish justice . . . by valuing trust and complete accountability as the standard for all transactions - both material and inter-personal; especially in daily human contact.<p>

<li>	- insure domestic tranquillity . . . by applying collective intent to the continuous upliftment of ourselves, the family system, our immediate environment, and the whole social fabric.<p>

<li>	- provide for the common defense . . . by protecting the rights guaranteed all citizens under the U.S. Constitution and consciously consuming goods and services that contribute to the whole.<p>

<li>	- promote the general welfare . . . by working with firm commitment to see that quality information, appropriately in context, can be requested and delivered to support the solution of any felt need in the whole system.<p>

<li>	- secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  . . . by striving to allow all those less fortunate the access to resources, both their own and other needed materials, that support them in building higher quality of life for themselves, their family, their community, their country and our planet.

                 <h2> An Invitation to Co-Create</h2>
			<img align=top src="http://www.rain.org/image/spmatrx.gif" alt="spectral matrix">
			<h4>This is an opportunity  to participate in the creation of a product of collective wisdom.   The vehicle is a draft framework for the Spectral Matrix: a 'Lifeware' tool that represents the magnificence and diversity of the human 
rit, and our capacity to rise to challenge in a self-organizing youniverse.<p>
	The tool has potential for both 'hard' and 'soft' applications.  In its 'hard aspect it is a generic information management system for mapping across/through the spectrum of human vision and action.   In its 'soft' aspect, it's a framework, or flexible mind-mapping tool for consciously  examining and evolving a self-organizing internal matrix of perceptions and attitudes (personal epistemology, or world view); especially useful for giving  the kids and adult a self-maturing and mastery option. </h4> <p>
	<h4>ASSERTION:  We have the opportunity to develop a shared perceptual matrix that continuously reinforces and embeds the principle of reality creation through primary reference frame.  All of us can become very conscious  about how we  create our  perceptual filters.  We need that skill to make  well informed  and reasoned choices about how we  construct our internal network of attitudes, and how we language it in the world.<p> <img src="http://www.rain.org/image/chr1.gif"></h4>
	 <h4>Are we ready to heal our separation as it exists in our language?  If each of us could construct our own world view and influence matrix, using a semantic rigor that we all share,  couldn't we then the invent a distributed language for learning collectively? <p></h4>
 <h3> Imagination is more important than knowledge - Einstein</h3><p>
	<h4>This invitation is being sent to you because of your commitment to  the creation of a personal and community life support artifact that is beyond the capacity of any one person or group.  Perhaps for the first time, we can create consensual semantic agreement about what we're seeing/saying.  That's why a pattern  language (an evolving, intentional network of whole concepts) is always open to input, is never finished.  After years of synthesizing an index for innovation into a 'suggestion draft' for such a collective tool, this is an invitation to you to move it towards being useful to your professional/personal needs and ideals. <p><img src="http://www.rain.org/image/chr2.gif"><h/4>
	<h4>The Spectral Matrix draft is 26 patterns of human expression in thirteen pairs that celebrate people as productive servers and innovators.  It attempts to simplify the vast number of words and symbols (a virtually infinite number of inter-connected patterns) into limited set of concepts arrayed in a comprehensive template.  Through the process of sharing our language and  perceptions we can build and grow them into an all-together different kind of collective 'brain'.   We can create functional Commons sense.<p><img align=bottom src="http://www.rain.org/image/commons.gif">
</h4>
	<hr><h3>The Universe is a process set into motion by purpose <p>
				Arthur Young </h3><p>
	<h4> The Inclusion of music, song lyrics, quotes, poetry, and images will likely be essential in conveying the perceptual basis for this tool; they are such marvelous examples of the collective wisdom, and also reinforce the intuitive & spatial aspects of information management and perception.  The draft leaves you a maximum opportunity for you to add your contributions.<p>

	The purpose of The Commons is to get the right information to the right person at the right time, regardless of cultural, economic, or educational status;   All its assets, and earnings belong to humanity and the planet    Thank you for your consideration.<p><img align=bottom src="http://www.rain.org/image/chr3.gif">

. . . I would like to write a song that is so vibrant and so intimate, that the earth would adopt it as if it had sprung like a stream from the land's memory, as if no one has written it but life itself.

And my song would travel along, from bird to wing, to tree, to breeze, to heart, to breast, to song, because the song belongs to everyone, like the spring. <p>

<h2>Why a Collaboration Notebook?</h2>
	<h4>In researching and tracking work in the group process technology field, its apparent that there is a large body of thoroughly tested large-scale collaborative methodologies.   The couple of dozen listed in the enclosed table of contents of the Draft Collaboration Notebook represent a taste of a growing industry where only a few of us even know of each other.  Our emerging process technology field has yet to develop a shared theoretical framework or philosophical foundation, and so far as we can determine, no rigorous model for comparative analysis yet exists.  Many approaches exist, each with its own strengths and limitations.  The opportunity to pull these pieces together is at hand.
<p>
	The Commons: An Institute of the Whole, together with the Interaction Institute for Social Change, Club Tech and Applied euristics Associates, has committed itself to realizing this opportunity by catalyzing collaboration among the most experienced and innovative practitioners in the process field.  Keeping in mind that each of us will have our own purpose for participating, and to stimulate your own thinking, I will share some of my purposes and those of other ommitted contributors as I understand them.<p>
I see the possibility of co-inventing a shared Language of Collaboration, as well as a research and development mechanism for new tool and product development.  In my vision this will provide a foundation for my dream of a new social structure that can perform the linkage and bumping up function that the corpus callosum does in the brain and the interstitial fluid does in the body.  My word for this image is the Commons, a virtual central gathering point; other ancient names for such  include the Agora, Socolo, Piazza, Rendezvous or simply a gathering.   Each such structure will have to be designed by those that will use it.  They will need some way to know which methods to use when, and why, hence the need for a tool kit.<p>
	As a tool user and provider,<b> David Straus</b> of the Interaction Institute sees the need for a way to compare and contrast the systems, and is interested in how we might see ourselves as a larger network of providers who can support and learn from each other.  Mike Gravino of Club Tech envisions a National Collaboration Cooperative that can manage shared community collaboration centers and give the field a collective purchasing and development vehicle.  Gene Bazan of Applied Heuristics embraces the latent intellectual challenge.<p>
<b>David Sibbet</b> of Graphic Facilitation fame would like to hear from each person why you are doing what youre doing, and where have you come from.  He also sees the value of sharing a gem and getting a whole book full.  Ed Claassen, Davids partner, sees a possible mechanism for reaching out into the bigger context.  Sam Kaner of Community at Work would like to see a collaborative version of Roberts Rules.  I have heard rumors of Robertas Rules, anyone seen them?<p><img  src="http://www.rain.org/image/chr4.gif">
	<b>Harrison Owen,</b> the shaman of Open Space knows that whoever shows up is who is supposed to, and that whatever happens is the only thing that couldve.  Stafford Beer sees the need to build Liberating Structures whose ambient environment is feedback rich, enabling redundancy of potential command.  Gifford Pinchot appreciates the opportunity to present Free Intraprise in a short and powerful manner.<p>
	In my conversations with each of you there seems to be a shared value in releasing group and community initiative, with, learning and sovereignty.  In that spirit, its time to move from intervention to building sustainable structures of decision-making that consistently apply the understanding that none of us is as smart as all of us.  I invite you to join us in co-defining this new discipline, one committed to practicing what it preaches.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  All power to those who care, and take caring action.<p>
At your service,<p></h4>

<b>The New Telecommunications Bill</b>\<br>
Promises, Perils and Predictions
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="bluerib2.gif"></center>
Concern for kids safety on the Internet has been hotly discussed over the 
past few months.  An attempt has been made to put into place a new law 
about "decency" on the Internet that very clearly takes away 
Constitutionally protected individual rights to freedom of speech.  
Because the Internet is such a new place most folks don't understand it 
enough to really  have an opinion.  The powers that be appear to be 
trying to introduce restrictions on the Internet that would be totally 
unacceptable if applied to a newspaper.
</p>
<p>
We strongly oppose this new legislation and encourage parents to study 
and understand the real issues.
</p>
<p>
March 19th will see a special Community Forum hosted by RAIN with 
speakers such as past SB Mayor Hal Conklin and UCSB Professor Dick Flacks 
going into what this new law really means.
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="greenbar.gif"></center>
</p>
<p>
<b>Whose Internet is this anyway?</b>
</p>
<p>
We are seeing the new Telecommunications Legislation open up the Internet 
to easy absorption by huge multi-national corporations that will attempt 
to make the Web very much like TV: PASSIVE 
</p>
<p>
Even if they let us send email we won't be able to publish our images & 
ideas like we can on the Net today.  They will let us talk and shop, but 
not run the risk of letting us have totally free speech & free image sharing.
</p>
<p>
Join the KNN team in sending your concerns and protest to the attention 
of your friends and teachers.

<p>
And keep that blue ribbon on your web!

<title>Walking With Fall</title>

<body><p>
<center><h2>Walking With Fall<br>
</h2><b>By Aquila Tyndall</b>
<p>
<b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b>
<p>
Leaves of red and gold
<p>
Dance around my head.
<p>
Magical winds cool the air,
<p>
And a hawk soars above me.
<p>
I am walking with fall.
<p>
My feet are walking,
<p>
Walking on dry leaves and dead grass.
<p>
Into the hills I am going,
<p>
And the deer watch me.
<p>
I am walking with fall.
<p>
I follow a dirt path,
<p>
Past ancient oak and strong sage.
<p>
Earth below, sky above,
<p>
And the crow caws at me.
<p>
I am walking with fall.
<p>
The path winds upwards,
<p>
I am walking towards the sky.
<p>
Up, up, up, I am almost there,
<p>
And the lizard scuttles by me.
<p>
I am walking with fall.
<p>
I am on top of the hill now,
<p>
I am high above the world now.
<p>
What a view,
<p>
And the blue-jay is here too.
<p>
I am walking with fall.

<title> In the Plants' Keep</title>
<body>
<p>
<h2> In the Plants' Keep</h2><br>
<b>A poem by Aquila Tyndall, 12/12/'96<b>
<p>
One day as I was walking along Fern Hill and heading West,<BR>
Beneath a bending oak I stopped to rest.<BR>
While I stood still,<BR>
Nothing happened at first, until,<BR>
The nearby vines began to grow,<BR>
And on the oak new leaves began to show,<BR>
At my feet fresh moss began to spread and creep,<BR>
And from the ground young ferns began to leap.<BR>
The vines were the kind that swiftly weaves,<BR>
Betwixt the branches and the leaves,<BR>
And so, quite soon, they had covered the entire tree,<BR>
And in a room of green, enclosed me.<BR>
I knew that now I was in the Plants' Keep.<BR>
Then I began to feel quite drowsy, and soon fell fast asleep.<BR>
That sleep was deeper than any I've had before, of that I'm sure,<br>
For when I woke, to my surprise, I found that I slept for one whole year.

<b>By Aquila Tyndall, 3/31/1996</b>
<p>
Your hands are in the earth,
<p>
Earth's strength is shared with you,
<p>
Your strength is shared with the earth.
<p>
Green plants are growing,
<p>
They are because of you,
<p>
You are becauses of them.
<p>
You and they are connected, interlinked.
<p>
It is a circle, a holy circle.
<p>
All elements,
<p>
Earth, Water, Sun, and Air,
<p>
Are working with you.
<p>
All work for one purpose:
<p>
Life.
<p>
You are partners in the dance of life.
<p>
Sacred life flows through you,
<p>
Through the earth,
<p>
Through everything.
<p>
Everything is dancing the dance of life.
<p>
Everything is dancing with you.

<center><h2>The Robber in the Attic</h2><br>
A scary story by Aquila Tyndall</center>
<p>
During the California Gold Rush some people got rich by finding gold, and
some people got rich stealing it.<br>
Joe Lodson was the latter, and one day he robbed a stage coach that was
carrying more gold than Joe had ever seen. Joe wasted no time gathering up
the gold his horse could carry.<br>
Now Joe Lodson was smart fellow, and he knew that the sheriff would be out
looking for him real soon. So he hid the attic of an old ranch house that
had been abandoned a cuple of years ago. Up in the attic, with the door
locked and no windows Joe felt pretty safe.<br>
At the end of the week Joe ran out of food, so he got ready to leave. But
when he tried to unlock and open the door, it wouldn't open. There was no
other way out, Joe was stuck.<br>
Joe Lodson shouted for help and shot his gun to make noise, but no one
heard him.<br>
Although Joe died a long, long time ago his ghost still walks back and
forth up in the attic of the house he died in. If you ever go to a certain 
old house near Santa Ynez listen carefully, you might just hear Joe's foot
steps, or the sound of a ghostly gun firing.

<p>
<h1><b><center>Best Book</h1></b></center>
</p>
<center><b><h1>Outcast of Redwall</center></b></h1>
</p>
<p>
<h2><b><center>A.D.T. - Grade 8</h2></b></center>
</p>
<p>
This is the eighth book in the beloved Redwall series by Brian Jacques, 
and it certainly meets the standard set by the first seven books in the 
series!  Outcast of Redwall is the exciting tale of Sunflash the Mace, a 
kind badger lord, and Swarrt Sixclaw, an evil warlord, sworn enemies 
since they were very young, and of Swarrt's son Veil, whom Swarrt 
abandoned when he was an infant.  Veil was raised by a kind mouse named 
Bryony at Redwall Abbey, a place where all the creatures of Mossflower 
forest live in peace and harmony.  But then Veil committs an unforgivable 
crime, and is banished from the Abbey.  When Bryony is captured by 
Swarrt, Veil has to decide whether he will let the only creature who ever 
cared for him die, or turn against his true father.
</p>

<P>A - <B>Composts.</B> Composting refers to the carefully managed process in
which organic materials are digested aerobically or anaerobically by microbial
action. In order to effectively stabilize the nutrients in compost, neutralize
pesticide residues and kill weed seeds and pathogens, aerobic compost piles must
reach a temperature of 131-149&#183; Fahrenheit (55-60&#183; Centigrade) for a
period of several days and then finish decomposing for about 6 weeks. Compost
should remain moist but not waterlogged for the whole decomposition period for
best results. Written documentation of source of off-farm materials is required.
No CCOF prohibited materials may be used in comporting, including no
synthetically &quot;fortified&quot; compost starters. Acceptable feedstocks
include animal manure, by-products of the processing of agricultural commodities
and source separated yard debris or &quot;clean green.&quot; Glossy paper and
colored ink are prohibited. Paraffin from waxed cardboard cannot exceed 0.75% of
total feedstock by weight. Sewage sludge is prohibited as a feedstock. See
Sewage Sludge.&quot; Mixed municipal solid waste and waste from Materials
Recovery Facilities (MRFs) are prohibited as feedstocks. Growers should obtain a
list of the main ingredients in any purchased composts. See also &quot;Microbiological

<P>R - <B>Copper Products. </B>These include copper compounds that are exempt
from tolerance by the EPA: Bordeaux mixes, copper hydroxide, copper sulfates,
copper-zinc chromate, copper oxychloride and copper oxides. These may be used as
algicides, bactericides, fungicides, molluscicides, for arthropod control, wood
treatment or as micronutrients. Cannot be used as an herbicide. Shall be used in
a manner that prevents excessive copper accumulation in the soil. Build-up of
copper in soil may prohibit future use. Use with caution. No visible residue is
allowed on harvested crops. Copper-chromium arsenate is prohibited--see &quot;Arsenate

</p>
<p>
<b>Space Cases is a new TV show on Nickelodeon, that tells the story of 
five students who sneaked aboard an alien space ship, and were sucked 
through a "white hole" whick took them the equivalent of seven years away 
from home in just a few minutes.  As they try to find the way home they 
encounter exciting adventures and strange aliens.  Although this is an 
adventure story, it is also rather funny at times.
<br>
You can see Space Cases on Nickelodeon every Saturday 6:00 PM (PST>
<br> 
We give Space Cases 5 Stars <img src="rd_sdi.gif"><img

<b><center>Space Shuttle Atlantis, Space Station Mir, and the 
International Space Station.</b></center>
</p>
<p>
<b>On Marcy 22 the space shuttle Atlantis was launched on it's 16th 
mission, this time to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir.  This is 
the third of nine planned Space Shuttle-Mir link-ups between March 1995 
and May 1998.  These missions will include docking and crew transfers.  
Shuttle-Mir participants seek to answer important questions about the 
future of human life in space.  The Shuttle-Mir project is helping to 
prepare astronauts and cosmonauts for living together on the 
International Space Station.
<br>
Atlantis is carrying "KidSat", a project that enables middle school 
students to configure their own payload of digital video and a camera to 
fly on shuttles.  The students will be able to command the camera from 
their classrooms, and download images of Earth through near real-time.  
The images will be used as a basis for all sorts of classroom studies, 
such as history, geography, oceanography, math, physics and current events.
<br>
Onboard the shuttle were Commander Kevin Chilton; Pilot Rick Searfoss; 
Payload Commander Ron Sega; Mission Specialists Rich Clifford; Mission 
Specialists Linda Godwin; and Mission Specialist Shannon Lucid, who is 
assigned to stay on the Space station Mir for five months.  Lucid is 
inaugurating the American presence on board Mir, that will last until 
1998.  The space shuttle that takes Shannon Lucid back to Earth will be 
carrying another astronaut to take her place.</a>

<title>Second Base, a ghost story</title>
<body>
<p>
<h2>Second Base</h2><br>
A ghost stroy by Aquila Tyndall
<p>
One day not too long ago a class of fifth graders went on a field trip to
Parson ball Park, an abandoned baseball field.<br>
The teacher, Mr. Smith, told the students about why the Parson Ball Park
had been abandoned. "About 50 years ago," he began, "there was a really
big ball game, in which two famous teams, the Tigers, and the Hawks, were
playing against each other. In the third Inning a player on the Hawks
team, name Tyrel, hit the ball and got to second base, he was stuck there
until some one hit the ball. The next two batters struck out. But, the
third batter was Jackson, the best batter on the team. Just as Jackson
stepped up to bat it started raining." Mr. Smith continued, " the game was
called off. And within the next week Tyrel died of pneumonia because of
how wet he had gotten.<br>
"After Tyrel died, all the games played on that field went wrong. Pretty
soon it got so bad that none of the teams would play there any more, they
thought the field was cursed, or haunted!"<br>
After he finished the story, Mr. Smith started gathering up the children
to go back to the bus. But, one of the kids, a boy named Alex, stayed
behind.<br>
Alex wanted find out if the field was really haunted. He went over to
second base and sat down. Nothing happened. But then Alex felt a cold
breeze on his back. When he looked behind himself he saw a man in a
baseball uniform. The man leaned over and whispered <i>"I'm stuck on
second base, Jackson was up to bat. Find Jackson, tell him to hit a home
run. Free Me! Please."</i> Then the man turned around and walked away, as
he walked he began to fade. Alex watched him go, the name Tyrel was
written on the back of uniform. After that Alex ran back to the bus as
fast his legs could go.<br>
When Alex got home he decided he had to do something to help the ghost of
Tyrel. The first thing he did was go to the library and look up the
baseball player named Jackson who had played with the Hawks.<br>
Alex found out that Jackson's first name was Sam. Next Alex searched the
phone book for a Sam Jackson. There were several, and Alex had to call
them all to find the one he was looking for.<br>
When Alex finally got a hold of Sam Jackson he explained the whole thing
to the retired baseball player. Jackson agreed to meet Alex in the Parson
Ball Park on Saturday, which was the next day.<br>
The next day at 10:00 O'clock sharp Alex met Sam Jackson at the Parson
Ball Park. They knew what they had to do, Jackson had to hit the ball so
that Tyrel could get to Home Base and finally be free.<br>
Sam Jackson was pretty old, and he could barely hold the bat straight.
Alex didn't think there was much chance of him hitting the ball.<br>
Alex threw the ball, Jackson missed it.<br>
Alex pitched again, Jackson missed again.<br>
Then, just when Alex had given up, Jackson hit the ball. The baseball
flew high into the air. And a strangely cold breeze rushed from second
base, to third base, and then to home base.<br>
The ghost of tyrel materialized on home base. <i>"Thank You!"</i> he
whispered, and then he began rising up, up, up, until Alex and Jackson
couldn't see him any more. Tyrel was finally free.
<p>
The End!

<title>How Maria Became a Ghost</title>

<p>
<center><h2>How Maria Became a Ghost</h2><br>
A scary story by Aquila Tyndall.</center>
<p>
One winter, several years ago, a girl named Maria and her parents went for
a camping in the Las Padres National Forest. They camped close to the
santa ynez river under an old oak tree.<br>
Maria's family had a great time, they hiked, picnicked, and told stories
around their camp fire. So they were all sad when the camping trip had to
end. <br>
Maria wanted to go for one last walk by herself. So she waded accross the
river and started walking into the forest. <bR>
The forest was very beautiful and Maria lost track of time. By the time
she turned around it was getting late and had started raining.<br>
At first the rain was just a drizzle, but pretty soon it was a torrent. 
Maria made very slow progress because of the rain, when she finally got
back to the river it was swollen and rushing.<br>
Maria knew it would be dangerous to try to cross the river, but she had to
get back to her parents. So she started accross the river, it was
difficult, but she did alright, until she reached the middle. Then,
<i>Swoosh!</i>Maria was sucked under the water.<br>
Her parents never found Maria's body, but one of her hair bows was found
floating in the river.<br>
Some people say that during rain storms Maria's ghost still wanders the
river bank trying to find her parents.<br>

organic practices feed the soil which in turn feed the plant. Organic farming is
a management intensive, not a material intensive, technology; materials are a

attempt to understand and work in harmony with the natural biological systems on
the farm, not override them with chemicals (even naturally derived ones). They
strive to develop cultural and biological means of crop nutrition and protection
that are balanced, sustainable, and resilient. </P>

<P> Soil ecologists,using new high-tech microscopic techniques, have begun to
discover the importance of soil foodwebs as a prime indicator of ecosystem
health.  Plants profoundly affect and are affected by soil organic matter and
nutrient cycling.  Food web nutrient cycling starts with root exudates and the
varying needs of carbon and nitrogen at each microbe tropic level.
Composts,compost teas and mulches have different effects on plants.Good soil for
each crop has measurable numbers and ratios of bacterial or fungal biomass or
activity,protozoa and beneficial nematodes,and nematode maturity indices.The
goal of soil ecologists is to develop bioassay techniques and an expanding
database to manage soil foodwebs that maximize plant health and biological
control.  Good biological control below ground supports good biological control
above ground. The Dietrick Institute for Applied Insect Ecology is  non-profit
and promotes research and education projects in Ventrue County Ca.This Soil
Ecology Seminar will provide the scientific basis and sampling techniques for
participants in these agroecology projects and for interested

<H1>The Soil Foodweb: It's Importance in Ecosystem Health</H1>
<H3>Soil Foodweb Significance</H3>
<P></P>
<P>The structure and function of the soil foodweb has been suggested as a prime
indicator of ecosystem health (Coleman, et al. 1992; Klopatek, et al. 1993).
Measurement of disrupted soil processes, decreased bacterial or fungal activity,
decreased fungal or bacterial biomass, changes in the ratio of fungal to
bacterial biomass relative to expected ratios for particular ecosystems,
decreases in the number or diversity of protozoa, and a change in nematode
numbers, nematode community structure or maturity index, can serve to indicate a
problem long before the natural vegetation is lost or human health problems
occur (Bongers, 1990; Klopatek et al. 1993).</P>
<P>Soil ecology has just begun to identify the importance of understanding soil
foodweb structure and how it can control plant vegetation, and how, in turn,
plant community structure affects soil organic matter quality, root exudates and
therefore, alters soil foodweb structure. Since this field is relatively new,
not all the relationships have been explored, nor is the fine-tuning within
ecosystems well understood.</P>
<P>Regardless, some relationships between ecosystem productivity, soil
organisms, soil foodweb structure and plant community structure and dynamics are
known, and can be extremely important determinants of ecosystem processes
(Ingham and Thies, 1995). Alteration of the soil foodweb structure can result in
sites which cannot be regenerated to conifers, even with 20 years of
regeneration efforts (Perry, 1988; Colinas et al, 1993). Work in intensely
disturbed forested ecosystems suggests that alteration of soil foodweb structure
can alter the direction of succession. By managing foodweb structure
appropriately, early stages of succession can be prolonged, or deleted (Allen
and Allen, 1993). Initial data indicates that replacement of grassland with
forest in normal successional sequences requires alteration of soil foodweb
structure from a bacterial-dominated foodweb in grasslands to a fungal-dominated
foodweb in forests (Ingham, E. et al, 1986 a, b; 1991; Ingham and Thies, 1995).</P>
<P>In addition to responses to disturbance, it is clear that species diversity,
community diversity and foodweb complexity increases with increasing
successional stage (Moore et al., 1991; Ingham, E. et al., 1989). Indeed,
examination of foodweb interactions and ecosystem diversity, instead of
community diversity, may result in new ecosystem measures which reflect this
increased community diversity and increased connectivity in later successional
stages.</P>
<P>The numbers, biomass, activity and community structure of the organisms
which comprise the soil foodweb can be used as indicators of ecosystem health
because these organisms perform critical processes and functions. Soil
decomposers (bacteria, fungi and possibly certain arthropods) are responsible
for nutrient retention in soil. Ifnutrients are not retained within an
ecosystem, future productivity of the ecosystem will be reduced as well as cause
problems for systems into which those nutrients move, especially aquatic
portions of the landscape (Hendrix et al, 1986; Klopatek, et al. 1993). </P>
<P>As ecosystems become more productive, the total amount of nutrients retained
within the system increases. As succession occurs, nutrients are increasingly
immobilized in forms that are less available for plants and animals, such as
phytates, lignins, tannins, humid and fulvic acids (Coleman et al, 1985, 1992).
In order for nutrients to become available once again to plants and animals,
they must be mineralized by the interaction of decomposers, i.e. bacteria and
fungi, and their predators, i.e. protozoa, nematodes, microarthropods, and
earthworms (if present). These predator populations and the rates at which they
perform mineralization processes are important to ecosystem stability. The
activity of these predator-prey interactions (which determines the rate at which
mineralization occurs) are in turn affected, and perhaps controlled by, higher
level predators such as millipedes, centipedes, beetles, spiders, and small
mammals.</P>
<P>It is perhaps something of a conundrum that in healthy ecosystems, while
nutrient cycling and productivity increases, nutrient loss is minimized. What
makes this possible is the increasing complexity of the soil foodweb. As total
ecosystem productivity increases, biodiversity below ground, i.e., the structure
and function of the soil foodweb, also increases (Moore et al. 1991). The
greater the foodweb complexity, i.e., the interaction of decomposers, their
predators, and the predators of those predators responsible for nutrient cycling
and the retention of nutrients within the soil (Coleman et al, 1985; 1992), the
fewer the losses of nutrients from that system, the more tightly nutrients cycle
from retained forms to plants, and back again. Without the soil foodweb, plants
would not obtain the nutrients necessary for growth, and the above ground
foodweb would not long continue (Nannipieri et al. 1990).</P>
<P>Interactions of decomposers with their predator groups (protozoa, nematodes
and microarthropods) maintain normal nutrient cycling processes in all
ecosystems (Coleman 1985, 1992). Plant growth is dependent on microbial nutrient
immobilization and soil foodweb interactions to mineralize nutrients (Nannipieri
et al. 1990). In undisturbed ecosystems, the processes of immobilization and
mineralization are tightly coupled to plant growth. Following disturbance, this
coupling is lost or reduced (Ingham et al. 1986a, b; Coleman et al., 1992).</P>
<P>By monitoring soil organism dynamics, we can detect detrimental ecosystem
changes and possibly prevent further degradation (Lal and Stewart, 1992). The
response of each group of soil organisms, i.e., soil saprophytic bacteria,
symbiotic bacteria, saprophytic fungi, mycorrhizal fungi, protozoa, and
nematodes, with respect to their total biomass and activity, can be used to
indicate effects of contaminants on soil health. Instead of relying on an
indirect measure of whether total biomass or activity is reduced (e.g., Paul and
Clark, 1990; Nannipieri et al. 1991), active and total biomass of each organism
group can be directly measured (Ingham et al. 1986).</P>
<P>Lal and Stewart (1992) reviewed the relationship between system health and
soil organic matter, and suggested that soil organism losses correlate with
detrimental ecosystem changes. Development of the relationship between soil
foodweb structure and function and assessment of potential toxic impact could be
extremely useful for assessing ecosystem health.</P>
<P>Two measures of ecosystem processes are discussed below: the ratio of fungal
to bacterial biomass (Ingham and Horton, 1987) and the Maturity Index for
nematodes (Bongers, 1985). Both appear to be useful predictors of ecosystem
health, although they must be properly interpreted given the successional stage
being examined. For example, recently disturbed systems have nematode community
structures skewed towards opportunistic species and genera, while the less
opportunistic, more K-selected species of nematodes return as time
since-disturbance increases. Thus, healthier soils tend to have more mature
nematode community structures. However, as systems mature, nutrients tend to be
more sequestered in soil biomass and organic matter, and thus the maturity index
reflects an optimal, intermediate disturbance period in which greatest ecosystem
productivity is likely to occur.</P>
<P>Ratios of fungal to bacterial biomass also predict this type of response.
Highly productive agricultural soils tends to have ratios near one, but asa
system undergoes succession into a grassland, this ratio dips downwards,
indicating that for a healthy grassland system, the ratio should be less than
one. In other words, bacterial-biomass dominates in healthy grassland soils.
However, as succession proceeds yet further, fungal biomass begins to dominate
and healthy forest systems have fungal to bacterial biomass ratios of greater
than one, usually greater than 10.</P>
<P>Piparian or deciduous forests appear to be intermediate within this range of
values. Alder forest soils are dominated by bacterial biomass, while popular
forest soils are fungal-dominated. Clearly, further investigation is required.</P>
<P>The predators of bacteria and fungi tend to follow the dominance of the
decomposer groups. Thus, bacterial-dominated soils have a majority of
bacterial-predators (protozoa and bacterial-feeding nematodes), while
fungal-dominated soils have a majority of fungal predators (fungal-feeding
nematodes and fungal-feeding microarthropods).</P>
<P>Much work is still required at the bacterial and fungal species level.While
the species of protozoa and nematodes have been researched in soils of this area
of the west, publication of much of this information has yet to occur. Up-dates
will be required as this information becomes available.</P>
<H3>The Soil Foodweb: Function</H3>
<P><A HREF="ingham1.gif"><B>Detrital food web in shortgrass prairie</B></A></P>
<P>Bacteria and fungi perform one of the major nutrient cycling processes,
nutrient retention, in soil (Coleman et al. 1992). The amount of N. P. S and
other nutrients immobilized in bacterial and fungal biomass can be considerable,
from several micrograms to milligrams of biomass, comprising a significant
portion of the stable nutrient pool (Ingham et al, 1986). When the bacterial or
fungal component of the soil declines, more nutrients are lost into the ground
and surface water (Hendrix et al, 1986; Coleman et al., 1992). A major means of
retaining nutrients may also be arthropod fecal material (Rusek, 1983; Pawluk,
1983), depending on the ecosystem.</P>
<P>Soil bacteria are important in maintaining normal nutrient immobilization
and decomposition processes in all ecosystems (Coleman et al. 1985; Ingham, et
al. 1986a, b). Plants are strongly influenced by the presence of bacteria in the
rhizosphere, especially with respect to microbial immobilization of nutrient,
and mineralization of nutrients from bacterial biomass by predators. Disturbance
of these soil processes may result in the un-coupling of mineralization and
plant growth, with the resultant loss of nutrients from the system, causing
problems for systems into which nutrients move (Ingham and Coleman, 1984).</P>
<P>As climate changes occur, bacterial populations in the soil could be
significantly impacted (Coleman et al, 1992). As temperature increases,
bacterial numbers could increase, resulting in greater immobilization of
nutrients in their biomass, causing greater nitrogen limitation of plant growth.
Alternatively, bacteria could be inhibited by increases in carbon dioxide,
resulting in decreased decomposition of soil organic matter and plant litter,
which ultimately would change soil structure and nutrient cycling. In addition,
current work indicates that alterations in the fungal to bacterial biomass ratio
strongly impacts vegetative community structure. If a forest soil, usually
strongly dominated by fungi, loses the fungal component, reflected by a decrease
in the ratio of fungi to bacteria, conifer species may be at risk of death. If
the fungal to bacterial biomass ratio decreases past one, re-establishment of
conifer species may be impossible.</P>
<P>Saprophytic fungi and bacteria form the base of the detrital foodweb, and as
such are critically important for supporting the nutrient cycling sub-system of
any ecosystem, landscape, or biome. Bacterial and fungal pathogens of plants,
insects, rodents, and other organisms can control the population density of
their hosts.</P>
<P>Mutualist bacteria and fungi can be critically important for plants and
animals alike, for example, nitrogen-fixing bacteria on legumes, or rumen
bacteria in cows, deer or elk. Without their mutualists, these plants and
animals are not capable of competing with other organisms and become locally
extinct. While methods are not yet capable of distinguishing between saprophytic
and pathogenic species of bacteria and fungi in soil, their total and active
biomass, and effects of different disturbances on their distributions, can be
estimated. However, work should continue on methods to differentiate bacterial
and fungal community composition in soil.</P>
<P>Protozoa, comprised of the three groups; (1) flagellates, (2) amoebae (both
naked and testate), and (3) ciliated, are important in maintaining
plant-available N and mineralization processes (Coleman, 1985) and, as
bacterial-feeders, are important in controlling bacterial numbers and community
structure in the soil (Foissner 1986). The presence or absence of certain
protozoa species is indicative of the presence of certain hazardous wastes and
therefore may be highly useful indicator organisms of certain types of
environmental impacts (Foissner 1986).</P>
<P>Nematodes are one of the most ecologically diverse groups of animals on
earth, existing in nearly every habitat. Nematodes eat bacteria, fungi, algae,
yeasts, diatoms and may be predators of several small invertebrate animals,
including other nematodes. In addition, they may be parasites of invertebrates,
vertebrates (including man) and all above and below ground portions of plants.
Nematodes range in length from 82 um (marine) to 9 m (whale parasite) but most
species in soil are between 0.25 and 5.5 mm long.</P>
<P>Nematodes are recognized as a major consumer group in soils, generally
grouped into four to five trophic categories based on the nature of their food,
the structure of the stoma and esophagus and method of feeding (Yeates, 1971).
Plant-feeding nematodes possess stylets with a wide diversity of size and
structure and are the most extensively studied group of soil nematodes because
of their ability to cause plant disease and reduce crop yield. Fungal-feeding
nematodes have slender stylets but are often difficult to categorize and have
been included with plant-feeders in many ecological studies. Bacterialfeeding
nematodes are a diverse group and usually have a simple stoma in the form of a
cylindrical or triangular tube, terminating in a teeth (Nicholas,
1975).valve-like apparatus which may bear minute   nematodes (marine) to 9 m 
0.25 and 5.5 mm</P>
<P>Predatory nematodes are usually large species possessing either a large
styles or a wide cup-shaped cuticular-lined stoma armed with powerful teeth
(Nicholas, 1975). Omnivores are sometimes considered as a fifth trophic category
of soil nematodes. These nematodes may fit into one of the categories above but
also ingest other food sources. For example, some bacterial feeders may also eat
protozoa and/or algae and some stylet-bearing nematodes may pierce and suck
algae as well as fungi and/or higher plants. Stages of animalparasitic
nematodes, such as hookworms, may also be found in soils but generally are not
common in most soil samples.</P>
<P>Nematodes and protozoa function as regulators of mineralization processes in
soil (Coleman, 1985). Bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematodes release a large
percent of N when feeding on their prey groups and are thus responsible for much
of the plant available N in the majority of soils (Ingham, R. et al. 1985).
Nematode-feeding also selects for certain species of bacteria, fungi and
nematodes and thereby influences soil structure, carbon utilization rates, and
the types of substrates present in soil (Ingham, R. 1992). Root-feeding
nematodes are among the greatest pests in agricultural systems and, with the
loss of many nematicides, are becoming a greater concern. Without doubt, plant
establishment, survival and successional processes are influenced by these soil
organisms</P>
<P>Soil processes are important for maintaining normal nutrient cycling in all
ecosystems (Coleman et al., 1985; Dindal 1990; Ingham, E. et al. 1986a, b).
Plant growth is dependent on the microbial immobilization and soil foodweb
interactions to mineralize nutrients. In undisturbed ecosystems, the processes
of immobilization and mineralization are tightly coupled to plant growth but
following disturbance, this coupling may be lost or reduced. Nutrients may be no
longer retained within the system, causing problems for systems into which
nutrients move (Ingham and Coleman, 1984; Hendrix et al. 1986; Nannipieri et al.
1990). Measurement of disrupted processes may allow determination of a problem
long before normal cycling processes are altered, before the natural vegetation
is lost, or human health problems occur. By monitoring soil organism dynamics,
we can perhaps detect detrimental ecosystem changes and possibly prevent further
degradation.</P>
<P>Immobilization of nutrients in soil, i.e., retention of carbon, nitrogen,
phosphorus, and many micronutrients in the horizons of soil from which plants
obtain their nutrients, is a process performed by bacteria and fungi. Without
these organisms present and functioning, nutrients are not retained by soil, and
the ecosystem undergoes degradation. Thus, to assess the ability of an ecosystem
to retain nutrients, the decomposed portion of the ecosystem, i.e., active and
total fungal biomass, and active bacterial biomass must be assessed.</P>
<H3>The Soil Foodweb: Structure</H3>
<P><A HREF="ingham3.gif">Worksheet for 1 sq. m soil</A></P>
<P>What is the soil foodweb? Per gram of healthy soil, which is about a
teaspoon of soil plus organic matter, the following organisms are found: of
which are mostly unknown to scientists. Bacteria break down easy to-use organic
material, and retain the nutrients, like N. P and S. in the soil. About 60% of
the carbon in those organic materials are respired as carbon dioxide, but 40% of
that carbon is retained as bacterial biomass. The waste products bacteria
produce become soil organic matter. This &quot;waste&quot; material is more
recalcitrant than the original plant material, but can be used by a large number
of other soil organisms, exemplifying the classic statement that &quot;One man's
garbage is another's treasure&quot;. Productive garden soil should contain more
bacteria than any other kind of organism, although care must be taken to make
sure beneficial bacteria, instead of disease-causing bacteria, are most
prevalent.- S to 60 000 meters of fungal hyphae. Fungi break down the more
recalcitrant, or difficult-to-decompose, organic matter, and retain those
nutrients in the soil as fungal biomass. Just like bacteria, fungal waste
products become soil organic matter, and these waste materials are used by other
organisms. Gardens require some fungal biomass for greatest productivity, but in
order for best crop growth, there should be an equal biomass of bacteria as
compared to fungi. Most grasslands or pastures have less fungi than bacterial,
while all conifer forests have much more fungal, as compared to bacterial,
biomass. As with bacteria, some fungi cause disease and the soil must be managed
to prevent these fungi from being a problem. </P>
<P> -100 to 100,000  protozoa. These organisms are one-celled, highly mobile
organisms that feed on bacteria and on each other. Because protozoa require 5 to
10-fold less nitrogen than bacteria, N is released when a protozoan eats a
bacterium. That released N is then available for plants to take up. Between 40
and 80% of the N in plants can come from the predator-prey interaction of
protozoa with bacteria.</P>
<P>- 5 to 500 beneficial nematodes. Beneficial nematodes eat bacteria, fungi,
and other nematodes. Nematodes need even less nitrogen than protozoa, between 10
and 100 times less than a bacterium contains, or between 5 and 50 times less
than a fungal hyphae contains. Thus when bacterial- or fungal-feeding nematodes
eat bacteria or fungi, nitrogen is released, making that N available for plant
growth. However, plant-feeding nematode are pests because they eat plant roots.
These &quot;bad&quot; nematodes can be controlled bacteria, fungi, and other
nematodes. Nematodes need even less nitrogen than protozoa, between 10 and 100
times less than a bacterium contains, or between 5 and 50 times less than a
fungal hyphae contains. Thus when bacterial- or fungal-feeding nematodes eat
bacteria or fungi, nitrogen is released, making that N available for plant
growth. However, plant-feeding nematode are pests because they eat plant roots.
These &quot;bad&quot; nematodes can be controlled biologically, as they are in
natural systems, by fungi that trap nematodes, by having fungi that colonize
root systems and prevent nematode attack of roots, or by predation of nematodes
by arthropods. In cases of extreme outbreaks, however, the only answer may be
the use chemicals to control these plant-feeding nematodes. However, once a
chemical is used which kills the beneficial nematodes as well as the
plant-feeding ones, the beneficial nematodes need to be replaced through
inoculation.</P>
<P>- A few to several hundred thousand microarthropods. These organisms have
several functions. They chew the plant leaf material, roots, stems and boles of
trees into smaller pieces, making it easier for bacteria and fungi to find the
food they like on the newly revealed surfaces. The &quot;comminuting&quot;
arthropods can increase decomposition rates by 2- to 100- times, although if the
bacteria or fungi are lacking, increased decomposition will not occur. In many
cases, however, the arthropods carry around an inoculum of bacteria and fungi,
making certain the food they want is inoculated onto the newly exposed surfaces!
Arthropods then feed on bacteria and fungi, and because the C:N ratio of
arthropods is 100 times greater than the bacteria and fungi, they release
nitrogen which then is available for plant growth. Some arthropods eat pest
insects, while others eat roots. Again, it's important to encourage the
beneficial ones and discourage the ones that eat plants!</P>
<H3>The Web of Life Can Be Degraded</H3>
<P>The interactions between these organisms form a web of life, just like the
web that biologists study above ground. What most people don't realize is that
the above ground wouldn't exist without the below ground systems in place and
functioning. Soil biology is understudied, compared to the above ground, yet it
is important for the health of gardens, pastures, lawns, shrublands, and
forests. If garden soil is healthy, there will be high numbers of bacteria and
bacterial-feeding organisms. If the soil has received heavy treatments of
pesticides, chemical fertilizers, soil fungicides or fumigants that kill these
organisms, the tiny critters die, or the balance between the pathogens and
beneficial organisms is upset, allowing the opportunist, disease-causing
organisms to become problems.</P>
<P>Over-use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides have effects on soil
organisms that are similar to over-using antibiotics. When we consider human use
of antibiotics, these chemicals seemed a panacea at first, because they could
control disease. But with continued use, resistant organisms developed, and
other organisms that compete with the disease-causing organisms were lost. We
found that antibiotics couldn't be used willy-nilly, that they must be used only
when necessary, and that some effort must be made to replace the normal
human-digestive system bacteria killed by the antibiotics.</P>
<P>Soils are similar, in that plants grown in soil where competing organisms
have been knocked back with chemicals are more susceptible to disease-causing
organisms. If the numbers of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes and arthropods
are lower than they should be for a particular soil type, the soil's &quot;digestive
system&quot; doesn't work properly. Decomposition will be low, nutrients will
not be retained in the soil, and will not be cycled properly. Ultimately,
nutrients will be lost through the groundwater or through erosion because
organisms aren't present to hold the soil together.</P>
<P>The best way manage for a healthy microbial ecosystem in a home garden is to
routinely apply organic material, such as compost. To keep garden soil healthy,
the amount of organic matter added must be equal to what the bacteria and fungi
use each year.</P>
<P>Indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides should be avoided.
If the soil is healthy for the type of vegetation desired, there should be no
reason to use pesticides, or fertilizers. If a decision is made to change from
grass to garden, or forest to lawn, a massive change in the soil foodweb
structure is required and chemical use, along with judicious addition of the
right kind of compost with the right kinds of organisms, may be necessary for a
few years. But once the correct soil foodweb structure is in place, there should
be no reason to apply chemicals.</P>
<P>If both bacteria and fungi are lost, then the soil degrades, than any other
organism. If bacteria are killed through pesticide or chemical applications, and
especially if certain extremely important bacteria like nitrogen-fixing bacteria
or nitrifying bacteria are killed, fungi can take over and crop production can
be harmed. For example, current research indicates that the reason moss takes
over in lawn ecosystems is because the soil is converted from a bacterial
dominated system to one dominated by fungi. nutrients are lost, erosion
increases and plant yield is reduced. If inorganic fertilizers are used to
replace the lost nitrogen, the immediate effect may be to improve plant growth.
However, as time goes on, it is clear that inorganic fertilizers can't replace
the other kinds of food that bacteria and fungi need. After awhile, fertilizer
additions are a waste of money, because there aren't enough soil organisms to
hold on to the nutrients added. Surface and groundwater will become contaminated
with the lost nutrients, causing problems.</P>
<H3>Maintaining and Enhancing the Soil Foodweb</H3>
<P></P>
<P>Bacterial dominance is maintained by mixing plant material into the soil.
But the bacteria and fungi eat this material at an amazingly rapid pace and new
inputs are required every year; Fungi can be maintained by letting litter
accumulate on the soil's surface. Larger soil organisms like millipedes,
centipedes, earthworms, and ants mix plant material into soil and open air
channels, especially important in wet periods in heavy clay soils. To maintain a
one-to-one ratio of bacteria and fungi needed for crop systems, a balance is
needed between too much and too little mixing. Plant material needs to be mixed
in enough to maintain bacterial dominance, but too much mixing results in soil
degradation. Timing of mixing is important as well, but the optimal combination
hasn't been determined for soil organisms in different types of soil.</P>
<P>It's important to remember that grassland, garden and forest soils represent
a gradient from bacterial to fungal dominance. Gardens require equal amounts of
bacteria and fungi, while trees require fungi. There are a number of examples
where the fungal component has been lost from forest soils and as a result, tree
regeneration is impossible. If the soil foodweb was better understood, there
would ways to fix the problem, but that research is yet to be done.</P>
<P>In order to determine the organisms in soil, the biomass and activity of
bacteria and fungi, the numbers of protozoa and nematodes, the types (beneficial
and root-feeding) of nematodes, and VA mycorrhizal colonization of roots need to
be assessed. Reference information on the biomass, numbers and types of these
organisms is being determined for soils all over the world. The goal is to
determine what the healthy soil foodweb structure should be for every soil type,
given vegetation and climate characteristics. If the foodweb structure is not at
that healthy level, another goal is to determine what it will take to return it
to a healthy level. Once a healthy foodweb structure is achieved, the only time
testing would be needed is when some problem is detected, suggesting the foodweb
has changed in an unproductive direction.</P>
<H3>Soil Sampling</H3>
<P></P>
<P>Soil sampling should result in three samples from any particular area, such
as a meadow, crop field, forest stand or garden. Five samples per area, or more
would be preferable, but time and cost of analysis must be a consideration. The
idea is to take enough samples that the variability within that area can be
assessed. One possible approach is to mentally split the area to be sampled into
three equal areas. From each of the three areas, between three and ten small
soil cores should be mixed together in a plastic bag. The cores should be taken
by pushing aside the litter (loose recognizable plant litter material) on the
top of the soil and removing soil (may contain some unrecognizable plant
material, but is mostly mineral soil material, or sand, silt and clay fractions)
from the 0-5 cm depth. The core should be about 2.5 cm or 1 inch diameter, and
all the soil from this small cylinder should be removed and placed in the
plastic bag. If mycorrhizal colonization is to be performed, the roots in each
core should be removed and placed in the plastic bag. Small scissors should be
used to cut the small roots.</P>
<P>In fact, the foodweb structure in any kind of material, from lake sediment,
to rumen material from cattle can be assessed, but most research has been
performed on soil-related material.</P>
<H2>Interpretation of Soil Foodweb Structure</H2>
<H3>Ratio of total fungal to total bacterial biomass </H3>
<P></P>
<P>By examining the structure of the soil foodweb in a range of soils, all
grassland and most agricultural soils have ratios of total fungal to total
bacterial biomass less than one (F/B &lt; 1). Another way to interpret this is
that the bacterial biomass is greater than the fungal biomass in these soils.
</P>
<P>In the most productive agricultural systems, however, the ratio of total
fungal to total bacterial biomass equals one (F/B = 1) or the biomass of fungi
and bacteria is even. When agricultural soils become fungal-dominated,
productivity will be reduced, and in most cases, liming and mixing of the soil
(plowing) is needed to return the system to a bacterial-dominated soil.</P>
<P>All conifer forest soils are fungal dominated, and the ratio in all forest
soils in which seedling regeneration occurs is above 10. In general, productive
forest soils have ratios greater than 100.  This means that fungal biomass
strongly outweighs the bacterial biomass in forest soils. In the case where
forest soils lose this fungal-dominance, it is not possible to re-establish
seedlings. When forest soil becomes bacterial-dominated, conifer seedlings are
incapable of being re-established.</P>
<P>In the few studies of riparian forests that have been performed, some
deciduous riparian forest soils are bacterial-dominated. In the case of riparian
aspen and beech soils, the soils are bacterial dominated. But poplar, oak and
maple soils are is fungal-dominated, although not as strongly fungal-dominated
as in conifer systems. No studies on establishment of seedlings in these systems
have been performed.</P>
<P>The ratio of total fungal to total bacterial biomass has been related to
ecosystem productivity, but numbers or length of active and total bacteria and
fungi are also indicative of the health of soil. For different soils, vegetation
and climate, the density of bacteria or fungi indicate the past degradation of
the soil. As explained above, and again in the following sections, bacterial
numbers should be greater than one million for all agricultural soils,
preferably nearer 100 million for the most productive soils. For the most
productive forest soils, for example, fungal length should be above 5000 meters
of hyphae per gram soil.</P>
<H3>Biomass of total fungi</H3>
<P></P>
<P>Fungal biomass is extremely important in all soils as a means of retaining
nutrients that plants need in the upper layers of the soil, i.e., in the
root-zone. Without these organisms to take-up nutrients, and either retain those
nutrients in their biomass, or to sequester those nutrients in soil organic
matter, nutrients would wash through the soil and into ground or surface water.
Plants would suffer from lack of nutrients cycling into forms that the roots can
take-up, if these nutrients aren't first immobilized in the soil through the
action of fungi or bacteria. For forest soils, fungi sequester most of the
nutrients, although significant portions are immobilized by bacteria as well.</P>
<P>In soil in which only fungi are present, the soil will become more acidic,
from secondary metabolites produced by fungi. Aggregates are larger in
fungal-dominated soils than in bacterial-dominated soils, and the major form of
N is ammonium, since fungi do not nitrify N. These conditions are more
beneficial for certain shrubs, and most trees.</P>
<P>Total fungal biomass varies depending on soil type, vegetation, organic
matter levels, recent pesticide use, soil disturbance and a variety of other
factors, many of which have not been researched completely. However, for normal
grassland soils, total fungal biomass levels are usually around 50 to 500 meters
per gram of soil. For agricultural soils, fungal biomass is around 1 to 50
meters per gram soil, while for forest soils, fungal biomass is between 1000
meters to 60 km per gram of soil. More work is necessary to establish what the
optimal fungal biomass value should be for each type of crop, soil, organic
matter, climate, etc. Very little information is available for tropical systems,
but that small amount of data indicates that temperate systems perform very
differently from tropical soils.</P>
<P>The average diameter of hyphae in most soils is about 2.5 micrometers,
indicating typical mixtures of zygomycetes, ascomycete and basidiomycetes
species. On occasion the average diameter may be greater than 2.5 micrometers,
indicating a greater than normal component of basidiomycete hyphae, while on
other occasions, the average diameter of hyphae may be less than 2.5
micrometers, indicating a change in species composition of soil fungi to a
greater proportion of lower fungi. Actinomycetes are not usually differentiated
from fungi, since actinomycetes are hyphal in morphology and are rarely of
significant biomass. In some agricultural soils, these narrow diameter &quot;hyphae&quot;
are of considerable importance, as demonstrated by Dr. A. Van Bruggan.</P>
<H3>Biomass of active fungi</H3>
<P></P>
<P>Activity in all soil organisms follow a typical seasonal fluctuation. This
cycle is related to optimal temperature and moisture, such that a peak in
activity usually occurs in the spring as temperature and moisture become optimal
after cold winter temperatures. In systems where snow accumulates on the Coil
surface, such that the soil does not actually freeze, fungal activity may
continue at high levels throughout the winter in litter. Decomposition may
continue at the highest rates through the winter under the snow in the litter.
In systems where moisture becomes limiting in the summer, activity may reach
levels even lower than in the winter. When temperatures remain warm in the fall
and rain begins again after a summer drought, such as in Mediterranean climates,
a second peak of activity may be observed in the fall. If these peaks are not
observed, this suggests inadequate organic matter in the soil.</P>
<H3>Numbers of total bacteria</H3>
<P></P>
<P>Just as fungi are the most important players in retaining nutrients in
forest soil, bacteria are the important players in agricultural and grassland
soils. Bacteria retain nutrients first in their biomass, and second, in their
metabolic by-products. In soil in which only bacteria are inoculated, the soil
will become more alkaline, will have small aggregates, and generally will have
nitrate/nitrite as the dominant form of N. These conditions are beneficial for
grasses and row crop plants.</P>
<P>Numbers of total bacteria generally remain the same regardless of soil type
or vegetation. Total bacterial numbers range between 1 million and 100 million
per gram soil in agricultural soils, and between 10 million and 1,000 million in
forest soils. Bacterial numbers can be above 100 million in decomposing logs, in
anaerobic soils, in soil amended with sewage sludge or in soil with high amounts
of comported material. In some instances following pesticide treatment,
bacterial numbers can fall below 1 million, and this has been correlated with
signs of severe nitrogen deficiency in plants. Bacterial numbers can drop to
extremely low levels, below 100,000 per gram of soil, in degraded soils where
nutrient retention is a problem.</P>
<H3>Biomass of active bacteria</H3>
<P></P>
<P>As with active fungal biomass, bacterial activity usually peaks in the
spring and decreases during the summer with drought. If the temperature remains
warm in the fall and fall rains begin, a second peak of activity usually occurs.
The ratio of active fungal to active bacterial biomass, even in forests, shows
that bacterial biomass is usually more active than fungal biomass. If these
peaks with temperature and moisture are not seen, then lack of appropriate food
in the soil to support bacterial and fungal biomass is suspected. If bacterial
and fungal activity does not respond to seasonal fluctuations, then subsequent
impacts on the predators in the soil will be observed.</P>
<H3>Protozoan numbers</H3>
<P></P>
<P>Protozoa feed on bacteria, and as they feed on their prey, N is released.
It's unclear just how much N is released per individual feeding event, since it
depends on whether the bacterium was actively growing, thus containing more N.
or whether the bacterium was in a resting starving phase, and containing much
less N. Several studies have shown that a major portion t40-80%) of the nitrogen
that cycles through in certain agricultural soils is cycled by protozoa. Without
these organisms in soil, plants suffer a significant reduction in available N.
However the optimal relationship between the number of bacteria and the number
of protozoa has not been quantified.</P>
<P>There appears to be a great range in protozoan numbers from soil to soil,
and even from field to field. Some of the observations that have been made, when
dealing with agricultural soil tie., bacterial dominated) is that when protozoan
numbers are high, bacterial-feeding nematode numbers will be low, and vice
versa. Thus there appears to be significant competition between
bacterial-feeding predators for the bacterial prey. Whether this is indicative
of the type of bacteria present in the soil, and whether this has any
relationship to productivity in agricultural situations is not known.</P>
<P>Testate amoebae are only found in significant and constant numbers in forest
soils, and are never found in temperate agricultural soils. Why this is the case
is not known, but continues to be observed.</P>
<H3>Nematode numbers, community structure</H3>
<P><A HREF="ingham2.gif"><B>Nematode handout</B></A></P>
<P>There are four major types of nematodes, which includes bacterial-feeding,
fungal-feeding, root-feeding and predatory nematodes. All nematodes are
predators, and thus reflect to some extent the availability of their prey
groups. However, other organisms prey upon these nematodes as well, and nematode
numbers can also reflect the balance between the availability of nematode prey,
as well as feeding by nematode predators.</P>
<P>Both bacterial-feeding and fungal-feeding nematodes mineralize N from their
prey groups. Bacterial-feeding nematodes are more important in
bacterial-dominated soils (agriculture and grassland systems), while
fungal-feeding nematodes are more important in fungal dominated soils (conifer
and most deciduous forests). Between 70 and 80% of the nitrogen in
rapidly-growing trees has been shown to come from interactions between nematode
predators and their prey. Between 30 and 50% of the N in crop plants appears to
come form the interactions of bacterial-feeding nematodes and bacteria. Thus,
the presence and numbers of bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematodes is extremely
important for productive soils.</P>
<P>Root-feeding nematodes are detrimental to plant growth. As few as one
endo-parasitic nematodes per plant may be enough to result in decreased
productivity or death, while plants may tolerate several hundred ecto-parasitic
nematodes per root system without reduction in production. Compensatory plant
production has been observed with a little root-feeding, in that plant
production is greater with a few herbivores munching on the plant than without
feeding taking place.</P>
<P>Root-feeding nematode numbers can be reduced by competition for root space.
VA mycorrhizal fungi may prevent root-feeding nematodes from reaching the roots
through a variety of mechanisms. Nematode trapping fungi trap and kill many
root-feeding nematodes. Other fungi and bacteria may be active inhibitors of
nematode presence in the rhizosphere. Effective biocontrol of these
plant-feeders is being worked on and may be possible in the near future.</P>
<P>T. Bongers, in the Netherlands, suggested the use of a Maturity Index for
nematodes in soil. Certain species of nematodes are more commonly found
following disturbance, while other species are more typical inhabitants of
less-disturbed soils. The numbers of the four different trophic groups, or of
different genera or species of matodes can be interpreted in several ways.
First, significant differences in the number of individuals in a trophic group,
or in nematode species in any treatment, compared to the control or reference
treatment indicates an impact on that particular group or species. Several
studies have recently shown that changes in numbers of even a single species of
nematode in soil can significantly alter nutrient cycling within a soil.
However, until more work is done to determine whether the same (or similar)
nematode species control that same process in a similar way in other soils,
extrapolation of results from a study performed in a different soil, with
different plant species, different bacterial and fungal species, and different
numbers of competing predators remains fraught with difficulty. However, it
clearly suggests that alteration in nematode species composition could have
negative impacts on plant growth, plant species composition, and thus ecosystem
productivity.</P>
<P>A second way of interpreting nematode data is to assess changes in process
rates. Since a bacterial-feeding nematode consumes 106 bacteria per day,
reductions in this trophic group should result in an increase in bacterial
biomass, with concomitant increase in net nutrient immobilization, and a
decrease in nutrient mineralization with a concomitant effect on availability to
plants. A fungal-feeding nematode consumes the cytoplasm in 10-50 meters of
hyphal length per day, with similar effects on nutrient cycling as decreases in
bacterial-feeding nematodes.</P>
<P>When root-feeding nematodes numbers are decreased, the ecosystem impact is
positive, since root-feeding nematodes reduce plant growth/yield. However,
root-feeding nematodes are highly opportunistic organisms, and are among the
first organisms to invade after disturbance. Thus, one result of any disturbance
which seriously affects ecosystem stability is reduction in the number of
organisms which displace root-feeding nematodes. These competitors of
root-feeding nematodes are mycorrhizal fungi, nematode-feeding nematodes,
nematode-feeding microarthropods which frequent the rhizosphere, and
fungal-feeding nematodes which apparently interfere with the ability of
root-feeding nematodes to find roots. A second result of disturbance is a
reduction in the ability of plants to resist nematode feeding. Thus, following a
disturbance which disrupts ecosystem stability, root-feeding nematode numbers
increase more rapidly than other groups, to the detriment of ecosystem
productivity. Thus, as a general indicator of ecosystem health, increases in
root feeding nematode numbers suggest serious negative impacts on ecosystem
stability.</P>
<P>A decrease in nematode-feeding nematode numbers initiates a trophic cascade
effect. For example, nematode-feeding nematodes can control the populations of
bacterial-, fungal- or root-feeding nematodes and reduction in nematode-feeders
results in an immediate increase in their prey group - i.e., bacterial- fungal-
or root feeding nematodes. This in turn results in a decrease in the prey of
these three nematode groups; a reduction in bacteria, fungi or roots, each with
it's detrimental effect on nutrient cycling Indoor plant growth, as outlined
above.</P>
<H3>VAM spore numbers</H3>
<P></P>
<P>Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (YAM) fungi are critically important for
all crop plants, except species of the brassica family (e.g., mustards, kale). A
number of researchers have shown that the lack of VAM inoculum, or the lack of
the appropriate inoculum can result in poor plant growth, in poor competition
with other plants or inability to reproduce or survive under certain extreme
conditions. However, most crop fields have adequate VAM spores present,
especially if crop residue is placed back into the field. Only in a few
situations where soil degradation has been severe, such as with intensive
pesticide use, fumigation, or intense fertilizer amendment, will VAM inoculum
become so low that plant growth will be in jeopardy.</P>
<P>In restoration studies, the lack of appropriate inoculum is more likely to
be a problem than in other situations where sources of appropriate VAM spores
are near-by. Thus, the presence of at least 1 to 5 spores per gram of soil is
adequate for most crop fields. When the number of spores falls below one per
gram, then addition of compost containing high numbers of VAM spores (for
example from an alfalfa field, or other legume), or inoculation of VAM spores
from a commercial source generally results in positive effects.</P>
<H3>Percent VAM colonization</H3>
<P></P>
<P>At least 12% of the root system of grasses, (i.e., most crop plants), should
be colonized by VAM in order to obtain the minimum required benefits from this
symbiotic relationship. Colonization upwards of 40% is usually seen in healthy
soils. VAM colonization can limit root-feeding nematode attack of root systems,
if the nematode burden is not too high. A great deal knowledge of the
relationship between plant species, VAM species and soil type, including
fertility, is needed in order to fully predict the optimal relationship between
crop plant, VAM species and soil.</P>

<P><B><I>Careful handling brings the rewards of this sweet, custard like
fruit.
</I></B></P>
<P><B>Cherimoya (Annona cherimoia) </B>is a wonderful, exotic fruit that
requires
<B>special handling  by growers and consumers alike.</B> For the growers, this
special handling starts when the flowers come into bloom. Cherimoyas won't even
bear fruit without some help. In their native habitat of Peru and Ecuador, there
is an insect that pollinates the cherimoya flowers, but the insect does't reside
in the U.S., so the growers in this country have to pollinate each flower by
hand .  Its a labor intensive process in which pollen is brushed from the flower
into a film canister, or other small container, and then bruished on to another
flower when the flower's stigma is receptive.  This pollination process last for
several months as the tree comes into bloom.  Sometimes the flowers will self
pollinate but self pollinated fruit can be misshapen.  Nor is hand pollination
100% effective. Growers expect that some fruit will not form even though the
flower was pollinated.  You may wonder what all this fussing is about. Is it
really worth so much trouble? If you&quot;ve tried this delicate, custardy fruit
with its primordial looking armor of green you probably would agree that yes
it's worth the fuss. The luscious flavors of papya,banana and pineapple make
this a truly special fruit worthy of the effort.</P>
<P>Not only does it need to be hand pollinated but it's delicacy of flavor is
mirrored in its delicacy of  constitution. This fruit needs to be pampered. 
Their tough looking exterior could lead you to believe that cherimoyas are ideal
for tossing around in a game of catch. Not so! Cherimoyas bruise easily and are
sensitive to extremes of heat and cold.  Like avocados, cherimoyas can not be
chilled before they ripen.  Cherimoya grower Sal Schettino of Noah's Ark Farm
says 50 degrees F is the ideal storage temperature to hold cherimoyas. Once ripe
they can be refrigerated for up to 5 days,but be careful not to bruise them. 
<B>Rough handling </B>of even unripe fruit leads to off flavored bruised fruit.
</P>
<P>Common varieties of Cherimoya are White, Booth, Bay and Spain.  Cherimoyas
make delicious sorbets or milkshakes, but their complex flavor and aroma is
enjoyed when served halved or quartered and eaten with a spoon. Cherimoyas are
rich in fiber,vitamin C and niacin.</P>
<P>Cherimoya 
<IMG SRC="cus1a.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></P>
<H3>Taken from Daimond Organics Cherimoya recipe sheet:</H3>
<P><B>To Ripen:</B>Place on a counter out of the sun or on the table in a
fruit bowl,. Check your cherimoya every couple of days with your thumb for
softness much like you would check ripeness in an avocado.  You will notice the
skin turning brownish as the cherimoya becomes soft and ripe.  You'll need to
find the happy medium, don't cut into it when you first notice ripeness,give it
a day or two more.  But if you let it sit out too long without eating it the
sugar in the flesh will become fermented tasting.  So don't wait too long for
the right occassion to cut it open!  Cut down the center from the top to bottom.
Cut in quarters and eat with a spoon or hold on your hand and eat like a
watermelon.  Scrape the rind with your teeth to get every bit of sweet flesh,
then discard the rind.  Don't forget to spit out the big black seeds. </P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P><A><IMG SRC="ccof.gif"></A>Organic farmers formed CCOF in 1973 to
define uniform organic farming standards and establish a certification
system.  Twenty years,serveral thousand inspections and many thousands
of grower volunteer hours later,we feel we have one of the finest
programs around.  </P>
<P>CCOF is a non-profit grass-roots ,democratically organized and
voluntary association of organic farmers and organic food processors. 
CCOF is the largest statewide organization of organic producers in the
nation, the primary certification and trade association for organic
farmers in California and a major representative for the organic foods
industry.</P>
<H2>Our Purpose</H2>
<P>Our purpose is to promote and support a healthful ,ecologically
accountable ,and permanent agriculture in California and elsewhere :to
develop standards and certification programs for organic farming and
processing of organic foods: to provide verification of adherence to
those standards for distributors ,retailers,and consumers to share ideas
and information</P>
<H3>Why be certified</H3>
<P>CCOF bases its certification program on the premise that legitimate
organic growers, handlers and processors, no matter what scale of
operation, benefit from a marketplace that demands independent
verification of organic claims.  CCOF believes that only a strong
verification system with on-site annual inspection protects consumers,
growers, processors and handlers from false claims.</P>
<H3>Basic Concepts</H3>
<P>The following are some of the concepts and practices that are
fundamental to organic production and should be the backbone of a
certified grower's farming system.  The Certification Handbook
Bibliography provides sources of in-depth information that could prove
valuable in making an organic operation a success.</P>
<P><EM>In an annual cropping system: -Legumes used as green manures
cover crops or permanent understory improve fertility; Allelopathic
crops that exude toxins from their roots can suppress weeds and insect
pests. Diversity of crops in both time and space prevents insect and
disease buildups and gives a grower a hedge against poor market
conditions for any one crop.</EM></P>
<P><EM>In a perennial or permaculture system:  -Cover crops are used
to hold the soil improve fertility and provide habitat for benefical
insects: A diversity of plants including polycultures, hedgerows and
windbreaks help ensure that no one factor such as a pest or a weed can
throw the system off balance.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Rotation and diversification are key principles in an
ecological  farming system</EM></P>
<P>Pest-free and weed-free fields are neither always possible nor
economically and ecologically desirable. Learning the thresholds for
tolerable levels of weeds,insects,birds,and rodents takes time and
experience and is an on-going process.</P>
<P>Varietal selection should look beyond maximum potential yield and
consider insect and disease resistance, nutritional quality, flavor and
positive response to lower inputs of nutrients and water.</P>
<P>Pest problems can be minimized by proper timing of plantings and the
use of trap crops to attract pests and beneficals alike.</P>
<P>Materials are not used as the primary management strategy, but
rather as an aid to resolving a specific problem until the farm system
can be brought back into balance.</P>
<P>Livestock managemant is based on good nutrition, animal stress
reduction, preventative medicine and other means not dependent on drugs
or pesticides.</P>
<P>Livestock breeding selects for disease resistance.</P>

<P>RINCON-VITOVA INSECTARIES, INC.</P>
<P>P.O. BOX 1555  *  VENTURA, CA 93002</P>
<P>805-643-5407 * FAX 805-643-6267</P>
<P><B>BENEFICIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL &amp; SUSTAINABLE AVOCADO
PRODUCTION
</B></P>
<P>At Rincon-Vitova Insectaries, we help our customers use beneficial insects
and predatory mites for sustainable natural biological pest control.  We
typically advise using either no pesticides, or where intolerable crop damage is
likely, an integrated pest management [IPM] strategy of spraying the lowest
possible rates of least toxic pest control compounds like soaps, oils,
botanicals, microbials and high pressure water sprays.</P>
<P>This low-input natural biological pest control strategy allows pest-eating
beneficial insects, predatory mites and spiders to survive, reproduce and
increase their populations in orchards.  Over the course of two to three
seasons, a combination of purchased beneficials from Rincon-Vitova Insectaries
and sustainable farming practices [e.g. cover crops; natural enemy refuge
strips; IPM] can tip the long-term orchard ecological balance from pest
outbreaks to the establishment of beneficial species and natural biological pest
control.</P> 
<P>Avocado pest control has become more complicated in recent years with
invasions of caterpillars like the Amorbia leafroller and loopers, along with
greenhouse thrips and persea mite.  Nonetheless, some of Rincon-Vitova
Insectaries' oldest avocado customers have conquered these pests with biological
control, spraying nothing harder than micronutrients in the last 25 years. 
Hence, we know from many years experience that avocado orchards can be
inoculated with beneficial insects, predatory mites and decollate snails [brown
garden snail predators] and farmed sustainably for decades with minimal or no
pesticides.  The key is farming in a way that builds up a large reservoir of
natural enemies that act as a buffer, absorbing invading pest populations.</P>
<P>Spraying avocado trees with even the least toxic pesticides, likes soaps,
oils, microbials [e.g. BT], botanicals and sulfur, can be an expensive affair,
whether with ground rigs or helicopters for optimum spray coverage of leaf
undersides.  Hence, any pesticide sprays replaced by an arsenal of orchard-grown
beneficials fattening themselves on pests means more dollars staying at home in
the orchard profit column.</P>
<P>Indeed, Rincon-Vitova's most successful customers have developed such a rich
assemblage of beneficial natural enemy species in their orchards over the years
that even beneficial insect purchases have become fewer and far between.  Once
orchards are successfully inoculated with new beneficial species and farming
practices modified to grow large quantities of predators and parasites in the
orchard, beneficial insect purchases are typically needed only for new pest
species [e.g. persea mite] or an ecological upset like a severe cold spell or
pesticide spray drift killing the beneficials.</P>
<P>When a new pest species, such as persea mite, becomes common in an area,
inoculating orchards with new natural enemy species, such as Galandromus
predatory mites or six-spotted thrips, is a sensible step in conjunction with an
IPM strategy that nurtures and encourages growth of the new beneficials.
Rincon-Vitova's beneficial insect and predatory mite products help create an
orchard ecological balance where beneficials eat enough pests to prevent major
problems.</P>
<P>Low levels of pests causing little economic loss are tolerated as food for
the beneficials.  Indeed, farming practices may even be altered to be more
sustainable, with more mulches, cover crops and special &quot;insectary&quot;
plants to grow more pest controlling beneficial insects in the orchard.</P>
<P>Once inoculation of new natural enemies is successful and farming practices
are such that large quantities of diverse beneficial insects are being grown on
the farm, the need for purchasing pest control inputs of all types diminishes. 
About the only pest control operation that we automatically recommend year in
and year out is regular monitoring of the orchards, preferably with a
knowledgeable consultant or PCA, to keep on top of potential pest problems and
detect new pest species.</P>
<P>Persea Mite Biocontrol</P>
<P>Persea mites, Olygonichus persea, are small yellowish spider mites living in
colonies and spinning very fine silvery or whitish webbing along veins on the
undersides of leaves.  The top sides of infested leaves have yellow spots that
later die and turn brown from mite feeding.  If persea mite populations explode
to over several hundred per leaf, defoliation and sunburning of fruit are a
threat.</P>
<P>Typically, persea mite populations peak in summer and decline during hot
spells [100 F, particularly when humidity is low] and cooler weather.  But
unless biological controls like green lacewings, six-spotted thrips and
Galandromus predatory mites sold by Rincon-Vitova become established, persea
mites will stage a comeback in the spring.</P> 
<P>The best IPM remedy for persea mite is high pressure water sprays, as these
are least toxic to the beneficials providing biological pest control. Indeed,
persea mite predators like Galandromus can be released immediately after high
pressure water sprays, as there is no toxic residue on the leaves to kill the
predators.  Work on remedies like oils, sulfur and botanicals is continuing, and
Rincon-Vitova Insectaries will be happy to share with callers the latest IPM
tactics as information becomes available.</P>
<P>Predators sold by Rincon-Vitova Insectaries that can be added to the natural
enemy complex fighting persea mite include the predatory mites Galandromus
helveolus and Galandromus annectens, six-spotted thrips, and green lacewings,
Chrysoperla species.</P>
<P>Galandromus species are an excellent choice for avocados, as these predatory
mites reproduce relatively fast in unsprayed orchards, with a new generation of
predators every one to two weeks.  These predators eat every life stage of
persea mite from egg to adult.  Each Galandromus female lays two to three dozen
eggs during its one month life span.  Both G. helveolus and G. annectens are
able to penetrate the dense white webbing in which persea mites hide even more
effectively than pesticides.  Penetrating this webbing is difficult for many of
the native predatory mites currently found in avocado orchards.</P> 
<P>Galandromus helveolus survives on other pests, such avocado brown mite and
six spotted mite, when there is no persea mite, making it an especially good
addition to orchards. Also, G. helveolus can help with biological control on
other crops, including citrus and grapes.</P>
<P>G. annectens survives on pollen when persea mite is scarce, but needs to eat
mites to reproduce.  G. helveolus reproduces faster. But G. annectens
overwinters better, survive temperature extremes better and survives better when
persea mite numbers are low.</P> 
<P>Recommended release rates for Galandromus species are a minimum of 100 per
tree or 5,000 per acre, beginning when persea mite activity is first noted. 
Releases may continue into a second or third season to ensure establishment over
the whole orchard. Galandromus spread very slowly, taking three months just to
colonize one tree in which they are released.  It can take over six months for
Galandromus to spread to neighboring trees.</P>
<P>Thus, for quickest predatory mite colonization of trees, make sure that each
tree is individually inoculated by releasing Galandromus directly onto avocado
leaves infested with persea mite.  Your PCA, consultant or Rincon-Vitova
Insectaries can supply more details on the best release techniques for
Galandromus.  Predator release technology is continually improving as we learn
more about mite ecology.</P>
<P>After Galandromus are released, practice IPM to avoid pesticide kills and
having to start over with releases.  Also, be aware that residues from previous
sprays are harmful to Galandromus.  If pesticides have been used or are
contemplated, Rincon-Vitova will be happy to share the latest information we
have on waiting periods for residues to disappear before making predator
releases for peresea mite and on predator reactions to various hard and soft
pesticides.</P>
<P>Rincon-Vitova Insectaries recommends high pressure water, rather than
pesticides, whenever possible, to knockdown persea mite numbers before releasing
predators.  It takes only 45 seconds in water for persea mites to drown, and in
their native Mexico summer rains naturally reduce persea mite populations.  In
contrast to persea mite's poor survival in water, some predatory mites are known
to survive in water by floating, though we have not yet tested Galandromus
survival in water.</P>
<P>In general, predatory mites are rather mysterious, with only a handful of
species even being known to science prior to the 1950s.  Predatory mites can be
particularly difficult to monitor and detect, particularly in tall trees like
mature avocados, where sampling is generally limited to those few leaves within
arm's reach.  Thus, months can go by in which biological control may be working
undetected on leaves not easily sampled.</P>
<P>Avocado is native to rainforests, and rainforest trees are noted for complex
insect ecologies.  Indeed, in rainforests different insect species may live at
different heights within the tree canopy.  Thus, a ground level person may only
be able to detect a small percentage of the insect species actually living in
the tree.  Complicating sampling and monitoring even more, predatory mites are
very mobile and hard to detect.  Mites and predators can move between tops,
middles and bottoms of trees, as well between exterior and interior leaves, and
on cycles that can be daily [e.g. AM/PM], weekly, monthly and seasonal.</P>
<P>Sometimes predatory mites survive at very low population levels, almost
undetectable, for long periods of time before suddenly exploding in massive
numbers and providing biological control.  Very few scientists study predatory
mites, so the reasons for this are poorly understood.  Thus, unlike pesticides,
where results may be clear and immediate, growers releasing predatory mites may
not get full feedback on successful establishment for several months or two to
three seasons.  This period of uncertainty during the transition and initial
establishment of biological control is, psychologically, the most difficult
period.</P> 
<P>Other Avocado Pests &amp; Natural Enemies</P>
<P>Green lacewing larvae are generalist predators, consuming greenhouse thrips,
aphids, small caterpillars and other orchard pests besides persea mite. 
Lacewing release methods and numbers vary from orchard to orchard, depending
upon terrain and other factors, and are best planned individually by talking
directly with Rincon-Vitova Insectaries, a consultant or PCA.</P>
<P>There are many intricacies in releasing lacewings, and Rincon-Vitova's
lacewing technical bulletin is recommended reading.  It is wise to map out
orchard ant activity, as ants eat lacewing eggs.  Thus, for some areas of the
orchard, lacewing larvae might be released rather than lacewing eggs to avoid
ants; and ant control measures might be used.</P>
<P>In general, lacewing recommended release rates are 10-15 hatching eggs or
2-10 larvae per tree.  The decision whether to spray on lacewings or hand place
lacewing egg cards in trees is also best discussed on a case by case basis with
Rincon-Vitova Insectaries, a PCA or consultant.</P>
<P>Even when mite populations are high in orchards, it is a good idea to have a
consultant or independent PCA check for natural enemies, viruses and other
pathogens.  Often, high mite populations are wiped out by natural enemies like
little black Stethorus lady beetles, which mostly migrate into orchards with
high mite populations.  Under certain weather conditions, high populations of
mites succumb to viruses that make them listless and stop feeding before the
high populations suddenly crash to near zero.</P>
<P>Thus, monitoring by a trained invididual can save a pesticide spray and
spare natural enemies like minute pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs, six-spotted thrips
[also sold commercially by Rincon-Vitova Insectaries], midge larvae and an array
of native predatory mites.  These beneficials and their progeny can then live to
provide many more seasons of free natural biological control as part of the
ecological natural enemy reservoir that builds up in unsprayed orchards.</P>
<P>It would cost thousands of dollars, and be economically prohibitive to
purchase the quantities of natural enemies building up on high mite populations.
 So, bringing in a professional for IPM advice during the crucial decision
points can be a profitable investment.</P>
<P>Rincon-Vitova Insectaries also raises a caterpillar/moth egg parasite,
Trichogramma platneri, which destroys eggs of Amorbia, the avocado leafroller,
and omnivorous looper, Sabulodes aegrotata. T. platneri is not meant to be a
standalone remedy.  Rather, T. platneri supplements existing natural enemies. 
As populations of T. platneri and other natural enemies, especially spiders,
increase during the season, the need for pesticides is eliminated in many
orchards.</P>
<P>Rincon-Vitova recommends releasing between 50,000 and 200,000 Trichogramma
platneri per acre over a several week period beginning with the first spring
flights of Amorbia and looper moths.  A PCA or consultant can help with
monitoring moth flights and ordering the appropriate number of T. platneri for
timely arrival each week coinciding with moth egg laying.  Rincon-Vitova can
also provide assistance developing T. platneri release strategies.</P>
<P>A few leaves chewed by Amorbia and loopers are not to be feared, as small
populations of these pests are life-sustaining food items to beneficial insects
providing natural biological pest control.  Ideally, T. platneri,green lacewings
and other natural enemies will provide the extra percentage of pest control
needed to augment existing orchard natural enemies and keep pest populations
below economic injury levels without pesticides and the pesticide treadmill
effect [which comes about when sprays kill natural enemies, unleashing pests
from biological control, and triggering the need for more sprays].</P> 
<P>Unsprayed orchards can grow populations of Tachinid flies, which along with
wasp parasites of caterpillars, such as Telenomous species, have been known to
kill 70% of looper caterpillars.  Add in some pest kill by Trichogramma
platneri, green lacewings and other natural enemies, and biological control can
be substantial enough to eliminate the need for sprays.</P>
<P>Greenhouse thrips, Heliothrips haemorrhoidalis, are a problem in some
orchards, particularly after mild winters. Thrips are controlled by a range of
predators, including green lacewings.  Since there are not native thrips
parasites in most orchards, Rincon-Vitova has been distributing Thripobius
semileuteus, a tiny wasp parasite of greenhouse thrips.  By expanding orchard
natural enemy biodiversity, Thripobius semileuteus should help shift the orchard
ecological balance from pests to beneficials.</P>
<P>Sustainability &amp; Ecology</P>
<P>Orchard ecology is complex, and Rincon-Vitova recommends sustainable farming
practices that favor beneficial insects building up their numbers in orchards. 
For example, since thrips pupate in the soil, soil building measures that
promote biological life in the soil result in more predators and pathogens
attacking thrips before they emerge from the soil.  Thus, building a living soil
with compost, mulches and cover crops means fewer thrips surviving in the soil
and flying into the trees.</P>
<P>The same soil building measures, such as composts, calcium and mulches, that
help against thrips may also help reduce Phytophthora root rot.  Being a
rainforest native, avocado is accustomed to soils with 20% organic matter in its
natural habitat.  One of the most successful avocado growers we know at
Rincon-Vitova has a thick mulch of fallen leaves, much like that found on the
rainforest floor, and rich healthy white feeder roots growing just beneath the
mulch surface.  The biological control in the trees and on the ground is
similarly impressive, ranging from rarely seen native predatory mites to
decollate snails and an abundance of caterpillar-eating spiders.</P> 
<P>Most years, this harmonious natural ecological balance and large reservoir
of natural enemies, which has not been sprayed in 25 years, does not even need
supplementation with additional natural enemies.  But that first year of not
spraying 25 years ago was the toughest by far, as the pest mite population was
very high.  The grower gritted his teeth and listened to the PCA, who said that
the mites were infected with a virus commonly found when mite populations get
high and the weather a bit humid.</P>
<P>Though hard to believe, the faith in the PCA proved accurate, and the only
sprays in the last 25 years have been micronutrients.</P>
<P>No one can promise similar results overnight, much less the first season. 
But getting through the tough early transition years on the path to sustainable
biological control is best done with support networks, like those provided by
working with Rincon-Vitova Insectaries, PCAs, consultants and other growers who
have already made the transition.</P>
<P>A Few Final Biocontrol Tips</P>
<P>Besides building soils and not spraying, there are a variety of ways that
the orchard habitat can be made more hospitable for natural enemy growth and
reproduction.  Ants sometimes &quot;farm&quot; pests like aphids, mealybugs and
other honeydew insects.  Black sooty mold growing on honeydew on the leaves and
trails of ants going up tree trunks tend to be a problem more near dusty roads
and orchard edges.  Ant control -- e.g. with registered baits; high pressure
water sprays to wash off pests sustaining the ants; disking ant nests in the
soil to check colony growth -- helps natural enemies control pests by
eliminating ant interference.</P>
<P>Providing food for natural enemies is another strategy promoting sustainable
biological pest control.  Flowering plants provide shade, dew, pollen, nectar
and alternate insect prey to beneficials capable of moving into trees and
providing biological pest control. In general, green lacewings like blooming
borders, particularly sunflowers.  Experiments on the best &quot;insectary
plants&quot; for growing beneficial insects are continuing, and there is no one
plant or group of plants that can be recommended for the whole state, any more
than one crop variety can be recommended for all regions.  Also, ways of
managing insectary and cover crops and border and pest break strips to grow more
beneficials are continually evolving.  For example, some growers cut strips of
insectary crops periodically to force beneficials out into the trees. 
Rincon-Vitova will be happy to share the latest knowledge on insectary crop
selection and management with callers.</P>
<P>Finally, keep in mind that avocados are used to the abundant moisture of
their native rainforest habitat when managing the crop.  Plants are already
stressed by low organic matter in most California soils.  So, make sure that
plants are properly fertilized and irrigated to better withstand insect and mite
populations, as well as root rot.  Adequate moisture and fertilizer also help
avocado trees outgrow summer pest damage.</P>

<BODY><H2>The Barn Owl (Tyto albq)</H2>
<P><A><IMG SRC="barnowl.gif"></A>The Barn Owl has nearly world-wide
distribution,being absent from only the high Latitudes.  It has been
introduced into some Pacific islands for rat control and is provided
nest boxes in  Malaysian palm nut groves for the same purpose.  While
the barn owl is found all over the US, its numbers are particularly high
in California and the Southwest.  Farmers and ranchers are increasingly
attracted to the barn owl's ability to control rodents better than
traps,poison,or cats and at no cost.</P>
<P>Barn owls in favorable habitats produce large broods once or twice a
year.  Each young owl as it nears maturity will eat the equivalent of a
dozen mice per night if such prey is available.  Adult barn owls kill
and consume the equivalent of one large rat or gopher per night.  The
Owl Rehabilitation Research Foundation,Ontario,Canada, reports that barn
owls consume twice as much food for their weight as other owls.</P>
<P>The number of barn owls in an area is limited by both prey base and
suitable nesting sites.  In the West,barn owls not only nest in natural
trees cavities and buildings, they also nest in cavities in cliffs and
cut banks,stacked hay bales,and in palm trees.  Use of these sites often
leads to nesting failure such as when bales are shifted or the young
outgrows the nest at the base of palm fronds.</P>
<P>This brochure offers several nest box designs that can be made from
off the shelf materials.  In addition, nest box designs that can be made
from off the shelf materials.  In addition, nest box designs for boxes
made from plywood and lumber can be found in a companion brochure, Using
Barn Owls for Rodent Control (209-369-8578) and in several other
publications: Woodworking for Wildlife, Minnesota Dept. of Natural
Resources World Aug 1991.</P>

<H1>How to Build Nest Boxes <I>from off -the Shelf Materials:</I></H1>
<P><A><IMG SRC="fig1owl.gif"></A><I><A HREF="fig1.gif">Fig 1.</A></I>A
large nest and daytime hide for barn owls made from a 55 gallon plastic
barrel that was used for juice concentrate.  Barrels used for petroleum
products should not be used.  This nest barrel has an angled side
entrance about 6 x 6 inches with a landing board.  A sunshade is
anchored with pipe standoffs to the top, and eye bolts are secured to
the sunshade.  There are ventilation and drain holes in the top and
bottom, respectively.  As nesting material, broken bark is generally
preferable to sawdust or shavings. Pine needles and leaves can also be
used.  Straw or hay, which support toxic fungus, should not be used. 
This owls will soon deposit a "felt" of regurgitated fur and bone
castings that will mix with the bark, etc.  Some recommend this debris
be cleaned out every year, but in the wild the owls build up thick
deposits with no ill effects, and its ammoniacal odor tends to repel
ants and flies.  Good ventilation is important both for cooling and odor
dissipation.</P>
<P><A><IMG SRC="fig2owl.gif"></A><I><A HREF="fig2.gif">fig2</A></I>Nest
barrel (fig. 1) shown proped and wired in place in liveoak tree.  An
open fight path to the entrance is desirable ,as is much shade as
possible.  Barn owls have nested twice in one season in another barrel
in a similar tree location at a ranch near Lake Casitas, California.  If
rope is used it should be UV resistant.  Galvanized wire will last for a
long time, as will the polyethelene barrels,  which are preferable to
steel barrels.  The latter are heavy overheat the owls in climatic
extremes.  Drain holes are essential, whichever type of barrel is used. 
A framed entrance hole can be provided in the barrel's end rather than
the side to optimize the flight path of a given site.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="fig3owl.gif"><A HREF="fig3owl.gif">fig3</A>  The nest
containers made from one plastic barrel.  These are large enough for
medium to large barn owl broods and are easy to install with eye bolts
in the 4 x 4 foot plywood lids.  Ventilation cuts are made in the top
edge of the plastic barrel, which is fastened to the plywood top with 4
inch deck screws set at an angle.  If the screws protrude through the
plywood strike the tips off with a hammer, and paint the top with a
white exterior latex.  The entrance hole is framed in with 1-inch wood
strips that "sandwich" the plastic.  Owls do not like to land on thin
thresholds.  A screened drain is provided in the bottom, which is
covered with broken bark and pine needles.  Barn owl nest containers
should be installed at least 12 feet above the ground in an area with no
human or vehicular disturbance below the nest if possible.  Owls will
use nest facilites in areas of disturbance if the containers are 30 feet
or more above the noise and they have some period of minimal disturbance
in which to "bond" to the nest container.  Barn owls are very sensitive
to intrusion during a critical period of brood development that extends
from 1 week before hatching to 2 weeks after, during which time they 
will destroy the young and abandon the nest.  In the early stages of
incubation, they may abandon the eggs if disturbed during daylight. 
Best course of action is to enjoy observing the owls in the evening but
do not intrude.</P>
<P><A HREF="fig4owl.gif">fig4</A><A><IMG SRC="fig4owl.gif"></A> 
Nest container made from a large-size enclosed cat litter box readily
obtainable in any pet store.  This one has a plywood sunshade mounted
with 1" pieces of water hose as standoffs thorough which eyebolts will
be used to anchor box in tree or building.  A wood front and landing
board have been provided, as well as drain holes.  There is a
factory-made ventilation opening in the top, as well as latches that
hold the bottom and top together.  The nesting material (bark) can be
readily  cleaned out by unlatching the bottom, but this should be an
infrequent operation best conducted after the nesting season in late
fall and early winter.  Barn owls can nest any month of the year in
California and use the nest boxes for shelter when they are not raising
young.  If you can avoid sitting nest container in the full sun do so.
The full heat of the summer's sun may force barn owls to abandon a nest.</P>
<P><A><IMG SRC="fig5owl.gif"></A><A HREF="fig5owl.gif">fig 5</A>
This is the nest box design described in <I>Using Barn Owls for Rodent
Control,</I>on a 4 x 4 inch post set 4 feet into the ground with 12 feet
elevation.  This design has landing dowels inside and outside the box, a
sunshade top and bock, and a clean out panel.  It has been successfully
used in the opening California vineyards such as this, but should be
placed under trees if available.  Barn owls will travel several miles
from nests and roosts to their hunting grounds. Off-center placement of
entrance provides more protection for the owls from attack by crows,
ravens, hawks and great horned owls.</P>
<P><A><IMG SRC="fig6owl.gif"></A><A HREF="fig6owl.gif">fig 6</A>This
is a large barn owl nest box that can be cut from one sheet of 1/2-inch
plywood.  It is for installation inside a barn,with the 6-inch entrance
hole cut through the barn's side.  The nest box can be screwed into the
side of the barn and into a beam if available.  Its weight can also be
suspended from diagonal wires fastened to the barn wall if no beam is
available for the bottom to rest on.  This in many ways is the ideal
barn owl house if it can be placed in an area of low disturbance.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="fig7owl.gif"> <A HREF="fig7owl.gif">fig 7</A> A barn owl

<BODY><H3>ARTIFICIAL PERCHES FOR RAPTORS </H3>
<P><A HREF="perches.gif">Plans and instructions<IMG SRC="perches.gif"></A>
United States Department of Agriculture  ^ Soil ( 5 Conservation 
Service  Davis, CA 95616 Encourage Raptors In Your Area for More
Efficient Rodent control.   Raptors are birds of prey that are greatly
beneficial in the control of rodents. A small,  one-time investment in
artificial perches can help increase their presence in your area, 
reducing the need for other methods of pest control.  </P>
<P>By providing strategically-located vantage points to these
sharp-sighted birds,  artificial perches can improve the hunting
efficiency of raptors, helping to eliminate  rodent pests. These perches
can be especially valuable in the winter and early spring,  before the
primary rodent breeding season and when many crops are either absent  or
provide little cover.   While we are not familiar with: any studies of
the impact of artificial perches on rodent  population, it would clearly
as beneficial to your raptor population if artificial perctles  make it
easier for them to spot prey and help them use less energy to hunt. 
</P>
<P>Perch Sites  You can encourage more raptors to hunt rodents in your
area by establishing artificial  perch sites.   Raptors hunt in open
areas such as mowed alfalfa fields, golf courses, along roadsides, 
ditch banks, rural school grounds and meadows. Any of these areas are
good  potential perch sites.  </P>
<P>
Important Points to Consider  All perches should be placed with their
horizontal axis pointing east-west to avoid  instability due to wind
direction and changing visibility due to sun and moonlight.   411 SCS
programs and services are offered on a non-di~i~;~ z  Artificial perches
are readily accepted by many resident raptors, including American 
kestrels, barn owls, great horned owls, burrowing owls, short-eared
owls, redtail and  red-shouldered hawks and white-tailed kites.  </P>
<P>
  Perches can be erected any time of year. The acceptance and use of the
perches by  raptors Indicate that perches may prove useful as a
management tool for raptors.  <BR> Building a Perch  Artificial perches
are easy to build. The ideal material is 3/4" galvanized steel pipe, 18'
 long. Set the pipe about 3 feet deep in the ground with an 18' :; 2" x
2" rounded edge  block of pine or redwood as the perch.   Or, you can
weld a 1 1/2" to 2" x 18" piece of galvanized steel pipe across the top
of  the vertical support. <BR>  Remember to place the perch running
east-west, longways.   Job sheet compiled by Patrick J. Burfse, (Soil
Conservation Service, Escondido) from a  research paper, ~Raptor Use of

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Fruits the Year Round</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><A><EM>Taken from California Rare Fruit Growers:Volume 8 Number
1 February,1976  :::::::Fruits The Year Around:::::::  Paul H. Thomson</EM>
<B>one of the CRFG 's founders
</B>  In February 1952 this piece of Bonsall real estate was purchased.
At that time it was under a 3 year lease for farming. They were good
farmers and filled and leveled the land,made contour furrows so the soil
would not erode and plowed the weeds and crop residues back into the
soil to provide some humus for the next crop.  After plowing the soil
was disced up and down hill, cross ways and then diagonally so they
almost were out the soil.  The organic matter was pulverized and exposed
to the elements so it oxidixed to the point where it simply disappered
leaving a seedbed of almost pure mineral granitic soil. Here was planted
the crop for that season, irrigated copiously and heavily fertilized
with chemicals.  Large crops of vegetables and fruits were produced that
looked beautiful and sold like the proverbial hot cakes, but had about
as much flavor as chewing on a peace of paper.  Each year it was
necessary to add more chemicals to get the same results in their
intensive cropping of two crops a year.  By the end of the third year
the last crop planted wasn't growing very well so it was reasoned that
there was not enough fertilizer so more was added.   The poor plants
couldn't take it.  They turned yellow for a while and finally died. They
gambled and lost on that last crop. The following winter was a wet  one
and every seed that had failed to germinate for the last 3 years must
have germinated. <BR> The excessive amount of fertilizer caused the
weeds to grow rampant.  Mustard grew 8' tall with stems 1 1/2" thick;
malva was 5' tall and 1" thick and other weeds grew in similar gigantic
proportions.  A heavy set of discs run over the field failed to do more
than barely knock the weeds down, so dense was the growth. The next year
was a different story.  All the fertilizer had been used up and the next
crop of weeds were quite stunted and sick looking with the spots of thin
soil having no weed cover to speak of.
<BR>And so it continued for the next 15yr. until gradually native
legumes and grasses finally gained a foothold and restored the soil to a
healthy condition. Around the edges of the cultivated fields were
gullies 4' to 8' deep which were filled and trees planted to hold the
soil.  As the trees grew nesting places were provided for the birds and
now large flocks annually migrate here and clean the bushes and trees of
any excess fruit.  The first few years different types of scale insects
were a problem but now the tiny birds keep the trees clean so there is
no scale buildup.  Weeds have been mowed to provide a cover of humus and
today a visitor to the pLace may remark as to how springy the soil is as
they walk upon it.  No pesticides,sprays or chemical fertilizers have
been used and nature's is being restored. There has been a steady
progression in the weed cover from the broad leafed weeds at first to
the present dominance of the grasses.  Where formerly it was very
difficult to get young seedlings started now they spring up voluntarily,
sown by the birds and nurtured by the layer of humus on top the soil. 
<BR>Twenty years ago it was necessary to use a pick and crowbar to dig
holes in which to plant trees,now it is easier to dig a hole in dry
ground than in wet ground before, and in damp ground holes can be dug
quickly and easily.  Earthworms have appeared in substantial
numbers,adding to the fertility of the soil as they tunnel through it
and leave their castings. So what?  What does this have to do with
growing Rare Fruits?  Perhaps a whole lot and on the other hand maybe
very little.
<B>One of the chief   joys of growing fruit is to be able to wander at
will and pick tree ripened fruit of high quality and delicious flavor
and eat it on the spot.  No worries as to whether it has been sprayed
and therefore must be washed first or if it has been long enough since
it was sprayed for the residue to be gone so it can be safely eaten. 
</B>Maybe they aren't as big and beautiful as the "puffed up " fruits
you buy in the market but they sure have a much finer flavor.  Of course
there may be some bird pecks to mar the surface of the fruit, and you
will lose a certain amount to our furry and feathered friends but they
have to live too.  And if you ever want to determine just which are the
finest fruits, watch which ones the birds eat and invariably that will
be the one.  It may not be the biggest or most colorful but it will have
the best quality.  When the best is gone only then will they eat the
fruit of inferior quality.  <BR>After savoring the fruits of my labor
for a short time during the summer and early fall I decided it sure
would be nice to have some kind of tasty fruit to pick and eat
throughout the year instead of only part of the year when there was a
glut of fruits and since the stomach is only so large could not do
justice to the quantity.  To do this successfully does present some
problems.  Tropical fruits such as mango,cherimoya,tropical guava,lychee
and longan bear their crops during the late fall and winter for the most
part and some years carry fruit into early spring.  These fruits were
selectied as they filled the gap after the fall fruits were gone.  The
problem was that at best these tropicals are rather marginal here in
southern California and needed a much warmer location in which to grow
than is found here on the home place in Bonsall where winter frost is
the rule rather than the exception.  Freezing temperatures occur as
early as 4 november and as late as 16 April with the first frost
averaging 16 November and the last frost averaging the end of February. 
the coldest period is from mid-December to mid-January with severe
frosts occurring around Christmas and New Years. <BR> After several
years of searching a location in Vista was found where the frost hazard
is very low as there were several bearing mango trees on the property
which were estimated to be around 60 or more years old.  The coldest
temperature since I have owned the property occurred on 13 January 1963
when it dipped briefly to 28* F and froze the mango trees back to 3/4 "
limbs on the lowest parts of the trees.<BR>  This "Edgehill" property
in Vista lies at an elevation of about 775' or 500' higher than the
Bonsall location.  The air drainage is good and mangos can be grwon at
the top of the slop and guavas,lyches,longans and cherimoyas on down the
hill in that order. These trees were planted in April 1963 after the
freeze and most years have suffered little damage.  Only 4 or 5 nights
have dropped to 30*F since the 1963 freeze and in 1968 some 125 young
mango trees were killed outright, one longan was killed and three others
damaged, and one guava was severely frozen, all at 30* at the top of the
hill.  Estimated temperatures were the longan was killed and the guava
damaged were 26* and 27* F respectively.  Lychees have never sufferd any
damaged as they were planted higher on the slop than the longans.
Several cherimoyas at the bottom of the planting were frozen back. These
were grafted to the hardy variety 'Spain' and since that time have
received no damgage.  During the 1968 freeze 4 mango trees survived at
the lower end of the planting.  One had no damage whatsoever at an
estimated 26* F while the other 3 were only lightly jdamaged.  Some 5 or
6 mangos that were frozen to the ground put up growth from the roots the
next spring and as the next winter was mild one came through without any
damage.  In June 1970 these tender trees were cut off at ground level,
the soil removed to a 3" depth and grafted with scions of the hardiest
mango.  They all grew the next winter the soil was mounded up around the
graft union.  Since that time the trees have grown well at no time have
they had any cold damage.  The idea is to get a hardy interstock near
the ground where the cold air settles and once it is 18"  to 24" tall
graft it ot the variety of choice which may be too tender to grow if
grafted low in the usual manner but which will survive and grow when
grafted on the hardy interstock 24" above ground level. This idea has
not been thoroughly tested as yet since two of the trees with this
combination were lost to gophers and the others have never been grafted.
I believe this method will permit mangos to be grown in areas normally
too cold for the mango In winter but were summer temperatures are ware
enough to successfully set and mature fruit. <BR>To get back to the
main subject, here is a list of the fruits I am growing on the two
places and their season of maturity.  Where listed in two or more colums
the early varieties mature in the first column and late varieties extend
the season to the next column.<BR>  <STRONG>January-March
=Casrissa,Cherimoya,Guava, Longan,Mango,Sapote(white),Casimiroa  edulis
</STRONG><BR> <STRONG>April-June= Apricot Capulin
cherry,Carissa,Cherimoya,Cherry of the Rio Grande 
Guava,Loquat,Mulberry,Peach,Plum,Sapote(white)</STRONG>
<BR> <STRONG>July-September = Almond, Apricot, Blueberry, Capulin
Cherry, Carob, Che,  Cherry of the Rio Grande, Green Sapote, Jujube,
Loquat, Lychee,  Mulberry(black), Opuntia cactus,Peach, Plum, Quince,

Carob,Che,jujube,Longan, Macadamia,  Mango,Opuntia cactus,
Pdistachio,Sapote(white),Walnut.    </STRONG><BR>  As can be seen you
can not only have a fruit but most of the time a  choice of fruits and
nuts.  Not all can be eaten fresh from the tree.  Many  must be picked
and ripened off the tree to be edible.  Anyway it's great   to have
Fruits The Year Around.</A>

<P><EM>Quotes from Understanding the Soil Processes</EM></P>
<P>Most of us will agree that the soil is the major natural resource
available to mankind.  Yet it is and has been abused by us to the point
of self destruction.  Many past civilizations have perished due to their
abuse of the soil (like Mesopotamia and the Mayan civilization). </P>
<P>Why didn't anyone stop the destruction?  The soil destruction
process takes time and the changes in each generation are "small" so no
one cared-and most of us still don't.</P>
<P>The soil in which we plant crops today has been self perpetuating
for millions of years without man's help.  It will continue to do so if
we do not disturb its natural cycle.</P>
<P>In the soil there are nutrients and trace elements both of which
plants require for growth.  They are essential.</P>
<P>Soil moves continually in a natural cycle aided by oxygen, water,
minerals and decomposing animal and plant matter.  These elements create
life in the soil, which is ongoing if not disturbed.  We speak of
healthy soil if it works well and nutrients continue to be available to
the plant.</P>
<P>Good soil consists of 93% mineral and 7% bio organic substances. 
The bio organic parts are 85% humus,10% roots, and 5% edaphon.</P>
<P>Edaphon is itself a "world" of life and consists of microbes, fungi,
bacteria, earthworms, micro fauna, and macro fanuna as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The Edaphon consists of:</LI>
<LI>fungi/algae .........................40%</LI>
<LI>bacteria/actinomycetes.....40%</LI>
<LI><A HREF="worms.html">Earthworms</A>.........................12%</LI>
<LI>Macrofauna........................   5%</LI>
<LI>micro/mesofauna...............    3%</LI></UL>
<P>Some of the nutrients get lost naturally through leaching
continually wet weather, melting snow, flooding or through
denitrification.  Also each cultivated plant takes nutrients from the
soil, as soon as the crops are harvested.</P>
<P>The substantial task of the farmer is to take care of returning
nutrients taken from the soil through harvesting.  The conventional
farmer is using water soluble, mostly salty chemical fertilizers.</P>
<P>In contrast, the bio-organic farmer uses organic matter in the form
of crop residues, and other wastes, and /or compost and BTR, in order to
take of soil life, its proliferation and stimulation to highest
effectivity.</P>
<P>With this treatment and approach, the bio farming system should
bring out the following:  Stronger nutrient accumulation and nitrogen
fixation. Availability of soil nutrients to plants.</P>
<H1>Humus</H1>
<P>The natural life cycle of out fields must be kept functional through
the addition of organic matter after the residues from the previous crop
have been depleted in order to build new Bio-Organo-Mineral nutrition
for our next crop.  This action connot be replaced with the water
soluble salts or overdoses of chemical fertilizer which destroy soil
life, not build it.</P>
<P>During the growing season, as the plants fix carbon dioxide by
photosyntheses, about 10-25% of this fixed carbon,finds its way back to
the soil through the roots (root exudates) this is even if all residues
including roots are removed. This is very important in bio-organic
farming.</P>
<P>The production of humus is a complex process.  In general cyclic
substances like phenol groups and also other like organic acids and
vitamins (humus is also related to crude oil) are polymerized with help
of enzymes,like phenol oxidase.  These cyclic compounds are both from
plant parts(like lignin) and are also produced by the microorganisms. 
Mostly fungi, actinomycetes (Streptomycets) seem to be responsible for
humus formation.  Aspergillus, Pisolithus, Rhizoctonia, Streptomycets
are only but a few examples of microorganisms actually capable of
synthesizing cyclic(aromatic) compounds and form them into humus from
non-cyclic materials.</P>
<P><B>It is impossible for man to produce stable humus synthetically. 
Man can properly cultivate the field, supply organic matter and so
encourage the development of stable humus in the soil. Soil with stable
humus must always be protected to maintain the fertility and
productivity of the soil.   
</B></P>
<P><EM>The production and maintenance of stable humus in the soil
should be the primary goal of every farmer.  Good stewardship of the
land is necessary to protect and maintain mankinds most important asset,
fertile soil.</EM></P>
<P>For nearly one hundred years soil science in most schools of higher
learning (especially in agricultural colleges) has been primarily
concerned with the physical and mechanical aspects of soil structure.
Biological thinking has become a major concern only in the last few
years.</P>
<P>The new approach considers not only the physical properties and
mineral structure of the soil,but also the process by which organic
matter is transformed into humus by microorganisms.
</P>
<H1>Organic Transformation</H1>  
<H3>[HUMIFICATION]</H3>
<P>Humification, the transformation of organic matter into humus, is a
fascinating process.  Organic materials such as manure or field wastes
,when disked into the upper three to six inches of topsoil, will undergo
several changes.  The humification process involves first catabolism ,
then anabolism.  These are not truly correct terms as they are usually
used for same functions within living organisms, but we may consider
soil as one living organism.
</P>
<P><B>Catabolism</B></P>
<P>The first stage in the break down process is important to be started
by fungi, these make the debris "pre-digested" for many animals in the
macro and mesofauna. Many of these animals lack needed enzymes for the
start of the decomposition process (springtails, millipeds, earthworms,
etc.) The debris is fragmented into smaller parts and chemical changes
occur in breaking up of cellulose, chitin, etc.
</P>
<P>Most plant parts already contain fungi within(seed,leafs,stems all
are inhabited by fungi): these are going to start the decomposition
process.  Many fungi residing within seeds are known and seeds (or plant
parts )carry only certain fungi, that will actually start the
decomposition process (sometimes they also carry pathogens.)</P> 
<P>If bacteria start the decompostion process instead of fungi, this
may happen because of several reasons,  the one most common  would be
water logging (too moist),  the process turns to putrefaction.  During
this stage toxic substances are produced (methane, formaldehyde,
hydrogen sulfide, phosphine) which are harmful to soil and retard the
growth of plants. </P>
<P>Please do not misunderstand-bacteria and fungi are decomposing all
at the same time,we mean predominance of one over the other not that the
other is not involved at all.</P>
<P>The excrements of the neso and macrofauna are a very suitable medium
for growth of bacteria, algae, and nematodes.  These multiply rapidly
and again draw the mesofauna, as it feeds on the bacteria.  Many new
animals are involved in this stage, some are the same as in the first
decomposition.</P>
<P>Slowly the materials are broken into smaller parts, at the same time
many are again combined and used for building hormones, enzymes,
proteins for the rapidly multiplying microfuna.  Antibiotics are
produced to secure an area for growth, form other  microorganisms.</P>
<P>Carbon dioxide is evolved back to the atmosphere and only about
20-30% <B> of carbon originally found in the plant parts makes it to
humic complexes.</B>In case of carbohydrates as starting point the
carbon percentage that makes it to humus is less than 20%.  If the
starting point is lignin, tannins, or other phenolic groupings (mostly
found in wood and leaves) the percentage may reach 75%.</P>
<P>Mineralization is the process of freeing minerals from organic
molecules (carbon bonds).  During humification there are two possible
end products for atoms within the starting molecules.  Minerals may
either be build  up stable humus or be in free form, carbon either tied
within humus or evolve in form of carbon dioxide.  The following is a
summarizing table where atoms end up after humification:</P>
<DL>
<DT>All minerals within organic compounds</DT>
<DD>80% freed up and 20% in humus</DD>
<DT>Carbon from carbohydrates</DT>
<DD>80% evolves as carbon dioxide and 20% goes to humus formation.</DD>
<DT>Carbon from lignin, aromatic type amino acids (tyrosine,
tryptophan...) and like compounds (fats, hydrocarbons like waxes,...)</DT>
<DD>25% evolves as carbon dioxide and 75% goes to humus formation</DD>
<DT>Nitrogen </DT>
<DD>will remain to 50% in humic form.</DD></DL>
<P>The micro, meso, and macrofauna is so closely interwoven that one
could say, if areas have small amounts of earthworms, beetles, etc. the
microbial population will be small.</P>
<P><B>Anabolism</B></P>
<P>The second half of soil metabolism-anabolism now begins, starting
with the synthesis of soil plasma.  It is in this process of plasmolysis
that the catabolized organic matter becomes plasma building material for
new plant life.  This is the least understood of all the processes that
go on in the soil.</P>
<P>Soil plasma is the liquid portion of the soil.  It contains
proteins, salts, degraded organic compounds and water.  It is like the
liquid part of the blood which, although without corpuscles , is much
more than water.</P>
<P>Soil plasma is that substance in the soil that can spin catabolized
remnants of former life into vital threads that are woven together into
the fabric of new life through the processes of anabolism.</P>
<P>In the anabolism process the plasma is transformed into stabel
humus.  This plasma also contains the decomposed cell walls of organic
residues and has become a spongy, gelatinous substance that bonds the
surface of the clay crystals together.  In this manner, clusters of clay
crystals form aggregates that are resistant to being broken apart.  This
gives the soil the ideal structure farmers refer to as tilth.  The
combination of plasma and clay forms what is known as stable humus.</P>
<P>The presence of stable humus allows air, water and essential mineral
nutrients to be held in the aggregates.  The chemical nutrients are in
the form of ions-atoms carring positive or negative electrical charges .
 In science, they are referred to as swarm ions.</P>
<P>The spongier the soil the more pores or open spaces are within it. 
Like Swiss cheese reduced to an infinitesimal scale, each of these holes
or pores has an inner surface that is coated with plasma.  The greater
the porosity of the soil the more capacity it has to accumulate and hold
air, water and nutrients and prevent them from being washed away.</P>
<P>Consequently, we can imagine that a loss of this porosity with all
its inner surfaces represents a catastrophe to the soil.  With the loss
of stable humus, the mineral particles of the soil come together almost
like concrete.  The porosity is lost and with it the ability of the soil
to retain air, water and nutrients.  As this capacity diminishes , the
fertility of the soil is reduced and productivity declines.</P>
<P>When we have stable humus,we have all the ideal conditions we are
seeking for our soils. We have the inner protected porosity, the glued
together clay crystals coated with plasma containing the decomposed
organic matter holding air, water and chemical nutrients-swarm ions.</P>
<P>In this ideal environment the third phase of stable humus, plant
feeder roots develop.  It is here the dormant power and original
resource of soil fertility comes to life.  This is the secret of
rebuilding the energy and fertility of "Mother Earth".</P>
<P>Here the living matter, which was originally buried in the soil to
decay, celebrates the birth of new life; the re-births of organic matter
for germinating and growing plants</P>
<P>Stable humus, the so desired, ideal stage of fertile soil, could be
considered the connectiong link or connector of life. Here decomposition
ends the last stage of death:and new life begins.  Through this
process,we can understand the fertility of the soil depends on the
ability of Nature to create living,organic order from inorganic
disorder.</P>
<P>Many farmers are imprisoned in a way of thinking that is only
concerned with levels of chemical fertilizers and must be re-educated to
 begin considering the biological processes occurring within the soil. 
Balanced soil fertility is a condition which cannot be measured by
chemical or physical tests.  The farmer who strives to maintain the
bio-organo-mineral complex in correct balance in his fields can achieve
the hightest agricultural production levels as a result of these
biological processes.</P>
<P><B>Today's popular chemical tests of soil do not tell anything
about the decisive life processes.  They are merely a yardstick of the
mineral content of the soil and do not help farmers in knowing how to
treat the fields for future productivity and healthy corps.  The whole
process misses the basic point that the true purpose of agriculture is
to recycle life to capture the life factor from decomposing organic
material and channel it into new growing plants.  It is only by doing
this that vital healthier life can be maintained in plant, animal and
man.</B></P>
<P>When the farmer decides to begin a biologically balanced fertility
program, soil analyses show minimal values of nutrient reserves and
indicate that large amount of fertilizers should be applied to meet the
needs of the crop.  However, after a few years of successful biological
farming, analyses can show high residual levels of available nutrients,
although the farmer has not used any chemical fertilizers during that
time.</P>
<P>The absurdity of conventional chemical thinking is revealed in the
mistaken notion that larger quantities of nutrients will continue to
result from the aid of chemical fertilizers.  But the truth is ,that by
the activity of microbes, the nutrients are biologically enriched,
accumulate in the pores of the soil aggregates as swarm ions, and will
become available to the growing plants. The farmer who implements the
balanced fertility program can achieve needed levels of nutrients in the
soil in a less expensive way, can achieve the highest possible yields,
and a higher quality harvest.  By using the wrong fertilizers, excessive
chemicals and heavy machinery we are destroying our soil, our filds, our
farms and our future.</P>
<P>Plants supplied with this kind of nutrient require less water.  This
assures the biological farmer a significant saving of water in the
production of crops, an especially important consideration in arid zones
and in dry seasons elsewhere.</P>
<P>We cannot outwit Nature.  Nature does not allow a wasting or loss of
living matter in the restless process of mineralization the procedure
for impregnating the soil solution with the mineral elements required
for plant growth.  In the final stage of decomposition the remmants of
plasma still contain the essential elements of the life processes. 
These remnants are then transformed into soil plasma in the process of
producing stable humus.  </P>
<P><B>Stable humus is the crucial center, the focal point of the life
cycle.  Adhering to farming practices that assure the production of
stable humus thus becomes the farmer's main objective.</B></P>
<H2>V. soil fertility</H2>
<P>Over 130 years ago (1855) Justus von Liebig's discovery that plants
are fed by water soluble substances started a revolution in agriculture.</P>
<P>However this revolution went in a different direction far from the
original thinking of von Liebig.</P>
<P>Von Liebig's discovery reads:</P>
<H5>"Plants take up water soluble nutrients"</H5>
<P>This discoveries became internationally understood, but
unfortunately, a single word has been added to the Liebig statement and
his sentence and the meaning changed as follows:</P>
<H6>"Plants take up water soluble nutrients only"</H6>
<P>There is a great difference between his original statement and his
interpretation by the addition of the single word "only".
</P>
<P>The single addition changed the truth of his discovery.  First to
recognize the important misunderstanding was von Liebig himself. 
However, the huge agro-chemical industry built their fort based on the
word "only".</P>
<P>Science neglected his best discoveries and findings which are as
follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Man must regard nature as one unit, a whole and everything that
occurs in nature works together as knots in a net</LI>
<LI>Diseases of plants are diseases of the soil.</LI>
<LI>We must treat the prime origin of the disease, not the symptom</LI></OL>
<P>It is important to understand that if the soil is living and
healthy, the plants  will be strong and healthy with natural resistance
against disease.  This opinion is the basic pillar of organic biological
farming.</P>
<P>Fertilizer facilities prospered and became firmly established as the
bass of a huge, new agro-industry.</P>
<P><EM>Ammonia taken up by plants is utilized directly, but nitrates
have to be converted to ammonia within the plant to be utilized.  In
addition the production of ammonia from nitrates within plants is only
on a as needed basis; therefore if soil  is high in nitrates that are
taken up by the plant in higher amounts than needed they will not be
formed into ammonia, but will sty in nitrate form and this is toxic to
animals ( carcinogenic compounds may be easily created under certain
cooking conditions.)</EM></P>
<P>Liebig actually discovered that plants take up solutes, these are
dissolved substances.  Well dissolved substances is a very broad
statement, it does not mean in water only.  Many things can be dissolved
in substances other than water yet are not water soluble.  The actual
meaning of solutes in the biological sense is that the molecules are in
fluid state, independent of each other, there may or may not be other
substances present (solubilizing agents , like water)  The word
dissolved means broken up into molecules, or ions in salts.  This is
what the agro-chemical changed "Only ions are taken up"  But ions are
not the only solutes, nor does the wording solutes necessarily imply a
solubilizing agents(like water) is present.  The molecules only have to
be disassociated to be solutes.</P>
<P>Good soil is a world of working microbes.  One gram of soil can
contain over ten million bacteria.  "Around the roots of a healthy
growing plant a dense coating of microbes may contain a population of
from 100 to 200 billion microbes. The life span of a single microbe in
this environment is approximately one half hour.
</P>
<P>Microbes live in colonies and are very mobile. In their rapid life
cycle from creation to death they develop tremendous metabolic activity
and steadily improve the structure of the soil.</P>
<P>Some microbes excrete antibiotics.  They metabolize phosphorus and
iron bonds which are difficult to dilute efficiently without this
microbial activity.  The earthy odor of the soil is due to them.  They
create two thirds of the soil  carbons, attack cellulose and mineralize
nutrients.</P>
<P>We have another important grouping of life in  the soil.  These are
mites, nematodes, centipeds,worms,and insects. All preying on or eating
plant and animal residues, eating each other, producing dung and other
excrements. As death they leave important waste.  They work on stages in
the formation of humus in the soil.</P>

<P>One thing organic farmers can add is water. When ever I see something wrong
with a plant or a tree I look to irrigation. A lot of people add chemicals
because a plant looks bad when it was a irrigation problem all the while.
Organic farmers have to make sure the land doesn't dry out or get to wet because
we have a living soil. Too wet or too dry can throw off the balance of life. I
like to keep my soil just the way I think an earthworm would like it. You got to
water different when you farm organic because your keeping not just the trees
and the plants alive but the soil alive as well.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>What is a Weed?</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><P><EM>Date: Sun, 4 Dec 1994 16:56:41 -0800 From: Brian Baker  
WHAT IS A WEED? 
</EM></P>
<P>Thought I'd try to break a few threads and seek clarification on
something that has led to several meandering conversations where it
appears to me you have different perceptions of the same problem.
Looking at the various posts by (in alpha order) Aquilla, Benbrook,
Hoogheem, Hovermale, Meade and Schettino, among others, on herbicides in
water, nutrient mining crops, and tillage systems appear to differ on
perceptions on what role weeds play in farming systems. I'd like to ask
a fundamental question--What is a weed?--and challenge you SANetters to
work toward a more sophisticated view of weeds in farming systems. My
apologies for making this so long.  _Weeds Conserve Soil_ in some
farming systems, having something fill that niche may be far better than
nothing. The exchange between Tracy and Sal illustrates this. While
no-till might conserve soil in the corn belt, heavy use of herbicides in
orchards on the steep slopes in Sal's area has led to serious erosion,
even in no-till systems.</P>
<P>Another place where this is a serious problem is the humid tropics.
During the Hawaiian rainy season, I watched soil washed down the slope
of a coffee and macadamia nut grove that was no-till but kept free of
weeds by herbicides. In a semi-arid subtropical perennial system, like
Sal's farm, an understory is needed to keep the soil from washing away
when the rains finally come after a long dry season. Someone who is
criticizing Sal's observation from the perspective that the whole world
grows corn and soybeans misses his point. But even in the semi-humid to
humid temperate zones that characterize most of the US east of the 100th
parallel, one should consider and critically evaluate the role weeds and
tillage systems play at conserving resources. 
</P>
<P>Most organic farmers that I know don't even own a moldboard plow.
While tools differ from soil to soil, and even season to season, most
will use cultivation implements like chisels, rippers, disks, rotary
hoes, spaders, as well as tool-bar devices like sweeps and shovels. A
few of the more adventurous row-croppers are working with permanent beds
with buried drip irrigation, following the Sundance (Arizona) system.
Sundance still uses herbicides, but have found that their rates have
been greatly diminished with a permanent bed with minimal disturbance,
and improved water control. Others have eliminated herbicides entirely.
One can argue whether the use of any or all of these tools are minimal
till. Not only do they suppressing weeds at a critical time, but also
aerate the soil and allow soil preparation for annual crops.  
</P>
<P> _Weeds Conserve Water_ In arid, semi-arid and Mediterranean
climates, where water conservation is arguably a more serious and
persistant challenge than soil conservation, weeds play a role in
helping water penetration, storage and shade, conserving soil moisture
that matches or outweighs water competition. Savory covers this in
rangeland management systems. Tap-rooted plants create macropores as
their mass slowly decomposes. These pores are destroyed by tillage, but
herbicides in a no-till system can prevent the tap-rooted of these
plants from ever forming. The result, especially in sun-baked alkali
conditions is a hard cap that prevents water from penetrating. Water
puddles on the surface, rather than penetrates, and thus is evaporated
rather than stored and made available to the crop. Ralph Jurgens of New
Era Farm Services in Tulare has two photos of walnut orchards following
a rain, one with bare ground the other with a ground cover.  </P>
<P>_No-till doesn't mean Herbicides_ While most vineyards still
french-plow, an increasing number of orchards have found that no-till
without herbicides works best. A well-managed ground cover plays several
important roles that bare soil can't match. To review: legumes fix
nitrogen; these and other crops can <A HREF="weeds2.html">"mine"</A>
other nutrients unavailable to the tree's root system; flowers attract
beneficial insects; roots hold soil in place; increased organic matter
increases water field capacity; chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and stores
energy, while bare soil reflects it, causing sunburn; plants moderate
both high and low temperatures. During the 1990 frost, weed scientists
predicted that organic citrus and avocado groves would be damaged worse
because the groud cover would raise the frostline. Instead, the ground
cover moderated the day- and night-time swings in temperature, saving
both fruit and whole trees. It was a disaster either way, but organic
farmers didn't seem to have to replant as many trees, and certainly
weren't any worse off, as weed scientists thought they'd be. 
</P>
<P>I know that this might be focusing too much on perennial crops, but
growers are also using no-till without herbicides in field and row
crops. Lundbergs, for example, have been experimenting with no-till rice
without herbicides, and have made some progress.   _No-Till Isn't Always
Environmentally Sound_ The San Joaquin Valley has a mandatory plow-down
for cotton to maintain a host-free period for pink bollworm and boll
weevil control. The program has been very successful, but recall a few
years ago, before the end of the drought, a dust-storm came and kicked
up enough dust to cause a major pile-up on I-5, the main artery between
LA & SF. Plow-down was generally acknowledged to be the culprit. More
rotation into winter small grains and hay, with buffer strips of alfalfa
(used for lygus control as well as for erosion) would have helped, trees
planted as windbreaks even moreso, but choosing between no-till or no
pink bollworm and no boll weevil is a trade-off California farmers have
chosen to make in favor of plow-down, which IMHO was the far lesser of
two evils. 
</P>
<P>_Toward a New Weed Science_ A stone-fruit and grape grower who still
uses herbicides on johnsongrass once told me a story about weed science.
He found an interesting-looking plant in his peach grove, and called
extension to have them come out and identify it. They knew what it was,
and immediately told him of about 20 herbicides he could use to kill it.
But he didn't really want to kill it without first knowing, Why was it
there? What was it doing? Was it competing? Would it attract beneficial
insects? What kind of organisms co-exist within its root system? Are
these organisms beneficial, pathogenic or neither? These questions the
weed scientists could not answer, so the plant lived, with no apparent
deleterious effect on the orchard.   I recognize that there are a few
really noxious weeds: bermudagrass, johnsongrass, field bindweed, purple
nutsedge, for example. Expanding the list beyond that is possible, but
debateable. Some might be noxious in some situations, but beneficial in
others, like sandbur or lamb's quarters. Still others are almost never
harmful to crops, like sweet alyssum, ageratum, or poppies. Some of
these are actively sown to attract beneficial arthropods. Yet there is
an imperative to show domination of nature through complete elimination
of every non-crop species planted in what are almost always fields
planted to monoculture. This does not always make economic sense. 
Giving up herbicides is often hard for a farmer who has been told that a
measure of his or her management is how controlled the system is. At the
risk of making a sexist generalization, I've found that women farmers
have less of a "hang-up" about weeds than men. I talked to the daughter
of a prominent organic farmer in North Dakota, who told me that
herbicides were difficult for her father to give up, not because the
economic damage of weeds or soil erosion was so great, but because _his_
father thought he was mismanaging the farm by the number of weeds in a
field. Bankers have also been known to make snap judgements about the
economic viability of a farm based on whether or not they see weeds,
regardless of what the balance sheet shows.  
</P>
<P>But fathers and bankers aside, the people who seem hardest to change
are the weed scientists. Weed scientists haven't learned the lesson that
entomologists learned with IPM--that killing every weed is not
economically efficient. After a certain threshold, weeds aren't worth
killing. Anybody seen articles on economic thresholds of weeds? If so,
I'd like to read them. If not, I would posit that just as insects and
micro-organisms in farming system are not always pestiferous or
pathogenic, non-crop species of higher plants do not always compete with
crops at levels that justify control. When they are found at levels that
justify control, herbicides are never the only and not always the "best"
tool for the long-term management of the problem. When a plant becomes a
"weed" it is the symptom of a larger problem. As Alan Savory points out
in _Holistic Resource Management_, herbicides treat the symptom, not the
problem. Cultural modification can be cheaper and more effective in the
long-run, but herbicides offer a quick fix and dramatic results. </P>
<P>While one can argue whether one-in-a-million or one-in-five cancer
risk is a more reasonable way to set public policy, the fact that any
herbicides are found in water shows that they are not being used
efficiently--they do a farmer no good to control weeds in his or her
field if they're in the river or the well.   My brief foray into weed
science in grad school was pretty disappointing. I found that herbicides
kill weeds pretty darn good, and that these cultural methods don't kill
'em nearly as well. End of story. The last time I looked, weed
scientists seemed to all learn their craft from General Sheridan--"The
only good weed is a dead weed," or Arlo Guthrie at the draft board in
Alice's Restaurant, "I want to kill, Kill, KILL!" I haven't picked up a
weed science journal in a few years. I hope the next time I do, I'll be
pleasantly surprised to find at least some articles on the benefits of
weeds in agro-ecosystems. Weed scientists are going to need to learn the
roles that non-crop plants play, both positive and negative, in order to
make a contribution to sustainable farming systems.
