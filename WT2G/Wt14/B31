the time prescribed by the secretary of state, by this section, and by section
1-2-302.
<P>(b)  Within five days after the close of the registration books prior to a

necessary to implement the consolidated data processing system created pursuant
to section 42-1-212, C.R.S.
<P>(b)  The department of state shall take all reasonable steps necessary to
facilitate the department of revenue's control and use of such computer
equipment to enable the department of revenue to carry out its functions

<P>(c)  The department of state shall reimburse the department of revenue for
the direct and indirect cost of utilizing personnel of the department of

by the operation and maintenance of the consolidated data processing system.
Such reimbursement shall be from moneys in the department of state cash fund
created by section 24-21-104 (3) (b), C.R.S.  The state treasurer shall make
such reimbursement through transfers or payments, as the case may be, pursuant
to the reimbursement provisions of the memorandum of understanding entered into

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-8-103.</H1>
1-8-103.  Application for absentee ballot - repeal of subsection. (1)
The application for an absentee ballot shall be made in writing or by fax,
using the application form furnished by the designated election official, as
prescribed by the secretary of state pursuant to section 1-1-109, or in the
form of a letter, which includes the applicant's signature, residence address,
and date of birth.   If the application is made for a primary election ballot,
the application shall name the political party with which the applicant is
affiliated or wishes to affiliate.
<P>(1.5) (a)  In any election conducted by the county clerk and recorder, the
application form for an absentee ballot shall include a space where the
applicant may give the applicant's driver's license number, if the applicant
has a driver's license, and the form shall clearly indicate that providing such
information is optional.  No application for an absentee ballot shall be
rejected because it does not include a driver's license number.
<P>(b)  This subsection (1.5) is repealed, effective January 1, 1999.
<P>(2)  The application for an absentee ballot shall be personally signed by
the applicant or a family member related by blood or marriage; or, in case of
the applicant's inability to sign, the elector's mark shall be witnessed by
another person.
<P>(3)  The application for an absentee ballot shall be filed  with the
designated election official of the political subdivision in which the
applicant resides or is entitled to vote.  The application shall be filed no
earlier than January 1 immediately preceding the election and no later than the
close of business on the Friday immediately preceding the election.
<P>(4)  The application for an absentee ballot is subject to  the rules of
residency contained in section 1-2-102 and is subject to challenge as provided
in parts 1 and 2 of article 9 of this title.
<P>(5)  A prisoner in pretrial detention may apply for an absentee ballot
from the prisoner's county of residence.  No application for an absentee ballot
shall be accepted unless personally signed by the applicant and accompanied by
a certification from the institutional administrator or the administrator's
designee that the applicant is in pretrial detention.  The institutional
administrator shall certify the application immediately upon request by the
prisoner.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-8-114.</H1>
1-8-114.  Manner of absentee and early voting - repeal of subsection.
(1)  Any eligible elector applying for and receiving an absentee ballot, in
casting the ballot, shall make and subscribe to the self-affirmation on the
return envelope.  The elector shall then mark the ballot, fold the ballot or
insert the ballot card in the special envelope provided for the purpose so as
to conceal the marking, deposit it in the return envelope, and seal the
envelope securely.  The envelope may be delivered personally or mailed by the
elector to the designated election official issuing the ballot.  Alternatively,
an elector may deliver the ballot to any person of the elector's own choice or
to any duly authorized agent of the designated election official for mailing or
personal delivery to the designated election official.  All envelopes
containing absentee ballots shall be in the hands of the designated election
official no later than 7 p.m. on the day of the election. Absentee envelopes
received after 7 p.m. on the day of the election but postmarked on or before
the day of the election will remain sealed and uncounted, but the elector's
registration record will not be canceled for failure to vote in a general
election.
<P>(2)  Upon receipt of an absentee ballot from an eligible elector, the
designated election official shall write or stamp upon the envelope containing
the ballot the date and hour the envelope was received in the office and, if
the ballot was delivered in person, the name and address of the person
delivering it.  The designated election official shall safely keep and preserve
all absentee ballots unopened in a  ballot box or transfer case that is locked
and secured with a numbered seal until the time prescribed for delivery to the
supply judge in accordance with section 1-8-121.
<P>(3)  An eligible elector who receives an early voters' ballot upon
appearing in person in the office of the county clerk and recorder may cast the
ballot in the early voters' polling place, as provided in section 1-8-112.
Ballot boxes for early voting shall be locked and sealed each night with a
numbered seal under the supervision of the election judges or watchers, and the
keys shall remain in the possession of the designated election official until
transferred to the supply judge for the absentee and early voters' counting
place for preparation for counting and tabulating pursuant to section 1-8-121.
When a seal is broken, the designated election official and a person who shall
not be of the same political party as the designated election official shall
record the number of the seal, and maintain the seal along with an explanation
of the reasons for breaking the seal.
<P>(3.5) (a)  In any election conducted by the county clerk and recorder, an
eligible elector who appears in person in the office of the county clerk and
recorder to cast an early voters' ballot shall be requested to write on the
signature card the elector's driver's license number or the number printed on
the elector information card or voter information card or letter mailed to the
elector pursuant to section 1-2-224 or 1-5-206, if a number is printed on such
card or letter, or to present such elector information card or voter
information card or letter when the signature card is given to the election
judge.  Signature cards shall include a labeled space for the driver's license
number and the number of the elector information card or voter information card
or letter and shall clearly indicate that providing such information is
optional.  No person shall be prohibited from voting for failure to provide
such information.  If the elector presents an elector information card or voter
information card or letter instead of providing the driver's license number or
the number of the elector information card or voter information card or letter,
the election judge receiving the signature card shall enter a notation to that
effect on the signature card.
<P>(b)  This subsection (3.5) is repealed, effective January 1, 1999.
<P>(4)  Early voting shall not be permitted after the close of the business
day on the Friday immediately preceding the election.

<P>I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Am. Jur.2d. See 26 Am. Jur.2d, Elections,  250.
<P>C.J.S.  See 29 C.J.S., Elections,  210(7).
<P>Annotator's note. The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>II. CASTING ABSENTEE BALLOTS.
<P>A voter, wishing to cast an absentee vote, must comply with all the
statutory demands, and the power of the board of elections is held within those
lines.  Bullington v. Grabow, 88 Colo. 561, 298 P. 1059 (1931).
<P>As absentee voting is in derogation of the general election law and should
be strictly construed.  Bullington v. Grabow, 88 Colo. 561, 298 P. 1059 (1931).
<P>For a strict construction of prescribed procedures is necessary to
safeguard the exercise of the elective franchise.  Bullington v. Grabow, 88
Colo. 561, 298 P. 1059 (1931).
<P>And the general assembly undoubtedly intended that a voter be held to a
strict performance of the prescribed absentee voting procedures.  Bullington v.
Grabow, 88 Colo. 561, 298 P. 1059 (1931).
<P>Thus execution  by a voter of the affidavit is a mandatory precedent to
the right to so vote, and if not furnished, the ballot should not be counted.
Bullington v. Grabow, 88 Colo. 561, 298 P. 1059 (1931).
<P>However, objection to method of casting vote not considered where vote not
mentioned in statement of contest.  See Israel v. Wood, 98 Colo. 495, 56 P.2d
1324 (1936).
<P>III. DUTY OF COUNTY CLERK.
<P>Voter cannot be disenfranchised for clerk's mistake.  A voter who has
performed every act required of him cannot be disenfranchised because of
irregularities or mistakes of the county clerk.  Bullington v. Grabow, 88 Colo.
561, 298 P. 1059 (1931).  See Kellogg v. Hickman, 12 Colo. 256, 21 P. 325
(1888); Lehman v. Pettingell, 39 Colo. 258, 89 P. 48 (1907).
<P>As election officials are presumed to comply with the law.  Bullington v.
Grabow, 88 Colo. 561, 298 P. 1059 (1931).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-8-116.</H1>
1-8-116.  Casting early voters' ballot. The early voters' polling place
shall be open during regular business hours for purposes of voting twenty-one
days before any presidential primary election, primary election, general
election, or other November election unless the board of county commissioners
by resolution increases the time that the early voters' polling place may be
open.  The offices of the designated election official are to be open until the
close of business on the Friday immediately preceding the election.  Registered
electors who appear in person at the early voters' polling place during this
time may cast their ballots in the same manner as any ballot would be cast in a
precinct polling place on election day.  The voting machines, electronic voting
machines, or ballot boxes used for the casting of early ballots shall remain
locked and secured with a numbered seal, and the tabulation of the votes cast
shall remain unknown until the time prescribed in section 1-8-117 for counting
absentee and early voters' ballots.  Alternatively, for any electronic voting
equipment, the ballot boxes shall be opened each night, and the voted ballots
shall be placed in a transfer case that is locked and secured with a numbered
seal. A record shall be maintained consisting of the date, number of ballots,
and seal number of each ballot box and transfer case until each ballot box and
transfer case is transferred to the supply judge for the absent voters' polling
place for preparation for counting and tabulating pursuant to section 1-8-121.
When a seal is broken, the designated election official and a person who shall
not be of the same political party as the designated election official shall
record the number of the seal and maintain the seal along with an explanation
of the reasons for breaking the seal.  During the time the early voters'
polling place is not open, the designated election official shall have the
custody and keys of any voting machine or electronic voting equipment being
used for the casting of early ballots.  The voting machines or electronic
voting machines used for the casting of early ballots shall not be used for the
further counting of absentee ballots, as provided in sections 1-8-123 and
1-8-124.

1-8-122.  Preparing to count absentee ballots - rejections. (1)  Before
opening any absentee ballot, one of the receiving judges, in the presence of a
majority of the receiving judges, shall announce in an audible voice the name
of the absentee voter and shall inspect the self-affirmation on the return
envelope.  For the ballot to be counted, the self-affirmation must have been
completed by the elector or a person acting in the elector's behalf, and must
have been signed by the elector.  If these requirements are met and the
self-affirmation appears complete and correct, the receiving judge shall tear
open the envelope without defacing the self-affirmation or mutilating the
enclosed ballot.  One of the election judges shall enter the name of the
absentee voter in the pollbook, and another election judge shall deposit the
ballot in the ballot box.
<P>(2)  If the self-affirmation on the return envelope does not meet the
requirements of subsection (1) of this section or is in some other way
incorrect or incomplete,  the election judges shall mark the envelope
"rejected" and shall write on the envelope the reason for the rejection.  The
envelope shall be set aside without being opened, and the ballot shall not be
counted.
<P>(3)  If it appears to the election judges, by sufficient proof, that a
voter has died after forwarding an absentee ballot, the envelope containing the
ballot of the deceased absentee voter shall not be opened, and the election
judges shall make notation of the death on the back of the envelope.  If an
absentee envelope contains more than one marked ballot of any one kind, none of
the ballots shall be counted, and the election judges shall write the reason
for rejection on the back of the ballots.
<P>(4)  Election judges shall certify in their returns the number of absentee
ballots cast and counted for each candidate, for and against each ballot issue,
and for and against each ballot question, and the number of ballots rejected.

the absentee voter.  No person other than an elector authorized by the
designated election official pursuant to sections 1-8-111 and 1-8-113 shall be
permitted to assist more than one absentee voter and unless the person is at
least eighteen years of age and is the spouse, parent, grandparent, sibling, or

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-8-118.5.</H1>
1-8-118.5.  Special write-in blank absentee ballots. (1)  Any citizen who
resides outside the United States, who is a registered elector in this state
prior to his or her departure, and who qualifies pursuant to this section may
apply to the county clerk and recorder for a special write-in blank absentee
ballot to vote at any primary, general, coordinated, or congressional vacancy
election.  An application for a special write-in blank absentee voter ballot
shall contain a statement by the registered elector that due to military or
other contingencies that preclude normal mail delivery, as specified by the
elector, the elector cannot vote an absentee ballot during the normal period
provided by this article.  Any application made pursuant to this section which
is received by the designated election official prior to the sixtieth day
before the election shall be kept and processed on or after the sixtieth day
before the election.
<P>(2)  If the applicant is qualified, the designated election official shall
immediately send the voter a ballot in a form prescribed by the secretary of
state and a list of all candidates who have qualified for the ballot by the
sixtieth day before the election and a list of all measures which are to be
submitted to the voters and upon which the elector is qualified to vote.
<P>(3)  On the special write-in blank absentee ballot, the registered elector
may designate his or her candidate by writing in the name of the candidate or
by writing in the name of a political party or political organization, in which
case the ballot shall be counted for the candidate of that political party or
political organization.  Any abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor
variation in the form of the name of the candidate, political party, or
political organization shall be disregarded in determining the validity of the
ballot as long as the intention of the registered elector can be ascertained.
<P>(4) (a)  If both a federal write-in blank absentee ballot pursuant to
section 1-8-119 and a special write-in blank absentee ballot pursuant to this
section are returned by the voter, the federal write-in absentee ballot shall
be deemed void, and votes shall be counted from the special write-in blank
absentee ballot only.
<P>(b)  If both an absentee ballot and a special write-in blank absentee
ballot are returned, the special write-in blank absentee ballot shall be deemed
void, and votes shall be counted from the absentee ballot only.
<P>(5)  Special write-in blank absentee ballots shall be counted in
accordance with section 1-8-117.

emergency orders or rules, such special procedures or requirements as may be
necessary to facilitate absentee or early voting by those members of the

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-8-119.</H1>
1-8-119.  Federal write-in absentee ballots pursuant to the "Uniformed and
Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act". (1)  Any citizen who resides outside
the United States and who is an eligible elector in this state prior to the
elector's departure or pursuant to section 1-2-208 is entitled to vote for
federal officers by a federal write-in absentee ballot at any primary, general,
or congressional vacancy election.
<P>(2)  A person in the United States service, as defined in section 1-2-208
(2), may apply for an absentee ballot by the use of a properly executed federal
postcard application, as provided for in the "Federal Voting Assistance Act of
1955", as amended.
<P>(3)  If a person in the United States service submits a properly executed
federal postcard application pursuant to this section and the county clerk and
recorder receiving it determines that the applicant is not properly registered,
the county clerk and recorder shall register the applicant in accordance with
section 1-2-208 and shall then deliver to the applicant the official absentee
ballot and other materials necessary for the applicant to vote properly.
<P>(4) (a)  In accord with the "Uniformed and Overseas Citizens  Absentee
Voting  Act", Public Law 99-410, the federal write-in absentee ballot shall be
provided to an eligible elector who has applied  for a Colorado absentee ballot
but believes that he or she will be unable to vote and return the ballot by
normal mail delivery within the period of time provided for the state absentee
ballot.
<P>(b)  The eligible elector may designate the federal candidate by writing
in the name of the candidate or by writing in the name of a political party or
political organization, in which case the ballot shall be counted for the
candidate of that political party or political organization.  Any abbreviation,
misspelling, or other minor variation in the form of the name of the candidate,
political party, or political organization shall be disregarded in determining
the validity of the ballot as long as the intention of the elector can be
ascertained.
<P>(5) (a)  If an application for a Colorado absentee ballot has been
received and processed by the county clerk and recorder but a federal write-in
absentee ballot, and not the state absentee ballot, is returned, only those
votes cast for the federal officers on the federal write-in absentee ballot
shall be counted.
<P>(b)  If both a Colorado absentee ballot and a federal write-in absentee
ballot are returned, the federal write-in absentee ballot shall be deemed void
and votes shall be counted from the state absentee ballot only.
<P>(6)  Federal write-in absentee ballots shall be counted in accord with
section 1-8-117.

1-8-110.  Delivery or replacement of absentee ballot. (1)  The absentee
ballot and other materials shall be delivered or mailed to the absentee elector
within seventy-two hours after the receipt of the application, if the official
ballots are then printed, or, if not then printed, within seventy-two hours
after the printed ballots are delivered to the designated election official.
If the absentee ballot and other materials are mailed, the envelope shall be
marked "DO NOT FORWARD.  ADDRESS CORRECTION REQUESTED." or by any other similar
statement that is in accordance with United States postal service regulations.
<P>(2)  Upon a request by an eligible elector stating an emergency need, the
designated election official may authorize one or more deputies or may deputize
a courier service to deliver the absentee ballot and return the ballot to the
office of the designated election official.
<P>(3)  The designated election official may issue a replacement absentee
ballot if an eligible elector applied for an absentee ballot but did not
receive it or if the elector spoiled the absentee ballot. An affidavit
completed by either the elector or the designated election official shall give
the reason for requesting a replacement absentee ballot and shall state that
the original absentee ballot was not received or was spoiled, that the
individual has not voted, and that the individual does not intend to vote at
the election except by voting the replacement absentee ballot.  The absentee
record shall have the notation "Spoiled" entered to indicate the original
absentee ballot was not received or was spoiled, and the replacement absentee
ballot number shall be entered in the absentee record.  If the original
absentee ballot is returned to the designated election official after the
issuance of the replacement absentee ballot, the original ballot shall be
marked "Spoiled" and shall not be counted.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-8-118.</H1>
1-8-118.  Emergency absentee voting. (1) (a)  In the event an eligible
elector is confined in a hospital or place of residence on election day and the
confinement occurred because of conditions arising after the last day to apply
for an absentee ballot, the elector may request in a personally signed written
statement that the designated election official send an absentee ballot with
the word "EMERGENCY" stamped on the stubs.  The designated election official
shall deliver the emergency absentee ballot, at the official's office during
the regular hours of business, to any authorized representative of the elector.
For the purposes of this paragraph (a), "authorized representative" means a
person who possesses a written statement from the elector containing the
elector's signature, name, and address indicating that the elector is or will
be confined in a hospital or place of residence on election day, and requesting
that the emergency absentee ballot be given to the authorized person as
identified by name and address.  The authorized person shall acknowledge
receipt of the emergency absentee ballot with a signature, name, and address.
<P>(b)  A request for an emergency absentee ballot under this section shall
be made before 5 p.m. on the day of the election, and the ballot shall be
returned no later than 7 p.m. on the day of the election.
<P>(2)  Any eligible elector, including any election official, who is unable
to go to the polls because of conditions arising after the closing date for
absentee ballot applications which will result in the elector's absence from
the precinct on election day, may apply at the office of the designated
election official for an emergency absentee ballot.  Upon receipt of an
affidavit signed by the elector on a form provided by the designated election
official and attesting to the fact that the elector will be absent from the
precinct on election day because of conditions arising after the last day to
apply for an absentee ballot, the designated election official shall provide
the elector with an absentee ballot with the word "EMERGENCY" stamped on the
stubs.  The request for the ballot shall be made by 5 p.m. on the day of the
election, and the ballot shall be voted at the designated election official's
office or outside of the office and returned by 7 p.m. on the day of the
election.
<P>(3)  After marking the ballot, the eligible elector shall place it in a
return envelope provided by the designated election official.  The elector
shall then fill out and sign the self-affirmation on the envelope, as provided
in section 1-8-115, on or before election day and return it to the office of
the designated election official.  Upon receipt of the envelope, the designated
election official shall verify the elector's name on the return envelope with
that which appears on the office precinct record and, if they compare, shall
deposit the envelope in the office in a ballot box that is locked and secured
with a numbered seal.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-2-209.</H1>
1-2-209.  Registration of citizens who reside outside the United States -
federal law. (1)  Any citizen who resides outside the United States, whose
domicile immediately prior to the elector's departure from the United States
was in this state, and who meets the other qualifications for registration in
this state shall be registered and entitled to vote at any primary, general, or
congressional vacancy election for federal offices only, upon receipt by the
county clerk and recorder of the former domicile of the citizen of an
application on a form prescribed by the secretary of state, even though while
residing outside the United States the elector does not have a place of
residence in this state and the intent to return may be uncertain, if:
<P>(a)  The elector does not maintain a sole legal  residence, is not
registered to vote, and is not voting in any other state, any district, or any
territory of the United States; or
<P>(b)  The elector has a valid passport or card of identity issued under the
authority of the United States secretary of state.
<P>(2)  The application may be made at any time following any general
election, up to and including the twenty-ninth day immediately preceding a
general, primary, or congressional vacancy election; except that the
application shall be received by the county clerk and recorder prior to the
close of business on the twenty-ninth day.  The application shall be deemed
received by the county clerk and recorder as of the date of the United States
postal service postmark.  Upon receipt of the duly executed application, the
county clerk and recorder shall forthwith register the elector and file the
registration in a separate registration book for overseas electors.
<P>(3)  An elector registered pursuant to this section shall apply for and
cast a vote by absent voting procedures as authorized by this code.  The
absentee ballot issued shall carry the candidates for the following federal
offices:  President and vice president of the United States, member of the
United States senate, and member of the United States house of representatives.
Any elector registered pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be
canceled under the provisions of section 1-2-224.  Upon returning to the United
States, any elector registered pursuant to this section shall notify the county
clerk and recorder either to cancel the elector's registration because the
elector has established residence outside the county where registered or to
complete the registration because the elector has established residence in the
county.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-13-108.</H1>
1-13-108.  Anonymous statements concerning candidates or issues. (1) Any
person as defined in section 1-45-103 (9) who willfully causes to be published
or printed or who intentionally causes to be distributed any card, pamphlet,
circular, poster, dodger, advertisement, or other writing relating to any
candidate for election for any office or relating to any issue which is to be
submitted to the electors in any election provided by law which does not
contain, clearly set apart from the text and identifying them as sponsors, the
names of the persons, associations, committees, or corporations responsible for
the publication, printing, or distribution of the same and the name of the
president, chairman, or responsible official of each such association,
committee, or corporation is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction
thereof, shall be punished as provided in section 1-13-111.
<P>(2)  Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to any person who
distributes, publishes, or prints any such card, pamphlet, circular, poster,
dodger, advertisement, or other writing but who is not responsible for
authoring, authorizing, paying for, or ordering the material.
<P>(3)  The general assembly declares that the purpose of subsections (1) and
(2) of this section is to further the compelling state interest in preserving
the integrity of the election process by providing a means of identifying those
persons who author, authorize, pay for or order the publishing, printing, or
distributing of campaign materials.  Such identification is intended to
ascertain the source of statements that are fraudulent, libelous, false, or
erroneous and as a result to insulate the election process from such
statements.  Such identification is also intended to help the voters make
informed decisions by permitting interested persons to ascertain and evaluate
the source of the statements.  Additionally, such identification will
facilitate any appropriate criminal prosecution for violations of section
1-13-109 relating to false statements.

1-7-104.  Affidavits of eligibility. (1)  In any election where the list
of registered electors and property owners is not divided by precinct, where an
eligible elector may vote at any polling place in a political subdivision, or
where a taxpaying elector's name is not on the list of registered electors or
property owners, an affidavit signed by the eligible elector stating that the
elector has not previously voted in the election may be required prior to
allowing the elector to cast a ballot.
<P>(2)  For coordinated elections, the affidavits shall be available at the
elector's polling place if the elector resides within the county of the
political subdivision.  For electors who own property within the political
subdivision but reside and are registered to vote in another county, the
affidavits and ballots shall be available at the office of the designated
election official for the political subdivision that is part of the coordinated
election.

<P>Am. Jur.2d.  See 26 Am. Jur.2d, Elections,  233.
<P>C.J.S.  See 29 C.J.S., Elections,  200.
<P>Annotator's note.  The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>II.  IRREGULARITIES.
<P>The presumption that election officers have faithfully discharged their
duties always obtains until the contrary is shown.  Londoner v. People ex rel.
Barton, 15 Colo. 557, 26 P. 135 (1890); Baldauf v. Gunson, 90 Colo. 243, 8 P.2d
265 (1932).
<P>And the will of the people should not be defeated by an honest mistake of
election officers. Baldauf v. Gunson, 90 Colo. 243, 8 P.2d 265 (1932).
<P>Moreover, literal compliance with prescribed forms is not required if the
spirit of the law is not violated.  Baldauf v. Gunson, 90 Colo. 243, 8 P.2d 265
(1932).
<P>And form should be subservient to substance when no legal voter has been
deprived of his vote and no injury of any kind has been done to anyone.
Baldauf v. Gunson, 90 Colo. 243, 8 P.2d 265 (1932).
<P>But where there is a gross disregard of the procedure and formalities
required in the conduct of elections, whether permitted by design, through
ignorance, or negligence, the returns should be rejected.  People v. Lindsey,
80 Colo. 465, 253 P. 465 (1927).
<P>However, it is not necessary that actual fraud should be committed.
People v. Lindsey, 80 Colo. 465, 253 P. 465 (1927).
<P>Rather, when it is clearly established that frauds subversive of the
purity of the ballot box and tending to nullify the popular will have been
perpetrated by the election officers of a precinct, or have been perpetrated by
others with their knowledge, connivance, and consent, and the extent of such
frauds cannot be disclosed with reasonable certainty, the official returns from
the precinct should be thrown out.  Londoner v. People ex rel. Barton, 15 Colo.
557, 26 P. 135 (1890); Baldauf v. Gunson, 90 Colo. 243, 8 P.2d 265 (1932).
<P>However, where the counting officers divulged how the vote stood and left
the tally books in an unlocked box, such irregularities did not constitute
fraud subversive of the purity of the ballot box and tending to nullify the
popular will or such culpable negligence as to render the doings of the
election officials unworthy of credence and destroy the integrity of the
returns.  Baldauf v. Gunson, 90 Colo. 243, 249, 8 P.2d 265 (1932).
<P>Entire poll ordinarily not rejected.  The fact that illegal ballots have

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-4-1101.</H1>
1-4-1101.  Write-in candidate affidavit of intent. (1)  Any person who
wishes to be a write-in candidate for any office in any election shall file an
affidavit of intent stating that he or she desires the office and is qualified
to assume its duties if elected.  The affidavit of intent shall be filed with
the secretary of state if it is for a statewide office, a seat in congress, a
seat in the general assembly, the office of district attorney, or any other
district office greater than a county office.  The affidavit shall be filed
with the county clerk and recorder if it is for a county office, and with the
designated election official if it is for a local office.
<P>(2)  No write-in vote for any office in any election shall be counted
unless the person for whom the vote was cast has filed an affidavit of intent
as required in subsection (1) of this section.

<P>Annotator's note.  Since  1-4-1101 is similar to  1-4-1001 as it existed
prior to the 1992 repeal and reenactment of this part 11, a relevant case
construing that provision has been included in the annotations to this section.
<P>This section and  1-7-309 do not conflict.  This section regulates the
conduct of write-in candidates and prohibits the write-in candidate who fails
to file an affidavit of intent from accumulating votes whereas  1-7-309
regulates the conduct of voters and rejects ballots showing more names than
persons to be elected to an office.  Moran v. Carlstrom, 775 P.2d 1176 (Colo.
1989).

future pay and that the affiant believes that no other person has paid or will
pay, directly or indirectly, any money or other thing of value to any signer
for the purpose of inducing or causing the signer to sign the petition.
<P>(3)  The designated election official shall not accept for filing any
section of a petition which does not have attached to it the notarized

<P>Applied in Hesseltine v. United States, 538 F. Supp. 1003 (D. Colo. 1982).
<P>II.  RESIDENCY.
<P>Test of residency after elector moves from precinct.  The following
inquiry is required to be undertaken if an elector has moved outside the
boundaries of his voting precinct and wishes to retain his right to vote within
the precinct:  (1)  Had the elector established his principal or primary home
or place of abode within the election precinct?  and (2)  was the individual's
departure taken or does his absence continue with a present intention of
returning to the precinct in the future?  Gordon v. Blackburn, 618 P.2d 668
(Colo. 1980).
<P>Intent to keep legal residence central factor.  Once a person's legal
residence has been established, his intent to keep it becomes the central
factor in determining whether it continues.  Gordon v. Blackburn, 618 P.2d 668
(Colo. 1980).
<P>But mere intention without other indicia not enough.  The mere intention
to return to a former abode at some more or less indefinite time, with no other
indicia of a home or domicile, may not fulfill the usual requirements of legal
residence for voting purposes.  Gordon v. Blackburn, 618 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1980).

1-1-102.  Applicability. (1)  This code applies to all general, primary,
congressional vacancy, school district, special district, ballot issue, and
other authorized elections unless otherwise provided by this code. This code
applies to any municipal election conducted as part of a coordinated election
except to the extent that this code conflicts with a specific charter
provision.  Any municipality may provide by ordinance or resolution that it
will utilize the requirements and procedures of this code in lieu of the
"Colorado Municipal Election Code of 1965", article 10 of title 31, C.R.S.,
with respect to any election.
<P>(2)  For elections that must be coordinated pursuant to section 20 (3) (b)
of article X of the Colorado constitution where the enabling legislation does
not require that the electors be registered electors, the political subdivision
may conduct its elections pursuant to the enabling legislation but it must
assure that the notice required by part 9 of article 7 of this title is
provided to the election official responsible for publishing the ballot issue
notice.

<P>I.  Political Organization and
<P>Political Party.
<P>II.  Taxpaying Elector.
<P>I.  POLITICAL ORGANIZATION AND
<P>POLITICAL PARTY.
<P>Annotator's note.  The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>Distinction made between "political party" and "political organization".
In common use the phrase "political party" is synonymous with political
organization, but the general assembly by this section has made a marked
distinction between them.  Clements v. People ex rel. Lee, 58 Colo. 105, 143 P.
834 (1914).
<P>"Political organization" defined.  An association of qualified electors
who, by petition, place upon an official ballot individual nominees for public
office constitute a "political organization".  Clements v. People ex rel. Lee,
58 Colo. 105, 143 P. 834 (1914).
<P>As a condition precedent for such a "political organization" to become a
"political party" within the statutory definition, it shall participate in an
election, and, in addition thereto, cast for its candidate for governor a least
ten percent of the total vote cast at such election.  When these  things occur
the "political organization" becomes a "political party". Clements v. People ex
rel. Lee, 58 Colo. 105, 143 P. 834 (1914).
<P>If a person be the candidate solely of one "political party" or a single
"political organization", the votes which he receives at a given election are
conclusively presumed to have been cast by the particular party or organization
whose candidate he is. Clements v. People ex rel. Lee, 58 Colo. 105, 143 P. 834
(1914).
<P>But if he be the candidate of two or more "political parties" or
"political organizations", no such presumption can exist. Clements v. People ex
rel. Lee, 58 Colo. 105, 143 P. 834 (1914).
<P>Thus, where distinct political organizations, under different names,
present the same individual as their candidate for governor, the votes cast by
all these several organizations for the same candidate are not to be considered
as cast by any one "party", as such is not conditioned upon the number of votes
which the candidate received, but upon the number an organization itself cast.
Clements v. People ex rel. Lee, 58 Colo. 105, 143 P. 834 (1914).
<P>For a political organization is a distinct entity which can neither
coalesce with another, nor lose its identity therein by the mere fact that its
candidates, principles, and management are the same. Clements v. People ex rel.
Lee, 58 Colo. 105, 143 P. 834 (1914).
<P>Evidence that organizations voting for same person were but one
organization under different names held inadmissible. Clements v. People ex
rel. Lee, 58 Colo. 105, 143 P. 834 (1914).
<P>II. TAXPAYING ELECTOR.
<P>The phrases "taxpaying elector" and "qualified taxpaying elector",
describe situations in which payment of a property tax is an additional
qualification for voting.  Sheldon v. Moffat Tunnel Comm'n, 335 F. Supp. 251
(D. Colo. 1971).
<P>However, these phrases are not used in connection with general elections.
Sheldon v. Moffat Tunnel Comm'n, 335 F. Supp. 251 (D. Colo. 1971).
<P>Only taxpaying electors entitled to vote on municipal bond issue. In an
election on a municipal bond issue, it is clear that under this subsection only
those electors who paid, or were obligated to pay,  taxes on real or personal
property subject to the mill levy of the municipality are eligible to vote.
City of Montrose v. Niles, 124 Colo. 535, 238 P.2d 875 (1951).
<P>And in such a case, the tax on real or personal property unquestionably
means a tax on property which is subject to the mill levy of the city. City of
Montrose v. Niles, 124 Colo. 535, 238 P.2d 875 (1951).
<P>Hence, county taxpayers cannot vote in municipal elections.  Registered
electors of the city who paid taxes in the county, but who did not pay taxes on
property in the city, do not have the right to vote on the question of the
erection of a municipal electric light plant. City of Loveland v. Western Light
&amp  Power Co., 65 Colo. 55, 173 P. 717 (1918).
<P>Moreover, a person who owns property which is assessed in the name of
another, is not a "taxpaying elector" qualified to vote in a municipal bond
election. City of Montrose v. Niles, 124 Colo. 535, 238 P.2d 875 (1951).
<P>Nor is a purchaser of realty under contract of sale.  See City of Montrose
v. Niles, 124 Colo. 535, 238 P.2d 875 (1951).
<P>As ownership of property in and of itself is insufficient to qualify a
citizen to vote, the property owned must in fact be "assessed to" him upon the
assessment rolls of the county. City of Montrose v. Niles, 124 Colo. 535, 238
P.2d 875 (1951).
<P>"Taxpaying elector" also must be registered.  In a municipal bond election
a person who possesses all qualifications as to ownership and assessment of
property is nevertheless not entitled to vote over the objection that he is not
registered. City of Montrose v. Niles, 124 Colo. 535, 238 P.2d 875 (1951).

1-7-701.  Delivery of election returns, ballot boxes, and other election
papers. When all the votes have been read and counted, the election officials
selected in accordance with section 1-6-116 shall deliver to the designated
election official the certificate and statement required by section 1-7-601,
ballot boxes and all keys to the boxes, paper tapes, "proms" or other
electronic devices, the registration book, pollbooks, accounting forms, spoiled
ballots, unused ballots, ballot stubs, oaths, affidavits, and other election
papers and supplies.  The delivery shall be made at once and with all
convenient speed, and informality in the delivery shall not invalidate the vote
of any precinct when delivery has been made previous to the completion of the
official abstract of the votes by the board of canvassers.  The designated
election official shall give a receipt for all items delivered.

<P>C.J.S. See 29 C.J.S., Elections,  234.
<P>Fraud must be shown to require ballot box opening.  Where the court, in a
contested election case in which fraud was alleged, refused to require the
opening of the ballot boxes and a recounting of the ballots until some evidence
of the fraud alleged was introduced, its discretion was, under the
circumstances, commendably exercised.  Kindel v. Le Bert, 23 Colo. 385, 48 P.
641, 58 Am. St. R. 234 (1897)(decided under former law).
<P>And court may decline ruling when ballots destroyed.  When, pending an
appeal in the matter of a contested election, an event occurs, such as the
destruction of the ballots cast at the election, which under the circumstances
of the case, renders any ruling which might be made ineffectual, the court may
decline to pass upon any of the controverted questions.  Kindel v. Le Bert, 23
Colo. 385, 48 P. 641, 58 Am. St. R. 234 (1897)(decided under former law).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-7-304.</H1>
1-7-304.  Manner of voting. (1)  Each eligible elector, upon receiving a
ballot, shall immediately proceed unaccompanied to one of the voting booths
provided.  To cast a vote, the eligible elector shall clearly mark or stamp in
the appropriate square or place a cross mark (X) opposite the name of the
candidate or the names of the joint candidates of the elector's choice for each
office to be filled.  In the case of a ballot issue, the elector shall clearly
mark or stamp in the appropriate square or place a cross mark (X) opposite the
answer which the elector desires to give. Before leaving the voting booth, the
eligible elector shall fold the ballot without displaying the marks thereon, in
the same way it was folded when received by the elector, so that the contents
of the ballot are concealed and the stub can be removed without exposing any of
the contents of the ballot, and shall keep the ballot folded until it is
deposited in the ballot box.
<P>(2)  Each eligible elector who has completed the ballot and is ready to
vote shall then leave the voting booth and approach the election judges having
charge of the ballot box.  The elector shall give his or her name to one of the
election judges, who shall clearly and audibly announce the name in a loud and
distinct tone of voice. The elector's ballot shall be handed to the election
judge in charge of the ballot box, who shall announce the name of the eligible
elector and the number upon the duplicate stub of the ballot, which number
shall correspond with the stub number previously placed on the registration
list.  If the stub number of the ballot corresponds and is identified by the
initials that the issuing election judge placed thereupon, the election judge
shall then remove the duplicate stub from the ballot.  The ballot shall then be
returned by the election judge to the elector, who shall, in full view of the
election judges, deposit it in the ballot box, with the official endorsement on
the ballot uppermost.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-7-901.</H1>
1-7-901.  Receipt of comments concerning ballot issues. (1)  Each
political subdivision shall accept written comments concerning ballot issues in
accordance with this section.
<P>(2)  All comments filed in writing will be received and kept on file with
the designated election official for the political subdivision submitting to
its eligible electors the ballot issue to which the comments pertain.  However,
only those comments that are filed by persons eligible to vote in the political
subdivision submitting the ballot issue to its electors must be summarized in
the ballot issue notice.  The filed comments shall be retained by the
designated election official as election records.
<P>(3)  To be summarized in the ballot issue notice, the comments shall
address a specific ballot issue and shall include a signature and an address
where the signor is registered to vote and shall be filed with the designated
election official for the political subdivision and not the county clerk and
recorder of the county in which the political subdivision is located unless the
issue is a county issue for which the county clerk and recorder is the
designated election official.
<P>(4)  Since section 20 (3) (b) (v) of article X of the state constitution
requires that comments pertaining to a ballot issue be filed by thirty days
before the election and since the thirtieth day before any ballot issue
election is always a Sunday, all comments shall be filed by the end of the
business day on the Friday before the thirtieth day before the election.

<HR>
<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-11-203.5.</H1>
1-11-203.5.  Contests concerning ballot order or ballot title - ballot
issue or ballot question elections. (1)  Except for petitions for rehearing
pursuant to section 1-40-107, all election contests arising out of a ballot
issue or ballot question election concerning the order on the ballot or the
form or content of any ballot title shall be summarily adjudicated by the
district court sitting for the political subdivision within which the contest
arises prior to the election.  Except as otherwise provided in this section,
the style and form of process, the manner of service of process and papers, the
fees of officers, and judgment for costs shall be according to the rules and
practice of the district court.  The court that first acquires jurisdiction of
any contest shall have exclusive jurisdiction.  Before the district court is
required to take jurisdiction of the contest, the contestor shall file with the
clerk of the court a bond, with sureties, running to the contestee and
conditioned to pay all costs, including attorneys fees, in case of failure to
maintain the contest.  The judge shall determine the sufficiency of the bond
and, if sufficient, approve it.
<P>(2)  Every such contest shall be commenced by verified petition filed by
the contestor to the proper court, setting forth the grounds for the contest
and a proposed alternative order for the ballot or alternative form or content
for the contested ballot title.  The contestee shall be the state in the case
of a statewide ballot issue or statewide ballot question or the political
subdivision that proposed to place the contested ballot issue or ballot
question on the ballot, as applicable, and the petition representative of an
initiated measure.  The petition shall be filed and a copy served on the
contestee within five days after the title of the ballot issue or ballot
question is set by the state or political subdivision and for contests
concerning the order of a ballot, within five days after the ballot order is
set by the county clerk and recorder and not thereafter.  The designated
election official or other authorized official, on behalf of the contestee and
the proponent of an initiated measure, shall answer under oath within five days
after service.  Upon the expiration of the time for the answer, and following
at least twenty-four hours advance notice of the date, time, and place of the
adjudication given by the clerk of the court by letter, telephone, or fax to
the contestor and contestee, the court having jurisdiction of the contest shall
immediately set the matter for trial on the merits and shall adjudicate it
within ten days of the date of filing of the answer by the contestee or
expiration of the time for the answer.
<P>(3)  If the court finds that the order of the ballot or the form or
content of the ballot title does not conform to the requirements of the state
constitution and statutes, the court shall provide in its order the text of the
corrected ballot title  or the corrected order of the measures to be placed
upon the ballot and shall award costs and reasonable attorneys fees to the
contestor.  If the court finds that the order of the ballot and the form and
content of the ballot title conform to the requirements of the state
constitution and statutes and further finds that the suit was frivolous as
provided in article 17 of title 13, C.R.S., the court shall provide in its
order an award of costs and reasonable attorneys fees to the contestee state or
political subdivision and to the proponent of an initiated measure.
<P>(4)  Following entry of the order of the district court pursuant to this
section, the ballot title shall be certified by the state or political
subdivision to the county clerk and recorder, to be voted upon at the election
as so certified unless the election on the ballot issue or ballot question is
canceled in the manner provided by law.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
law, any appeal from an order of the district court entered pursuant to this
section shall be taken directly to the supreme court, which shall decide the
appeal as expeditiously as practicable.
<P>(5)  The procedure provided in this section shall be the exclusive
procedure to contest or otherwise challenge the order of the ballot or the form
or content of the ballot title.
<P>(6)  This section shall not apply to a ballot title for a statewide ballot
issue or statewide ballot question that is set by a title setting board or
court as provided by law.

<P>Provisions not mandatory.  To treat the provisions for preparing to vote
as mandatory so as to deprive those who attempt to register would provide an
unequal application of the statute and an inconsistency not warranted by any
express language in the enactment.  Meyer v. Putnam, 186 Colo, 132, 526 P.2d
139 (1974).
<P>Obtaining of social security numbers from vast majority of voters is only
directory.  Meyer v. Putnam, 186 Colo. 132, 526 P.2d 139 (1974).
<P>And not sufficient to deny the right to vote.  The general assembly has
provided unequivocally that all those registered to vote shall not be denied
the right to vote, notwithstanding that they do not furnish their social
security numbers.  Meyer v. Putnam, 186 Colo. 132, 526 P.2d 139 (1974).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-5-407.</H1>
1-5-407.  Form of ballots. (1)  The extreme top part of each ballot shall
be divided into two spaces by two perforated or dotted lines.  Each space shall
be not less than one inch wide.  The top portion is called the stub, and the
next portion is called the duplicate stub.  The same number shall be printed
upon both the stub and the duplicate stub.  All ballots shall be numbered
consecutively.  All ballots shall be uniform and of sufficient length and width
to allow for the names of candidates, officers, ballot issues, and ballot
questions to be printed in clear, plain type, with a space of at least one-half
inch between the different columns on the ballot.  On each ballot shall be
printed the endorsement "Official ballot for  ......................", and
after the word "for" shall follow the designation of the precinct, if
appropriate, and the political subdivision for which the ballot is prepared,
the date of the election, and a facsimile of the signature of the election
official.  The ballot shall contain no caption or other endorsement, except as
provided in this section.  The election official shall use precisely the same
quality and tint of paper, the same kind of type, and the same quality and tint
of plain black ink for all ballots prepared for one election.
<P>(2)  The ballots shall be printed so as to give to each eligible elector a
clear opportunity to designate his or her choice of candidates, joint
candidates, or ballot issues by a cross mark (X) in a sufficient margin at the
right of the name or ballot issue.  On the ballot may be printed words which
will aid the elector, such as "vote for not more than one".
<P>(3)  At the end of the list of candidates for each different office shall
be as many blank spaces as there are persons to be elected to the office, in
which the elector may write the name of any eligible person not printed on the
ballot who has filed an affidavit of intent of write-in candidate pursuant to
section 1-4-1101.
<P>(4)  The names of the candidates for each office shall be arranged under
the designation of the office according to the surnames, as provided in section
1-5-404.  The designated election official shall not print, in connection with
any name, any title or degree designating the business or profession of the
candidate.
<P>(5)  Whenever the approval of a ballot issue or ballot question is
submitted to the vote of the people, the ballot issue or question shall be
printed upon the ballot following the lists of candidates.  Constitutional
issues shall be printed first, followed by statewide issues and questions,
county issues and questions, municipal issues and questions, school district
issues and questions, ballot issues and questions for other political
subdivisions which are in more than one county, and then ballot issues and
questions for other political subdivisions which are wholly within a county.
The measures in each category shall be placed in the following order:  Measures
to increase taxes; measures to increase debt; citizen petitions; and referred
measures.
<P>(5.5)  The coordinated election official may choose to follow the
provisions of subsection (5) of this section, or may choose to use separate
ballots.  If separate ballots are used, the candidates shall be listed first,
followed by measures to increase taxes, measures to increase debt, citizen
petitions, and referred measures.
<P>(6)  Whenever candidates are to be voted for only by the eligible electors
of a particular district, county, or other political subdivision, the names of
those candidates shall not be printed on any ballots other than those provided
for use in the district, county, or political subdivision in which those
candidates are to be voted on.
<P>(7)  No printing or distinguishing marks shall be on the ballot except as
specifically provided in this code.
<P>(8)  The form of the ballot may vary from the requirements of this section
if the changes are approved by the secretary of state.

people are listed numerically.  A 'yes' vote on any measure is a vote in favor
of changing constitutional or statutory law, and a 'no' vote on any measure is
a vote against changing constitutional or statutory law."  Each ballot title
shall appear on the official ballot but once and shall be separated from the
other ballot titles next to it by heavy black lines and shall be followed by
the words "yes" and "no" with blank spaces to the right and opposite the same
as follows:
Measures referred by the general assembly or any political subdivision are
listed by letter, and measures initiated by the people are listed numerically.
A "yes" vote on any measure is a vote in favor of changing constitutional or
statutory law, and a "no" vote on any measure is a vote against changing

<P>C.J.S.  See 62 C.J.S., Municipal Corporations,  443.
<P>This section does not apply to the home rule city. Burks v. City of
Lafayette, 142 Colo. 61, 349 P.2d 692 (1960).
<P>And the general assembly can grant or withhold from the council of a
nonhome rule city the power to declare health and safety. Burks v. City of
Lafayette, 142 Colo. 61, 349 P.2d 692 (1960).
<P>But it has chosen to authorize the exercise of the power by councils of
such cities. Burks v. City of Lafayette, 142 Colo. 61, 349 P.2d 692 (1960).
<P>And it grants to the councils of cities the power to limit referendum by
invoking the safety clause. Burks v. City of Lafayette, 142 Colo. 61, 349 P.2d
692 (1960).
<P>And a city ordinance which contains a safety clause, is not subject to
referendum under the provisions of  1 of art. V, Colo. Const. Shields v. City
of Loveland, 74 Colo. 27, 218 P. 913 (1923).
<P>But at the same time by enacting this section, authorizing the councils of
nonhome rule cities to enact ordinances with safety provision, the general
assembly recognized that there was no maximum limitation of the referendum
power. Burks v. City of Lafayette, 142 Colo. 61, 349 P.2d 692 (1960).
<P>And whether the recital in a municipal ordinance, that it is "necessary
for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety", is true
or not, is a legislative, and not a judicial question. Shields v. City of
Loveland, 74 Colo. 27, 218 P. 913 (1923).
<P>Also respecting this matter, there is no distinction between state and
municipal legislation. Shields v. City of Loveland, 74 Colo. 27, 218 P. 913
(1923).
<P>However, it was not the intention of the legislature for a soil erosion
district to be considered as a town, city, or municipality within the meaning
of those terms as used in this section and sections 1-40-116 and 1-40-117.
People ex rel. Cheyenne Soil Erosion Dist. v. Parker, 118 Colo. 13, 192 P.2d
417 (1948).
<P>And for a case where the city charter provisions were held complete within
themselves for filing of referendum petition. See Leach &amp  Arnold Homes, Inc. v.
City of Boulder, 32 Colo. App. 16, 507 P.2d 476 (1973).

1-5-403.  Content of ballots for general and congressional vacancy
elections. (1)  The county clerk and recorder of each county using paper
ballots or electronically counted ballot cards shall provide printed ballots
for every general or congressional vacancy election. The official ballots shall
be printed and in the possession of the county clerk and recorder at least
thirty days before every congressional vacancy election and, for every general
election, at least fifteen days after the  county clerk and recorder receives
from the secretary of state the notice provided for in section 1-5-203.
<P>(2)  For all elections except those for presidential electors, every
ballot shall contain the names of all candidates for offices to be voted for at
that election whose nominations have been made and accepted, except those who
have died or withdrawn, and the ballot shall contain no other names. When
presidential electors are to be elected, their names shall not be printed on
the ballot, but the names of the candidates of the respective political parties
or political organizations for president and vice president of the United
States shall be printed together in pairs under the title "presidential
electors".  The pairs shall be arranged in the alphabetical order of the names
of the candidates for president in the manner provided for in section 1-5-404.
A vote for any pair of candidates is a vote for the duly nominated presidential
electors of the political party or political organization by which the pair of
candidates were named.
<P>(3)  The names of joint candidates of a political party or political
organization for the offices of governor and lieutenant governor shall be
printed in pairs. The pairs shall be arranged in the alphabetical order of the
names of candidates for governor in the manner provided for in section 1-5-404.
A vote for any pair of candidates for governor and lieutenant governor is a
vote for each of the candidates who compose that pair.
<P>(4)  The name of each person nominated shall be printed or written upon
the ballot in only one place.  Opposite the name of each person nominated,
including candidates for president and vice president and joint candidates for
governor and  lieutenant governor, shall be the name of the political party or
political organization which nominated the candidate, expressed in not more
than three words.  Those three words may not promote the candidate or
constitute a campaign promise.
<P>(5)  The positions on the ballot shall be arranged as follows:  First,
candidates for president and vice president of the United States; next,
candidates for United States senator; next, congressional candidates; next,
joint candidates for the offices of governor and lieutenant governor; next,
other state candidates; next, legislative candidates; next, district attorney
candidates; next, candidates for the board of directors of the regional
transportation district; next, other candidates for district offices greater
than a county office; next, candidates for county commissioners; next, county
clerk and recorder candidates; next, county treasurer candidates; next, county
assessor candidates; next, county sheriff candidates; next county surveyor
candidates; and next, county coroner candidates.   When other offices are to be
filled, the county clerk and recorder, in preparing the ballot, shall use
substantially the form prescribed by this section, stating the proper
designation of the office and placing the names of the candidates for the
office under the name of the office.  The ballot issues concerning the
retention in office of justices of the supreme court, judges of the court of
appeals, judges of the district court, and judges of the county court shall be
placed on the ballot in that order and shall precede the placement of ballot
issues concerning amendment of the state constitution or pertaining to
political subdivisions.

receiving judges shall then proceed to use the other ballot box furnished for
voting.   The receiving judges shall open, empty, and lock the alternate ballot
box in the manner prescribed in section 1-7-301.
<P>(2)  When the counting judges have counted the votes in a ballot box,
they shall return the empty ballot box to the receiving judges and exchange it
for the box containing ballots cast since taking possession of the first ballot
box.  The judges shall continue to exchange ballot boxes in the same manner
during the day until the polls are closed and shall continue counting until all
ballots have been counted.
<P>(3)  When an exchange of ballot boxes is made as described in subsection
(2) of this section, the receiving judges shall sign and furnish to the
counting judges a statement showing the number of ballots that are to be found
in each ballot box as indicated by the pollbooks.  The counting judges shall
then count ballots in the manner prescribed in section 1-7-307.
<P>(4)  The governing body may provide a separate room or building for the
counting judges but, when ballot boxes are moved from one room or building to
another, they shall be under the constant observation of at least one of the
counting judges.

1-7-508.  Determination of improperly marked ballots. (1)  If any ballot
is damaged or defective so that it cannot properly be counted by the electronic
vote-counting equipment, a true duplicate copy shall be made of the damaged
ballot in the presence of two witnesses.  The duplicate ballot shall be
substituted for the damaged ballot.  Every duplicate ballot shall be clearly
labeled as such and shall bear a serial number which shall be recorded on the
damaged ballot.
<P>(2)  Votes cast for an office to be filled or a ballot issue to be decided
shall not be counted if a voter marks or punches more names than there are
persons to be elected to an office or if for any reason it is impossible to
determine the elector's choice of candidate or vote concerning the ballot
issue.  A defective or an incomplete mark or punch on any ballot in a proper
place shall be counted if no other mark or punch is on the ballot indicating an
intention to vote for some other candidate or ballot issue.
<P>(3)  No ballot shall be counted unless it has the official endorsement
required by section 1-7-502.
<P>(4)  Ballots not counted because of the election judges' inability to
determine the elector's intent for all candidates and ballot issues shall be
marked "defective" on the back, banded together, separated from the other
ballots, and preserved by the designated election official pursuant to section
1-7-801.

1-5-412.  Correction of errors. (1)  The designated election official
shall correct without delay any errors in publication or in sample or official
ballots which are discovered or brought to the official's attention and which
can be corrected without interfering with the timely distribution of the
ballots.
<P>(2)  When it appears by verified petition of a candidate or the
candidate's agent to any district court that any error or omission has occurred
in the publication of the names or description of the candidates or in the
printing of sample or official election ballots which has been brought to the
attention of the designated election official and has not been corrected, the
court shall issue an order requiring the designated election official to
correct the error forthwith or to show cause why the error should not be
corrected. Costs, including reasonable attorney fees, may be assessed in the
discretion of the court against either party.
<P>(3)  If, before the date set for election, any duly nominated candidate
withdraws by filing an affidavit of withdrawal with the designated election
official or dies and the fact of the death becomes known to the designated
election official, the name of the candidate shall not be printed upon the
ballots.  If the ballots are already printed, the votes cast for the withdrawn
or deceased candidate are invalid and shall not be counted.

1-5-411.  Substitute ballots. If the ballots to be furnished to any
election judges are not delivered at the time and in the manner required in
section 1-5-410 or if after delivery they are destroyed or stolen, it shall be
the duty of the designated election official to cause other ballots to be
prepared, as nearly in the form prescribed as practicable, with the words
"substitute ballot" printed on each ballot.  Upon receipt of the ballots thus
prepared from the designated election official, accompanied by a statement
under oath that the designated election official prepared and furnished the
substitute ballots and that the original ballots have not been received or have
been destroyed or stolen, the election judges shall cause the substitute
ballots to be used at the election.  If from any cause neither the official
ballots nor the substitute ballots are ready in time to be distributed for the
election or if the supply of ballots is exhausted before the polls are closed,
unofficial ballots, printed or written, made as nearly as possible in the form
of the official ballots, may be used until substitutes prepared by the
designated election official can be printed and delivered.

1-5-408.  Form of ballots - electronic voting. (1)  Ballot pages or ballot
cards placed upon voting devices shall, so far as practicable, be arranged as
provided by sections 1-5-402, 1-5-403, 1-5-404, and 1-5-405; except that they
shall be of the size and design required by the vote recorder or device and may
be printed on a number of separate pages which are placed on the voting device
or on one or more ballot cards.
<P>(2)  If votes are recorded on a ballot card, a separate write-in ballot
may be provided, which may be in the form of a paper ballot or envelope on
which the elector may write in the title of the office and the name of a
qualified write-in candidate.
<P>(3)  Precincts which use electronic voting systems may use ballot cards of
different colors to insure that electors receive a full ballot. Such precincts
may also use different-colored ballot cards for each party at primary
elections.
<P>(4)  In precincts using electronic voting systems, each ballot card shall
have two stubs attached.  The stubs shall be separated from the ballot card and
from each other by perforated lines so that they may be readily detached.  Both
stubs shall have the serial ballot number printed on them.  The size of the
ballot stubs and the spacing of the printed material may be varied to suit the
conditions imposed by the use of the ballot cards. The ballot stub may also
include color marking or wording to indicate that the stub must show when the
ballot is voted and placed in the privacy envelope for deposit in the ballot
box.  The face of the ballot card shall include the endorsement "Official
ballot for ....................", and after the word "for" shall follow the
designation of the precinct, if appropriate, and the political subdivision for
which the ballot is prepared, the date of the election, and a facsimile of the
signature of the designated election official.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-7.5-107.</H1>
1-7.5-107.  Procedures for conducting mail ballot election. (1)  Official
ballots shall be prepared and all other preelection procedures followed as
otherwise provided by law or rules promulgated by the secretary of state;
except that mail ballot packets shall be prepared in accordance with this
article.
<P>(2) (a)  Except for coordinated elections conducted as a mail ballot
election where the county clerk and recorder is the coordinated election
official, no later than thirty days prior to election day, the county clerk and
recorder shall submit to the designated election official of the political
subdivision conducting the mail ballot election a full and complete preliminary
list of registered electors.  For special district mail ballot elections, the
county clerk and recorder and county assessor of each county in which a special
district is located shall certify and submit to the designated election
official a list of property owners and a list of registered electors residing
within the affected district.
<P>(b)  No later than twenty days prior to election day, the county clerk and
recorder required to submit a preliminary list in accordance with paragraph (a)
of this subsection (2) shall submit to the appropriate authority a supplemental
list of the names of eligible electors whose names were not included on the
preliminary list.
<P>(c)  All lists of registered electors and lists of property owners
provided to a designated election official under this section shall include the
last mailing address of each elector.
<P>(3) (a)  Not sooner than twenty-five days before an election, and no later
than fifteen days before an election, the designated election official shall
mail to each eligible elector, at the last mailing address appearing in the
registration records and in accordance with United States postal service
regulations, a mail ballot packet, which shall be marked "DO NOT FORWARD.
ADDRESS CORRECTION REQUESTED", or any other similar statement that is in
accordance with United States postal service regulations; except that with
prior approval from the secretary of state, the packets shall be sent no later
than ten days before election day.
<P>(b)  The ballot or ballot label shall contain the following warning:
<P>"WARNING:
<P>Any person who, by use of force or other means, unduly influences an
eligible elector to vote in any particular manner or to refrain from voting, or
who falsely makes, alters, forges, or counterfeits any mail ballot before or
after it has been cast, or who destroys, defaces, mutilates, or tampers with a
ballot is subject, upon conviction, to imprisonment, or to a fine, or both."
<P>(c)  No sooner than twenty-five days prior to election day, nor later than
7 p.m. on election day, mail ballots shall be made available at the designated
election official's office, or the office designated in the mail ballot plan
filed with the secretary of state, for eligible electors who are not listed on
the county voter registration records or, for special district mail ballot
elections, on the list of property owners or the registration list but who are
authorized to vote pursuant to section 32-1-806, C.R.S., or other applicable
law.
<P>(d) (I)  An eligible elector may obtain a replacement ballot if the ballot
was destroyed, spoiled, lost, or for some other reason not received by the
eligible elector. An eligible elector may obtain a ballot if a mail ballot
packet was not sent to the elector because the eligibility of the elector could
not be determined at the time the mail ballot packets were mailed.  In order to
obtain a ballot in such cases, the eligible elector must sign a sworn statement
specifying the reason for requesting the ballot.  The statement shall be
presented to the designated election official no later than 7 p.m. on election
day.  The designated election official shall keep a record of each ballot
issued in accordance with this paragraph (d) together with a list of each
ballot obtained pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection (3).
<P>(II)  A designated election official shall not transmit a mail ballot
packet under this paragraph (d) unless a sworn statement requesting the ballot
is received on or before election day.  A ballot may be transmitted directly to
the eligible elector requesting the ballot at the designated election
official's office or the office designated in the mail ballot plan filed with
the secretary of state or may be mailed to the eligible elector at the address
provided in the sworn statement.  Ballots may be cast no later than 7 p.m. on
election day.
<P>(4) (a)  Upon receipt of a ballot, the eligible elector shall mark the
ballot, sign and complete the return-verification envelope, and comply with the
instructions provided with the ballot.
<P>(b)  The eligible elector may return the marked ballot to the designated
election official by United States mail or by depositing the ballot at the
office of the official or any place designated by the official.  The ballot
must be returned in the return-verification envelope.  If an eligible elector
returns the ballot by mail, the elector must provide postage.  The ballot shall
be received at the office of the designated election official or a designated
depository, which shall remain open until 7 p.m. on election day.
<P>(5)  Once the ballot is returned, an election judge shall first qualify
the submitted ballot by examining the return-verification envelope and
comparing the information on the envelope to the registration records to
determine whether the ballot was submitted by an eligible elector who has not
previously voted in the election.  If the ballot so qualifies and is otherwise
valid, the election judge shall indicate in the poll book that the eligible
elector cast a ballot, open the return-verification envelope, remove the ballot
stub, and deposit the ballot in an official ballot box.
<P>(6)  All deposited ballots shall be counted as provided in this article
and by rules promulgated by the secretary of state.  A mail ballot shall be
valid and counted only if it is returned in the return-verification envelope,
the affidavit on the envelope is signed and completed by the eligible elector
to whom the ballot was issued, and the information on the envelope is verified
in accordance with subsection (5) of this section. Mail ballots shall be
counted in the same manner provided by section 1-7-307 for counting paper
ballots or section 1-7-507 for counting electronic ballots.  If the election
official determines that an eligible elector to whom a replacement ballot has
been issued has voted more than once, the official shall not count any ballot
cast by the elector.  Rejected ballots shall be handled in the same manner as
provided in section 1-8-128.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-7-503.</H1>
1-7-503.  Manner of voting. (1)  Each eligible elector, upon receiving a
ballot, shall immediately proceed unaccompanied to one of the voting booths
provided.  To cast a vote, the eligible elector shall clearly mark or stamp in
the appropriate square or place a cross mark (X) opposite the name of the
candidate or the names of the joint candidates of the elector's choice for each
office to be filled.  In the case of a ballot issue, the elector shall clearly
mark or stamp in the appropriate square or place a cross mark (X) opposite the
answer which the elector desires to give.  Before leaving the voting booth, the
eligible elector, without displaying the marks thereon, shall place the ballot
in the privacy envelope so that the contents of the ballot or ballot card are
concealed and the stub can be removed without exposing any of the contents of
the ballot or ballot card, and shall place the envelope and the ballot or
ballot card in the ballot box.
<P>(2)  Each eligible elector who has prepared the ballot and is ready to
vote shall then leave the voting booth and approach the election judges having
charge of the ballot box.  The eligible elector shall give his or her name to
one of the election judges, who shall clearly and audibly announce it in a loud
and distinct tone of voice. The elector's ballot or ballot card shall be handed
to the election judge in charge of the ballot box, who shall announce the name
of the eligible elector and the number upon the duplicate stub of the ballot or
ballot card, which number shall correspond with the stub number previously
placed on the registration list.  If the stub number of the ballot or ballot
card corresponds and is identified by the initials that the issuing election
judge placed thereupon, the election judge shall then remove the duplicate stub
from the ballot or ballot card. The ballot or ballot card shall then be
returned by the election judge to the elector, who shall, in full view of the
election judges, deposit it in the ballot box, with the official endorsement on
the ballot or ballot card facing upward.
<P>(3)  In precincts which use electronic voting equipment in which voting is
by a method other than a ballot, each voter shall be listed by name in the
pollbook and shall be given an entry card to the electronic voting device.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-7-307.</H1>
1-7-307.  Method of counting paper ballots.
(1)  The
election judges shall first count the number of ballots in the
box.  If the ballots are found to exceed the number of names
entered on each of the pollbooks, the election judges shall then
examine the official endorsements.  If, in the unanimous opinion of the judges,
any of the ballots in excess of the number on the pollbooks are
deemed not to bear the proper official endorsement, they shall be
put into a separate pile and into a separate record, and a return
of the votes in those ballots shall be made under the heading
"excess ballots".  When the ballots and the pollbooks agree, the
judges shall proceed to count the votes.
<P>(2)  Each ballot shall be read and counted separately.  Every name and all
names of joint candidates separately marked as voted for on the ballot shall be
read and an entry made on each of two accounting forms before any other ballot
is counted.   The entire number of ballots, excepting "excess ballots", shall
be read, counted, and placed on the accounting forms in like manner.  When all
of the ballots, except "excess  ballots", have been counted, the election
judges shall post the votes from the accounting forms.
<P>(3)  When all the votes have been read and counted, the ballots shall be
returned to the ballot box, the opening shall be carefully sealed, and the
election judges shall place their initials on the seal.  The cover shall then
be locked and the ballot box delivered to the designated election official, as
provided in section 1-7-701.
<P>(4)  All persons, except election judges and watchers, shall be excluded
from the place where the ballot counting is being held  until the count has
been completed.

<P>Annotator's note.  The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>The intention of the voter, as expressed upon the face of his ballot, has
always been regarded as the cardinal principle controlling the count.  Under a
system providing for balloting like the Australian, it is necessary that
certain rules be prescribed to prevent confusion and secure uniformity; by this
means the intention of the voter is to be ascertained.  Nicholls v. Barrick, 27
Colo. 432, 62 P. 202 (1900); Wiley v. McDowell, 55 Colo. 236, 238, 133 P. 757
(1913). See Young v. Simpson, 21 Colo. 460, 42 P. 666, 52 Am. St. R. 254
(1895); Heiskell v. Landrum, 23 Colo. 65, 46 P. 120 (1896); Rhode v. Steinmetz,
25 Colo. 308, 55 P. 814 (1898).
<P>So neither the judges of the election nor the courts are authorized to go
beyond what the voter has set down upon his ballot to ascertain his intention.
Wiley v. McDowell, 55 Colo. 236, 133 P. 757 (1913).
<P>But in order to designate his choice a voter must use a cross mark as the
law requires.  Riley v. Trainor, 57 Colo. 155, 140 P. 469 (1914).
<P>Hence, where no cross mark is used anywhere with reference to any of the
candidates for the particular office in question, the ballots ought not to be
counted. Riley v. Trainor, 57 Colo. 155, 140 P. 469 (1914), where the voter
made a cross mark (X) after the name of the candidate for whom he desired to
vote and the question was to ascertain the intent of the voter from the ballot
that was marked with a cross mark substantially as the law required.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-7-111.</H1>
1-7-111.  Disabled registered elector - assistance. (1) (a)  If at any
election, any registered elector declares to the election judges that, by
reason of blindness or other physical disability or inability to read or write,
he or she is unable to prepare the ballot or operate the voting machine without
assistance, the elector shall be entitled, upon making a request, to receive
the assistance of any one of the election judges or, at the elector's option,
any eligible elector selected by the disabled eligible elector.  No person
other than an election judge in the precinct shall be permitted to enter the
voting booth or voting machine as an assistant to more than one elector, unless
the person is the spouse, parent, grandparent, sibling, or child eighteen years
or older of the elector.
<P>(b)  Any person who assists any eligible elector to cast his or her ballot
shall first complete the following voter assistance/disabled voter
self-affirmation form:  "I, ...................., shall not in any way attempt
to persuade or induce the elector to vote in a particular manner nor will I
cast the elector's vote other than as directed by the elector whom I am
assisting."
<P>(2)  Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 1-8-117 and 1-8-118, in
every political subdivision, physically disabled eligible electors shall be
allowed to vote at the absentee voters' polling place on election day.  More
than one absentee voters' polling place may be established in a county for the
purposes of this subsection (2).  Prior to voting, if possible, the disabled
eligible elector intending to vote at the absentee voters' polling place on
election day shall complete the following self-affirmation form.  If the
disabled elector cannot read or write, or is unable to sign his or her name,
the election official or person assisting the elector shall read the form aloud
to the elector, and, upon the affirmation of the elector, will mark that the
elector requesting assistance has affirmed that the facts on the form are true
and correct.   If the disabled elector is able to read and write, he or she
shall complete the voter assistance/disabled voter self-affirmation form.  The
form shall provide:
<P>"I, .........., affirm that I am an eligible elector in this political
subdivision located in the county of .........., state of Colorado; that I
shall vote today at this polling place. I further affirm that I have not, nor
will I, cast a vote by any other means in this election."
<P>(3)  After the voter assistance/disabled voter self-affirmation form is
completed, a corresponding entry shall be made on the back of the printed list
or computer list.  If assistance to a disabled eligible elector occurs at the
precinct polling place, an entry shall be made on the pollbook or list of the
name of each eligible elector assisted and the name of each person assisting.

<P>(2)  The county clerk and recorder, at least one hundred twenty days prior
to a regular special district election or regular election of any other
political subdivision, shall prepare a map of the county showing the location
of the polling places and precinct boundaries utilized in the last November
election.  Copies of the map shall be available for inspection at the office of
the county clerk and recorder and for distribution to the designated election
official of each political subdivision.
<P>(3)  The county clerk and recorder shall maintain a list of owners or
contact persons who, to the clerk's knowledge, may grant permission to
political subdivisions to use the locations identified on the map for polling
places.  The clerk shall, upon request of the designated election official of a
political subdivision, provide a copy of the list, or a part of the list as
requested by the designated election official.

election in November, and at any time prior to any other elections, a governing
body may by resolution cancel the election.  The ballot issues and ballot
questions shall be deemed to have not been submitted and votes cast on the

deemed invalid by action of the governing body.
<P>(3)  If the electors are to consider the election of persons to office and

election official, and in the office of the clerk and recorder for each county
in which the political subdivision is located and, for special districts, a
copy of the notice shall be filed in the office of the division of local
government.  The governing body shall also notify the candidates that the
election was canceled and that they were elected by acclamation.

<P>Failure to pursue remedies under the objection provision does not
constitute waiver of the right of an elector to contest the eligibility of one
to be a candidate of his political party.  Ray v. Mickelson, 196 Colo. 325, 584
P.2d 1215 (1978).
<P>II. APPARENT CONFORMITY.
<P>The secretary of state, in the absence of objection, is not vested with
authority to refuse to certify a nomination because he has some objection to it
for some substantial reason.  Mills v. Newell, 30 Colo. 377, 70 P. 405 (1902).
<P>He may, on his own motion, refuse to file a certificate, based on some
formal ground.  Mills v. Newell, 30 Colo. 377, 70 P. 405 (1902).
<P>But if it is "in apparent conformity" with the applicable provisions the
secretary may not, of his own motion, and in the absence of some objection
based upon matters of substance, refuse to certify the nomination.  Mills v.
Newell, 30 Colo. 377, 70 P. 405 (1902).
<P>The law regards certificates of nomination as having been filed where the
parties presenting them did all that was possible in complying with the
designation and nomination provision even though the secretary of state refused
to file the certificate.  Mills v. Newell, 30 Colo. 377, 70 P. 405 (1902).
<P>The objection provision does not contemplate that void certificates of
nomination can be cured or amended so as to make them valid after the time for
filing such certificates of nomination has expired. O'Connor v. Smithers, 45
Colo. 23, 99 P. 46 (1908).
<P>III. PROCEEDINGS SUMMARY.
<P>The formalities which are required in ordinary civil actions need not be
strictly observed in proceedings based on objections to designations and
nominations.  Phillips v. Curley, 28 Colo. 34, 62 P. 837 (1900).
<P>IV. JURISDICTION.
<P>The filing officers in the first instance and the courts upon review have
jurisdiction to determine the regularity of party conventions and the claims of
rival factions of the same political party to have their nominees placed on the
official ballot.  Spencer v. Maloney, 28 Colo. 38, 62 P. 850 (1900).  See
Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856, 50 P. 858 (1897); Liggett v. Bates,
24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897); Whipple v. Owen, 24 Colo. 319, 50 P. 861
(1897); McCoach v. Whipple, 24 Colo. 379, 51 P. 164 (1897); Whipple v. Broad,
25 Colo. 407, 55 P. 172 (1898); Whipple v. Wheeler, 25 Colo. 421, 55 P. 188
(1898).
<P>The decision of the filing officer as to formal matters in a certificate
of nomination is final.  Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).
<P>But his decisions of matters of substance are reviewable by lower courts.
Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).
<P>And when reviewed by a lower court in the manner prescribed, the decision
of such lower court is final.  Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856
(1897).
<P>Subject only to the power of the supreme court, in its discretion, to
review summarily the judicial proceeding below.  Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo.
303, 50 P. 856 (1897).
<P>V. REVIEW.
<P>A review is ordinarily had of record only, and as made by the lower
tribunal.  Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).
<P>Yet the review may not be so limited.  Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50
P. 856 (1897).
<P>Because of accompanying or explanatory words, the review may be enlarged
so as to embrace the taking of additional evidence, or practically to
constitute a trial de novo. Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).
<P>The review in the trial courts contemplated by the objection provision was
such as the section on settlement of controversies provided. Leighton v. Bates,
24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).
<P>And it is clear that the provision for settlement of controversies
contemplates the taking of evidence where the issues require it. Leighton v.
Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).
<P>The objection provision does not contemplate a review in supreme court of
the same character as that provided for in county or district court. Liggett v.
Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).
<P>Review in the supreme court is to be upon the record as made in the lower
court. Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).
<P>Decision of trial court will not be disturbed except for strong and
persuasive reasons.  Since the decision of the trial court is final, that
decision should not be disturbed except for strong and persuasive reasons.
Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).
<P>The supreme court should interfere if the trial court acts without
jurisdiction, or in excess thereof, or acts arbitrarily, or grossly abuses its
discretion. Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).
<P>Supreme court may in its discretion accept or reject an appeal with
respect to nominations of candidates, and if it elects to accept the appeal, it
may proceed in a summary way to dispose of it.  In re Weber, 186 Colo. 61, 525
P.2d 465 (1974).
<P>The matter of review by the supreme court, in an action to compel a town
clerk to accept and file certificate of nomination and to certify and have
printed on the official ballot the names of certain candidates, is entirely
discretionary with the court.  Luedke v. Todd, 109 Colo. 326, 124 P.2d 932
(1942).
<P>Objection to petition not raised before county clerk cannot be raised on
review.  In a proceeding to protest the placing of nominations upon the
official ballot, an objection that the petition failed to show the authority of
the petitioner to make the protest, if not raised before the county clerk,
cannot be raised on review. Phillips v. Curley, 28 Colo. 34, 62 P. 837 (1900).
<P>In order to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court, in the
exercise of its discretion to review the proceedings of the lower court
determining the validity of objections to certificates of nomination, a
certified copy of the record and judgment of the trial court, or the material
parts thereof, sufficient to present the questions relied upon, with a brief
petition stating the nature of the controversy, the points at issue, and the
errors relied upon, should be filed in the supreme court. Liggett v. Bates, 24
Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).
<P>A motion should then be made, based upon this petition, asking the court
to exercise its appellate jurisdiction, specifying time and place of hearing of
the application. Liggett v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).
<P>And notice of the motion should be served upon the opposing party. Liggett
v. Bates, 24 Colo. 314, 50 P. 860 (1897).
<P>In an action to compel a county clerk to receive and file nominations for
county offices which was refused by him on the ground that no election for such
offices could be held at the ensuing election, where in the absence of one of
the judges of the supreme court the other two disagree as to whether the court
should exercise its discretion to review the judgment of the lower court even
if it has jurisdiction to do so, the proceeding must be dismissed and it is
unnecessary to determine whether or not the court has jurisdiction to review
the judgment of the lower court.  Beach v. Berdel, 31 Colo. 505, 74 P. 1129
(1903).
<P>District judge was interested in the result and disqualified to try cause.
Where a list of nominations for county officers filed with the county clerk was
protested on the ground that the party name assumed was an infringement on the
name of another political party and tended to deceive the voters, a district
judge who had been nominated under the same party name and the nomination filed
with the secretary of state was interested in the result and disqualified to
try the cause, although the judgment in the cause would not directly affect his
own nomination, since it involved the determination of a question which if
raised in the proper tribunal would determine the validity of his own
nomination on the ticket. Phillips v. Curley, 28 Colo. 34, 62 P. 837 (1900).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-4-601.</H1>
1-4-601.  Designation of candidates for primary election. (1)  Assemblies
of the several political parties may make assembly  designations of candidates
for nomination on the primary election ballot. No assembly shall be held later
than sixty-five days preceding the primary election.
<P>(2)  An assembly shall take no more than two ballots for party candidates
for each office to be filled at the next general election.  Every candidate
receiving thirty percent or more of the votes of all duly accredited assembly
delegates who are present and voting on that office shall be certified by
affidavit of the presiding officer and secretary of the assembly. If no
candidate receives thirty percent or more of the votes of all duly accredited
assembly delegates  who are present and voting, a second ballot shall be cast
on all the candidates for that office.  If on the second ballot no candidate
receives thirty percent or more of the votes cast, the two candidates receiving
the highest number of votes shall be certified as candidates for that office by
the assembly.  The certificate of designation by assembly shall state the name
of the office for which each person is a candidate and the candidate's name and
address, shall designate in not more than three words the name of the political
party which the candidate represents, and shall certify that the candidate has
been a member of the political party for the period of time required by party
rule or by law if the party has no such rule.  The candidate's party
affiliation, as shown on the registration books of the county clerk and
recorder, is prima facie evidence of party membership.  The certificate of
designation shall indicate the order of the vote received at the assembly by
candidates for each office, but no assembly shall declare that any one
candidate has received the nomination of the assembly.  The certificate of
designation shall be filed in accordance with section 1-4-604. If two or more
candidates receiving designation under the provisions of this subsection (2)
have received an equal number of votes, the order of certification of
designation shall be determined by lot by the candidates.  The assembly shall
select a vacancy committee for vacancies in designation or nomination only.
<P>(3)  Within ten days after the adjournment of the assembly, each candidate
designated by assembly shall file a written acceptance with the officer with
whom the certificate of designation is filed. The acceptance shall state the
candidate's name in the form in which it is to appear on the ballot.  The name
may include one nickname. If an acceptance is not filed within the specified
time, the candidate shall be deemed to have declined the designation.
<P>(4) (a)  No person is eligible for designation by assembly as a candidate
for nomination at any primary election unless the person has been affiliated
with the political party holding the assembly for a period of at least twelve
months immediately preceding the date of the assembly, as shown by the
registration books of the county clerk and recorder, unless otherwise provided
by party rules.
<P>(b)  Repealed.

<P>Am. Jur.2d.  See 25 Am. Jur.2d, Elections,  156.
<P>Annotator's note. The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>Although boundaries of judicial district are coincident with those of
county, certificate should be filed with secretary of state.  Under the
provision that a certificate of nomination for an office to be filled by the
voters of a district office greater than a county office shall be filed with
the secretary of state, a certificate of nomination for the office of district
attorney of a judicial district should be filed with the secretary of state,
notwithstanding the boundaries of the district were coincident with those of
the county.  Brown v. Van Cise, 69 Colo. 242, 193 P. 495 (1920).
<P>Clerk who wrongfully refuses to accept certificate may be commanded to
file certificate as of the date of presentment.  The county clerk had
wrongfully refused to accept a certificate making nominations for an
approaching election.  In view of the brief time intervening between the
hearing and the day appointed for the election, the court, to avoid the delays
which must attend a remand of the cause, gave judgment commanding the county
clerk to file the certificate as of the date upon which it was presented, and
proceed in the matter as required by law.  McBroom v. Brown, 53 Colo. 412, 127
P. 957 (1912).
<P>Petitioner's name allowed to appear on ballot. Where the secretary of
state accepted and approved the petition filed by petitioner, and no objections
were filed as to the validity of his petition, there was no issue in reference
to his right to appear on the primary ballot as a candidate by petition and his
name did appear.  Anderson v. Mullaney, 166 Colo. 533, 444 P.2d 878 (1968).

<P>I.  GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Am. Jur.2d.  See 25 Am. Jur.2d, Elections,  156.
<P>C.J.S.  See 29 C.J.S., Elections,   106-110.
<P>Annotator's note.  The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>In addition to nominees designated by party assembly, a party member
desirous of the party's nomination at the primary election may become a
candidate by filing a petition signed by the requisite number of the electors
of his party residing within the district from which he seeks to be elected.
Anderson v. Mullaney, 166 Colo. 533, 444 P.2d 878 (1968).
<P>And it is permissible and possible for several candidates for the party's
nomination to be placed on the primary ballot by this procedure.  Anderson v.
Mullaney, 166 Colo. 533, 444 P.2d 878 (1968).
<P>The purpose in allowing nominations by individuals is to confer upon
electors the right to place candidates in nomination under some party name
which they might choose, representing a principle which they desired to support
at the polls. O'Connor v. Smithers, 45 Colo. 23, 99 P. 46 (1908).
<P>II.  ELECTORS SIGNING PETITION.
<P>Certificates not having the requisite number of names have no effect to
nominate candidates, and can only be made valid by the addition of names within
the time required by law to make nominations by individuals.  O'Connor v.
Smithers, 45 Colo. 23, 99 P. 46 (1908). See Whipple v. Kleckner, 25 Colo. 423,
55 P. 163 (1898).
<P>All duplicate names on certificates for the same candidates for the same
office must be eliminated.  The certificates nominating candidates for the
legislative and senatorial districts did not contain the requisite number of
names to make a nomination by individuals, for the obvious reason that all
duplicate names on these certificates for the same candidates for the same
office must be eliminated.  Hence, they were invalid. O'Connor v. Smithers, 45
Colo. 23, 99 P. 46 (1908).
<P>III.  OATH AND AFFIDAVIT.
<P>Voter must not only sign petition but must also sign the oath, and a
failure so to do invalidates the certificate. Cowie v. Means, 39 Colo. 1, 88 P.
485 (1906).
<P>The signature of the elector, statement of residence, and the oath that
the subscriber is an elector are matters of substance. Cowie v. Means, 39 Colo.
1, 88 P. 485 (1906).
<P>Each requirement is to be a check upon the making of false or fraudulent
certificates, and to enable anyone inspecting a certificate to discover the
residence of the subscriber. Cowie v. Means, 39 Colo. 1, 88 P. 485 (1906).
<P>The oath required is a matter of substance, as affording prima facie proof
that the persons so subscribing the certificate did, in fact, subscribe the
certificate, and are, in fact, electors of the state. Cowie v. Means, 39 Colo.
1, 88 P. 485 (1906).
<P>These requirements are essential. Cowie v. Means, 39 Colo. 1, 88 P. 485
(1906).
<P>Where no affidavit is made, the alleged certificate of nomination is void
and of no force or effect, and no duty rested upon defendant as town clerk to
file same or place the names of the candidates mentioned therein upon the
ballot.  Ballew v. Hartman, 118 Colo. 476, 196 P.2d 870 (1948).
<P>Petitions for nomination of candidates held insufficient, where the
affidavit attached to each, although sworn to, was not signed by the signers of
the petition.  Stephen v. Lail, 80 Colo. 49, 248 P. 1012 (1926).  See Cowie v.
Means, 39 Colo. 1, 88 P. 485 (1906).
<P>Where the original petition is void because the oath was not signed by the
voters, that portion of it assuming to appoint a committee to fill vacancies is
likewise void, and such alleged committee has no power to act. Cowie v. Means,
39 Colo. 1, 88 P. 485 (1906).
<P>IV.  AFFILIATION REQUIRED.
<P>The provisions for designation of candidates by petition and by party
assembly require that a person shall be affiliated for one year with the party
in which he seeks to become a candidate for public office.  Anderson v. Kilmer,
134 Colo. 270, 302 P.2d 185 (1956).
<P>And the county clerk's record must indicate the affiliation of that person
with the political party for at least one year prior to the date of the
assembly at which he seeks designation as a candidate for office.  Spain v.
Fischahs, 143 Colo. 464, 354 P.2d 502 (1960).
<P>The record of the county clerk cannot be supplemented or enlarged by parol
evidence.  Spain v. Fischahs, 143 Colo. 464, 354 P.2d 502 (1960).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-4-802.</H1>
1-4-802.  Petitions for nominating unaffiliated candidates.
(1)  Candidates for public offices to be filled at a general or congressional
vacancy election who do not wish to affiliate with a political party may be
nominated, other than by a primary election or a convention, in the following
manner:
<P>(a)  A petition for nominating unaffiliated candidates shall be prepared
which shall contain the name and address of any candidate for the office to be
filled.  The petition shall designate in not more than three words the
political or other name which the signers select.  No name of any political
party shall be used, in whole or in part, for this purpose.
<P>(b)  Each petition shall contain only the name of one candidate for one
office; except that any petition for a candidate for governor shall also
include a candidate for lieutenant governor, and together they shall be
considered joint candidates at the general election.  In the case of
nominations for electors of president and vice president of the United States,
the names of the candidates may be added to the political or other name
designated on the petition.
<P>(c)  Every petition for the office of president and vice president, for
statewide office, for congressional district office, for the office of member
of the general assembly, for district attorney, and for county office shall be
signed by eligible electors residing within the district or political
subdivision in which the officer is to be elected.  The number of signatures of
eligible electors on a petition shall be as follows:
<P>(I)  At least five thousand for the office of president and vice
president;
<P>(II)  The lesser of one thousand or two percent of the votes cast for all
candidates for that office in the most recent general election for any
statewide office;
<P>(III)  The lesser of eight hundred or two percent of the votes cast in the
congressional district in the most recent general election for the office of
member of the United States house of representatives, member of the state board
of education for a congressional district, or member of the board of regents of
the university of Colorado for a congressional district;
<P>(IV)  The lesser of six hundred or two percent of the votes cast in the
senate district in the most recent general election for the office of member of
the state senate;
<P>(V)  The lesser of four hundred or two percent of votes cast in the house
district in the most recent general election for the office of member of the
state house of representatives;
<P>(VI)  The lesser of six hundred fifty or two percent of the votes cast in
the district in the most recent general election for the office of district
attorney; and
<P>(VII)  The lesser of seven hundred fifty or two percent of the votes cast
for all candidates for that office in the most recent general election for any
county office.
<P>(d)  No petition, except petitions for candidates for vacancies to
unexpired terms of representatives in congress and for presidential electors,
shall be circulated or any signatures obtained thereon prior to eighty-four
days before the primary election.
<P>(e)  The petition may designate or appoint upon its face one or more
unaffiliated registered electors as a committee to fill vacancies in accordance
with section 1-4-1002 (4) and (5).  However, in the case of a petition for the
office of state senator or state representative, the petition shall designate
or appoint upon its face three or more unaffiliated registered electors as a
committee to fill vacancies in accordance with section 1-4-1002 (4) and (5) and
section 1-12-203.
<P>(f)  Petitions shall be filed not later than 3 p.m. on the twenty-eighth
day preceding the primary election or 3 p.m. on the fifty-fifth day preceding
the congressional vacancy election.
<P>(g)  No person shall be placed in nomination by petition unless the person
is an eligible elector of the political subdivision or district in which the
officer is to be elected and unless the person was registered as unaffiliated,
as shown on the books of the county clerk and recorder, for at least twelve
months prior to the last date the petition may be filed; except that, if such
nomination is for a nonpartisan election, the person shall be an eligible
elector of the political subdivision or district and be a registered elector,
as shown on the books of the county clerk and recorder, on the date of the
earliest signature on the petition.

<P>I.   General Consideration.
<P>III.   Requisites for Nomination.
<P>IV.   Requirements of Section.
<P>VI.   Protection of Name of Party.
<P>I.  GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Law reviews. For article, "Constitutional Law", which discusses a recent
Tenth Circuit decision dealing with minor party ballot access, see 62 Den. U.
L. Rev. 101 (1985). For article, "Constitutional Law", which discusses recent
Tenth Circuit decisions dealing with minor party ballot access, see 63 Den. U.
L. Rev. 247 (1986).
<P>Annotator's note.  Since  1-4-802 is similar to  1-4-801 as it existed
prior to the 1992 repeal and reenactment of this part 8, a relevant case
construing that provision has been included in the annotations to this section.
For additional cases, see the annotations under former  1-4-801 in the 1980
replacement volume.
<P>An appeal from the denial of an injunction to place a candidate's name on
the ballot for the general election will be dismissed as moot where the
election has come and gone. Thournir v. Buchanan, 710 F.2d 1461 (10th Cir.
1983).
<P>III.  REQUISITES FOR NOMINATION.
<P>No violation of equal protection.  Requirement that each nominating
petition circulated by an individual or political organization contain the name
of a single candidate only does not violate equal protection.  National
Prohibition Party v. State of Colorado, 752 P.2d 80 (Colo. 1988); Libertarian
Party v. Secretary of State, 817 P.2d 998 (Colo. 1991).
<P>The requirement of subsection (1) (i) that a person be registered as
"unaffiliated" for a period of one year as a prerequisite for running for
public office is constitutional.  Thournir v. Meyer, 708 F. Supp. 1183 (D.
Colo. 1989).
<P>IV.  REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION.
<P>The unaffiliation requirement of subsection (1) (i) is not
unconstitutional because it serves the compelling state interest of protecting
the integrity of Colorado's balloting process and it does not unnecessarily or
unfairly impinge on a prospective candidate's right of access to the ballot.
Libertarian Party v. Secretary of State, 817 P.2d 998 (Colo. 1991).
<P>VI.  PROTECTION OF NAME OF PARTY.
<P>Section unenforceable. In light of the Colorado Supreme Court decision in
McBroom v. Brown, 53 Colo. 412, 127 P. 957 (1912), this section which
distinguishes between political parties and political organizations by only
allowing parties to prevent unendorsed candidates from running under the party
name is unenforceable.  Baer v. Meyer, 577 F. Supp. 838 (D. Colo. 1984), aff'd
in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 728 F.2d 471 (10th Cir. 1984).

whom that elector may vote.
<P>(2)  The nomination petition must be filed prior to sixty-six days before
the election date.
<P>(3)  If a school district has an at-large method of representation and if
terms of different lengths are to be filled at a district election, candidates
must designate on the nomination petition the term for which they are running.
<P>(4)  A candidate for the office of school director shall not run as a
candidate of any political party for that school directorship.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-4-1002.</H1>
1-4-1002.  Vacancies in designation or nomination. (1)  Any vacancy in a
party designation occurring after the party assembly at which the designation
was made and more than fifty-five days before the primary election, which is
caused by the declination, death, disqualification, or withdrawal of any person
designated by the assembly as a candidate for nomination, or by failure of the
assembly to make designation of any candidate for nomination or which exists by
reason of the death or resignation of any elective officer after an assembly at
which a candidate could have been designated for nomination for the office at a
primary election had the vacancy then existed, may be filled by the respective
party assembly vacancy committee of the district, county, or state, as
appropriate, depending upon the office for which the vacancy in designation has
occurred. No person is eligible for appointment to fill a vacancy in a party
designation unless that person meets all requirements of candidacy as of the
date of the assembly which made the original designation.
<P>(2)  Any vacancy in a party designation occurring during the fifty-five
days before the primary election or any vacancy in a party nomination occurring
on or after the day of the primary election and more than fifty-five days
before the general election, which is caused by the declination, death,
disqualification, resignation, or withdrawal of any person previously
designated or of any person nominated at the primary election, or which exists
by reason of the declination, death, disqualification, or withdrawal of any
elective officer after a primary election at which a nomination could have been
made for the office had the vacancy then existed, may be filled by the
respective party assembly vacancy committee of the district, county, or state,
as appropriate, depending upon the office for which the vacancy in designation
or nomination has occurred.  No person is eligible for appointment to fill a
vacancy in the party designation or nomination unless that person meets all of
the requirements of candidacy as of the date of the primary election.
<P>(3)  Any vacancy in a party nomination occurring after the convention or
assembly at which the nomination was made and more than fifty-five days before
the congressional vacancy election, caused by the declination, death,
disqualification, or withdrawal of any person nominated at the convention, may
be filled in the same manner required for the original nomination.  If the
original nomination was made by a party convention or assembly which had
delegated to a committee the power to fill vacancies, the committee may proceed
to fill the same vacancy when it occurs.  No person is eligible for appointment
to fill a vacancy in the party nomination unless that person meets all of the
requirements of candidacy as of the date of the convention or assembly at which
the original nomination was made.
<P>(4)  Any vacancy in a nomination for an unaffiliated candidate occurring
after the filing of the petition for nomination and more than fifty-five days
before the general or congressional vacancy election, which is caused by the
declination, death, or withdrawal of any person nominated by petition, may be
filled by the person or persons designated on the petition to fill vacancies.
<P>(5) (a)  The persons designated to fill any of the vacancies in
subsections (1) to (4) of this section shall file any certificate of
designation or nomination to fill the vacancy, together with a written
acceptance signed by the person designated or nominated, with the designated
election official with whom the original certificate or petition was filed.
This filing shall be done no later than the close of business on the
fifty-fifth day before the election affected by the vacancy.
<P>(b)  If the persons designated to fill any of the vacancies in subsections
(1) to (4) of this section decide not to fill a vacancy, they shall in like
manner file a certificate setting  forth the occurrence of the vacancy, stating
they do not intend to fill the vacancy.
<P>(6)  When the secretary of state or the county clerk and recorder receives
a certificate of nomination to fill a vacancy, that official, in certifying the
list of designees or nominees, shall replace the name of the original candidate
with that of the replacement candidate.  In the event the secretary of state
has already certified the list, the secretary of state shall forthwith certify
to the county clerk and recorders of the proper counties the name and
description of the new nominee, the office for which the nomination is made,
and the name of the person for whom the nominee is substituted.   The secretary
of state and the county clerk and recorders shall not accept any certificates
of nomination to fill vacancies after fifty-five days before election day.
<P>(7)  Any vacancy in a statewide or county office, in the office of
district attorney, or in the office of a state senator occurring during a term
of office shall be filled at the next general election with nomination or
designation by the political party as follows:
<P>(a)  If the vacancy occurs prior to the political party assembly, the
designated election official shall notify the chairperson of each major
political party that the office will be on the ballot for the next primary
election, and candidates for the office shall be designated as provided in
section 1-4-601 or 1-4-603.
<P>(b)  If the vacancy occurs after the political party assembly and more
than fifty-five days before the primary election, the designated election
official shall add the office to the notice of election and notify the
chairperson of each major political party that the office will be on the ballot
for the next primary election.  Candidates for the office shall be designated
as provided in section 1-4-603 or by the respective party central committee
vacancy committee for the state, county, judicial district, or state senate
district.
<P>(c)  If the vacancy occurs during the fifty-five days before the primary
election or after the primary election and more than fifty-five days before the
general election, the designated election official shall add the office to the
notice of election for the general election.  Nominations for the office shall
be made by the respective party central committee vacancy committee for the
state, county, judicial district, or state senate district or as provided in
section 1-4-802 for the nomination of unaffiliated candidates.
<P>(8)  Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, if a  political party
has established a rule regarding the length of party affiliation required for a
candidate for the office of United States senator or representative in
congress, and a vacancy in that office occurs, then the party rule applies.

1-4-501.  Only eligible electors eligible for office. (1)  No person
except an eligible elector who is at least eighteen years of age, unless
another age is required by law, is eligible to hold any office in this state.
No person is eligible to be a designee or candidate for office unless that
person fully meets the qualifications of that office as stated in the
constitution and statutes of this state on or before the date the term of that
office begins.  The designated election official shall not certify the name of
any designee or candidate who fails to swear or affirm under oath that he or
she will fully meet the qualifications of the office if elected and who is
unable to provide proof that he or she meets any requirements of the office
relating to registration, residence, or property ownership.  The information
found on the person's voter registration record is admissible as prima facie
evidence of compliance with this section.
<P>(2)  No person is eligible to be a candidate for more than one office at
one time; except that this subsection (2) does not apply to memberships on
different special district boards. This subsection (2) shall not prohibit a
candidate or elected official of any political subdivision from being a
candidate or member of the board of directors of any special district or
districts in which he or she is an eligible elector, unless otherwise
prohibited by law.
<P>(3)  The qualification of any candidate may be challenged by an eligible
elector of the political subdivision within five days after the designated
election official's statement is issued that certifies the candidate to the
ballot.  The challenge shall be made by verified petition setting forth the
facts alleged concerning the qualification of the candidate and shall be filed
in the district court in the county in which the political subdivision is
located.  The hearing on the qualification of the candidate shall be held in
not less than five nor more than ten days after the date the election
official's statement is issued that certifies the candidate to the ballot.  The
court shall hear the testimony and other evidence and, within forty-eight hours
after the close of the hearing, determine whether the candidate meets the
qualifications for the office for which the candidate has declared.  Provisions
of section 13-17-101, C.R.S., regarding frivolous, groundless, or vexatious
actions shall apply to this section.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-10-101.</H1>
1-10-101.  Canvassers for partisan elections - appointment, fees, oaths.
(1) (a)  At least fifteen days before any primary, general, or congressional
vacancy election, the county chairpersons of each of the two major political
parties in each county shall certify to the county clerk and recorder the
appointment of an eligible elector who is a resident of the county to act as a
member of the county board of canvassers.  The two appointees, together with
the county clerk and recorder, constitute the county board of canvassers.
<P>(b)  If for any reason an appointee to the county board of canvassers
refuses, fails, or is unable to serve, the appointee shall notify the county
clerk and recorder.  The county clerk and recorder,  by the speediest and most
convenient method, shall notify the county chairperson of the political party
to which the appointee belongs.   The county chairperson shall forthwith
appoint another person to the county board of canvassers. If the political
party has no county chairperson or vice-chairperson or if a vacancy in the
appointment occurs on the date of the meeting of the county board of canvassers
so that there can be no specific compliance with the provisions of this
section, the county clerk and recorder shall make the appointment or shall fill
the vacancy as nearly in compliance with the intention of this section as
possible.
<P>(2)  Each member of the county board of canvassers except the county clerk
and recorder shall receive a minimum fee of fifteen dollars for each day on
which the member is actually engaged in opening election returns and making
abstracts of the votes cast.  The fee shall be set by the county clerk and
recorder and shall be paid by the county for which the service is performed.
<P>(3)  Before beginning their duties as members of the county board of
canvassers, the members of the board shall take an oath in the following form:
"I,  ....................,  do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am an eligible
elector in precinct  ....,  in the county of ....................; that I am a
registered member of the ..............  party as shown on the registration
books of the county clerk and recorder; and that I will faithfully perform the
duties required of a member of the county board of canvassers."

1-10-201.  Canvassers for nonpartisan elections. (1)  Except as provided
in section 1-10-202, at least fifteen days before any nonpartisan election, the
governing body which called the election shall appoint at least one member of
the governing body and at least one eligible elector of the political
subdivision who is not a member of the governing body to assist the designated
election official in the survey of returns.  The persons so appointed and the
designated election official constitute the board of canvassers for the
election.
<P>(2)  No member of the board of canvassers who is a member of the governing
body or the member's spouse shall have a direct interest in the election unless
all of the members of the governing body have a direct interest in the
election, except the designated election official.  No member of the board of
canvassers who is not a member of the governing body or a member's spouse shall
have a direct interest in the election unless all of the eligible electors have
a direct interest in the election.
<P>(3)  If for any reason any person appointed as a member of the board of
canvassers refuses, fails, or is unable to serve, that appointed person shall
notify the designated election official, who shall appoint another person with
the same qualifications, if available, to the board of canvassers.
<P>(4)  Each member of the board of canvassers, except members of the
governing body, shall receive a minimum fee of fifteen dollars for each day on
which the member is actually engaged in opening election returns and making
abstracts of the votes cast.  The fee shall be set by the designated election
official and shall be paid by the political subdivision for which the service

<P>(5)  Before beginning their duties as members of the board of canvassers,
the members of the board of canvassers shall take an oath in the following
form:  "I,                 , do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am registered
to vote in the state of Colorado and that I will faithfully perform the duties
required of a member of the board of canvassers."  In the event that the county
board of canvassers serves as the board of canvassers for a political
subdivision, no oath other than the oath taken pursuant to section 1-10-101
shall be required.

candidate is qualified to hold the office for which the elector's vote was
cast.
<P>(3)  If the elector has cast more votes for an office than he or she is

1-9-203.  Challenge questions asked person intending to vote. (1)  If a
person intending to vote is challenged as not eligible, one of the election
judges shall tender to the elector the following oath or affirmation: "I do
solemnly swear or affirm that I will fully and truly answer all questions that
are put to me concerning my place of residence and my qualifications as an
eligible elector at this election."
<P>(2)  If the person is challenged as not eligible because the person is not
a citizen, an election judge shall ask the following question:
<P>(a)  Are you a citizen of the United States?
<P>(b)  (Deleted by amendment, L. 93, p. 1432,  109, effective July 1, 1993.)
<P>(3)  If the person is challenged as not eligible because the person has
not resided in this state and precinct for thirty days immediately preceding
the election, an election judge shall ask the following questions:
<P>(a)  Have you resided in this state and precinct for the thirty days
immediately preceding this election?
<P>(b)  Have you been absent from this state during the thirty days
immediately preceding this election, and during that time have you maintained a
home or domicile elsewhere?
<P>(c)  If so, when you left, was it for a temporary purpose with the intent
of returning, or did you intend to remain away?
<P>(d)  Did you, while absent, look upon and regard this state as your home?
<P>(e)  Did you, while absent, vote in any other state or any territory of
the United States?
<P>(4)  If the person is challenged as not eligible because the person is not
eighteen years of age or older, an election judge shall ask the following
question: To the best of your knowledge and belief, are you eighteen years of
age or older?
<P>(5)  If the person is challenged as not eligible because the person is not
a property owner or the spouse of a property owner, an election judge shall ask
the following questions:
<P>(a)  Are you a property owner or the spouse of a property owner in this
political subdivision and therefore eligible to vote?
<P>(b)  What is the address or, for special district elections where an
address is not available, the location of the property which entitles you to
vote in this election?
<P>(6)  An election judge shall put all other questions to the person
challenged as may be necessary to test the person's qualifications as an
eligible elector at the election.
<P>(7)  If the person challenged answers satisfactorily all of the questions
the person shall sign on the challenge form after the printed questions.  The
election judge shall indicate in the proper place on the challenge form whether
the challenge was withdrawn or whether the challenged elector refused to answer
the questions and left the polling place without voting.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-4-1203.</H1>
1-4-1203.  Names on ballots. (1)  The secretary of state shall certify the
names and party affiliations of the candidates to be placed on the presidential
primary election ballots fifty days before the election is to be held.  The
only candidates whose names shall be placed on ballots for the election shall
be those candidates who:
<P>(a)  Are eligible to receive payments pursuant to the federal
"Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act", 26 U.S.C. sec. 9031 et
seq., at the time candidates' names are to be certified by the secretary of
state pursuant to this subsection (1); and
<P>(b)  Are seeking the nomination for president of a political party whose
nominee for president of the United States received at least twenty percent of
the votes cast by eligible electors in Colorado at the last presidential
election; and
<P>(c)  Have submitted to the secretary of state, by the second day of
January in the year of the presidential primary, a notarized candidate's
statement of intent together with either a nonrefundable filing fee of five
hundred dollars or a petition signed by at least five thousand eligible
electors of the candidate's political party who reside in the state.
<P>(2)  The names of candidates appearing on any presidential  primary ballot
shall be in alphabetical order.
<P>(3)  Pursuant to a political party's rules, the party may request the
secretary of state to provide a place on the primary ballot for electors who
have no presidential candidate preference to register a vote to send a
noncommitted delegate to the political party's national convention. To be
valid, this request must be received by the secretary of state on or before the
forty-ninth day before the presidential primary election.
<P>(4)  Challenges concerning the right of any candidate's name to appear on
the ballot of the presidential primary election shall be made in writing and
filed with the secretary of state no later than five days after the filing
deadline for candidates.  Challenges may be submitted by fax if an original is
received by the secretary of state no later than five days after the deadline
for filing the challenge. Challenges shall give written notice in a summary
manner of an alleged impropriety.  If a challenge is made, notice of the
challenge shall be mailed forthwith to all candidates who may be affected. The
secretary of state shall hear a challenge within ten days after the challenge
is filed and shall pass upon the validity of all alleged improprieties, whether
of form or substance, and shall decide challenges and issue findings of fact
and conclusions within seventy-two hours after the hearing.  The party filing
the challenge has the burden to sustain the challenge by a preponderance of the
evidence.  The secretary of state's decisions upon matters of substance are
open to review, if prompt application is made, as provided in section 1-1-113.
The remedy in all cases shall be summary, and the decision of any other court
having jurisdiction is final and not subject to review by any other court;
except that the supreme court, in the exercise of its discretion, may review
any judicial proceeding in a summary way.

election official, then the secretary of state is the appropriate official to
conduct the recount. The designated election official shall be an official
observer during any recount conducted pursuant to this subsection (1).

1-13-102.  Sufficiency of complaint - judicial notice. Irregularities or
defects in the mode of calling, giving notice of, convening, holding, or
conducting any general, primary, or congressional vacancy election authorized
by law constitute no defense to a prosecution for a violation of this code.
When an offense is committed in relation to any general, primary, or
congressional vacancy election, an indictment, information, or complaint for
such offense is sufficient if it alleges that such election was authorized by
law without stating the call or notice of the election, the names of the judges
holding such election, or the names of the persons voted for at such election.
Judicial notice shall be taken of the holding of any general, primary, or
congressional vacancy election.

<P>C.J.S. See 29 C.J.S., Elections,   89, 91-93.
<P>Annotator's note. The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>The provision for acceptance of a nomination is so plain that it needs no
construction other than that which its own language imports. O'Connor v.
Smithers, 45 Colo. 23, 99 P. 46 (1908).
<P>No convention or body of men can compel another to be a candidate for
office against his will. O'Connor v. Smithers, 45 Colo. 23, 99 P. 46 (1908).
<P>Only the political parties have the right to nominate by a convention or
nominating committee.  Schafer v. Whipple, 25 Colo. 400, 55 P. 180 (1898).
<P>Nominees by either of the two leading political parties are not required
to file an acceptance. O'Connor v. Smithers, 45 Colo. 23, 99 P. 46 (1908).
<P>II.  MORE CANDIDATES THAN OFFICES
<P>TO FILL.
<P>The purpose of limiting the number of names on a certificate of nomination
to the number of offices to be filled is to prevent the same persons nominating
candidates for the same office by certificate as individuals under two or more
party names. O'Connor v. Smithers, 45 Colo. 23, 99 P. 46 (1908).
<P>An elector once having exercised the right to join in a certificate as an
individual, nominating a candidate for office under some name adopted by the
signers, cannot join in nominating the same person for the same office under
some other name. O'Connor v. Smithers, 45 Colo. 23, 99 P. 46 (1908).
<P>III.  FILING CERTIFICATE WITH SECRETARY OF STATE.
<P>Certificates of nomination must be presented for filing at the office of
the secretary of state to some person in charge thereof during business hours.
Cowie v. Means, 39 Colo. 1, 88 P. 485 (1906).
<P>Certificates not filed in office of the secretary of state. Certain
alleged certificates of nomination to fill vacancies were handed for filing to
the secretary of state, on board a train bound for another city, at the union
depot in Denver, preceding the general election to be held on November 6.  It
was held, that such action did not constitute a legal filing of such
certificates, as of that date, it being necessary to tender such certificates
for filing at the office of the secretary of state to some person in charge
during business hours. Cowie v. Means, 39 Colo. 1, 88 P. 485 (1906).
<P>IV.  MISCELLANEOUS.
<P>The convention revoked nomination power of the committee.  A party
convention sat two days, and on the first day it adopted a resolution
empowering a committee to nominate the ticket which it had assembled; on the
second day, without expressly rescinding the resolution, it proceeded to
nominate a full ticket and then adjourned sine die.  It was held that the
action of the convention on the second day was a revocation of the power
delegated to the committee.  Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856 (1897).
<P>Secretary of state has no power to decide between two sets of
nominations.  When two sets of nominations, both by conventions purporting to
have been held by the same political party, and each in apparent conformity
with this section, are certified to the secretary of state, he has no power to
decide between them, but should certify both tickets to the county clerks in
order that both may be printed upon the official ballots.  People ex rel. Eaton
v. District Court, 18 Colo. 26, 31 P. 339 (1892).

convention of delegates of a political party or any committee authorized by
resolution of the convention shall nominate a candidate to fill a vacancy in

for the state convention, stating the number of delegates from each county and
the method of their selection.
<P>(c)  No convention shall be held later than the twentieth day from the
date of the order issued by the governor.

(d), if a political party has established a rule regarding the length of party
affiliation which is necessary to be eligible for nomination by convention for
the office of representative in congress, the party rule shall apply.
<P>(2)  The nomination to fill the vacancy in the unexpired  term of a
representative in congress made by the political party convention or a
committee authorized by the convention shall be certified by affidavit of the

<P>Although nominee has already accepted a nomination for the same office
upon another ticket, the secretary of state is justified in refusing to certify
it for a place on the ballot where nominee fails to file his acceptance.
O'Connor v. Smithers, 45 Colo. 23, 99 P. 46 (1908).
<P>Without an express written acceptance there is just as much a vacancy as
if a nominee by convention should expressly decline to accept.  O'Connor v.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-12-203.</H1>
1-12-203.  Vacancies in general assembly. (1)  In the event of a vacancy
in the general assembly caused by the death or resignation of a member who has
been sworn into office or caused by the death or resignation of a member who
has been elected to a seat but who has not yet been sworn into office, the
vacancy shall be filled by the appropriate vacancy committee, if any, as
provided in section 1-3-103 (1) (d), of the same political party and of the
same representative or senatorial district represented by the former member
whose seat is vacant. If the member was unaffiliated with a political party,
then the vacancy shall be filled by the vacancy committee designated on the
petition for nomination pursuant to section 1-4-802 (1) (e).  The vacancy shall
be filled until the next general election after the vacancy occurs, when the
vacancy shall be filled by election.
<P>(2)  No vacancy committee may select a person to fill a vacancy at a
meeting held pursuant to this section unless a written notice announcing the
time and location of the vacancy committee meeting was mailed to each of the
committee members at least six days prior to such meeting by the chairperson of
the central committee which selected the members.   Mailing of the notice is
effective when the notice is properly addressed and deposited in the United
States mail, with first-class postage prepaid.
<P>(3)  The vacancy committee, by a majority vote of its members present and
voting at a meeting called for that purpose, shall select a person who
possesses the constitutional qualifications for a member of the general
assembly and who is affiliated with the same political party, if any, shown on
the registration books of the county clerk and recorder as the former member
whose seat is vacant.  No meeting shall be held until a quorum is present
consisting of two-thirds of the voting membership of the vacancy committee.  No
member of the vacancy committee may vote by proxy.  The committee shall certify
the selection to the secretary of state within ten days from the date the
vacancy occurs.  If the vacancy committee fails to certify a selection within
ten days, the governor, within five days, shall fill the vacancy by appointing
a person having the qualifications set forth in this subsection (3).  The name
of the person selected or appointed shall be certified to the secretary of
state, who shall certify the name to the appropriate house of the general
assembly. The person, after having qualified and taken the oath of office,
shall immediately assume the duties of office and shall serve until the next
convening of the general assembly following the election certification and
qualification of a successor.
<P>(4)  If the vacancy is caused by the resignation of a member of the
general assembly and the letter of resignation gives an effective date of
resignation that is later than the date the letter of resignation is submitted,
the vacancy committee may meet no more than twenty days prior to the effective
date of the resignation for the purposes of nominating a person to fill the
vacancy.  The certification of the nominee of the vacancy committee to the
secretary of state may not be made prior to the effective date of the
resignation; further, should the member of the general assembly withdraw the
letter of resignation prior to the effective date, the person nominated by the
vacancy committee may not be certified to the secretary of state.
<P>(5)  If the vacancy is caused by the death of a member-elect of the
general assembly who has been elected to office but who has not yet been sworn
in, the vacancy committee shall meet no more than ten days after the death of
the general assembly member-elect to fill the vacancy.  The certification of
the nomination of the vacancy committee to the secretary of state may be made
prior to the convening of the general assembly but shall not take effect until
the effective date of the vacancy, which is the first day the general assembly
convenes.

the ballot for a general or congressional vacancy election shall be entitled to
have no more than one watcher at any one time in each precinct polling place in
the county.  The chairperson of the county central committee of each major
political party, the issue committee, the write-in or unaffiliated candidate

<P>I.  GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Annotator's note.  Since  1-7-106 is similar to  1-7-104 as it existed
prior to the 1992 repeal and reenactment of article 7 of this title, a relevant
case construing that provision has been included in the annotations to this
section.  For additional cases, see the annotations under former  1-7-104 in
the 1980 replacement volume.
<P>Designation of poll watchers for political organizations is not required
in order to ensure constitutional access to the voting process.  Baer v. Meyer,

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-1-103.</H1>
1-1-103.  Election code liberally construed. (1)  This code shall be
liberally construed so that all legally qualified electors may be registered
and permitted to vote, those who are not legally qualified electors may be kept
from registering to vote, and those who have become ineligible may be removed
from the registration books, in order to prevent fraud and corruption in
elections.
<P>(2)  It is also the intent of the general assembly that
non-English-speaking citizens, like all other citizens, should be encouraged to
vote.   Therefore, appropriate efforts should be made to minimize obstacles to
registration by citizens who lack  sufficient skill in English to register
without assistance.

elected entitles that person to take office when the term of office begins,

received a certificate, the judgment annuls the certificate.  If the court
finds that no person was legally elected, the judgment shall set aside the

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-11-213.</H1>
1-11-213.  Rules for conducting contests in district court. (1)  The style
and form of process, the manner of service of process and papers, the fees of
officers, and judgment for costs and execution shall be according to the rules
and practice of the district court.
<P>(2)  Change of venue may be taken from any district court for any cause in
which changes of venue might be taken in civil or criminal actions.  The
decisions of any district court are subject to appellate review as provided by
law and the Colorado appellate rules.
<P>(3)  Before the district court is required to take jurisdiction of the
contest, the contestor shall file with the clerk of the court a bond,  with
sureties, running to the contestee and conditioned to pay all costs in case of
failure to maintain the contest.  The judge shall determine the sufficiency of
the bond and, if it is sufficient, approve it.
<P>(4)  The contestor, within ten days after the official survey of returns
has been filed with the designated election official, shall file in the office
of the clerk of the district court a written statement of the intention to
contest the election, setting forth the name of the contestor, that the
contestor is an eligible elector of the political subdivision, the name of the
contestee, the office or ballot issue or ballot question being contested, the
time of the election, and the particular grounds for the contest.  The
statement shall be verified upon information and belief by the affidavit of the
contestor or of an eligible elector of the political subdivision.  If the
contest is based upon a ballot issue or ballot question, the political
subdivision or subdivisions for which the ballot issue or ballot question was
decided shall be named as a contestee.  If a written statement of intent to
contest the election is filed more than ten days after the completion of the
official survey of returns, no court shall have jurisdiction over the contest.
<P>(5)  The clerk of the district court shall then issue a summons in the
ordinary form, in which the contestor shall be named as plaintiff and the
contestee as defendant, stating the court to which the action is being brought,
the political subdivision for which the contest is filed, and a brief statement
of the grounds for contest as set forth in the contestor's statement.  The
summons shall be served upon the contestee and political subdivision in the
same manner as other district court summonses are served in this state, within
ten days after the statement of intention is filed.
<P>(6)  The contestee, within ten days after the service of the summons,
shall file an answer with the clerk of court, which admits or specifically
denies each allegation of the statement and asserts any counterstatement on
which the contestee relies as entitling him or her to the office to which
elected.
<P>(7)  If a contestor alleges the reception of illegal votes or the
rejection of legal votes as the grounds for the contest, a list of the eligible
electors who so voted or offered to vote shall be set forth in the statement of
the contestor and likewise in the answer of contestee if the same grounds are
alleged in the counterstatement.
<P>(8)  When the answer of the contestee contains a new matter constituting a
counterstatement, within ten days after the answer is filed, the contestor
shall file a reply with the clerk of court admitting or specifically denying,
under oath, each allegation contained in the counterstatement.

<P>(e)  That, for any reason, another candidate was legally elected to the
office.
<P>(2)  For the purpose of this part 2, if the election or nomination of
either the governor or lieutenant governor is found to be invalid for any
reason, the finding shall not in any way be construed to invalidate the
election or nomination of the other joint candidate.
<P>(3)  The result of any election to determine a ballot issue or ballot
question may be contested on any of the following grounds:
<P>(a)  That illegal votes were received or legal votes were rejected at the

<P>Pursuant to the constitutional mandate of Colo. Const., art. VII,  12, the
procedure to be followed in election contests was enacted.  Cox v.
Starkweather, 128 Colo. 89, 260 P.2d 587 (1953).
<P>II.  CAUSES OF CONTEST.
<P>A.  In General.
<P>In an election contest the statement of contest must bring the case within
one of the enumerated causes constituting grounds for contest.  Lewis v.
Boynton, 25 Colo. 486, 55 P. 732 (1898).
<P>For, in an election contest, the contestor should be able to show some
good reason for the contest.  Boger v. Smith, 77 Colo. 475, 238 P. 57 (1925).
See Todd v. Stewart, 14 Colo. 286, 23 P. 426 (1890); Smith v. Harris, 18 Colo.
274, 32 P. 616 (1893).
<P>And in the absence of some definite and specific assertion, a court will
assume that there are none to be made.  Boger v. Smith, 77 Colo. 475, 238 P. 57
(1925).  See Todd v. Stewart, 14 Colo. 286, 23 P. 426 (1890); Smith v. Harris,
18 Colo. 274, 32 P. 616 (1893).
<P>Moreover, a statement of contest not vulnerable to demurrer (now dismissal
for failure to state a claim) may be assailable on other grounds, e.g., that it
is ambiguous, unintelligible, and uncertain.  Boger v. Smith, 77 Colo. 475, 238
P. 57 (1925).  See Collins v. Heath, 76 Colo. 600, 233 P. 838 (1925).
<P>And contestors are without right to amend their statement of contest by
supplying the very thing which was essential in the first instance to state a
ground of contest and give the court jurisdiction.  Town of Sugar City v. Board
of Comm'rs, 57 Colo. 432, 140 P. 809 (1914).
<P>Causes of contest incorporated by reference. The causes of contest are,
insofar as applicable, incorporated by reference into provisions requiring a
contestor of the election of county officers to file a written statement
setting forth, among other things, the causes of the contest, and hence also
into provisions relating to contests in special district elections.  Jardon v.
Meadowbrook-Fairview Metropolitan Dist., 190 Colo. 528, 549 P.2d 762 (1976).
<P>B.  Causes.
<P>Eligibility is to be determined at the date of qualifying. Cox v.
Starkweather, 128 Colo. 89, 260 P.2d 587 (1953).
<P>And the word "eligible" has reference to the capacity not of being elected
to office, but of holding office.  Cox v. Starkweather, 128 Colo. 89, 260 P.2d
587 (1953).
<P>Thus it is wholly immaterial whether contestee is qualified at the time of
election when at the time of taking office his eligibility exists.  Cox v.
Starkweather, 128 Colo. 89, 260 P.2d 587 (1953).
<P>For the eligibility of a candidate to office is to be ascertained as of
the time of his entering upon the duties of the office.  Cox v. Starkweather,
128 Colo. 89, 260 P.2d 587 (1953).
<P>An election will not be set aside for irregularities unless they affect
the result of the election.  City of Loveland v. Western Light &amp  Power Co., 65
Colo. 55, 173 P. 717 (1918); Suttle v. Sullivan, 131 Colo. 519, 283 P.2d 636
(1955).  See People v. Keeling, 4 Colo. 129 (1878); Kellogg v. Hickman, 12
Colo. 256, 21 P. 325 (1888); Todd v. Stewart, 14 Colo. 286, 23 P. 426 (1890);
Allen v. Glynn, 17 Colo. 338, 29 P. 670, 31 Am. St. R. 304, 15 L.R.A. 743
(1892); Smith v. Harris, 18 Colo. 274, 32 P. 616 (1893); People ex rel. Johnson
v. Earl, 42 Colo. 238, 94 P. 294 (1908); Littlejohn v. People ex rel. Desch, 52
Colo. 217, 121 P. 159 1913D Ann. Cas. 610 (1911).
<P>The causes for contest make no provision for a contest of an election upon
the removal of a county seat, for the only election contests authorized are
those of officers.  Accordingly, it is also clear that there is no remedy by
quo warranto, for that remedy is only employed to test the right of an officer
or franchise.  People v. Board of County Comm'rs, 6 Colo. 202 (1882).
<P>Similarly, failure of election officials to issue absentee ballots upon
oral application, although they had previously promised to do so, amounts to
nothing as a ground of contest.  Graham v. Swift, 123 Colo. 309, 228 P.2d 969
(1951).
<P>And an allegation that the name of the contestee was unlawfully printed
upon the official ballot under the name and emblem of a political party of
which he was not the nominee, that the filing of the certificate of nomination
of contestee as the nominee of such political party was the result of a
fraudulent conspiracy between contestee and the county clerk,  and that by
reason of having his name so printed under the name and emblem of the said
political party he had counted for him a large number of votes to which he was
not entitled, sufficient to reduce the number of his votes below the number
cast for contestor, does not state a cause for contest under this section.
Rather, it was contestor's duty to make his objection to the printing of
contestee's name on the official ballot under the name and emblem to which he
was not entitled in seasonable time and in the manner provided by the election
law, and failing to do so, he cannot be heard after election to urge such
objections when to uphold them would be to overthrow the expressed will of a
majority of the legal voters of the county.  Lewis v. Boynton, 25 Colo. 486, 55
P. 732 (1898).

1-11-215.  Recount in contests for county and nonpartisan elections. If,
at trial of any election contest as provided in sections 1-11-214 and this
section, the statement or counterstatement alleges an error in the survey of
returns sufficient to change the result, the district judge has the power to
order a recount of the ballots cast or the votes tabulated in the precincts in
which the alleged error was made.  The court may also require the production
before it of witnesses, documents, records, and other evidence as may have or
contain information regarding the legality of any vote cast or counted for
either of the contesting candidates or a ballot issue or ballot question, or
concerning the correct number of votes cast for a candidate or a ballot issue
or ballot question.  The court may order the returns corrected in accordance
with the evidence presented and the court's findings.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-11-208.</H1>
1-11-208.  Contests for state senator or representative. (1)  The election
of any person as a state senator or a member of the state house of
representatives may be contested by any eligible elector of the district to be
represented by the senator or representative.  Each house of the general
assembly shall hear and determine election contests of its own members.
<P>(2)  The contestor, within ten days after the completion of the official
survey of the returns, shall file in the office of the secretary of state a
verified statement of intention to contest the election, setting forth the name
of the contestor, that the contestor is an eligible elector of the district,
the name of the contestee, the office being contested, the time of the
election, and the particular grounds for the contest, and shall serve a copy
upon the contestee.   The contestor shall file with the secretary of state a
bond, with sureties, running to the contestee and conditioned to pay all costs
in case of failure to maintain the contest. The secretary of state shall
determine the sufficiency of the bond, and, if it is sufficient, approve it.
<P>(3)  The contestee, within ten days after personal service of the
statement, shall file in the office of the secretary of state an answer, duly
verified, admitting or specifically denying each allegation and containing any
new matter or counterstatement which the contestee believes may entitle him or
her to retain the seat in the general assembly to which elected.  The contestee
shall serve a copy upon the contestor.
<P>(4)  When the answer of the contestee contains new matter constituting a
counterstatement, the contestor, within ten days after the service of the
answer, shall file in the office of the secretary of state a reply admitting or
specifically denying under oath each allegation contained in the
counterstatement, and shall serve a copy upon the contestee.

<P>Annotator's note. Since  1-11-208 is similar to  1-11-206 as it existed
prior to the 1992 repeal and reenactment of article 1 of this title, a relevant
case construing that provision has been included in the annotations to this
section.
<P>Authority of courts to determine election controversies when no candidate
declared duly elected.  State constitutional provisions and statutes permitting
general assembly to judge election of members does not limit subject matter
jurisdiction of district court to hear controversies related to elections where
no candidate is yet declared duly elected by secretary of state.  Meyer v.
Lamm, 846 P.2d 862 (Colo. 1993) (decided under former  1-11-206).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-11-209.</H1>
1-11-209.  Depositions in contests for state senator or representative.
(1)  Either party, at the time the statement or answer is served, may serve
upon the adverse party reasonable notice of taking depositions to be used at
trial of the contest for state senator or state representative. Immediately
after joining issue of fact, both parties shall proceed with all reasonable
diligence to take any depositions they may desire to use at trial.  Nothing in
this subsection (1) shall abridge the right of either party to take depositions
upon reasonable notice prior to the joining of issue in relation to any of the
matters in controversy; but a failure to take depositions before the joining of
issue shall not be held as laches against either party to the contest.
<P>(2)  If, upon the completion of taking any depositions, the adverse party
has any witnesses present before the officer taking the depositions whose
testimony the adverse party may wish to use in rebuttal of the depositions, the
adverse party may proceed immediately to take the deposition of the rebutting
witness before the officer, upon giving written notice to the other party or
the other party's attorney.  The officer shall attach to the depositions a copy
of the notice with proof of service and shall return the rebuttal depositions
in the same manner provided for returning depositions in chief.  The party
taking a deposition shall pay all costs of taking the deposition and its
return.
<P>(3)  The time for taking depositions to be used at trial of the contest
shall expire three days prior to the meeting of the next general assembly.
Both parties may take depositions at the same time, but neither party shall
take depositions at more than one place at the same time. Nothing in this
subsection (3) shall be construed to abridge the right of either house of the
general assembly, upon good cause shown, to extend the time to take
depositions, or to send for and examine any witness, or to take any testimony
it may desire to use on trial of the contest, or to order a recount of the
ballots if there has been an error in surveying the returns in any county or
precinct.
<P>(4)  Any county or district judge of or for a county in the judicial
district where a contested election case arises may issue subpoenas, compel the
attendance of witnesses, take depositions, and certify depositions according to
the rules of the district court.
<P>(5)  The officer before whom the depositions are taken, upon the
completion thereof, shall certify the depositions immediately, shall enclose
the depositions, and the notices for taking the depositions, and the proofs of
service of the notices in an envelope, and shall seal and transmit the envelope
by mail or in person by a sworn officer, to the secretary of state, with an
endorsement showing the nature of the papers, the names of the contesting
parties, and the house of the general assembly before which the contest is to
be tried.

1-11-214.  Trial and appeals in contests for county and nonpartisan
elections. (1)  Immediately after the issue is joined, the district judge shall

ten days after the issue was joined.  The trial shall take precedence over all
other business of the court.  Any depositions to be used in the trial may be
taken upon four days' notice before any officer authorized to take depositions.
The testimony at trial may be made orally or by depositions. The district judge
shall cause the testimony to be taken in full and filed in the cause.  The
trial shall be conducted according to district court rules and practice.
<P>(2)  An appeal from the judgment may be taken to the supreme court, in the
same manner as other cases tried in the district court.  The appeal shall be
filed, the bill of exceptions settled, the bond for costs executed and filed,
and the record transmitted to the clerk of the supreme court within twenty days
from the date the judgment is entered. The supreme court shall advance the case
to the head of the calendar and shall hear and determine the matter with all
reasonable dispatch.

1-11-203.  Contests arising out of primary elections. (1)  All election
contests arising out of a primary election, except contests for national or
state offices, shall be summarily adjudicated by the district court sitting for
the political subdivision within which a contest arises. The court which first
acquires jurisdiction of any contest shall have original jurisdiction, subject
to appellate review as provided by law and the Colorado appellate rules.  In
all cases involving contests for state offices, the supreme court shall take

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-7-116.</H1>
1-7-116.  Coordinated elections. (1)  If more than one political
subdivision holds an election on the same day in November and the eligible
electors for each such election are the same or the boundaries overlap, the
county clerk and recorder shall be the coordinated election official and shall
conduct the elections on behalf of all political subdivisions that are not
utilizing the mail ballot procedure set forth in sections 1-7.5-101 to
1-7.5-112.  As used in this subsection (1), "political subdivision" shall
include the state, counties, municipalities, school districts, and special
districts formed pursuant to title 32, C.R.S.
<P>(2)  The political subdivisions for which the county clerk and recorder
will conduct the coordinated election shall enter into an agreement with the
county clerk and recorder for the county or counties in which the political
subdivision is located concerning the conduct of the coordinated election.  The
agreement shall be signed no less than sixty days prior to the scheduled
election.  The agreement shall include but not be limited to the following:
<P>(a)  Allocation of the responsibilities between the county clerk and
recorder and the political subdivisions for the preparation and conduct of the
coordinated election; and
<P>(b)  Provision for a reasonable sharing of the actual cost of the
coordinated election among the county and the political subdivisions.  For such
purpose, political subdivisions are not responsible for sharing any portion of
the usual costs of maintaining the office of the county clerk and recorder,
including but not limited to overhead costs and personal services costs of
permanent employees, except for such costs that are shown to be directly
attributable to conducting coordinated elections on behalf of political
subdivisions.
<P>(3)  Notwithstanding the provision for independent mail ballot elections
in subsection (1) of this section, the designated election official or the
official's designee for the state or a political subdivision conducting an
election in November, shall prepare to transmit to the county clerk and
recorder for the county or counties in which the political subdivision is
located at least twenty-five days before the election any notice that the
political subdivision shall distribute pursuant to section 20 (3) (b) of
article X of the Colorado constitution.  It shall be the responsibility of the
county clerk and recorder to mail the required notices or notice package.

1-10-304.  Request by candidate supporters. If it appears, as evidenced by
the survey of returns, that any candidate failed to be nominated or elected by
more than the number of required votes provided in section 1-10-301, 1-10-302,
or 1-10-303, the losing candidate may submit a certified written request for a
recount at the expense of the person making the request or the losing political
party or organization.  This request shall be filed within thirty days after
the general or congressional vacancy election or within fifteen days after the
primary election or any other election. Before conducting the recount, the
designated election official shall notify the other candidate or candidates and
shall determine the cost and notify the requesting candidate. If the recount is
for an office greater than a county office, the cost shall be determined by the
secretary of state who shall notify the candidate.  The candidate or the losing
political party or organization shall pay on demand the cost of the recount to
the county clerk and recorder for a recount of a county office, to the
secretary of state for a recount of a congressional, state, or district office,
or to the governing body for a nonpartisan election.  The funds shall be placed
in escrow for payment of all expenses incurred in the recount.  If after the
recount the candidate who requested the recount is declared the winner of the
election, regardless of the margin of victory, or if the winning candidate
failed to be nominated or elected by more than the number of required votes
provided in section 1-10-301, 1-10-302, or 1-10-303, the payment for expenses
shall be refunded to the person or the losing political party or organization

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-10-304.5.</H1>
1-10-304.5.  Request by ballot issue or ballot question supporters or
opponents. If it appears, as evidenced by the survey of returns, that any
ballot issue or ballot question passed or failed to pass by more than the
number of required votes provided in section 1-10-301, 1-10-302, or 1-10-303,
the opponents of a passed ballot issue or ballot question or the supporters of
a losing ballot issue or ballot question, as the case may be, may submit a
certified written request for a recount at the expense of the person or group
making the request.  This request shall be filed within ten days after the
election.  Before conducting the recount, the designated election official
shall notify the governing body of the political subdivision and the supporters
or petition representatives of the ballot issue or ballot question, in the case
of a request submitted by the opponents, or the opponents, in the case of a
request submitted by the supporters or petition representatives, and shall
determine the cost and notify the requesting person or group.  The person or
group requesting the recount shall pay on demand the cost of the recount to the
county clerk and recorder for a recount of a county ballot issue or ballot
question, to the secretary of state for a recount of a ballot issue or ballot
question for a district greater than a county, or, for a nonpartisan election,
to the governing body of the political subdivision calling the election.  The
funds shall be placed in escrow for payment of all expenses incurred in the
recount.  If after the recount the ballot issue or ballot question is declared
to have failed, regardless of the margin of loss, the payment for expenses
shall be refunded to the person or group who paid them, and the expenses shall
be paid as provided in section 1-10-309.  The recount provided for in this
section shall be in addition to any other recounts provided by law.  Any
recount of votes pursuant to this section shall be held no later than the
thirtieth day after the election and shall be completed no later than the
thirty-fifth day after the election.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-7-506.</H1>
1-7-506.  Electronic vote-counting - test. (1) (a)  The designated
election official shall have the electronic vote-counting equipment tested at
each counting center in the manner prescribed in this section to ascertain that
it will accurately count the votes cast for all offices and ballot issues.  The
electronic equipment shall be tested at least three times, once on the day
before the election, again just prior to the start of the count on election
day, and finally at the conclusion of the counting.  The designated election
official may make any additional tests deemed necessary.
<P>(b)  For the purpose of testing an electronic voting device which records
votes on a paper tape and simultaneously on a "prom" or other electronic
tabulating device, the election judges in any precinct using the device shall
run a paper tape prior to opening the polls, label it, and return it to the
designated election official in the transfer case, together with one copy of
the tape of votes cast and the "prom" or other electronic tabulating device.
<P>(2)  The county chairpersons of the two major political parties, or their
official representatives, shall each be supplied with at least one hundred
official ballots that are clearly marked as test ballots and shall secretly
vote the test ballots and retain a record of the test votes.  The designated
election official shall also vote and retain at least one hundred test ballots.
For coordinated elections, all of the designated election officials from
political subdivisions other that the county shall be given together a total of
one hundred test ballots to mark among them.  The designated election officials
shall secretly vote their portion of the test ballots and retain a record of
the test votes.
<P>(3)  The designated election official, or for partisan elections, the
county clerk and recorder and county chairpersons, shall observe the tabulation
of all test ballots by means of the electronic vote-counting equipment and
compare the tabulation with the previously retained records of the test vote
count.  The cause of any discrepancies shall be corrected prior to the actual
vote tabulation.
<P>(4)  All test materials when not in use shall be kept in a metal box, and
the designated election official shall be the custodian of the box.
<P>(5)  For partisan elections, each county chairperson or the designee shall
affix the chairperson's own seal or padlock to the metal box with the test
materials.  The county clerk and recorder shall be the custodian of the box,
but shall not be able to open and use the test material unless the county
chairpersons or designees are present and unlock the box.
<P>(6)  After the final test following the conclusion of the counting, all
programs, test materials, and ballots shall be sealed and retained, as
provided for paper ballots pursuant to section 1-7-307.

<P>Annotator's note. The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>Disclosure must affect result to set aside election.  While it is a
misdemeanor to disclose to anyone the comparative standing of candidates or
questions being voted upon during an election while the polls are still open,
an election will not be set aside for this reason alone unless this fact has
been shown to affect the result of the election.  Montrose v. Niles, 124 Colo.
535, 238 P.2d 875 (1951).
<P>But where there is a gross disregard of the procedure and formalities in
the conduct of elections, whether permitted by design, through ignorance, or
negligence, the returns should be rejected.  People v. Lindsey, 80 Colo. 465,
253 P. 465 (1927).
<P>And it is not necessary that actual fraud should be committed.  People v.
Lindsey, 80 Colo. 465, 253 P. 465 (1927).

1-2-224.  Canceling registration. (1) (a)  At any time between twenty-nine
days before the primary election and thirty days after the primary election,

electors.  The communication shall be in the form of an elector information
card, including but not limited to the registered elector's name and address,
precinct number, and polling place, shall be mailed first class, and shall
contain on the address side of the card the statement "Do Not Forward.  Address
Correction Requested" or any other similar statement which is in accordance
with United States postal service regulations.
<P>(b)  For all electors whose communication pursuant to paragraph (a) of
this subsection (1) is returned by the United  States postal service as
undeliverable at the elector's voting address, the county clerk and recorder
shall mark the registration record of that elector with the word "Inactive".
<P>(c)  All electors whose communication pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
subsection (1) is not returned to the county clerk  and recorder as
undeliverable shall be deemed "Active", and no mark shall be made on the
electors' registration records.
<P>(2)  Any elector whose registration record has been marked "Inactive"
pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section shall have the
"Inactive" statement deleted from the registration record and shall be deemed
"Active" if:
<P>(a)  The elector makes current the registration information:
<P>(I)  At any office of the county clerk and recorder at any time prior to
or on the day of any primary, general, or congressional vacancy election; or
<P>(II)  At any office of the county clerk and recorder, any mobile
registration station, any driver's license examination facility, or any voter
registration agency; or
<P>(b)  The elector votes in any primary, general, or congressional vacancy
election; or
<P>(c)  The elector votes in any municipal, school district, or special
district election in which a county clerk and recorder has access to the
election records; or
<P>(d)  The elector applies for an absentee ballot for any primary, general,
or congressional vacancy election.
<P>(3)  A registered elector who is deemed "Active" pursuant to paragraph (c)
of subsection (1) of this section, but who fails to vote in the general
election which follows the communication mailed by the county clerk and
recorder pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section, shall
have the elector's registration record marked "Inactive (insert date)" by the
county clerk and recorder following the general election.
<P>(4)  Any registered elector who is deemed "Active" pursuant to paragraph
(c) of subsection (1) of this section, and whose general election absentee
ballot was received by the county clerk and recorder after 7 p.m. on general
election day or within twenty days thereafter, but was postmarked on or before
election day, shall have the registration record marked "LATE, Date
__________", and the elector shall be deemed "Active".
<P>(5)  A registered elector whose registration record is marked "Inactive"
pursuant to subsection (3) of this section shall have the "Inactive" statement
deleted from the registration record and shall be deemed "Active" if:
<P>(a)  The elector votes in any of the next two primary, general, or
congressional vacancy elections that follow the general election in which the
elector failed to vote (referred to in this section as the "next" election); or
<P>(b)  The elector makes current the registration information:
<P>(I)  At any office of the county clerk and recorder at any time prior to
or on the day of any primary, general, or congressional vacancy election; or
<P>(II)  At any office of the county clerk and recorder, any mobile
registration station, any driver's license examination facility, or any voter
registration agency; or
<P>(c)  The elector submitted the elector's general election absentee ballot,
which was received by the county clerk and recorder after 7 p.m. on general
election day or within twenty days thereafter, but which was postmarked on or
before election day.  The elector's registration record shall be marked "LATE,
Date __________".
<P>(6) (a)  At any time before January 10 after any general election, any
registered elector whose registration record is marked "Inactive" prior to a
general election and who failed to become "Active" pursuant to either
subsection (2) or (4) of this section, shall be mailed a continuance card by
the county clerk and recorder pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection (6).
<P>(b)  A continuance card shall be mailed first class, shall contain on the
address side of the card "Please forward." or any other similar statement which
is in accordance with United States postal service regulations, and shall have
a place for an address change, and the return card shall be postage prepaid and
pre-addressed to the sending county clerk and recorder.  The continuance card
shall state that, if the registered elector wishes to be retained in the
registration book of the county and if the elector is still a resident of the
county, the elector shall complete and sign the continuance card and shall
return it to the county clerk and recorder.
<P>(c) (I)  If a continuance card is completed, signed, and hand-delivered to
the county clerk and recorder or returned postmarked within sixty days after
the card is mailed by the county clerk and recorder, the county clerk and
recorder shall change the mark on the elector's registration record from
"Inactive" to "Active".  The elector's registration record shall remain in the
registration file of the county and shall reflect any further changes requested
by the elector.
<P>(II)  If a continuance card is not completed and hand-delivered to the
county clerk and recorder or returned postmarked within sixty days after the
card is mailed by the county clerk and recorder, after the second general
election in which the elector has been designated "Inactive", the county clerk
and recorder shall mark the registration record of the elector "Canceled
(insert date)", and the record shall be removed from the registration file of
the county.
<P>(III)  If a continuance card is returned to the county clerk and recorder
as undeliverable and the elector has been designated "Inactive" for two general
elections since the first continuance card was mailed, the county clerk and
recorder shall mark the registration record of the elector "Canceled (insert
date)", and the record shall be removed from the registration file of the
county.
<P>(7)  Within one hundred thirty-five days following any general election,
the county clerk and recorder shall furnish to the county chairpersons of the
two major political parties a list containing the names, addresses, precinct
numbers, and party affiliations of the electors whose names were removed from
the registration book.
<P>(8)  Any registered elector whose registration record has been marked
"Inactive" shall be eligible to vote in any municipal, school district, or
special district election, but voting in these elections shall not cause the
county clerk and recorder to delete the word "Inactive" from the elector's
registration record, except as provided for in subsection (2) of this section.
<P>(9)  If after twenty-eight days prior to an election, any registered
elector finds that his or her registration record has been cancelled during the
prior six years pursuant to this section, the elector shall have the cancelled
notation deleted and shall be reinstated and given a "Certificate of
Reinstatement" if the elector provides proof to the county clerk and recorder
that he or she has not moved since the last two general elections.  The
"Certificate of Reinstatement" may be issued any time during the twenty-eight
days before or on election day and the elector may then vote at his or her
precinct polling place or, if authorized by the county clerk and recorder, at
the office of the county clerk and recorder.

to maintain the master list of registered electors on a current basis.  Such
means shall be consistent with the provisions of section 42-1-212, C.R.S.

<P>Annotator's note. The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>Judicial notice taken of boundaries of election precincts.  Courts take
judicial notice of matters of common knowledge in the community where they sit,
such as the boundaries of election precincts.  Israel v. Wood, 93 Colo. 500, 27
P.2d 1024 (1933).  See National Optical Co. v. United States Fid. &amp  Guar. Co.,
77 Colo. 130, 235 P. 343 (1925);  Antlers Athletic Ass'n v. Hartung, 85 Colo.
125, 274 P. 831 (1928).
<P>And a court will take judicial notice of the fact that there has been a
precinct established in a county, it not being material whether the precinct
was established upon proper petition or by virtue of authority so to do under
this section.  Board of Comm'rs v. People ex rel. McPherson, 36 Colo. 246, 91
P. 36 (1906).
<P>Whereupon a mandamus proceeding will be dismissed. When a court takes
judicial notice that an election precinct has been established, a mandamus
proceeding to compel the board of county commissioners to establish such
precinct pending upon review in such court will be dismissed, there being no
live question for determination.  Board of Comm'rs v. People ex rel. McPherson,
36 Colo. 246, 91 P. 36 (1906).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-6-120.</H1>
1-6-120.  Removal of election judges by the court. (1)  Upon the failure
or neglect of any election judge to perform the duties of the office, any other
election judge, the designated election official, the county chairperson of a
political party, or an eligible elector of the political subdivision for which
the election judge is appointed, having knowledge of the failure or neglect,
shall cause proper action for removal to be instituted against the election
judge.
<P>(2)  Election judges who neglect their duties, who commit, encourage, or
connive in any fraud in connection with their duties, who violate any of the
election laws or knowingly permit others to do so, who are convicted of any
crime, who violate their oath, who wrongfully hamper or interfere or tend to
interfere with the regular performance of the duties of the other election
judges, who commit any other act that interferes or tends to interfere with a
fair and honest registration and election, or who are not appointed in
accordance with the provisions of this article may be removed in the following
manner:
<P>(a)  Any eligible elector may file a brief petition in the district court
at any time up to twelve days before any election, setting out in brief and
concise language the facts constituting the cause for the removal of the
election judge. The petition shall be verified, but the verification may be
upon information and belief. Upon filing of the petition, the court shall issue
a citation to the election judge directing an appearance within forty-eight
hours to answer the petition if the election judge desires to do so.
<P>(b)  The court shall proceed summarily to hear and finally dispose of the
petition and may set a hearing within forty-eight hours after the answer is
filed. Evidence given by any accused election judge at the hearing shall not be
used against that election judge in any civil, criminal, or other proceedings.
If the court decides that the election judge should be removed for any cause
stated in the petition, the court shall so order and shall immediately notify
the appropriate election official.
<P>(3)  The validity of any part of the registration or election already
completed or other acts performed under this code, if otherwise legally
performed, shall not be affected by the removal of an election judge and shall
be in every respect valid and regular.  The successor of any election judge
removed shall proceed with the duties of the election judge with the same power
and effect as though originally appointed.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-7-507.</H1>
1-7-507.  Electronic vote-counting - procedure. (1)  All proceedings at
the counting centers shall be under the direction of the designated election
official and the representatives of the political parties, if a partisan
election, or watchers, if a nonpartisan election. No persons, except those
authorized for the purpose, shall touch any ballot, ballot card, "prom" or
other electronic device, or return.
<P>(2)  All persons who are engaged in the processing and counting of the
ballots or recorded precinct votes shall be deputized in writing and take an
oath that they will faithfully perform their assigned duties.
<P>(3)  The return printed by the electronic vote-tabulating equipment, to
which have been added write-in votes, shall, when certified by the designated
election official, constitute the official return of each precinct. The
designated election official may, from time to time, release unofficial
returns.  Upon completion of the count, the official returns shall be open to
the public.
<P>(4)  Absentee ballots shall be counted at the counting centers in the same
manner as precinct ballots.
<P>(5)  Write-in ballots may be counted in their precincts by the precinct
election judges or at the counting centers.
<P>(6)  If for any reason it becomes impracticable to count all or a part of
the ballots with electronic vote-tabulating equipment, the designated election
official may direct that they be counted manually, following as far as
practicable the provisions governing the counting of paper ballots as provided
in 1-7-307.
<P>(7)  The receiving, opening, and preservation of the transfer boxes and
their contents shall be the responsibility of the designated election official,
who shall provide adequate personnel and facilities to assure accurate and
complete election results. Any indication of tampering with the ballots, ballot
card, or other fraudulent action shall be immediately reported to the district
attorney, who shall immediately investigate the action and report the findings
in writing within ten days to the designated election official and shall
prosecute to the full extent of the law any person or persons responsible for
the fraudulent action.  The secretary of state shall issue such directives as
may be necessary to implement or clarify the procedures outlined for the
conduct of elections when punch card electronic voting systems are used.
<P>(8)  Precincts using punch card electronic voting systems shall not be
required to post the abstract of the count of votes at the precinct after the
closing of the polls.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-2-225.</H1>
1-2-225.  Change of polling place - accessibility for persons with
disabilities. (1)  The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares
that the purpose of this section is to  protect the fundamental right of
citizens with disabilities to vote. The general assembly further finds that,
where reasonable polling place access for electors with disabilities cannot be
provided, other reasonable accommodations should be made to enable those
electors to cast their votes.
<P>(2)  The elector information card required to be sent to all registered
electors pursuant to section 1-2-224 shall include a notice to the elector
indicating whether the polling place for the elector is accessible to persons
with disabilities. The information card shall also include an affidavit which
may be signed and returned to the county clerk and recorder indicating that the
elector to whom the information card was sent has a disability and requesting a
change of polling place assignment to a location that is accessible to persons
with disabilities.
<P>(3)  Any registered elector with a disability, or a  family member living
at the same address as the elector and acting for the elector, may appear at
the county clerk and recorder's office in the county in which the elector is
registered and sign an affidavit requesting a temporary change of polling place
to a place that is accessible to persons with disabilities.
<P>(4)  Upon receiving an affidavit requesting a polling place change
pursuant to this section, a county clerk and recorder shall temporarily assign
the requesting elector to a polling place that uses the same ballot type as the
permanently assigned location and is accessible to persons with disabilities,
if such a place exists.  If more than one such polling place exists, the county
clerk and recorder shall assign the polling place that is closest to the
elector's residence.
<P>(5)  A family member living at the same address as an elector who has
changed polling places pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this section may
also change polling places to vote at the same polling place as the elector
with a disability by filing a request with the county clerk and  recorder
containing the information required by the county clerk and recorder.
<P>(6)  Any request for a change of polling place to a polling place which is
accessible to persons with disabilities must be received by the designated
election official at least twelve days prior to the election for which the
change is requested.
<P>(7)  Upon granting a request for a temporary change of polling place
pursuant to this section, the county clerk and recorder shall make and deliver
to the elector a temporary polling place certificate setting forth the facts of
the temporary polling place change, including the name of the elector, the date
of the election, the type of election, and the address of the temporary polling
place. The certificate shall be attested by the hand of the county clerk and
recorder and the seal of the county.
<P>(8)  An elector who has temporarily changed polling places pursuant to
this section shall present the temporary polling place certificate on the day
of the election to the election judges at the temporary polling place assigned
to the elector. The election judges shall allow the elector to vote at that
polling place.  The election judges shall use the certificate as a substitute
registration record, entering the date of the election and pollbook ballot
number on the certificate and including it with the registration book when it
is returned to the county clerk and recorder following the election.
<P>(9)  Only one application for a temporary change of polling place pursuant
to this section must be made for all subsequent primary and general elections
in any calendar year.  Separate applications for temporary changes of polling
places must be made for all other elections.
<P>(10)  Any political subdivision which holds elections is authorized to
follow the procedures specified in this section for its elections.

<P>II.  District Court to Decide.
<P>III.  Review by Supreme Court.
<P>I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Annotator's note.  The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>II. DISTRICT COURT TO DECIDE.
<P>The court is given jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing a substantial
compliance with the provisions of election act by the parties to such
controversy.  People ex rel. McGaffey v. District Court, 23 Colo. 150, 46 P.
681 (1896).
<P>And provision for adjudication of controversies, being remedial in
character, must be liberally construed in order that its purpose may be given
effect.  People v. District Court, 23 Colo. 150, 46 P. 681 (1896).
<P>The district court has jurisdiction to order the recognition by a state
central committee of one who is admittedly a member of that body.  People ex
rel. Vick Roy v. Republican State Cent. Comm., 75 Colo. 312, 226 P. 656 (1924).
<P>And it has jurisdiction to determine authority of the secretary of state.
Where the secretary of state assumes jurisdiction, deciding a dispute and the
defeated party applies to the district court for relief, challenging the
authority of the secretary to determine the controversy as well as the
correctness of his decision upon the merits, the district court has
jurisdiction to entertain the cause and determine the matter. People ex rel.
McGaffey v. District Court, 23 Colo. 150, 46 P. 681 (1896).
<P>The provision for adjudication of controversies contemplates the taking of
evidence where the issues require it.  Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P.
856, 50 P. 858 (1897).
<P>III. REVIEW BY SUPREME COURT.
<P>The provision for adjudication of controversies does not confer original
jurisdiction on the supreme court. Leighton v. Bates, 24 Colo. 303, 50 P. 856,
50 P. 858 (1897).
<P>Supreme court may in its discretion accept or reject an appeal with
respect to nominations of candidates, and if it elects to accept the appeal, it
may proceed in a summary way to dispose of it.  In re Weber, 186 Colo. 61, 525
P.2d 465 (1974).

(1)  After the polls have been closed, the election judges shall secure the
vote recorders or the voting devices, or both, against further use.
<P>(2)  In precincts in which voting is on a ballot or ballot card, election
judges shall prepare a return in duplicate showing the number of eligible

and dependents;
<P>(c)  Civilian employees of the United States in all categories serving

paid from funds appropriated by the congress; or
<P>(d)  Members of religious groups or welfare agencies who assist members of
the armed forces and who are officially attached  to and serving with the armed
forces and their spouses and dependents.
<P>(3)  Any eligible elector of this state who is temporarily residing

dependents of the elector when residing with or accompanying the elector may be
registered by properly executing the federal postcard application, as provided
by the "Federal Voting Assistance Act of 1955", as amended.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-2-202.</H1>
1-2-202.  Registration by county clerk and recorder. (1)  The county clerk
and recorder shall register any eligible elector residing in any precinct in
the state of Colorado who appears in person at the primary office or at any
office, mobile or stationary, regularly maintained by the county clerk and
recorder and staffed by regular employees at any time following any general
election, up to and including the twenty-ninth day before the primary election,
or at any time after the primary election, up to and including the twenty-ninth
day before the general election.  The registrations shall then be forwarded to
the appropriate county clerk and recorder.  The county clerk and recorder shall
accept deferred registrations pursuant to subsection (6) of this section,
except on the days of the primary, general, and congressional vacancy elections
and elections held on the first Tuesday in November of odd-numbered years.
<P>(2)  Each municipal clerk shall serve as a deputy registrar.  The
municipal clerk shall register any eligible elector who appears in person at
the municipal clerk's primary office at any time during which registration is
permitted in the office of the county clerk and recorder, except the
twenty-eight days preceding any municipal election.  The municipal clerk shall
deliver the new registration records to the office of the county clerk and
recorder either in person or by certified mail on or before the fifteenth day
of each month and in person on the day following the last day for registration
preceding any election for which registration is required.
<P>(3)  (Deleted by amendment, L. 94, p. 1753,  8, effective January 1,
1995.)
<P>(4)  If the county clerk and recorder finds that a precinct is composed of
three percent or more non-English-speaking eligible electors, the county clerk
and recorder shall take affirmative action to recruit full-time or part-time
staff members who are fluent in the language used by the eligible electors and
in English.  The action shall be conducted through voluntarily donated public
service notices in the media, including newspapers, radio, and television,
particularly those media which serve those non-English-speaking persons.
<P>(5)  The county clerk and recorder shall attest to the  signature of all
electors who register in the county clerk and recorder's office by placing the
official signature of the county clerk and recorder on the registration sheet.
<P>(6)  At any time that the registration books of the county  clerk and
recorder are closed pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1) of this
section, except for the days of the primary, general, and congressional vacancy
elections, the county  clerk and recorder shall register any eligible elector
residing in any precinct in the county who appears in person at the primary
office or at any office regularly maintained by the county clerk and recorder
and staffed by regular employees, but the names of persons registering pursuant
to the provisions of this subsection (6) shall not be placed in the
registration book or added to the list of eligible electors until after the
election for which the registration books were closed. Registrations made
pursuant to this subsection (6) shall take effect on the day following the
election for which the registration books were closed, and after that date each
registration shall be effective as of the date the registration was actually
made.
<P>(7)  The name of each elector who registered pursuant to subsection (6) of
this section shall be included in books and lists prepared for all elections
held at least twenty-nine days after the date of registration.

<P>I.  General Consideration.
<P>II.  Registering Qualified Elector.
<P>III.  Registering Family Member.
<P>I.  GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Cross reference. As to questions answered and oath taken by the elector,
see   1-2-203 and 1-2-204.
<P>Am. Jur.2d. See 25 Am. Jur.2d, Elections,   103-106.
<P>C.J.S. See 29 C.J.S., Elections,   39, 40(1), 46.
<P>Annotator's note. The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>II.  REGISTERING QUALIFIED ELECTOR.
<P>The entire purpose of the election law, insofar as it relates to the
subject of registration is to render it impossible to prevent registration on
account of political affiliations or preferences.  People ex rel. Smith v.
District Court, 33 Colo. 22, 78 P. 679 (1904).
<P>Person complying with section is entitled to have name upon registration
list. See People ex rel. Smith v. District Court, 33 Colo. 22, 78 P. 679
(1904).
<P>And in such instances there is no power to prevent the registration. See
People ex rel. Smith v. District Court, 33 Colo. 22, 78 P. 679 (1904).
<P>Nor strike the name from the registration list. See People ex rel. Smith
v. District Court, 33 Colo. 16, 78 P. 684 (1904).
<P>However, registration lists are only prima facie evidence that the persons
whose names appear thereon are legally qualified to vote, and so, when they
present themselves at the polls, they may be challenged.  People ex rel. Smith
v. District Court, 33 Colo. 22, 78 P. 679 (1904).
<P>Closing registration books 32nd day before election is constitutional.
Since the state is entitled to a reasonable time to complete whatever
administrative tasks are necessary to prevent fraud, the requirement that
registration books be closed after the 32nd day before an election is
constitutionally valid.  Jarmel v. Putnam, 179 Colo. 215, 499 P.2d 603 (1972).
<P>But county clerks must register any persons otherwise qualified as
electors who are or will be residents of the state for 32 days on the date of
the election for which they seek to register.  Jarmel v. Putnam, 179 Colo. 215,
499 P.2d 603 (1972).
<P>III.  REGISTERING FAMILY MEMBER.
<P>Where individuals are members of a religious order, then, even though they
live together in a community, such a community within the meaning of this
section, is not such a family as to make registration valid.  Goss v. Klipfel,
112 Colo. 87, 146 P.2d 217 (1944).

1-2-203.  Registration on Indian reservations. The secretary or
secretary's designee of any tribal council of an Indian tribe located on a
federal reservation which has no municipality contained within the reservation
shall serve as a deputy registrar only for registration purposes for the county
in which the reservation is located. The secretary of the tribal council or the
secretary's designee shall take registrations only in the tribal council
headquarters.  The secretary of the tribal council or the secretary's designee
shall register any eligible elector residing in any precinct in the county who
appears in person in the office of the secretary of the tribal council at any
time during which registration is permitted in the office of the county clerk
and recorder.  The secretary of the tribal council shall forward the
registration records to the county clerk and recorder, either in person or by
certified mail, on or before the fifteenth day of each month; except that the
secretary of the tribal council shall appear in person to deliver any
registration records to the county clerk and recorder on the day following the

<P>Provisions not mandatory. To treat all of the provisions of this statute
as mandatory so as to deprive those who attempt to register would provide an
unequal application of the statute and an inconsistency not warranted by any
express language in the enactment.  Meyer v. Putnam, 186 Colo. 132, 526 P.2d
139 (1974).
<P>Obtaining social security numbers from vast majority of voters is only
directory. Meyer v. Putnam, 186 Colo. 132, 526 P.2d 139 (1974).

1-6-113.  Vacancies. (1)  If for any reason any person selected to serve
as an election judge fails to attend the class of instruction for election
judges, or refuses, fails, or is unable to serve, or is removed by preemption
or for cause, the designated election official thereafter may appoint an
election judge, and for a partisan election the election judge shall be
appointed from the list of names previously submitted by the county chairperson
of the political party to which the person belongs or from a list of previously
authorized judges.  To insure that a sufficient number of judges is available
at every election, each county clerk and recorder shall compile a list of
persons who are affiliated with a minor political party or a qualified
political organization or who are unaffiliated and who are willing and eligible
to serve as election judges.  If a vacancy occurs and no persons are available
who meet the affiliation requirements of section 1-6-109, then the county clerk
and recorder may appoint a person from the list of persons not affiliated with
a major political party.
<P>(2)  If any election judge is not present at the opening of the polls but
appears at the polling place within thirty minutes after the opening of the
polls, that election judge is entitled to serve as an election judge, and in
such event the election judges shall make note of this fact in their official
returns.  If a vacancy occurs on the date of any election by failure of any
election judge to appear at the polling place by 7:30 a.m., the vacancy may be
filled by the designated election official.

the duties of judge according to law and the best of my ability; that I will
studiously endeavor to prevent fraud, deceit, and abuse in conducting the same;

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-6-103.</H1>
1-6-103.  Recommendations by county chairperson. (1)  No later than the
last Tuesday of April in even-numbered years, the county chairperson of each
major political party in the county shall certify to the county clerk and
recorder the names and addresses of electors recommended to serve as election
judges in each precinct in the county.
<P>(2)  The county chairperson shall designate the order of preference of the
names of the electors recommended to serve as election judges for each
precinct, and the county clerk and recorder shall select election judges from
each precinct list in the county chairperson's order of preference.  If the
county chairperson certifies an order which is different from that submitted by
the precinct committeepersons, a copy of the list submitted by the precinct
committeepersons shall be attached to the certification which the county
chairperson gives to the county clerk and recorder.
<P>(3)  In recommending eligible electors as election judges, the county
chairperson shall select only names from the list submitted by the precinct
committeepersons.  If the precinct committeepersons do not furnish enough names
to the county chairperson, the county chairperson may  recommend additional
eligible electors to the county clerk and recorder, in which case the precinct
residence requirement may be waived.
<P>(4)  If the county has no county chairperson or vice-chairperson, the
county clerk and recorder shall appoint election judges by obtaining lists of
qualified eligible electors from the precinct committeepersons.  If the
precinct has no precinct committeepersons or captains, the county clerk and
recorder may select eligible electors representing the two major political
parties, in which case the precinct residence requirement may be waived.
<P>(5)  If the county chairperson does not submit any names or submits
insufficient names for election judges for a precinct prior to the time for
issuing certificates of appointment, the county clerk and recorder shall
appoint the election judges, following the party affiliation requirements of
section 1-6-109.

<P>Annotator's note. Since  1-6-103 is similar to  1-5-107 as it existed
prior to the 1992 repeal and reenactment of articles 5 and 6 of this title, a
relevant case construing that provision has been included in the annotations to
this section.  For additional cases, see the annotations under former  1-5-107
in the 1980 replacement volume.
<P>Requirement that persons serving as election judges must be affiliated
with one of two major political parties does not violate right to freedom of
speech and association or right to equal protection since the statute is
rationally related to the legitimate ends of efficiently running an election by
pairing Democrats and Republicans as election monitors to provide the
appearance of propriety.  MacGuire v. Houston, 717 P.2d 948 (Colo. 1986).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-4-101.</H1>
1-4-101.  Primary election nominations made. (1)  A primary election shall
be held at the regular polling places in each precinct on the second Tuesday of
August in even-numbered years to nominate candidates of political parties to be
voted for at the succeeding general election.
<P>(2)  Each political party is entitled to participate in the primary
election and shall have a separate party ballot.  The primary election of all
political parties shall be held at the same time and at the same polling places
and shall be conducted by the same election officials.
<P>(3)  All nominations by political parties for candidates for United
States senator, representative in congress, all elective state, district, and
county officers, and members of the general assembly shall be made by primary
elections.  Neither the secretary of state nor any county clerk and recorder
shall place on the official general election ballot the name of any person as a
candidate of any political party who has not been nominated in accordance with
the provisions of this article, or who has not been affiliated with the
political party for at least twelve months unless otherwise provided by law, or
who does not meet residency requirements for the office, if any.  The
information found on the voter registration record of the person seeking to be
placed on the ballot is admissible as prima facie evidence of compliance with
this article.
<P>(4)  Except as otherwise provided in this code, all primary elections
shall be conducted in the same manner as general elections insofar as the
general election provisions are applicable, and the election officers for
primary elections have the same powers and shall perform the same duties as
those provided by  law for general elections.
<P>(5)  All expenses incurred in the preparation or conduct of the primary
election shall be paid out of the treasury of the county or state, as the case
may be, in the same manner as for general elections.

1-7-108.  Requirements of watchers. (1)  Watchers shall take an oath
administered by one of the election judges that they are eligible electors,
that their name has been submitted to the designated election official as a
watcher for this election, and that they will not in any manner make known to
anyone the result of counting votes until the polls have closed.
<P>(2)  Neither candidates nor members of their immediate families by blood
or marriage to the second degree may be pollwatchers for that candidate.
<P>(3)  Each watcher shall have the right to maintain a list of eligible
electors who have voted, to witness and verify each step in the conduct of the
election from prior to the opening of the polls through the completion of the
count and announcement of the results, to challenge ineligible electors, and to
assist in the correction of discrepancies.

1-7-110.  Preparing to vote. (1)  Any eligible elector desiring to vote
shall write his or her name and address on the signature card and give it to
one of the election judges, who shall clearly and audibly announce the name in
a loud and distinct tone of voice.  An eligible elector who is unable to write
may request assistance from one of the election judges, who shall also sign the
signature card and witness the eligible elector's mark.  The signature card
shall provide:  "I, ....................,  who reside at ....................,
am an eligible elector of this precinct or district and desire to vote at this
............ election.
Date .........."
<P>(2)  If the name is found on the registration list or, where applicable,
the property owner's list by the election judge in charge, the elector's name
shall be repeated.  The judge in charge of the pollbook or list shall then
enter the eligible elector's name, and the eligible elector shall be allowed to
enter the immediate voting area.  Besides the election officials, no more than
four electors more than the number of voting booths or voting machines shall be
allowed within the immediate voting area at one time.
<P>(2.5)  If the elector's qualification to vote is established by the
completion of an affidavit, and if the affidavit contains all of the
information required in subsection (1) of this section, then the designated
election official may consider the affidavit the signature card or may require
the completion of an additional signature card.
<P>(3)  The completed signature cards shall be returned with other election
materials to the designated election official.

vote at an election shall be entitled to absent themselves for the purpose of
voting from any service or employment in which they are then engaged or
employed on the day of the election for a period of two hours during the time

absent themselves shall not be liable for any penalty, nor shall any deduction
be made from their usual salary or wages, on account of their absence.
Eligible electors who are employed and paid by the hour shall receive their
regular hourly wage for the period of their absence, not to exceed two hours.
Application shall be made for the leave of absence prior to the day of

absent, but the hours shall be at the beginning or end of the work shift, if
the employee so requests.
<P>(2)  This section shall not apply to any person whose hours of employment
on the day of the election are such that there are three or more hours between
the time of opening and the time of closing of the polls during which the

Act of 1965", and therefore are not required to be printed in any language
other than English to be circulated in any county in Colorado.

Source: L. 93:  Entire article amended with relocations, p. 685,  1,
effective May 4.
<P>Annotator's note. Since  1-40-114 is similar to  1-40-107.5 as it existed
prior to the 1993 amendment of title 1, article 40, which resulted in the
relocation of provisions, a relevant case construing that provision has been
included in the annotations to this section.
<P>Law reviews. For comment, "Montero v. Meyer:  Official English, Initiative
Petitions and the Voting Rights Act", see 66 Den. U. L. Rev. 619 (1989). For
comment, "Another View of Montero v. Meyer and the English-Only Movement:
Giving Language Prejudice the Sanction of the Law", see 66 Den. U. L. Rev. 633
(1989).
<P>Minority language provisions of the federal "Voting Rights Act" not
applicable to initiative petitions. With respect to initiative petitions,
electoral process to which the minority language provisions of the "Voting
Rights Act" would apply did not commence under state law until the measure was
certified as qualified for placement on the ballot.  Furthermore, the signing
of petitions did not constitute "voting" under the act.  Montero v. Meyer, 861
F.2d 603 (10th Cir. 1988) (decided prior to enactment of this section).

by law to register with the county clerk and recorder within the prescribed
period after a change of residence to a different county, and has not and will
not cast a vote in the election in the county of previous residence; or
<P>(b)  The elector registered to vote prior to the close of registration by
federal postcard application or at a voter registration agency designated

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-2-219.</H1>
1-2-219.  Changing or withdrawing declaration of party affiliation.
(1)  Any eligible elector desiring to change or withdraw the elector's party
affiliation may do so by completing and signing a prescribed request for the
change or withdrawal and filing it with the county clerk and recorder or by
submitting a personal letter written by the elector to the county clerk and
recorder at any time during which electors are permitted to register.  The
prescribed form or personal letter for the change shall include the elector's
printed name, address within the county, birth date, social security number, if
the elector wishes to state it, and signature, the date, the elector's previous
party affiliation status, and the requested change in party affiliation status.
A prescribed form shall be furnished by the county clerk and recorder upon the
elector's oral or written request.  Upon receiving the request, the county
clerk and recorder shall change the elector's party affiliation on the
registration record. If the party affiliation is withdrawn, the designation on
the registration record shall be changed to "unaffiliated".  If an elector
changes party affiliation, the elector is entitled to vote, at any primary
election, only the ballot of the party to which the elector is currently
affiliated.  A change or withdrawal of party affiliation may not be made by
anyone other than the elector.
<P>(2)  Any declaration, change, or withdrawal of affiliation made on the
same form or personal letter as an address or name change shall be accepted by
the county clerk and recorder if the form or personal letter is dated and
signed so that it is clearly indicated that the elector intended to make the
change or withdrawal indicated on the form or in the personal letter.  An
elector who is unable to write may request assistance from the county clerk and
recorder, and the county clerk and recorder shall sign the form, witnessing the
elector's mark or, on a personal letter, the elector shall have his or her
signature attested to by a notary public.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-2-221.</H1>
1-2-221.  Continuation of affiliation. (1)  Any eligible elector of this
state who has moved from a residence in one county and has established a
residence and registered in another county of this state may request the county
clerk and recorder of the new county to continue the elector's party
affiliation from the county of prior residence to the county of new residence
by signing a form furnished by the county clerk and recorder, as prescribed in
subsection (3) of this section, using the statewide electronic registration
system.  This may be done either at the time the elector registers in the new
county or within three months thereafter.  The party affiliation, when entered
on the new registration record, is evidence of continued  affiliation.  The
provisions of this section do not apply to continuation of affiliation from
other states.
<P>(2)  If any eligible elector, pursuant to the provisions of section
1-2-204 (2) (j), desires to continue a party affiliation from one county to
another, the elector shall sign a form furnished by the county clerk and
recorder, as prescribed in subsection (3) of this section.  The signed form
shall then be mailed by the county clerk and recorder to the county clerk and
recorder of the county of prior residence in this state, requesting the
information specified in subsection (1) of this section.  Upon receipt of the
form, the county clerk and recorder of the county of prior residence shall use
the elector's "notice of registration" document as evidence of the elector's
move from the county, shall forthwith complete and certify the "request and
return" portion of the form, shall send the return portion by return mail to
the requesting county clerk and recorder, and shall then cancel the
registration record from the registration book.  The requesting  county clerk
and recorder shall retain the return portion of the document as record evidence
of continued party affiliation, as in the case prescribed in subsection (1) of
this section.
<P>(3)  The form shall be printed in two parts:  One part shall be the
"notice of registration" portion containing spaces for the  name, signature,
and previous address in the elector's prior county of residence, a statement
that the elector has registered in another county, the date of the new
registration, a statement that the elector desires or does not desire to
continue the party affiliation, and the name and address of the county clerk
and recorder of the new county of residence; the other part shall be the
"request and return" portion containing spaces for the elector's signature and
printed name and address, the elector's registered party affiliation, if any,
as shown by the registration records of the county clerk and recorder of the
prior county of residence, the date that the affiliation was declared, and the
certification by the county clerk and recorder that the information is true and
correct.

1-2-206.  Declaration of party affiliation. (1)  Any unaffiliated eligible
elector may declare a party affiliation at the time the elector prepares  to
vote at a primary election, as provided in section 1-7-201 (2); or at any time
during which electors are permitted to register by appearing in person before
the county clerk and recorder; or by filing or causing to be filed a written
request for the declaration upon a form which shall be furnished by the county

of the county clerk and recorder as "unaffiliated".
<P>(2)  Any declaration shall be separately dated and signed or dated and
initialed by the elector if present or by the county clerk and recorder if the
elector is not present, so that it is clearly indicated that the elector's
affiliation has been properly recorded.  An elector who is unable to write may

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-2-222.</H1>
1-2-222.  Errors in recording of party affiliation. (1)  If an elector
goes to the elector's legal voting place to vote at any primary election or to
the office of the county clerk and recorder and contends that an error has been
made in the recording of the elector's party affiliation on the registration
book or that the party affiliation has been unlawfully changed or withdrawn,
the election judges or the county clerk and recorder shall allow the elector to
make and sign an affidavit, which shall be substantially in the form provided
in subsection (4) of this section.  Any election judge or the county clerk and
recorder has authority to administer the oath and take the acknowledgment of
the elector's affidavit.  When the affidavit is completed, the election judge
or the county clerk and recorder shall make the change as specified in the
affidavit and shall enter after the elector's party affiliation on the
registration book the words "changed  by affidavit", giving the date of the
change.
<P>(2)  No affidavit shall be allowed or received by the election judges or
the county clerk and recorder if the date and the elector's signature,
initials, or properly witnessed mark appear on the registration record in or
adjacent to the space provided for recording party affiliation or on a form
furnished by the county clerk and recorder for declaring party affiliation, as
provided in section 1-2-206, evidencing the elector's acknowledgment of the
accuracy of the recorded party affiliation or evidencing a written request for
the same party affiliation as shown on the registration record.
<P>(3)  For the purposes of determining the eligibility of candidates for
nomination in accordance with sections 1-4-601 (4) (a) and 1-4-801 (4), the
eligibility of persons to vote at any precinct caucus, assembly, or convention
in accordance with section 1-3-101, or the eligibility of persons to sign
petitions in accordance with section 1-4-801 (2), the date of declaration of
the party affiliation of the elector shall be the date of the declaration which
the elector alleges by affidavit to have been erroneously recorded or
unlawfully changed or withdrawn.
<P>(4)  Printed affidavit forms shall be furnished to the election judges of
the various election precincts. The affidavit form shall be substantially as
follows:

<P>C.J.S.  See 29 C.J.S., Elections,  13.
<P>Annotator's note.  The following annotations are taken from a case decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>Law reviews.  For note, "Purged Voter Lists", see 44 Den. L.J. 279 (1967).
<P>The provision for purging the registration book does not violate the equal
protection clause of amendment 14, U.S. Const.  Duprey v. Anderson, 184 Colo.
70, 518 P.2d 807 (1974).
<P>Nor requirements of due process.  The requirements of due process of law
as set forth in  25 of art. II, Colo. Const., and in amendment 14, U.S. Const.,
are not violated by the provision as it applies to persons whose names have
been removed from the registration books.  Duprey v. Anderson, 184 Colo. 70,
518 P.2d 807 (1974).
<P>Purging procedure does not result in an invidious discrimination between
qualified registered electors who exercise their right to vote in general
elections and qualified registered electors who do not vote. Duprey v.
Anderson, 184 Colo. 70, 518 P.2d 807 (1974).
<P>Purging registration book is exclusively an administrative adjunct which
is necessary in order to provide for the purity of elections and to guard
against abuses.  Duprey v. Anderson, 184 Colo. 70, 518 P.2d 807 (1974).
<P>Prevention of fraud and other abuses is state interest in purging
books.  Any person who does not reregister may be presumed to be deceased, to
have moved and registered at a new address, or to have no desire to vote at a
forthcoming election.  Thus, the election list becomes more authentic and is
not as susceptible to fraudulent voting practices or other abuses of the
franchise.  This is the legitimate state interest involved in the purging
procedure.  Duprey v. Anderson, 184 Colo. 70, 518 P.2d 807 (1974).
<P>Qualified electors whose names were purged from registration books were in
no way barred from voting, for to vote, they are merely required to reregister.
Duprey v. Anderson, 184 Colo. 70, 518 P.2d 807 (1974).

procedure of section 1-14-105 (now section 1-2-219) is followed, an elector
moving from one county to another shall lose his party affiliation.  Murphey v.
Trott, 160 Colo. 336, 417 P.2d 234 (1966).
<P>Provision of section constitutional. Provision in this section that a

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-2-204.</H1>
1-2-204.  Questions answered by elector. (1)  The county clerk and
recorder shall ask each eligible elector making application for registration,
and the elector shall answer, the following:
<P>(a)  Whether the elector intends to claim the elector's present address as
the elector's sole legal place of residence and, in so doing, to abandon claim
to any other legal residence;
<P>(b)  Whether the elector is aware that, if the elector is a resident of
this state for voting purposes, the elector is also a resident of this state
for motor vehicle registration and operation purposes and for income tax
purposes;
<P>(c)  Whether the elector is aware that the elector cannot legally vote in
more than one place in any election; and
<P>(d)  Whether the elector is aware that a violation of the self-affirmation
the elector is about to make is a criminal act under the laws of this state and
will subject the elector to the penalties provided by law.
<P>(2)  In addition, each eligible elector shall be asked, and the elector
shall correctly answer, the following:
<P>(a)  The elector's name in full;
<P>(b)  The elector's place of residence, including municipal address with
street number or, if there is no street number, by legal description of the
land upon which the residence sits, including lot, block, addition, division,
or subdivision, as applicable. In all other cases, the residence shall be
described by the section or subdivision in the township and range as
established and numbered by the United States government survey.  If the place
of residence is an apartment house, rooming house, dormitory, hotel, or motel,
the number of  the floor and the number of the apartment or room shall also be
given.  No vacant lot or business address shall be considered a residence.  A
post office box number shall not be used as a place of residence for the
purposes of this subsection (2).
<P>(c)  Whether the elector is a native-born or naturalized citizen of the
United States;
<P>(d)  The elector's sex;
<P>(e)  The elector's date of birth;
<P>(f)  The elector's mailing address if different from the elector's
residential address;
<P>(g)  The elector's social security number, if the elector wishes to state
it;
<P>(h)  Whether or not the elector is registered to vote in another county of
this state;
<P>(i)  Whether or not the elector has voted or was registered to vote in
another county of this state or in another state. If the elector was previously
registered, the elector shall, when registering, sign a "notice of
registration" form pursuant to section 1-2-221; and
<P>(j)  The elector's party affiliation, if any, if the eligible elector
desires to affiliate with any political party.  If this question is not
answered, the elector shall be registered as "unaffiliated".  Only the eligible
elector personally shall declare the eligible elector's party affiliation.  Any
elector appearing in person to register shall also state on the notice of
registration whether or not the elector wishes the party affiliation to be
continued from the county of prior residence in this state to the new county of
residence.  If such is the case, the county clerk and recorder shall proceed to
forward the party affiliation and original date of affiliation with that party
as provided in section 1-2-221.  Party affiliation shall not be continued from
another state.
<P>(3) (a)  If the county clerk and recorder has reasonable cause to believe
that an applicant has falsified any answers to the questions set forth in this
section, the county clerk and recorder shall certify the same to the district
attorney for investigation and appropriate action.
<P>(b)  If the elector states that the elector's present address is the
elector's sole legal residence and that the elector claims no other place as
the elector's legal residence and if the elector meets the qualifications of
section 1-2-101, the county clerk and recorder shall proceed to register the
elector.

section.  For additional cases, see the annotations under former  1-2-203 in
the 1980 replacement volume.
<P>Supporters of minor parties must be allowed to designate that support on
voter registration forms. The refusal to permit such designation unnecessarily
burdens the opportunity of the citizen and his party to promote their minority
interests.  Baer v. Meyer, 577 F. Supp. 838 (D. Colo. 1984), aff'd in part,
rev'd in part on other grounds, 728 F.2d 471 (10th Cir. 1984).
<P>But party designation need only be permitted if a political organization
already exists in the state under its name, has recognized officials, and has
previously placed a candidate on the ballot by petition.  Baer v. Meyer, 728
F.2d 471 (10th Cir. 1984).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-2-303.</H1>
1-2-303.  Multiple registration - most recent date of registration
determines precinct in which allowed to vote. (1)  If a registered elector is
registered to vote in more than one precinct in this state, the elector shall
be allowed to vote only in the precinct which pertains to the most recent date
of registration, as determined by the secretary of state's master list of
registered electors.
<P>(2)  If the elector completes a "notice of registration" form as required
by section 1-2-204 (2) (i), the county clerk and recorder shall immediately
transmit the form to the county clerk and recorder of the elector's prior
county of residence, using the statewide electronic registration system in the
counties that do on-line registration with the secretary of state.  Upon
receipt of the form, the county clerk and recorder of the county of prior
residence shall use the elector's "notice of registration" as evidence of the
elector's move from the county and shall cancel the registration record from
the registration book.  In counties that do not have on-line registration with
the secretary of state, the form shall be transmitted weekly to the secretary
of state.  The secretary of state shall notify the county clerk and recorders
of any duplicate records throughout the state.  The county clerk and recorder
of the county of prior residence shall cancel the registration record only if
the name and birth date or the name and social security number of the elector
match.
<P>(3)  If a county clerk and recorder receives a notice from another county
clerk and recorder in the state of Colorado, from the Secretary of State, or
from an election official in another state that the elector has registered to
vote in another county or transferred registration to another county, the
county clerk and recorder of the county of prior residence shall cancel the
registration record if the name and birth date or the name and social security
number of the elector match.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-2-216.</H1>
1-2-216.  Change of residence. (1)  Any eligible elector who has moved
from the precinct in which the elector is registered to some other precinct in
the same county or has moved from one residence to another residence in the
same precinct may have the elector's residence changed on the registration
books by appearing before the county clerk and recorder and signing the
registration book for the change.  An eligible elector may also have his or her
residence changed on the registration books by writing a letter or filing a
form furnished by the county clerk and recorder.  The letter or form for the
change shall include the elector's new residence address within the county,
mailing address if different from the residence address, old address, printed
name, birth date, social security number, if the elector wishes to state it,
and signature and the date.
<P>(2)  Any address change made on the same form or personal letter as a
change or withdrawal of affiliation or name change shall be accepted by the
county clerk and recorder if the form or personal letter is signed indicating
that the elector intended to make the change or withdrawal indicated on the
form or in the personal letter.
<P>(3)  Any eligible elector who is unable to write may request assistance
from the county clerk and recorder, and the county clerk and recorder shall
sign the form, witnessing the elector's mark, or the elector may have his or
her mark attested to by a notary public on a prescribed form or personal
letter, if the request is not made at the office of the county clerk and
recorder.
<P>(4) (a)  For the twenty-eight days before and on the day of any primary,
general, or congressional vacancy election, any eligible elector, by appearing
in person at the office of the county clerk and recorder, may complete a change
of address form within the county in which the elector is registered, stating,
under penalty of perjury, that the elector has moved prior to the thirtieth day
before the election and that on the day of the election the elector will have
lived at the new address in the new precinct for at least thirty days.  Upon
the receipt of the request, the county clerk and recorder shall verify the
registration of the elector and, upon verification, if the elector does not
choose to vote at the time the request is verified, shall issue or authorize a
certificate of registration, showing the information required in section
1-2-215 plus the change of address.
<P>(b)  The election judges shall allow the registered elector to vote in the
precinct where the new address is located.  The election judges shall use the
certificate of registration as a substitute registration record, entering the
date of the election and pollbook ballot number on the certificate and
including it with the registration book when it is returned to the county clerk
and recorder following the election.
<P>(c)  If the request is received by the county clerk and recorder on or
after the time early voting has begun, the elector may vote at the time the
change of address request is received.  The elector may also vote by absentee
ballot if the ballots have been prepared.  If the request is received on the
election day, the elector may, at the discretion of the county clerk and
recorder, vote in the office of the county clerk and recorder rather than
voting in the precinct where the new address is located.
<P>(5)  Changes from one residence in a precinct to another residence in the
same precinct may be made on the day of any primary, general, congressional
vacancy, or coordinated election by the election judges.  Any election judge
making the change shall sign opposite the change of residence.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-2-213.</H1>
1-2-213.  Registration at driver's license examination facilities.
(1)  Commencing July 1, 1985, the department of revenue, through its local
driver's license examination facilities, shall provide each eligible elector
who applies for the issuance, renewal, or correction of any type of driver's
license or for an identification card pursuant to part 3 of article 2 of title
42, C.R.S., an opportunity to complete an application to register to vote by
use of a form containing the necessary information required by this part 2.
<P>(2) (a)  An applicant who wishes to complete an application for
registration shall read and answer the questions required by section 1-2-204
and shall make a self-affirmation by signing  the following statement:  "I,
......................, do solemnly affirm that I am a citizen of the United
States and that on the date of the next election I shall have attained the age
of eighteen years and shall have resided in the state of Colorado at least
thirty days and in my precinct at least thirty days before the election.  I
further affirm that the present address I listed herein is my sole legal place
of residence and that I claim no other place as my legal residence."  Each
application for registration shall bear the following statement:  "Warning: It
is a class 1 misdemeanor to affirm falsely as to your qualifications to
register to vote."
<P>(b)  The application for registration shall not require any information
that duplicates information required in the driver's license portion of the
form other than a second signature or other information necessary to assure
that the applicant meets the eligibility requirements for registration.  The
application may require only the minimum amount of information necessary to
prevent duplicate voter registrations and enable the county clerk and recorder
to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration
and other parts of the election process.
<P>(c)  The application shall include a statement that, if an applicant
declines to register to vote, the fact that the applicant has declined to
register will remain confidential and will be used only for voter registration
purposes, and a statement that, if an applicant does register to vote, the
office at which the applicant submits a voter registration application will
remain confidential and will be used only for voter registration purposes.
<P>(d)  The authorized employee shall stamp the application for registration
with a validation stamp and indicate on the driver's license that the bearer
registered to vote, which license shall be the elector's receipt.  Applications
and changes shall be forwarded on a weekly basis to the county clerk and
recorder of the county in which the driver's license examination facility is
located, and, if the applicant lives in a different county from the facility,
the application shall then be forwarded to the county clerk and recorder of the
county in which the applicant resides;  except that, during the last week
allowed for registration prior to any election, the applications shall be
forwarded daily to the county clerk and recorder of the county in which the
driver's license examination facility is located.
<P>(3)  Upon receipt of an application, the county clerk and recorder shall
determine if the application is complete. If the application is complete, the
applicant shall be deemed registered as of the date of application.  If the
application is not complete, the county clerk and recorder shall notify the
applicant, stating the additional information required. The applicant shall be
deemed registered  as of the date of application if the additional information
is provided at any time prior to the actual voting.
<P>(4)  (Deleted by amendment, p. 1756,  16, effective January 1, 1995.)
<P>(5)  The department of revenue and the secretary of state shall jointly
develop an application form and a change of name and address form by April 1,
1985, which shall allow an applicant wishing to register to vote to do so by
the use of a single form containing the necessary information required by this
part 2 and the information required for the issuance, renewal, or correction of
the driver's license or identification card.  The forms shall be furnished to
the local driver's license examination facilities by the department of revenue.
<P>(6)  Unless the registrant states on the form that the change of address
is not for voter registration purposes, any eligible elector who continues to
reside in the county where the elector is registered to vote and who informs a
driver's license examination facility of a change of name or address shall have
notice of the change of name or address forwarded by the driver's license
examination facility to the county clerk and recorder of the county in which
the driver's license facility is located.  If the elector lives in a different
county from the facility, the county clerk and recorder shall forward the
change to the county clerk and recorder of the county in which the elector
resides.  The county clerk and recorder of the county in which the elector
resides shall change the registration record of the elector to reflect the
change of name and address.
<P>(7)  No information relating to the failure of an applicant for a driver's
license to sign a voter registration application may be used for any purpose
other than voter registration.

<P>C.J.S. See 29 C.J.S., Elections,   252, 261, 300, 308-312.
<P>Annotator's note. The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>Law reviews. For comment on Porter v. Johnson, 85 Colo. 440, 276 P. 333
(1929), appearing below, see 2 Rocky Mt. L. Rev. 1311 (1930).
<P>The provision for contesting the election of county officers is not only
special in character, but furnishes a complete system of procedure within
itself.  Gray v. Huntley, 77 Colo. 478, 238 P. 53 (1925).  See Schwarz v.
County Court, 14 Colo. 44, 23 P. 84 (1890); Kindel v. Le Bert, 23 Colo. 385, 48
P. 641, 58 Am. St. R. 234 (1897).
<P>The provision for contesting the election of county officers lists the
pleadings and time within which they are to be filed.  Cox v. Starkweather, 128
Colo. 89, 260 P.2d 587 (1953).
<P>And such system is exclusive. Lewis v. Boynton, 25 Colo. 486, 55 P. 732
(1898).
<P>II.  ELECTION MAY BE CONTESTED.
<P>Scope of contest. Contests of the election of any person declared duly
elected to any county office, except the office of county judge, are governed
by this section.  Gray v. Huntley, 77 Colo. 478, 238 P. 53 (1925).  See Schwarz
v. County Court, 14 Colo. 44, 23 P. 84 (1890); Kindel v. Le Bert, 23 Colo. 385,
48 P. 641, 58 Am. St. R. 234 (1897).
<P>And election contest over the office of county judge comes under Rule 100,
C.R.C.P. Boger v. Smith, 77 Colo. 475, 238 P. 57 (1925).
<P>The judge sitting in term time in his regular capacity as the court for
the county is invested with jurisdiction to try and determine contested
election cases of county officers.  Vailes v. Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P. 495,
14 L.R.A.  120 (1891).  See Gunson v. Baldauf, 88 Colo. 436, 297 P. 516 (1931).
<P>But whether a judge sitting in vacation may exercise such jurisdiction not
determined. See Vailes v. Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P. 945, 14 L.R.A. 120 (1891).
<P>A contest proceeding is initiated by the filing of a bond and a statement
of contest.  Gunson v. Baldauf, 88 Colo. 436, 297 P. 516 (1931).
<P>III.  BOND REQUIRED.
<P>The bond for costs is for the benefit of the contestee. Nicholls v.
Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62 P. 202 (1900).
<P>And whether it be given or not in the first instance does not affect the
jurisdiction of the court.  Nicholls v. Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62 P. 202
(1900).
<P>So contestee must object. If no bond for costs be given when the action is
commenced, or if the one accepted be insufficient, it is incumbent upon the
contestee, to object at the earliest opportunity.  Nicholls v. Barrick, 27
Colo. 432, 62 P. 202 (1900).
<P>Otherwise, he will waive his rights in this respect.  Nicholls v. Barrick,
27 Colo. 432, 62 P. 202 (1900).
<P>The cost bond should not be in any specified penalty, but should be
conditioned for the payment of all costs.  Nicholls v. Barrick, 27 Colo. 432,
62 P. 202 (1900).
<P>But the contestee cannot object to the bond because a penalty is
specified, in the absence of a showing that the penalty fixed is insufficient
to cover the probable costs which he may incur in the case.  Nicholls v.
Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62 P. 202 (1900).
<P>Attorney's fees are not included in "all costs".  Amaya v. District Court,
197 Colo. 129, 590 P.2d 506 (1979).
<P>IV.  STATEMENT OF CONTEST.
<P>A.  Filing.
<P>The contest must be filed within 10 days after the date when the votes are
canvassed.  Vigil v. Garcia, 36 Colo. 430, 87 P. 543 (1906).
<P>And this means all the votes. Vigil v. Garcia, 36 Colo. 430, 87 P. 543
(1906).
<P>However, it does not mean a sufficient number to show that one or the
other of the parties was elected. Vigil v. Garcia, 36 Colo. 430, 87 P. 543
(1906).
<P>But it means the votes of the entire county. Vigil v. Garcia, 36 Colo.
430, 87 P. 543 (1906).
<P>And if for any reason one or more precincts are not canvassed at the time
of the first sitting of the board, the statute will not commence to run until
those precincts are canvassed, even though the returns from those precincts,
when counted, will not affect the result as between candidates for any single
office.  Vigil v. Garcia, 36 Colo. 430, 87 P. 543 (1906).
<P>Moreover, the contest provision is to be construed as a statute of
limitations upon a summary proceeding.  Vailes v. Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P.
945, 14 L.R.A. 120 (1891).
<P>Whose time limit may not be enlarged. A statutory provision requiring
notice of contest to be given within a given time from either the date of the
official count, the declaration of the result, or the issuing of the
certificate of election, etc., is peremptory, and the time cannot be enlarged.
Vailes v. Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P. 945, 14 L.R.A. 120 (1891).
<P>And there is the strongest reason for enforcing this rule most rigidly in
cases of contested elections, because promptness in commencing and prosecuting
the proceedings is of the utmost importance to the end that a decision may be
reached before the term has wholly, or in great part, expired.  Vailes v.
Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P. 945, 14 L.R.A. 120 (1891).
<P>Furthermore, time cannot be extended on ground that last day falls on
Sunday. When the statutory period for filing the statement of an election
contest for county officers under this section has fully elapsed, excluding the
day when the votes are canvassed, the time cannot be extended merely on the
ground that the last day happens to fall on Sunday.  This is the reasonable as
well as the natural and literal interpretation of the section.  Vailes v.
Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P. 945, 14 L.R.A. 120 (1891).
<P>Although it is clear that the first day must be excluded, for the
contestor is given 10 days after the day when the votes are canvassed to file
his statement.  Vailes v. Brown, 16 Colo. 462, 27 P. 945, 14 L.R.A. 120 (1891).
<P>B.  Requisites of Statement.
<P>There must be reasonable definiteness in statements of election contests.
Suttle v. Sullivan, 131 Colo. 519, 283 P.2d 636 (1955).
<P>A statement of contest which contains the averments and matters required
by statute is sufficient to state a cause of action and sufficiently alleges
the qualifications of the contestor to hold the office.  Nicholls v. Barrick,
27 Colo. 432, 62 P. 202 (1900).
<P>Hence, statement must include the particular cause of the contest. A
contest proceeding is initiated by the filing of a statement of contest, the
contents of which must conform to this section, and include the particular
cause or causes of the contest.  Gunson v. Baldauf, 88 Colo. 436, 297 P. 516
(1931).
<P>Causes of contest incorporated by reference. The causes of contest are,
insofar as applicable, incorporated by reference into the provision requiring a
contestor of the election of county officers to file a written statement
setting forth, among other things, the causes of the contest, and hence also
into the provision relating to contests in special district elections.  Jardon
v. Meadowbrook-Fairview Metropolitan Dist., 190 Colo. 528, 549 P.2d 762 (1976).
<P>Where the statement does not allege facts showing that the irregularities
complained of changed the result of the election, the statement does not state
a cause of action.  Suttle v. Sullivan, 131 Colo. 519, 283 P.2d 636 (1955).
<P>Statement of contestor that he is "an elector of the county" is a material
averment and must be proved if denied by the answer or the contest as such must
fail.  Clanton v. Ryan, 14 Colo. 419, 24 P. 258 (1890).
<P>Nor is the contestor excused from producing evidence in support of such
averment on the ground that other competent evidence is refused. Clanton v.
Ryan, 14 Colo. 419, 24 P. 258 (1890).
<P>Statement may be amended as to proper name of contestee. Where there was
an admitted mistake in naming the contestee in an election contest, a trial
court errs in denying contestor's motion to amend the statement of contest.
Graham v. Swift, 123 Colo. 309, 228 P.2d 969 (1951).
<P>V.  ANSWER.
<P>If contestee desires to controvert the truth of the matters averred in the
statement of contest, he must do so by filing an answer in the time prescribed.
Lewis v. Boynton, 25 Colo. 486, 55 P. 732 (1898).
<P>And contestee cannot avail himself of a demurrer (now motion to dismiss
for failure to state a claim) for the purpose for which it is ordinarily used.
Lewis v. Boynton, 25 Colo. 486, 55 P. 732 (1898).
<P>But if he elects to interpose such a demurrer (now motion to dismiss), it
must be regarded as the equivalent of an answer admitting the truth of the
matters averred, in which case it is unnecessary to introduce evidence in
support of the allegations of the statement of contest.  Lewis v. Boynton, 25
Colo. 486, 55 P. 732 (1898).
<P>VI.  RECEPTION OF ILLEGAL
<P>VOTES OR REJECTION OF
<P>LEGAL VOTES.
<P>Although a slight ambiguity exists, the evident purpose of including the
list of disputed votes is to require each party to give the other notice of the
names of such persons as he claims illegally voted for his competitor and of
those whose votes for himself were illegally rejected.  Schwarz v. County
Court, 14 Colo. 44, 23 P. 84 (1890).
<P>This provision is mandatory. The provision that where the reception of
illegal votes is the ground of contest a list of the persons alleged to have
voted illegally must be set forth in the statement of contest is mandatory.
Town of Sugar City v. Board of Comm'rs, 57 Colo. 432, 140 P. 809 (1914).  See
Israel v. Wood, 98 Colo. 495, 56 P.2d 1324 (1936); Graham v. Swift, 123 Colo.
309, 228 P.2d 969 (1951).
<P>And it must be strictly construed. Town of Sugar City v. Board of Comm'rs,
57 Colo. 432, 140 P. 809 (1914).
<P>Moreover, the provisions of the rules of civil procedure have no
application. Town of Sugar City v. Board of Comm'rs, 57 Colo. 432, 140 P.809
(1914).
<P>Consequently, in order to give the court jurisdiction the contest
statement must contain the required list. Schwarz v. County Court, 14 Colo. 44,
23 P. 84 (1890); Town of Sugar City v. Board of Comm'rs, 57 Colo. 432, 140 P.
809 (1914).
<P>And an amendment to the statement to include the name of the voters is not
permissible. Town of Sugar City v. Board of Comm'rs, 57 Colo. 432, 140 P. 809
(1914); Kay v. Strobeck, 81 Colo. 144, 254 P. 150 (1927).
<P>Also, the omission to furnish the required list of names cannot be
justified by subsequently alleging that the information necessary to prepare
the same was in the hands of contestee by whose fraud and violence contestor
was prevented from obtaining it when no effort was made in the first instance
to either comply with the section or to excuse the failure.  Schwarz v. County
Court, 14 Colo. 44, 23 P. 84 (1890).
<P>Hence, there is no error in the refusal of the court to declare a vote
illegal where the voter's name was not set forth in the statement of contest.
Kay v. Strobeck, 81 Colo. 144, 254 P. 150 (1927).
<P>List concerning absentee voters held not to meet requirements. Where
exhibit incorporated into statement of contest contained a long list of names
of persons applying for and voting absentee ballots, but there was nothing in
the list to indicate how many persons therein named were not legally qualified
residents of the county, or who were not qualified by reason of mental or
physical incompetence, or who had subscribed to an oath before a person
unauthorized to administer the same, the statement of contest failed to meet
the requirements for supplying a list of disputed votes.  Graham v. Swift, 123
Colo. 309, 228 P.2d 969 (1951).
<P>However, list not required where no "rejection" or "reception" of votes.
In an election contest where the contestor alleged that two legal ballots had
been rejected after they had been placed in the box, the polls had closed, and
the ballots had been counted and canvassed, the ground of contest was not the
"rejection" of legal votes or the "reception" of illegal votes, and the
contestor was not required to set forth in his statement of contest a list of
the number of persons who "so voted" or "offered to vote".  Waggoner v. Barela,
123 Colo. 436, 230 P.2d 586 (1951).
<P>And a vote is rejected when an elector offers to vote and is not permitted
to cast a ballot; the rejected vote is a vote that is not cast - one that did
not reach the ballot box.  Waggoner v. Barela, 123 Colo. 436, 230 P.2d 586
(1951).
<P>But if an elector is permitted to cast a ballot and to deposit it in the
ballot box, the vote is accepted and must be counted unless it is attacked upon
the other ground named in the statute, to wit, "the reception of illegal"
votes, in which event the contest provision requires a list of the names of the
persons who "so voted", that is, who voted illegally, to be set out in the
statement of contest.  Waggoner v. Barela, 123 Colo. 436, 230 P.2d 586 (1951).
<P>For the term "so voted" refers to alleged illegal votes in the ballot box.
Waggoner v. Barela, 123 Colo. 436, 230 P.2d 586 (1951).
<P>While the term "or offered to vote" refers to electors, the rejected votes
of whom were not cast or placed in the ballot box.  Waggoner v. Barela, 123
Colo. 436, 230 P.2d 586 (1951).
<P>Notwithstanding, illegal votes, whether challenged or not, may be
considered in an election contest.  Russell v. Wheeler, 165 Colo. 296, 439 P.2d
43 (1968).
<P>As there is no statutory requirement that contested votes must be votes
which are challenged at the polling place.  Russell v. Wheeler, 165 Colo. 296,
439 P.2d 43 (1968).
<P>However, where contestor alleges that an ineligible voter's ballot was
received and counted for contestee, the burden is on the contestor to prove
this necessary allegation contained in his statement of contest.  Porter v.
Johnson, 85 Colo. 440, 276 P. 333 (1929).
<P>VII.  REPLY TO COUNTERSTATEMENT.
<P>Contestor's assertion of counterstatement's failure to state a claim does
not deprive contestee's right to proof. In view of the specific denial of the
charges made in the statement of contest, the counterstatement of contest filed
by contestee, and the requirement that judgment be pronounced, it would be
unreasonable to hold that the contestor's demurrer (now motion to dismiss for
failure to state a claim) under such circumstances would deprive the contestee
of the right to demand proof of the charges made by the contestor and to
introduce testimony in support of his counterstatement of contest, inasmuch as
such a ruling would deny the contestee his day in court.  Gunson v. Baldauf, 88
Colo. 436, 297 P. 516 (1931).

1-4-205.  County commissioners. (1) (a)  Members of the board of county
commissioners shall be elected in each county, excluding a city and county, for
a term of four years.
<P>(b)  No person shall be a county commissioner unless that person is a
registered elector and has resided in the district for at least one year prior
to the election.
<P>(2)  Each county having a population of less than seventy  thousand shall
have three county commissioners, any two of whom shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business.  One commissioner shall be elected at the general
election in 1982 and every four years thereafter, and two commissioners shall
be elected at the general election in 1984 and every four years thereafter.
<P>(3) (a)  In each county having a population of seventy thousand or more,
the board of county commissioners may consist either of three members, any two
of whom shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, or of five
members, any  three of whom shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business.
<P>(b)  If the board consists of three commissioners, they shall be elected
as provided in subsection (2) of this section and as provided in section
30-10-306.7 (5), C.R.S.
<P>(c)  In any county having a population of seventy thousand or more, the
membership of the board of county commissioners may be increased from three to
five members pursuant to section 30-10-306.5, C.R.S., or decreased from five to
three members pursuant to section 30-10-306.7 (2) (a) (II), C.R.S.

<P>Law reviews. For article, "Colorado's Program to Improve Court
Administration", see 38 Dicta 1 (1961).
<P>Courts would not inquire into county's increase in commissioners. Where a
county entitled to increase the number of its commissioners from three to five,
did make such increase, and the people of the county acquiesced therein and
thereafter elected successors to the added members of the board so as to keep
the number at five, in an action brought by private individuals twenty years
after such increase was made to test the right of the successors of the added
members of the board to the office, the courts will not inquire into the
regularity of the proceeding making such increase.  People ex rel. Lankford v.
Long, 32 Colo. 486, 77 P. 251 (1904).
<P>And court action was not maintainable. In an action against two county
commissioners jointly to test their right to hold their offices on the ground
that the board was illegally increased from three to five members and that
respondents were the successors in office of the two illegally added members of
the board, where it appears that one of the respondents was not a successor of
either of the added members of the board, a joint action could not be
maintained against respondents.  People ex rel. Lankford v. Long, 32 Colo. 486,
77 P. 251 (1904).

which the incumbent actually expended as an expense of the election.  In no
event shall the sum repaid exceed forty cents per voter, subject to a maximum
repayment of ten thousand dollars.
<P>(3)  Authorized expenses shall include, but are not limited to, moneys
spent in challenging the sufficiency of the recall petition and in presenting
to the electors the official position of the incumbent, including campaign

shall then review the reimbursement request for appropriateness under
subsection (2) of this section and shall refer the request, with
recommendations, to the general assembly at its next general session for state
recall elections or to the treasurer of the governing body for all other
elections within thirty days after receipt of the request for reimbursement.

1-40-101.  Legislative declaration. It is not the intention of this

<P>Annotator's note. Since  1-40-101 is similar to  1-40-111 as it existed
prior to the 1993 amendment of title 1, article 40, which resulted in the
relocation of provisions, see the annotations under former  1-40-111 in the
1980 replacement volume.

no civil action for relief is instituted by the attorney general, the
complainant shall have a private right of action based on an alleged violation
of this part 5 and may institute a civil action in district court for any

even-numbered year, which day shall be known as "precinct caucus day".
<P>(2) (a)  At the time of electing the delegates to the county assembly, the

days and has been affiliated with the political party holding the precinct
caucus for a period of at least two months preceding the date of the precinct
caucus; except that any person who has attained the age of eighteen years or
who has become a naturalized citizen during the two months immediately
preceding the precinct caucus may be a candidate for the office of precinct
committeeperson even though he or she has been affiliated with the political
party for less than two months as shown on the registration book of the county
clerk and recorder.  The two people receiving the highest number of votes at
the caucus for precinct committeeperson shall be elected as the precinct
committeepersons of the precinct.  If two or more candidates for precinct
committeeperson receive an equal and the second highest number of votes, or if
three or more candidates receive an equal and the highest number of votes, the
election shall be determined by lot by those candidates.  The names of the
committeepersons elected shall be certified to the county assembly of the
political party by the officers of the caucus. All disputes regarding the
election of precinct committeepersons shall be determined by the credentials
committees of the respective party assemblies.  The county assembly shall
ratify the list of committeepersons.  The presiding officer and secretary of
the county assembly shall file a certified list of the names and addresses, by
precinct, of those persons elected as precinct committeepersons with the county
clerk and recorder within ten days after the date of the county assembly.
<P>(b)  Within ten days after the boundaries of an existing precinct are
changed or a new precinct is created, the members of the party county central
committee vacancy committee shall select members to fill the vacancies for
precinct committeepersons.
<P>(c)  Repealed.
<P>(d)  The person elected as committeeperson at the caucus shall assume the
office immediately following the caucus.  Causes for removal of the elected
committeeperson from office shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
<P>(I)  In the case of removal by the credentials committee at the county
assembly, the person does not meet the qualifications for committeeperson;
<P>(II)  In the case of removal by the county central  committee, the person
has moved from the precinct or has changed party affiliation.
<P>(III)  Repealed.
<P>(3) and (4)  Repealed.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-12-108.</H1>
1-12-108.  Petition requirements. (1)  The petition shall be prepared and
circulated pursuant to this part 1.  No signature shall be counted that was
placed on a petition prior to approval of the petition by the designated
election official or more than sixty days after the designated election
official's approval of the petition.
<P>(2) (a)  The petition for the recall of an elected official may consist of
one or more sheets, to be fastened together in the form of one petition, but
each sheet shall contain the same heading and the sworn affidavit of the
circulator.  No petition shall contain the name of more than one person
proposed to be recalled from office.
<P>(b)  The petition for recall may be circulated and signed in sections, and
each section shall contain a full and accurate copy of the title and text of
the petition.  Each petition shall designate, by name and address, three
persons, referred to in this section as the "committee", that shall represent
the signers in all matters affecting the petition.
<P>(3) (a)  The signatures to a recall petition need not all be appended to
one paper, but no petition shall be legal that does not contain the requisite
number of names of eligible electors whose names do not appear on any other
petition previously filed for the recall of the same person under the
provisions of this section.
<P>(b)  At the top of each page shall be printed, in bold-faced type, the
following:
<P>WARNING:
<P>IT IS AGAINST THE LAW:
<P>For anyone to sign this petition with any name other than one's own or to
<P>knowingly sign one's name more than once for the same measure or to
<P>knowingly sign the petition when not a registered elector.
<P>Do not sign this petition unless you are an eligible elector.  To be an
<P>eligible elector you must be registered to vote and eligible to vote in
<P>(name of political subdivision) elections.
<P>Do not sign this petition unless you have read or have had read to you
<P>the proposed recall measure in its entirety and understand its meaning.
<P>(c)  Directly following the warning in paragraph (b) of this subsection
(3) shall be printed in bold-faced type the following:
<P>Petition to recall (name of person sought to be recalled) from the office
<P>of (title of office).
<P>(4)  No petition shall be circulated until it has been approved as meeting
the requirements of this subsection (4) as to form.  The secretary of state and
the official with whom the petitions are to be filed shall approve or
disapprove a petition as to form by the close of the second business day
following submission of the proposed petition.  The official shall mail written
notice of the action taken to the person who submitted the petition and to the
officer whom the petition seeks to recall on the day the action is taken.
<P>(5) (a)  Every petition shall be signed only by eligible electors.
<P>(b)  Unless physically unable, all electors shall sign their own signature
and shall print their names, respective residence addresses, including the
street number and name, the city or town, the county, and the date of
signature.  Each signature on a petition shall be made, to the extent possible,
in black ink.
<P>(c)  Any person, except a circulator, may assist an elector who is
physically unable to sign the petition in completing the information on the
petition as required by law. On the petition immediately following the name of
the disabled elector, the person providing assistance shall both sign and state
that the assistance was given to the disabled elector.
<P>(6) (a)  Only an eligible elector may circulate a recall petition.
<P>(b)  To each petition section shall be attached a signed, notarized, and
dated affidavit executed by the eligible elector who circulated the petition
section, which shall include:  The affiant's printed name, the address at which
the affiant resides, including the street name and number, the city or town,
the county, and the date of signature; a statement that the affiant was an
eligible elector at the time the section of the petition was circulated and
signed by the listed electors; a statement that the affiant circulated the
section of the petition; a statement that each signature on the petition
section is the signature of the person whose name it purports to be; a
statement that to the best of the affiant's knowledge and belief each of the
persons signing the petition section was, at the time of signing, an eligible
elector; and a statement that the affiant has not paid or will not in the
future pay and that the affiant believes that no other person has paid or will
pay, directly or indirectly, any money or other thing of value to any signer
for the purpose of inducing or causing the signer to sign the petition.
<P>(c)  The designated election official shall not accept for filing any
section of a petition that does not have attached to it the notarized affidavit
required by this section.  Any signature added to a section of a petition after
the affidavit has been executed is invalid.
<P>(7)  The petition, when executed and acknowledged as prescribed in this
section, shall be filed as follows:  With the secretary of state if it is for
an office voted on by the electors of the entire state or of a congressional
district or for the offices of members of the general assembly or district
attorney or a district office of state concern; with the county clerk and
recorder if it is for a county office; and with the designated election
official if it is for a nonpartisan local election.
<P>(8) (a)  Upon filing, the designated election official for the political
subdivision shall review all petition information and verify the information
against the registration records, and, where applicable, the county assessor's
records.  The secretary of state shall establish guidelines for verifying
petition entries.
<P>(b)  Any disassembly of a section of the petition prior to filing that has
the effect of separating the affidavits from the signatures shall render that
section of the petition invalid and of no force and effect.
<P>(c)  After review, the designated election official shall notify the
committee and the incumbent of the number of valid signatures and whether the
petition appears to be sufficient or insufficient.  Upon determining that the
petition is sufficient and after the time for protest has passed, the
designated election official shall certify the recall question to the ballot
and, if the election is a coordinated election, notify the coordinated election
official.
<P>(9) (a)  A recall petition that has been verified by the designated
election official shall be held to be sufficient unless a protest in writing
under oath is filed in the office of the designated election official by an
eligible elector within fifteen days after the petition is filed or an
amendment is filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection (9).  The
petition shall set forth specific grounds for the protest. Grounds include but
are not limited to failure of any portion of a petition or circulator affidavit
to meet the requirements of this article or any conduct on the part of petition
circulators that substantially misleads persons signing the petition.  The
designated election official shall forthwith mail a copy of the protest to the
committee named in the petition as representing the signers, together with a
notice fixing a time for hearing the protest not less than five nor more than
ten days after the notice is mailed.  Every hearing shall be before the
designated election official with whom the protest is filed or before a
district judge sitting in that county if the designated election official is
the subject of the recall.  The testimony in every hearing shall be under oath.
The hearing shall be summary and not subject to delay and shall be concluded
within thirty days after the petition is filed, and the result shall be
forthwith certified to the committee.
<P>(b)  The party filing a protest has the burden of sustaining the protest
by a preponderance of the evidence. The decision upon matters of substance is
open to review, if prompt application is made, as provided in section 1-1-113.
The remedy in all cases shall be summary, and the decision of any court having
jurisdiction shall be final and not subject to review by any other court;
except that the supreme court, in the exercise of its discretion, may review
any judicial proceeding in a summary way.
<P>(c)  In case a petition for recall is not sufficient, it may be withdrawn
by a majority of the committee and may be amended at any time within sixty days
from the date the petition was approved by the designated election official.
Any signer may request that his or her name be stricken from the petition
within the sixty-day period.
<P>(10)  Any person who willfully destroys, defaces, mutilates, or suppresses
a petition, or who willfully neglects to file or delays delivery of a petition,
or who conceals or removes a petition from the possession of the person
authorized by law to have custody of it, or who aids, counsels, procures, or
assists any person in doing any of the above acts commits a misdemeanor and,
upon conviction, shall be punished as provided in section 1-13-111.

<P>Annotator's note. The following annotations are taken from a case decided
under a former provision similar to this section.
<P>The "vacancy" section must be construed in the light of the two-pronged
framework for the designation and nomination of candidates either by the party
assembly or by petition.  Anderson v. Mullaney, 166 Colo. 533, 444 P.2d 878
(1968).
<P>A vacancy comes into being when a party assembly fails to designate any
candidate for nomination to a particular office.  Anderson v. Mullaney, 166
Colo. 533, 444 P.2d 878 (1968).
<P>And such "vacancy" continues to exist until it is filled by the party
central committee or the time for filing it expires by the term of the statute.
Anderson v. Mullaney, 166 Colo. 533, 444 P.2d 878 (1968).
<P>The "vacancy" created by the party assembly's failure to designate a
candidate for nomination may be filled by the subsequent action of the
appropriate party central committee.  Anderson v. Mullaney, 166 Colo. 533, 444
P.2d 878 (1968).
<P>This is true even though a candidate for party nomination has in the
interim between the assembly and the action of the central committee been
placed on the primary ballot by petition.  Anderson v. Mullaney, 166 Colo. 533,
444 P.2d 878 (1968).

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>

1993.

<P>Annotator's note.  The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>The power granted to the state central committee of a political party to
determine party controversies is constitutional. This grant of power was not in
violation of the former provisions concerning district court jurisdiction, now
9 of art. VI, Colo. Const., on the grounds that it divests the district courts
of jurisdiction in such causes and confers it upon another tribunal, as the
district courts have no such jurisdiction in the absence of a statute
conferring it.  People ex rel. Lowry v. District Court, 32 Colo. 15, 74 P. 896
(1903).
<P>And the committee, or the state convention while in session, has exclusive
jurisdiction to determine all controversies between factions of the same party
as to which is the regular organization and entitled to the party name and to
make and file nominations for office under the party name within any district,
county, or city of the state.  People ex rel. Lowry v. District Court, 32 Colo.
15, 74 P. 896 (1903).
<P>Factional disputes of subordinate divisions of a political party must be
referred to the state central committee of that political party.  People ex
rel. Lowry v. District Court, 32 Colo. 15, 74 P. 896 (1903).
<P>And the courts have no jurisdiction in such factional and internal
disputes between members of the same party although the committee may not have
passed thereon.  People ex rel. Lowry v. District Court, 32 Colo. 15, 74 P. 896
(1903).
<P>And prohibition lies to prevent court from taking further action.  Where a
district court is proceeding without jurisdiction to determine a factional
dispute between members of the same political party, and the parties objecting
to such proceeding have no speedy and adequate remedy at law, on petition to
supreme court a writ of prohibition will issue to prevent the court from taking
any further action in the matter except to dismiss the proceedings.  People ex
rel. Lowry v. District Court, 32 Colo. 15, 74 P. 896 (1903).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-4-602.</H1>
1-4-602.  Delegates to party assemblies. (1) (a)  County assemblies shall
be held not less than ten days nor more than thirty days after precinct
caucuses held on the first Tuesday in April.  The county central committee
shall fix the number of delegates from each precinct to participate in the
county assembly. The persons receiving the highest number of votes at the
precinct caucus shall be the delegates to the county assembly from the
precinct.  If two or more candidates receive an equal number of votes for the
last available place in the election of delegates to county assemblies at the
precinct  caucuses, the delegate shall be determined by lot by the candidates.
Except as provided in subsections (2) and (6) of this section, delegates to all
other party assemblies shall be selected by the respective county assemblies
from among the members of the county assemblies.
<P>(b)  In determining the number of delegates from precincts which have been
created or split since the previous general election, the county central
committee may allocate delegates  based on the number of registered voters
affiliated with the political party.
<P>(2) (a)  In each state senatorial and representative district comprised of
a portion of one county only, persons elected at precinct caucuses as delegates
to the county assemblies shall serve also as delegates to the senatorial and
representative district assemblies.
<P>(b)  In each state senatorial and representative district comprised of one
or more whole counties and a portion of one or more counties or comprised of
portions of two or more counties, the number of delegates to the senatorial and
representative district assemblies shall be apportioned among the counties by
the party's senatorial or representative central committee according to the
vote in the county or portion of a county for that party's candidate for
governor or president in the last general election, unless the state party
bylaws or bylaws of the district provide a different method to apportion
delegates.
<P>(3)  All questions regarding the qualifications of any delegate or the
conduct of any precinct caucus at which the delegates were voted on shall be
determined by the credentials committees of the respective party county,
representative, and senatorial assemblies.
<P>(4)  All places established for holding precinct caucuses shall be
designated by a sign conspicuously posted for at least ten days before the
precinct caucuses.  The sign shall be substantially in the following form:
"Precinct caucus place for precinct no.  ......".  The lettering on the sign
and the precinct number shall be black on a white background, with all letters
and numerals at least four inches in height.  Any precinct caucus subsequently
removed and held in a place other than the place stated on the sign is null and
void.
<P>(5)  As used in this section, "delegate" means a person who is a
registered elector, has been a resident of the precinct for thirty days prior
to the caucus, and has been affiliated with the political party holding the
caucus for at least two months, as shown on the registration books of the
county clerk and recorder; except that any registered elector who has attained
the age of eighteen years during the two months immediately preceding the
caucus or any registered elector who has become a naturalized citizen during
the two months immediately preceding the caucus may be a delegate even though
the elector has been affiliated with the political party for less than two
months as shown on the registration books of the county clerk and recorder.  A
delegate who moves from the precinct of residence shall become ineligible to
serve as a delegate from that precinct.
<P>(6)  In each state senatorial and representative district comprised of all
or parts of more than one county, persons elected at precinct caucuses as
delegates to the county assemblies from precincts within the senatorial or
representative district shall also serve as delegates to the senatorial and
representative district assemblies if the senatorial or representative district
central committee, by resolution adopted prior to the holding of the precinct
caucuses in the year for which the resolution is to be effective, chooses to
have the delegates to its district assembly in that year elected as provided in
this subsection (6).  As a part of the resolution, the senatorial or
representative central committee may determine the total number of delegate
votes to be cast at the senatorial or representative district assembly,
apportion them by county among the portions of the district which lie in
separate counties upon an equitable basis determined by party bylaws or rules,
and, upon the basis of the apportionment, determine the factor necessary to
apportion equally among the delegates from the precincts within the district in
each county the total votes to be cast by delegates  from the portion of the
district lying within that county.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-4-1204.</H1>
1-4-1204.  Election results -  certification - pledging of delegates.
(1)  The secretary of state shall tabulate the number of votes received by each
candidate named on the presidential primary election ballot and shall calculate
the percentage of votes received by each candidate as compared to the number of
votes received by all candidates of the same political party.
<P>(2)  The secretary of state shall certify the results and percentages
calculated pursuant to subsection (1) of this section to the state chairperson
and the national committee of each political party which had at least one
candidate on the presidential primary election ballot.  To the extent permitted
by  state and national political party rules, each party shall use the election
results to allocate delegate votes to presidential candidates for the
presidential nominating convention of that party.  Political parties need not
allocate delegate votes to candidates who receive less than fifteen percent of
the votes cast in the presidential primary election for that party unless
required to do so by state or national party rules.  Delegates shall be pledged
or bound to vote for the candidate to which they have been allocated only to
the extent allowed by the state and national party rules of that political
party.
<P>(3)  It is the intent of the general assembly that the provisions of this
part 12 conform to the requirements of federal law and national political party
rules for presidential primary elections.  The secretary of state shall prepare
a written report to the general assembly concerning whether the provisions of
this part 12 conform to the requirements of federal law and national political
party rules for presidential primary elections.  The secretary of state shall
solicit comments from national political parties on the conformance of this
part 12 to their rules and shall include any comments submitted by the parties
on that topic.  The report shall be submitted to the legislative council no
later than January 1, 1991, and the general assembly shall make such reasonable
changes to this part 12 as are necessary to conform to federal law and national
political parties' rules.

<P>(3)  Forms completed by eligible electors, as provided in subsection (1)
of this section, shall be returned with other election  materials to the county
clerk and recorder.  If no challenges have been made, the forms may be
destroyed pursuant to section 1-7-802.
<P>(4)  Party ballots shall be cast in the same manner as in general
elections.  An elector shall not vote for more candidates for any office than
are to be elected at the general election as indicated on the ballot.
<P>(5)  Instead of voting for a candidate whose name is printed on the party
ballot, an elector may cast a write-in vote for any eligible candidate who is a
member of the political party and who has filed an affidavit of intent of
write-in candidacy pursuant to section 1-4-1101. When no candidate has been
designated by an assembly or by petition, a write-in candidate for nomination
by any political party must receive at least the number of votes at any primary
election that is required by section 1-4-801 (2) to become designated as a
candidate by petition.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-45-116.</H1>
1-45-116.  State and political subdivisions - limitations on
contributions. (1) (a) (I)  No agency, department, board, division, bureau,
commission, or council of the state or any political subdivision thereof shall
make any contribution or contribution in kind in campaigns involving the
nomination, retention, or election of any person to any public office, nor
shall any such entity expend any public moneys from any source, or make any
contributions in kind, to urge electors to vote in favor of or against any:
<P>(A)  Statewide ballot issue that has been submitted for the purpose of
having a title designated and fixed pursuant to section 1-40-106 (1) or that
has had a title designated and fixed pursuant to that section;
<P>(B)  Local ballot issue that has been submitted for the purpose of having
a title fixed pursuant to section 31-11-111 or that has had a title fixed
pursuant to that section;
<P>(C)  Referred measure, as defined in section 1-1-104 (34.5);
<P>(D)  Measure for the recall of any officer that has been certified by the
appropriate election official for submission to the electors for their approval
or rejection.
<P>(II)  However, a member or employee of any such agency, department, board,
division, bureau, commission, or council may respond to questions about any
such issue described in subparagraph (I) of this paragraph (a) if the member,
employee, or public entity has not solicited the question.  A member or
employee of any such agency, department, board, division, bureau, commission,
or council who has policy-making responsibilities may expend not more than
fifty dollars of public moneys in the form of letters, telephone calls, or
other activities incidental to expressing his or her opinion on any such issue
described in subparagraph (I) of this paragraph (a).
<P>(b) (I)  Nothing in this subsection (1) shall be construed as prohibiting
an agency, department, board, division, bureau, commission, or council of the
state or any political subdivision thereof from expending public moneys or
making contributions in kind to dispense a factual summary, which shall include
arguments both for and against the proposal, on any issue of official concern
before the electorate in the jurisdiction.  Such summary shall not contain a
conclusion or opinion in favor of or against any particular issue.  As used
herein, an issue of official concern shall be limited to issues that will
appear on an election ballot in the jurisdiction.
<P>(II)  Nothing in this subsection (1) shall be construed to prevent an
elected official from expressing a personal  opinion on any issue.
<P>(III)  Nothing in this subsection (1) shall be construed as prohibiting an
agency, department, board, division, bureau, commission, or council of the
state or any political subdivision  thereof from:
<P>(A)  Passing a resolution or taking a position of advocacy on any issue
described in subparagraph (I) of paragraph (a) of this subsection (1);  or
<P>(B)  Reporting the passage of or distributing such resolution through
established, customary means, other than paid advertising, by which information
about other proceedings of such agency, department, board, division, bureau, or
council of the state or any political subdivision thereof is regularly provided
to the public.
<P>(c)  Nothing in this subsection (1) shall be construed as prohibiting a
member or an employee of an agency, department, board, division, bureau,
commission, or council of the state or any political subdivision thereof from
expending personal funds, making contributions in kind, or using personal time
to urge electors to vote in favor of or against any issue described in
subparagraph (I) of paragraph (a) of this subsection (1).
<P>(2)  The provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to:
<P>(a)  An official residence furnished or paid for by the state or a
political subdivision;
<P>(b)  Security officers who are required to accompany a candidate or the
candidate's family;
<P>(c)  Publicly owned motor vehicles provided for the use of the chief
executive of the state or a political subdivision;
<P>(d)  Publicly owned aircraft provided for the use of the chief executive
of the state or of a political subdivision or his family for security purposes;
except that, if such use is, in whole or in part, for campaign purposes, the
expenses relating to the campaign shall be reported and reimbursed pursuant to
subsection (3) of this section.
<P>(3)  If any candidate who is also an incumbent inadvertently or
unavoidably makes any expenditure which involves campaign expenses and official
expenses, such expenditure shall be deemed a campaign expense only, unless the
candidate, not more than ten working days after such expenditure, files with
the appropriate officer such information as the secretary of state may by rule
require in order to differentiate between campaign expenses and official
expenses.  Such information shall be set forth on a form provided by the
appropriate officer.  In the event that public moneys have been expended for
campaign expenses and for official expenses, the candidate shall reimburse the
state or political subdivision for the amount of money spent on campaign
expenses.
<P>(4)  The provisions of this section shall be enforced as provided in
section 1-45-113 (2) (c).

1-2-228.  Residence - false information - penalty. Any person who votes by

<P>Annotator's note.  Since  1-2-228 is similar to  1-2-225 as it existed
prior to the 1992 repeal and reenactment of article 2 of this title, a relevant
case construing that provision has been included in the annotations to this
section.
<P>Conduct prohibited by this section is sufficiently distinguishable from
misdemeanor election statute to create two separate offenses avoiding violation
of equal protection clause.  This section is violated when defendant actually
votes by providing false information about present residence. People v. Onesimo
Romero, 746 P.2d 534 (Colo. 1987).

1-2-401.  Legislative declaration. It is the intent of the general
assembly that, in order to promote and encourage voter registration of all
eligible electors in the state, registration should be made as convenient as
possible.  It is determined by the general assembly that if voter registration
is convenient, the number of registered voters will increase.  It is further
determined by the general assembly that support and cooperation of school
officials and interested citizens will make high school registration
successful.  It is therefore the purpose of this part 4 to encourage voter
registration by providing convenient registration procedures for qualified high
school students, employees, and other persons by using high school deputy
registrars.

<HR>
<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-2-102.</H1>
1-2-102.  Rules for determining residence. (1)  The following rules shall
be used to determine the residence of a person intending to register or to vote
in any precinct in this state and shall be used by election judges in challenge
procedures:
<P>(a)  The residence of a person is the principal or primary home or place
of abode of a person.  A principal or primary home or place of abode is that
home or place in which a person's habitation is fixed and to which that person,
whenever absent, has the present intention of returning after a departure or
absence, regardless of the duration of the absence.  A residence is a permanent
building or part of a building and may include a house, condominium, apartment,
room in a house, or mobile home.  No vacant lot or business address shall be
considered a residence.
<P>(b)  In determining what is the principal or primary place of abode of a
person, the following circumstances relating to the person shall be taken into
account:  Business pursuits, employment, income sources, residence for income
or other tax purposes, age, marital status, residence of parents, spouse, and
children, if any, leaseholds, situs of personal and real property, existence of
any other residences and the amount of time spent at each residence, and motor
vehicle registration.
<P>(c)  The residence given for voting purposes shall be the same as the
residence given for motor vehicle registration and for state income tax
purposes.
<P>(d)  A person shall not be considered to have gained a residence in this
state, or in any county or municipality in this state, while retaining a home
or domicile elsewhere.
<P>(e)  If a person moves to any other state with the intention of making it
a permanent residence, that person shall be considered to have lost Colorado
residence after thirty days' absence from this state unless the person has
evidenced an intent to retain a residence in this state by a self-affirmation
executed pursuant to section 1-8-115.
<P>(f)  If a person moves from one county or precinct in this state to
another with the intention of making the new county or precinct a permanent
residence, after thirty days the person shall be considered to have lost
residence in the county or precinct from which the person moved.

<P>II.   Establishing Residence.
<P>III.   Loss of Residence.
<P>II.  ESTABLISHING RESIDENCE.
<P>Test of residency after elector moves from precinct. The following inquiry
is required to be undertaken if an elector has moved outside the boundaries of
his voting precinct and wishes to retain his right to vote there:  (1)  Had the
party established his principal or primary home or place of abode within the
election precinct?  and (2)  was the individual's departure taken or does his
absence continue with a present intention of returning to the precinct in the
future?  Gordon v. Blackburn, 618 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1980).
<P>Intent to keep legal residency central factor. Once a person's legal
residence has been established, his intent to keep it becomes the central
factor in determining whether it continues.  Gordon v. Blackburn, 618 P.2d 668
(Colo. 1980).
<P>But residence is not acquired by, etc.
<P>The mere intention to return to a former abode at some more or less
indefinite time, with no other indicia of a home or domicile, may not fulfill
the usual requirements of legal residence for voting purposes.  Gordon v.
Blackburn, 618 P.2d 668 (Colo. 1980).
<P>III.  LOSS OF RESIDENCE.
<P>One does not lose voting rights by reason of departure or absence from
primary home, once it has been established.  Gordon v. Blackburn, 618 P.2d 668
(Colo. 1980).

1-10-104.  Imperfect returns -  corrections. (1)  If a county board of
canvassers or the secretary of state finds that the method of making or
certifying returns from any precinct, county, or district does not strictly
conform to the requirements of law, the returns shall nevertheless be surveyed
if they are sufficiently explicit in showing how many votes were cast for each
candidate or ballot issue.
<P>(2)  If the county board of canvassers or the secretary of state finds
that during the survey of returns any statement furnished to them has omitted
certain matters which should have been included or that clerical mistakes have
been made, they shall send the returns to the appropriate county clerk and
recorder for correction.  The county clerk and recorder, after consultation
with the election judges, shall make any correction required by the facts of
the case but shall not change or alter any decision made by them prior to the
corrections.  The election judges shall submit to the canvassers any
documentation required for verification of the corrections and, at some
convenient time, shall come to the office of the county clerk and recorder to
initial any change previously authorized orally. A county board of canvassers
may adjourn from day to day for the purpose of obtaining and receiving
corrections but shall not delay the surveying past the day provided by law for
its completion.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-5-602.</H1>
1-5-602.  Requirements for voting machines. (1)  No voting machine shall
be purchased, leased, or used unless it fulfills the following requirements:
<P>(a)  It provides for voting in secrecy;
<P>(b)  It is closed during the progress of the voting so that no person can
see or know the number of votes registered for any candidate or for whom an
elector has voted;
<P>(c)  It is capable of containing on its face the form of ballot made up
and arranged substantially in the manner prescribed by this article;
<P>(d)  It allows a ballot to contain the names of candidates of at least
seven political parties or organizations;
<P>(e)  It enables each elector to vote a ticket selected in part from the
candidates of one party, and in part from the candidates of any other party,
and in part from an unaffiliated nomination, and in part from persons not in
nomination by any party or upon any unaffiliated ticket;
<P>(f)  It prevents the elector from voting for a candidate or on a ballot
issue or question for whom or on which the elector is not lawfully entitled to
vote;
<P>(g)  It enables each elector to vote for all candidates for whom the
elector is entitled to vote and prevents each elector from voting for any
candidate for any office more than once unless the elector is lawfully entitled
to cast more than one vote for that office and, in that event, permits the
elector to cast only as many votes for that office as the elector is by law
entitled to cast, and no more;
<P>(h)  It is provided with at least twenty pairs of "yes" and "no" counters
for voting on ballot issues;
<P>(i)  It enables an elector to write in the name of or otherwise vote for

<P>(k)  It will correctly register by means of exact mechanical counters
every vote cast for candidates or for ballot issues or questions appearing on
the ballot;
<P>(l)  It is provided with locks, the keys of which cannot be
interchangeably used and by the locking of which any movement of the operating
mechanism can be prevented, so that the machine cannot be tampered with or
manipulated for any fraudulent purpose;
<P>(m)  It has a counter on each machine which will show during the election
the total number of electors who have operated the machine at that election;
and
<P>(n)  It has a protective counter or other device, the register of which
cannot be reset, to record the cumulative total number of movements of the
operating mechanism.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-41-101.</H1>
1-41-101.  Legislative declaration. The general assembly hereby finds,
determines, and declares that section 20 of article X of the state constitution
requires that a ballot issue election be held on the first Tuesday in November
of odd-numbered years; that the provisions of section 20 (2) and 20 (3) of said
article X are unclear as to what issues can be submitted to a vote in the
odd-year election; that section 20 of article X did not amend preexisting
provisions of the state constitution on the initiative, the referendum, and the
submission of constitutional amendments by the general assembly, and repeal or
amendment of such provisions by implication is not presumed; that this
legislation implements section 20 of article X of the state constitution, which
article is entitled "Revenue" and concerns exclusively government revenue
raising and appropriations; that section 20 of article X requires public votes
on additional government taxes, spending, or debt; that the language of
section 20 of article X evinces the public's desire to have more opportunity to
vote on government tax, spending, and debt proposals; that a construction of
section 20 of article X that limits local government electors' opportunities to
vote on tax, spending, debt, or other proposals would be inconsistent with the
ballot title of and the voters' intention in adopting said amendment; that
state and local election officials need guidance as to how to administer the
November 1993 election; and that, in view of the issues set out in this
section, the general assembly should exercise its legislative power to resolve
the ambiguities in section 20 of article X in a manner consistent with its
terms.

<P>Board had the authority to set a title, ballot title and submission
clause, and summary for the proposed constitutional amendment at issue, but the
question of the board's jurisdiction to set titles for a ballot issue in an
odd-numbered year was premature, as the secretary of state, not the board, has
the authority to place measures on the ballot. Matter of Election Reform
Amendment, 852 P.2d 28 (Colo. 1993) (decided under law in effect prior to 1993
amendment and relocation).
