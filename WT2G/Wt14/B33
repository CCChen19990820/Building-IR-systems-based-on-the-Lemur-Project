<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-2-406.</H1>
2-2-406.  Contempt of either house. (1)  The senate and the house of
representatives may each punish by imprisonment not extending beyond the same
session of the general assembly, as and for a contempt, disorderly conduct of
its members, officers, employees, or others committed in the immediate view of
the senate or the house of representatives and tending to interrupt its
proceedings.  Imprisonment for contempt shall be effected by a warrant in the
name of the people of the state, signed by the presiding officer of the house
in which the contempt occurred, directed to the chief security officer of such
house or the state police and ordering the apprehension of the contemnor and
the delivery of him to the sheriff of the county in which the alleged contempt
occurred for detention by said sheriff in accordance with such warrant, subject
to such bail as may be set by the district court of the county in which the
alleged contempt occurred. A finding of contempt and imprisonment therefor
shall not constitute a bar to any other proceeding, civil or criminal, for the
same act.
<P>(2)  Notice of the proposed contempt citation shall be published in a
resolution of the house in which the contempt occurred approved first by a
majority of a committee and then of the house itself. If the contempt is
committed before the house itself rather than a committee thereof, a resolution
of the house itself shall be sufficient.  Persons actually named in the
resolution shall be either personally served or otherwise be given notice in
the same manner as is provided by law and the Colorado rules of civil procedure
for acquisition of jurisdiction over the person in civil actions.  The notice
shall include:
<P>(a)  A statement of the terms or substance of the offense which caused the
citation to be issued;
<P>(b)  A statement of the time and place of the hearing before the committee
which first passed the contempt resolution or before the house in which the
contempt occurred, as the case may be.  The person to be cited shall be
required to show cause why he should not be found in contempt.  The time and
place for hearing shall allow reasonable time to give the person to be cited
notice of the charges against him and to prepare an appropriate defense
concerning them.
<P>(3)  The contempt hearing shall give the person to be cited an opportunity
for an oral presentation before the committee or before the house in which the
contempt occurred, whichever is holding the hearing, for submission of written
arguments, and for the right to counsel at the hearing.
<P>(4)  A person to be cited shall be found in contempt and shall be punished
therefor only after a majority of the committee which initiated the contempt
proceeding finds, after notice and a hearing which satisfies the provisions of
subsections (2) and (3) of this section, that the person cited has been proven
beyond a reasonable doubt to have committed a contempt as defined in this
section.  The committee shall state in a report to the full house the reasons
for its finding.  If the full house affirms by a majority vote the finding of
the committee, the cited person shall be held in contempt.
<P>(5)  If the contempt citation is initiated by the house itself because of
a contempt committed before the house, the person to be cited shall be punished
for contempt if the house itself finds, by a majority vote, after notice and a
hearing which satisfies the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this
section, that the person cited has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to
have committed a contempt as defined in this section.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-2-404.</H1>
2-2-404.  Legislative rules and regulations. (1)  The senate and the house
of representatives shall each have the power to adopt rules or joint rules, or
both, for the orderly conduct of their affairs and to preserve and protect the
health, safety, and welfare of their members, officers, and employees in the
performance of their official duties, as well as that of the general public in
connection therewith, and to preserve and protect property and records under
the jurisdiction of the general assembly or either house thereof, consistent
with public convenience, the public's rights of freedom of expression and to
peaceably assemble and petition government, and the established democratic
concepts of the openness of the legislative process.
<P>(1.5)  Smoking in the state capitol and other legislative buildings shall
be governed by section 25-14-103.7, C.R.S.; except that the senate and the
house of representatives each has the exclusive authority to adopt rules or
joint rules, or both, governing the control or limitation of smoking in their
respective chambers, antechambers, committee rooms, and office space assigned
to and occupied by legislators.
<P>(2)  In lieu of or in addition to the adoption of such rules, the senate
and the house of representatives may each, by rule, authorize its presiding
officer to promulgate regulations for any or all such purposes.
<P>(3)  Rules or regulations may be adopted with respect to the following
matters, among others, without limitation by reason of such specification:
<P>(a)  Regulating admission to the legislative chambers, galleries, lobbies,
offices, and other areas of the buildings wherein they are located which
provide access thereto;
<P>(b)  Limiting the size of groups of persons permitted within such areas,
for reasons of health and safety and in case of fire or other emergency;
<P>(c)  Prohibiting or restricting the bringing of signs, banners, placards,
or other display materials into any such areas, or possessing them therein,
without proper authorization;
<P>(d)  Prohibiting or restricting the bringing of radio or television
equipment, recording equipment, sound-making or amplifying equipment, and
photographic equipment into any such areas, or possessing them therein, without
proper authorization;
<P>(e)  Prohibiting or restricting the bringing of packages, bags, baggage,
or briefcases into any such areas, or possessing them therein, without proper
authorization;
<P>(f)  Establishing rules of conduct for visitors to the galleries;
<P>(g)  Authorizing the clearing of the public from the chambers, lobbies,
and galleries or from any room in which a public legislative hearing or meeting
is being conducted in the event of any disturbance therein which disrupts
legislative proceedings or endangers any member, officer, or employee of the
general assembly or the general public, or where reasonable grounds exist for
believing that such a disturbance or danger may occur; except that duly
accredited representatives of the news media not participating in any such
disturbance shall be permitted to remain therein.  The closing of such areas to
the public shall continue only so long as necessary to avoid disruption of the
legislative proceedings or to preserve and protect the safety of the members,
officers, or employees of the general assembly or the general public;
<P>(h)  Authorizing the construction of safety barriers and other protective
measures for the galleries and other areas under the jurisdiction of the
general assembly and the acquisition of security equipment, all within the
funds made available therefor;
<P>(i)  Protecting the records and property of the general assembly from
unlawful damage or destruction;
<P>(j)  Any and all other matters which may be necessary or appropriate to
the orderly conduct of the affairs of the general assembly and the protection
of the health, safety, and welfare of the members, officers, and employees of
the general assembly and the general public in connection therewith.
<P>(4)  In lieu of or in addition to the adoption of separate rules, the
senate and the house of representatives may adopt joint rules applicable to
both houses.
<P>(5)  In lieu of or in addition to the promulgation of separate
regulations, the senate and the house of representatives may promulgate joint
regulations applicable to both houses.
<P>(6)  All such rules of the senate and the house of representatives or
either house and regulations of the senate and the house of representatives
shall be filed in the offices of the clerks thereof, and a copy of such rules
and regulations shall be made available to any person upon request, without
charge.
<P>(7)  Such rules and regulations shall have the force and effect of law.
Any person who willfully violates any such rule or regulation is guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not
more than one hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not
more than thirty days, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-2-316.</H1>
2-2-316.  Legislative declaration. Considering the greatly improved
highways and airways of this state which permit greater mobility with less cost
in money and time, considering the increasing length of legislative sessions,
the increasing complexity and importance of the problems presented, and the
benefits to be derived from frequent contact between legislator and
constituents, and considering the desirability of preserving the concept of
part-time citizen-legislators and, therefore, the need to allow them a
reasonable opportunity to attend to their own personal, family, and business
affairs even during sessions of the general assembly, it is hereby declared to
be necessary, within the meaning of the state constitution and in the best
interests of the general assembly and the state of Colorado, that members of
the senate and house of representatives travel to their homes and back to the
capitol during sessions of the general assembly when the house to which they
belong is in adjournment for periods not exceeding seventy-two hours.

<P>No provision in the constitution prevents lodging from being considered by
the general assembly in determining what the compensation of each member shall
include.  In re Interrogatories by Governor, 163 Colo. 113, 429 P.2d 304
(1967).
<P>Therefore, it is, within the province of the general assembly to
compensate its members for expenses incurred for lodging.  In re
Interrogatories by Governor, 163 Colo. 113, 429 P.2d 304 (1967).
<P>But the constitution requires that expenses be actually incurred in order
to be compensible.  In re Interrogatories by Governor, 163 Colo. 113, 429 P.2d
304 (1967).
<P>And since the words "per day of actual occupancy" precede the word
"lodging", we must construe the act to limit "lodging" to charges for occupancy
of living quarters.  In re Interrogatories by Governor, 163 Colo. 113, 429 P.2d
304 (1967).
<P>And the section authorizing travel expenses allows members of the general
assembly to travel to their homes and back to Denver as often as once a week
during adjournments for periods not exceeding 72 hours.  In re Interrogatories
by Governor, 163 Colo. 113, 429 P.2d 304 (1967).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-2-318.</H1>
2-2-318.  Members to be reimbursed for expenses. Each member of the
general assembly shall be reimbursed for expenses actually incurred pursuant to
sections 2-2-316 and 2-2-317.  In auditing any mileage claim of members of the
general assembly, the controller is authorized to accept without further
substantiating evidence the expense voucher duly signed by the member if the
mileage in such claim does not exceed the authorized rate at which employees of
the executive branch are reimbursed.  In addition, he may accept without such
further evidence the member's certification as to the number of days of actual
attendance under section 2-2-317 (1) or, in lieu thereof, the member's
certification as to the number of days of actual occupancy under section
2-2-317 (2).

<P>The general assembly has the right and the power to declare what
constitutes necessary traveling expenses for its members.  In re
Interrogatories by Governor, 163 Colo. 113, 429 P.2d 304 (1967).
<P>There is a presumption that legislators will follow their oath of office
and act only in good faith and will therefore seek payment only for such proper
amounts as have actually been incurred and will thus abide by the
constitutional limitations.  In re Interrogatories by Governor, 163 Colo. 113,
429 P.2d 304 (1967).
<P>And the auditing requirement of the constitution can be carried out by
auditing the expense statements as filed.  In re Interrogatories by Governor,
163 Colo. 113, 429 P.2d 304 (1967).
<P>"Holdover" senators may receive the allowances provided for in this
section for traveling to their homes and back to Denver as often as once a week
during sessions of such general assembly when the senate is in adjournment for
periods not exceeding 72 hours.  In re Interrogatories by Colo. State Senate,
168 Colo. 558, 452 P.2d 391 (1969).

the office of legislative legal services or the director's designee.  The title
board, by majority vote, shall proceed to designate and fix a proper fair title
for each proposed law or constitutional amendment, together with a submission
clause, at public meetings to be held at 2 p.m. on the first and third
Wednesdays of each month in which a draft or a motion for reconsideration has
been submitted to the secretary of state. To be considered at such meeting, a
draft shall be submitted to the secretary of state no later than 3 p.m. on the
twelfth day before the meeting at which the draft is to be considered by the
title board.  The first meeting of the title board shall be held no sooner than
the first Wednesday in December after an election, and the last meeting shall
be held no later than the third Wednesday in May in the year in which the
measure is to be voted on.
<P>(2)  (Deleted by amendment, L. 95, p. 432,  4, effective May 8, 1995.)
<P>(3) (a)  The title board shall prepare a clear, concise summary of the
proposed law or constitutional amendment.  The summary shall be true and
impartial and shall not be an argument, nor likely to create prejudice, either
for or against the measure.  The title board may request assistance in the
preparation of the summary from the legislative council and, if, in the opinion
of the title board, the proposed law or constitutional amendment will have a
fiscal impact on the state or any of its political subdivisions, shall request
assistance in such matter from the office of state planning and budgeting or
the department of local affairs.  When the title board requests fiscal impact
information from the office of state planning and budgeting or the department
of local affairs, the fiscal impact information shall be filed with the
secretary of state by 12 noon on the Friday before the meeting of the title
board at which the draft is to be considered.  The legislative council, the
office of state planning and budgeting, and the department of local affairs
shall furnish any assistance requested, and the summary shall include an
estimate of any such fiscal impact, together with an explanation thereof.
<P>(b)  In setting a title, the title board shall consider the public
confusion that might be caused by misleading titles and shall, whenever
practicable, avoid titles for which the general understanding of the effect of
a "yes" or "no" vote will be unclear.  The title for the proposed law or
constitutional amendment, which shall correctly and fairly express the true
intent and meaning thereof, together with the ballot title, submission clause,
and summary, shall be completed within two weeks after the first meeting of the
title board.  Immediately upon completion, the secretary of state shall deliver
the same with the original to the parties presenting it, keeping the copy with
a record of the action taken thereon.  Ballot titles shall be brief, shall not
conflict with those selected for any petition previously filed for the same
election, and shall be in the form of a question which may be answered "yes"
(to vote in favor of the proposed law or constitutional amendment) or "no" (to
vote against the proposed law or constitutional amendment) and which shall
unambiguously state the principle of the provision sought to be added, amended,
or repealed.

attorney general, who may institute a criminal prosecution.  If a circulator is
found to have violated any provision of this article or is otherwise shown to

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-40-116.</H1>
1-40-116.  Verification - ballot issues - random sampling. (1)  For ballot
issues, each section of a petition to which there is attached an affidavit of
the registered elector who circulated the petition that each signature thereon
is the signature of the person whose name it purports to be and that to the
best of the knowledge and belief of the affiant each of the persons signing the
petition was at the time of signing a registered elector shall be prima facie
evidence that the signatures are genuine and true, that the petitions were
circulated in accordance with the provisions of this article, and that the form
of the petition is in accordance with this article.
<P>(2)  Upon submission of the petition, the secretary of state shall examine
each name and signature on the petition.  The petition shall not be available
to the public for a period of no more than thirty calendar days for the
examination.  The secretary shall assure that the information required by
sections 1-40-110 and 1-40-111 is complete, that the information on each
signature line was written by the person making the signature, and that no
signatures have been added to any sections of the petition after the affidavit
required by section 1-40-111 (2) has been executed.
<P>(3)  No signature shall be counted unless the signer is a registered
elector and eligible to vote on the measure.  A person shall be deemed a
registered elector if the person's name and address appear on the master voting
list kept by the secretary of state at the time of signing the section of the
petition.  In addition, the secretary of state shall not count the signature of
any person whose information is not complete or was not completed by the
elector or a person qualified to assist the elector.  The secretary of state
may adopt rules consistent with this subsection (3) for the examination and
verification of signatures.
<P>(4)  The secretary of state shall verify the signatures on the petition by
use of random sampling.  The random sample of signatures to be verified shall
be drawn so that every signature filed with the secretary of state shall be
given an equal opportunity to be included in the sample.  The secretary of
state is authorized to engage in rule-making to establish the appropriate
methodology for conducting such random sample.  The random sampling shall
include an examination of no less than five percent of the signatures, but in
no event less than four thousand signatures.  If the random sample verification
establishes that the number of valid signatures is ninety percent or less of
the number of registered eligible electors needed to find the petition
sufficient, the petition shall be deemed to be not sufficient.  If the random
sample verification establishes that the number of valid signatures totals one
hundred ten percent or more of the number of required signatures of registered
eligible electors, the petition shall be deemed sufficient.  If the random
sampling shows the number of valid signatures to be more than ninety percent
but less than one hundred ten percent of the number of signatures of registered
eligible electors needed to declare the petition sufficient, the secretary of
state shall order the examination and verification of each signature filed.

<P>VII.  PROTESTS BEFORE SECRETARY OF STATE.
<P>Amended protest was properly dismissed by the secretary of state pursuant
to former version of this section, despite the secretary's incorrect
notification to the protestor that a protest could be filed by a specified
date.  The secretary of state lacked the authority to enlarge the protest
period provided in former version of this section and protestor cannot state
claim for relief under theory of estoppel against a state entity on the basis
of an unauthorized action or promise.  Montero v. Meyer, 795 P.2d 242 (Colo.
1990) (decided under law in effect prior to 1989 amendment).

<P>IV.  Newspapers of General Circulation.
<P>I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Cross reference.  As to title and submission clause, rehearing and appeal,
see  1-40-101.
<P>Am. Jur.2d. See 42 Am. Jur.2d, Initiative and Referendum,   40,42-44.
<P>C.J.S. See 82 C.J.S., Statutes,  135.
<P>Burden for invalidating an amendment because of an alleged misleading
ballot title, after adoption by the people in a general election, is heavy
since the general assembly has provided procedures for challenging a ballot
title prior to elections.  Unless the challengers to the amendment can prove
that so many voters were actually misled by the title that the result of the
election might have been different, the challenge will fail.  City of Glendale
v. Buchanan, 195 Colo. 267, 578 P.2d 221 (1978).
<P>Applied in In re Interrogatories Propounded by Senate Concerning House
Bill 1078, 189 Colo. 1, 536 P.2d 308 (1975).
<P>II.  HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
<P>This section is unconstitutional in that it impairs and limits the
initiative right reserved to the people by the Colorado Constitution. Colorado
Project-Common Cause v. Anderson, 177 Colo. 402, 495 P.2d 218 (1972).
<P>Because the general assembly may not impose restrictions which limit in
any way the right of the people to initiate proposed laws and amendments except
as those limitations are provided in 1 of art. V, Colo. Const. Colorado
Project-Common Cause v. Anderson, 177 Colo. 402, 495 P.2d 218 (1972).
<P>Because in determining severability the court looks to legislative intent.
Colorado Project-Common Cause v. Anderson, 177 Colo. 402, 495 P.2d 218 (1972).
<P>Also section 1-40-102(1) is so intertwined with section 1-40-102(2) that
the two subsections are inseverable.  Colorado Project-Common Cause v.
Anderson, 177 Colo. 402, 495 P.2d 218 (1972).
<P>And it is clear that in requiring publication in section 1-40-102(1), the
general assembly was concerned that payment for it should come not from the
state but from the sponsors as stated in section 1-40-102(2).  Colorado
Project-Common Cause v. Anderson, 177 Colo. 402, 495 P.2d 218 (1972).
<P>Publications of legal advertising under art. XXIII, Colo. Const., are at
the expense of the state. Colorado Project-Common Cause v. Anderson, 177 Colo.
402, 495 P.2d 218 (1972).
<P>But it was not the legislative intent to require publication of proposed
initiated laws and amendment in addition to that required by art. XXIII, Colo.
Const.  Colorado Project-Common Cause v. Anderson, 177 Colo. 402, 495 P.2d 218
(1972).
<P>So if it is incumbent upon the state to pay the publication costs, the
subsection requiring the publication is inseverable from the invalid subsection
requiring the sponsors to bear the expense of publication, and is also invalid.
Colorado Project-Common Cause v. Anderson, 177 Colo. 402, 495 P.2d 218 (1972).
<P>III.  PUBLICATION.
<P>The purpose of the provision that the full text of a proposed amendment be
published in a newspaper of general circulation is to acquaint the voters,
before they enter the polling booths, as to the contents of measures submitted.
Cook v. Baker, 121 Colo. 187, 214 P.2d 787 (1950).
<P>And to require that the text of an amendment or a substantial portion
thereof be again printed on the official ballot, is contrary to all precedent,
could serve no useful purpose, and was not within the contemplation of the
general assembly.  Cook v. Baker, 121 Colo. 187, 214 P.2d 787 (1950).
<P>The timely publication of a constitutional amendment in sixty-two counties
of the state, with only five days delay in the sixty-third county and that
without fault of either the proponents of the amendment or of the secretary of
state - is a substantial compliance with the requirement of the statute.
Yenter v. Baker, 126 Colo. 232, 248 P.2d 311 (1952).
<P>And where publication was in compliance with the provisions of the
section, the supreme court makes no determination as to the validity of the
statutory provisions requiring such publication.  Yenter v. Baker, 126 Colo.
232, 248 P.2d 311 (1952).
<P>IV.  NEWSPAPERS OF GENERAL CIRCULATION.
<P>The phrase "newspaper of general circulation in each county", means that
an amendment must be published in one newspaper in each county in the state,
which is published, and has a general circulation, in that county.  In re House
Resolution No. 10, 50 Colo. 71, 114 P.293 (1911) (decided under former law).
<P>The phrase "general circulation" is descriptive of the character of the
newspaper.  In re House Resolution No. 10, 50 Colo. 71, 114 P.293 (1911)
(decided under former law).
<P>And it must be one of general, not special, or limited circulation.  In re
House Resolution No. 10, 50 Colo. 71, 114 P.293 (1911) (decided under former
law).
<P>The newspaper may not be a mere advertising sheet, or a newspaper
restricted or devoted to some particular trade or calling, or branch of
industry.  In re House Resolution No. 10, 50 Colo. 71, 114 P.293 (1911)
(decided under former law).

1-40-123.  Counting of votes - effective date - conflicting provisions.
The votes on all measures submitted to the people shall be counted and properly
entered after the votes for candidates for office cast at the same election are
counted and shall be counted, canvassed, and returned and the result determined
and certified in the manner provided by law concerning other elections.  The
secretary of state who has certified the election shall, without delay, make
and transmit to the governor a certificate of election.  The measure shall take
effect from and after the date of the official declaration of the vote by
proclamation of the governor, but not later than thirty days after the votes
have been canvassed, as provided in section 1 of article V of the state
constitution. A majority of the votes cast thereon shall adopt any measure
submitted, and, in case of adoption of conflicting provisions, the one that
receives the greatest number of affirmative votes shall prevail in all
particulars as to which there is a conflict.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-40-105.</H1>
1-40-105.  Filing procedure - review and comment - amendments - filing
with secretary of state. (1)  The original typewritten draft of every
initiative petition for a proposed law or amendment to the state constitution
to be enacted by the people, before it is signed by any elector, shall be
submitted by the proponents of the petition to the directors of the legislative
council and the office of legislative legal services for review and comment.
Proponents are encouraged to write such drafts in plain, nontechnical language
and in a clear and coherent manner using words with common and everyday meaning
which are understandable to the average reader.  Upon request, any agency in
the executive department shall assist in reviewing and preparing comments on
the petition.  No later than  two weeks after the date of submission of the
original draft, unless it is withdrawn by the proponents, the directors of the
legislative council and the office of legislative legal services, or their
designees, shall render their comments to the proponents of the petition
concerning the format or contents of the petition at a meeting open to the
public.  Where appropriate, such comments shall also contain suggested
editorial changes to promote compliance with the plain language provisions of
this section.  Except with the permission of the proponents, the comments shall
not be disclosed to any person other than the proponents prior to the public
meeting with the proponents of the petition.
<P>(2)  After the public meeting but before submission to the secretary of
state for title setting, the proponents may amend the petition in response to
some or all of the comments of the directors of the legislative council and the
office of legislative legal services, or their designees.  If any substantial
amendment is made to the petition, other than an amendment in direct response
to the comments of the directors of the legislative council and the office of
legislative legal services, the amended petition shall be resubmitted to the
directors for comment in accordance with subsection (1) of this section prior
to submittal to the secretary of state as provided in subsection (4) of this
section.  If the directors have no additional comments concerning the amended
petition, they may so notify the proponents in writing, and, in such case, a
hearing on the amended petition pursuant to subsection (1) of this section is
not required.
<P>(3)  To the extent possible, drafts shall be worded with simplicity and
clarity and so that the effect of the measure will not be misleading or likely
to cause confusion among voters.  The draft shall not present the issue to be
decided in such manner that a vote for the measure would be a vote against the
proposition or viewpoint that the voter believes that he or she is casting a
vote for or, conversely, that a vote against the measure would be a vote for a
proposition or viewpoint that the voter is against.
<P>(4)  After the conference provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this
section, a copy of the original typewritten draft submitted to the directors of
the legislative council and the office of legislative legal services, a copy of
the amended draft with changes highlighted or otherwise indicated, if any
amendments were made following the last conference conducted pursuant to
subsections (1) and (2) of this section, and an original final draft which
gives the final language for printing shall be submitted to the secretary of
state without any title, submission clause, summary, or ballot title providing
the designation by which the voters shall express their choice for or against
the proposed law or constitutional amendment.

<P>B.   Submission Clause.
<P>D.   Brevity Required.
<P>VI.   Hearing by Supreme Court.
<P>I.  GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Annotator's note. For additional cases concerning the initiative and
referendum power, see the annotations under section 1 of article V of the state
constitution.
<P>The purpose of the initiative and referendum embodied in the constitution,
etc.
<P>In accord with original.  See Matter of Title, Ballot Title &amp  S. Clause,
872 P.2d 689 (Colo. 1994).
<P>The purpose of the title setting process is to ensure that both the
persons reviewing an initiative petition and the voters are fairly and
succinctly advised of the import of the proposed law.  In re Proposed
Initiative on Education Tax Refund, 823 P.2d 1353 (Colo. 1991);  Matter of
Title, Ballot Title &amp  S. Clause, 872 P.2d 698 (Colo. 1994).
<P>II.  PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO ENACT OWN LEGISLATION.
<P>People have reserved to themselves right of initiative in  1 of art. V,
Colo. Const.  In re Second Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141,
613 P.2d 867 (1980).
<P>II.5.  REVIEW AND COMMENT BY LEGISLATIVE AGENCIES.
<P>Any proposed initiative must be submitted to the legislative research
office and the legislative drafting office before it is submitted to the
initiative title setting board regardless of whether it is substantially
similar to a previously proposed initiative.  Without such submittal, the board
lacks jurisdiction to set title.  Matter of Milkin, 797 P.2d 1283 (Colo. 1990).
<P>IV.  STATUTORY BOARD.
<P>Board was created by statute to assist the people in the implementation of
their right to initiate laws.  In re Proposed Initiative Concerning Drinking
Age, 691 P.2d 1127 (Colo. 1984).
<P>Impartiality required in summary. The summary prepared by the board must
be true and impartial statement of intent of proposed law and must not be an
argument, nor likely to create prejudice either for or against the measure.  In
re Branch Banking Initiative, 200 Colo. 85, 612 P.2d 96 (1980);  In re Second
Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141, 613 P.2d 867 (1980); Spelts
v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>And summary is to include estimate of any fiscal impact upon the state or
any of its political subdivisions with an explanation thereof.  In re Second
Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141, 613 P.2d 867 (1980); Spelts
v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>Unless fiscal impact cannot be determined. Where the fiscal impact upon
local government could not be determined because of the variables involved, a
definitive statement concerning fiscal impact is not required.  Spelts v.
Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>The board may properly exercise its judgment in concluding that the fiscal
impact upon local government cannot be determined because of the variables
involved.  In re Title Pertaining to Sale of Table Wine in Grocery Stores, 646
P.2d 916 (Colo. 1982).
<P>The burden of proving procedural noncompliance rests with the petitioner,
not with the proponents of the initiative.  A presumption exists that the
secretary of state properly determined the sufficiency of the filing of a
petition to initiate a measure.  Because the petitioner has not shown any
defect in the proceeding that would destroy the board's jurisdiction in the
matter, the petitioner's jurisdictional challenge is rejected.  In re Petition
on Campaign and Political Finance, 877 P.2d 311 (Colo. 1994).
<P>Summary need not mention the effect of the amendment on an existing
statute addressing the same or a similar subject as the proposed amendment.  In
re Mineral Prod. Tax Initiative, 644 P.2d 20 (Colo. 1982).
<P>The board is not required to provide lengthy explanations of every portion
of a proposed constitutional amendment as overly detailed titles and submission
clauses could by their very length confuse voters.  In re Proposed Initiative
Concerning State Personnel Systems, 691 P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1984).
<P>Mere ambiguity of a summary, if not clearly misleading, does not require
disapproval by court. In re Proposed Initiative Concerning State Personnel
System, 691 P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1984).
<P>Board is not required to give opinion regarding ambiguity of a proposed
initiative, nor is it necessary for the board to be concerned with legal issues
which the proposed initiative may create.  Matter of Title, Ballot Title, Etc.,
797 P.2d 1275 (Colo. 1990).
<P>Board may be challenged when misleading summary of amendment prejudicial.
A misleading summary of the fiscal impact of a proposed amendment is likely to
create an unfair prejudice against the measure and is a sufficient basis, under
this section, for challenging the board's action.  In re An Initiated
Constitutional Amendment, 199 Colo. 409, 609 P.2d 631 (1980).
<P>Request for agency assistance at board's discretion. The decision of
whether and from which of the two state agencies to request information is
within the discretion of the board. Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo.
1982).
<P>Technical correction of proposed initiative permitted. Allowing a
technical correction of the proposed initiative to conform with the intent of
the proponents does not frustrate the purpose of the statute.  Spelts v.
Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>Purpose of statutory time table for meetings of initiative title setting
review board is to assure that the titles, submission clause, and summary of an
initiated measure are considered promptly by the board well in advance of the
date by which the signed petitions must be filed with the secretary of state.
In re Second Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141, 613 P.2d 867
(1980).
<P>Section not frustrated by next-day continuance of statutory date for last
meeting. A continuance to the next day following the statutory date for the
last meeting in order to comply fully with other statutory requirements does
not frustrate the purpose of this section.  In re Second Initiated
Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141, 613 P.2d 867 (1980).
<P>V.  BALLOT TITLE AND SUBMISSION CLAUSE.
<P>A.  Sufficiency of Ballot Title.
<P>Explanation of effect on existing law permitted. The board is not
precluded from adopting language which explains to the signers of a petition
and the voter how the initiative fits in the context of existing law, even
though the specific language is not found in the text of the proposed statute.
In re Title Pertaining to Sale of Table Wine in Grocery Stores, 646 P.2d 916
(Colo. 1982).
<P>Although every possible effect need not be included. There is not
requirement that every possible effect be included within the title or the
ballot title and submission clause.  In re Title Pertaining to Sale of Table
Wine in Grocery Stores, 646 P.2d 916 (Colo. 1982); Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d
303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>Initiated measure's title, as set by review board, must be proper and fair
and must correctly and fairly express the true intent and meaning of the
proposed measure.  In re Second Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo.
141, 613 P.2d 867 (1980); In re Proposed Initiative on Parental Notification of
Abortions for Minors, 794 P.2d 238 (Colo. 1990).
<P>No clear case presented for the invalidation of titles fixed by the board
where the wording of the titles attributes a meaning to the text that is
reasonable, although nor free from all doubt, and relates to a feature of the
proposed law that is both peripheral to its central purpose and of limited
temporal relevance.  In re Proposed Initiative Concerning Drinking Age, 691
P.2d 1127 (Colo. 1984).
<P>A title and submission clause do not fairly and accurately reflect the
intent and purpose of an initiative if the voters are not informed that the
intent is to prevent the state courts from adopting a definition of obscenity
that is broader than under the U.S. Constitution.  In re Proposed Initiative on
"Obscenity," 877 P.2d 848 (Colo. 1994).
<P>Supreme Court should resolve all legitimate presumptions in favor of title
setting board when reviewing the board's procedure and choice of language.
Matter of Title, Ballot Title, Etc., 850 P.2d 144 (Colo. 1993) (decided under
former  1-40-101 prior to 1993 amendments).
<P>Ballot title found sufficient.  There is no requirement that ballot title
and submission clause identify any articles or sections which are amended.
Matter of Title, Ballot Title, Etc., 797 P.2d 1275 (Colo. 1990).
<P>Ballot title found insufficient and misleading. In re Tax Reform, 797 P.2d
1283 (Colo. 1990).
<P>B.  Submission Clause.
<P>"Catch phrases" are forbidden in ballot titles. Spelts v. Klausing, 649
P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>"Catch phrase" construed. A "catch phrase" consists of words which could
form the basis of a slogan for use by those who expect to carry out a campaign
for or against an initiated constitutional amendment.  Spelts v. Klausing, 649
P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>The board need not and cannot describe every feature of a proposed measure
in the titles and submission clause.  In re Proposed Initiative Concerning
State Personnel Systems, 691 P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1984).
<P>Failure of title, ballot title, and submission clause to include
definition of abortion which would impose a new legal standard which is likely
to be controversial made title, ballot title, and submission clause deficient
in that they did not fully inform signers of initiative petitions and voters
and did not fairly reflect the contents of the proposed initiative.  In re
Proposed Initiative on Parental Notification of Abortions for Minors, 794 P.2d
238 (Colo. 1990); In re Proposed Initiative Concerning "Automobile Insurance
Coverage", 877 P.2d 853 (Colo. 1994).
<P>D.  Brevity Required.
<P>Ballot title and submission clause of proposed initiative measure must be
brief. In re Second Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141, 613 P.2d
867 (1980).
<P>VI.  HEARING BY SUPREME COURT.
<P>Court's function limited. It is not the function of the supreme court to
rephrase the language of the summary and title in order to achieve the best
possible statement of the intent of the amendment.  In re Mineral Prod. Tax
Initiative, 644 P.2d 20 (Colo. 1982).
<P>Review limited to whether intent of initiative properly reflected. On
review, the supreme court can only consider whether the titles, summary, and
submission clause reflect the intent of the initiative, not whether they
reflect all possible problems that may arise in the future in applying the
language of the proposed initiative.  In re Title Pertaining to Sale of Table
Wine in Grocery Stores, 646 P.2d 916 (Colo. 1982).
<P>The supreme court can only consider whether the titles, submission clause,
and summary reflect the intent of the initiative, not whether they reflect all
possible problems that may arise in the future in applying the proposed
language.  Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>And interpretation of initiative not permitted. It is not the function of
the supreme court in the review proceeding, nor is it the board's function, to
determine the meaning of the language of the initiative:  A judicial
interpretation of the meaning of the initiative must await an adjudication in a
specific factual context.  Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982); In re
Proposed Initiative on Parental Notification of Abortions for Minors, 794 P.2d
238 (Colo. 1990).
<P>In a proceeding under this statute, etc.
<P>In accord with original.  See In re An Initiated Constitutional Amendment,
199 Colo. 409, 609 P.2d 631 (1980); In re Title Pertaining to Sale of Table
Wine in Grocery Stores, 646 P.2d 916 (Colo. 1982); Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d
303 (Colo. 1982); In re Proposed Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 682 P.2d
480 (Colo. 1984); In re Proposed Initiative Concerning State Personnel System,
691 P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1984); In re Proposed Initiative Concerning Drinking Age,
691 P.2d 1127 (Colo. 1984); In re Proposed Initiative on Parental Notification
of Abortions for Minors, 794 P.2d 238 (Colo. 1990).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-40-113.</H1>
1-40-113.  Form - representatives of signers. (1)  Each section of a
petition shall be printed on a form as prescribed by the secretary of state.
No petition shall be printed, published, or otherwise circulated unless the
form and the first printer's proof of the petition have been approved by the
secretary of state.  Each petition section shall designate by name and mailing
address two persons who shall represent the signers thereof in all matters
affecting the same.  The secretary of state shall assure that the petition
contains only the matters required by this article and contains no extraneous
material.  All sections of any petition shall be prenumbered serially, and the
circulation of any petition section described by this article other than
personally by a circulator is prohibited.  Any petition section that fails to
conform to the requirements of this article or is circulated in a manner other
than that permitted in this article shall be invalid.
<P>(2)  Any disassembly of a section of the petition which has the effect of
separating the affidavits from the signatures shall render that section of the
petition invalid and of no force and effect.
<P>(3)  Prior to the time of filing, the persons designated in the petition
to represent the signers shall bind the sections of the petition in convenient
volumes consisting of one hundred sections of the petition if one hundred or
more sections are available or, if less than one hundred sections are available
to make a volume, consisting of all sections that are available. Each volume
consisting of less than one hundred sections shall be marked on the first page
of the volume.  However, any volume that contains more or less than one hundred
sections, due only to the oversight of the designated representatives of the
signers or their staff, shall not result in a finding of insufficiency of
signatures therein.  Each section of each volume shall include the affidavits
required by section 1-40-111 (2), together with the sheets containing the
signatures accompanying the same.  These bound volumes shall be filed with the
secretary of state.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-40-121.</H1>
1-40-121.  Receiving money to circulate petitions - filing. (1)  The
proponents of the petition shall file with the official who receives filings
under the "Campaign Reform Act of 1974", article 45 of this title, for the
election the name, address, and county of voter registration of all circulators
who were paid to circulate any section of the petition, the amount paid per
signature, and the total amount paid to each circulator.  The filing shall be
made at the same time the petition is filed with the secretary of state.  Any
payment made to circulators is an expenditure under article 45 of this title.
<P>(2)  The proponents of the petition shall sign and file monthly reports
with the secretary of state, due ten days after the last day of each month in
which petitions are circulated on behalf of the proponents by paid circulators.
Monthly reports shall set forth the following:
<P>(a)  The names of the proponents;
<P>(b)  The name and the residential and business addresses of each of the
paid circulators;
<P>(c)  The name of the proposed ballot measure for  which petitions are
being circulated by paid circulators; and
<P>(d)  The amount of money paid and owed to each paid circulator for
petition circulation during the month in question.

effective May 4. L. 95:  (1) and IP(2) amended, p. 436,  15, effective May 8.
<P>Annotator's note. Since  1-40-121 is similar to  1-40-110 as it existed
prior to the 1993 amendment of title 1, article 40, which resulted in the
relocation of provisions, relevant cases construing that provision have been
included in the annotations to this section.
<P>Ban of "inducement" overly broad.  The language of this section is too
broad to survive strict scrutiny.  The ban of any "inducement" to petition
circulation sweeps far too broadly.  Urevich v. Woodward, 667 P.2d 760 (Colo.
1983) (decided under former law).
<P>Section construed to delete "inducement".  This section must be narrowed
to delete the word "inducement".  Urevich v. Woodward, 667 P.2d 760 (Colo.
1983) (decided under former law).
<P>Section unconstitutional.  This section violates the first and fourteenth
amendments to the U.S. constitution by imposing a direct and substantial
restriction on the right to political speech, employing unnecessarily broad
prohibitions.  Grant v. Meyer, 828 F.2d 1446 (10th Cir. 1987), aff'd, 486 U.S.
414, 108 S. Ct. 1886, 100 L. Ed.2d 425 (1988).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-40-118.</H1>
1-40-118.  Protest. (1)  A protest in writing, under oath, together with
three copies thereof, may be filed in the district court for the county in
which the petition has been filed by some registered elector, within thirty
days after the secretary of state issues a statement as to whether the petition
has a sufficient number of valid signatures, which statement shall be issued no
later than thirty calendar days after the petition has been filed.  If the
secretary of state fails to issue a statement within thirty calendar days, the
petition shall be deemed sufficient.  During the period a petition is being
examined by the secretary of state for sufficiency, the petition shall not be
available to the public; except that such period shall not exceed thirty
calendar days.
<P>(2)  If the secretary of state conducted a random sample of the petitions
and did not verify each signature, the protest shall specifically allege the
defects in the procedure used by the secretary of state in the verification of
the petition or the grounds for challenging individual signatures.  If the
secretary of state verified each name on the petition sections, the protest
shall set forth with particularity the grounds of the protest and the
signatures protested.  No signature may be challenged that is not identified in
the protest by section number, line number, name, and reason why the secretary
of state is in error.  If any party is protesting the finding of the secretary
of state regarding the registration of a signer, the protest shall be
accompanied by an affidavit of the elector or a copy of the election record of
the signer.
<P>(3)  (Deleted by amendment, L. 95, p. 436,  13, effective May 8, 1995.)
<P>(4)  The secretary of state shall furnish a requesting protestor with a
computer tape or microfiche listing of the names of all registered electors in
the state and shall charge a fee which shall be determined and collected
pursuant to section 24-21-104 (3), C.R.S., to cover the cost of furnishing the
listing.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-40-107.</H1>
1-40-107.  Rehearing - appeal - fees - signing. (1)  Any person presenting
an initiative petition or any registered elector who is not satisfied with the
titles, submission clause, and summary provided by the title board and who
claims that they are unfair or that they do not fairly express the true meaning
and intent of the proposed state law or constitutional amendment may file a
motion for a rehearing with the secretary of state within seven days after the
titles and summary are set.  The motion for rehearing shall be heard at the
next regularly scheduled meeting of the title board; except that, if the title
board is unable to complete action on all matters scheduled for that day,
consideration of any motion for rehearing may be continued to the next
available day, and except that, if the titles and summary protested were set at
the last meeting in May, the motion shall be heard within forty-eight hours
after the motion is filed.
<P>(2)  If any person who filed a motion for a rehearing pursuant to
subsection (1) of this section is overruled by the title board, then the
secretary of state shall furnish such person, upon request, a certified copy of
the petition with the titles, submission clause, and summary of the proposed
law or constitutional amendment, together with a certified copy of the motion
for rehearing and of the ruling thereon.  If filed with the clerk of the
supreme court within five days thereafter, the matter shall be docketed as a
cause there pending, which shall be placed at the head of the calendar and
disposed of summarily, either affirming the action of the title board or
reversing it, in which latter case the court shall remand it with instructions,
pointing out where the title board is in error.
<P>(3)  The secretary of state shall be allowed a fee which shall be
determined and collected pursuant to section 24-21-104 (3), C.R.S., for
certifying a record of any proceedings before the title board.  The clerk of
the supreme court shall receive one-half the ordinary docket fee for docketing
any such cause, all of which shall be paid by the parties desiring a review of
such proceedings.
<P>(4)  No petition for any initiative measure shall be circulated nor any
signature thereto have any force or effect which has been signed before the
titles, submission clause, and summary have been fixed and determined as
provided in section 1-40-106 and this section.
<P>(5)  In the event a motion for rehearing is filed in accordance with this
section, the period for filing a petition in accordance with section 1-40-108
shall not begin until a final decision concerning the motion is rendered by the
title board or the Colorado supreme court; except that under no circumstances
shall the period for filing a petition be extended beyond three months prior to
the election at which the petition is to be voted upon.
<P>(6)  The summary of any proposed initiated law or constitutional amendment
shall be included in the publication of measures by the secretary of state
pursuant to article XXIII of the state constitution.

<P>Annotator's note. For additional cases concerning the initiative and

constitution.
<P>Applied in Matter of Election Reform Amendment, 852 P.2d 28 (Colo. 1993)
(decided under law in effect prior to 1993 amendment and relocation).
<P>II.  PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO ENACT OWN LEGISLATION.
<P>People have reserved to themselves right of initiative in  1 of art. V,
Colo. Const.  In re Second Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141,
613 P.2d 867 (1980).
<P>II.5.  REVIEW AND COMMENT BY LEGISLATIVE AGENCIES.
<P>Any proposed initiative must be submitted to the legislative research
office and the legislative drafting office before it is submitted to the
initiative title setting board regardless of whether it is substantially
similar to a previously proposed initiative.  Without such submittal, the board
lacks jurisdiction to set title.  Matter of Milkin, 797 P.2d 1283 (Colo. 1990).
<P>IV.  STATUTORY BOARD.
<P>Board was created by statute to assist the people in the implementation of
their right to initiate laws.  In re Proposed Initiative Concerning Drinking
Age, 691 P.2d 1127 (Colo. 1984).
<P>Board is vested with considerable discretion in setting title, ballot
title and submission clause, and summary.  Matter of Title, Ballot Title &amp  S.
Clause, 875 P.2d 207 (Colo. 1994).
<P>Impartiality required in summary. The summary prepared by the board must
be true and impartial statement of intent of proposed law and must not be an
argument, nor likely to create prejudice either for or against the measure.  In
re Branch Banking Initiative, 200 Colo. 85, 612 P.2d 96 (1980);  In re Second
Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141, 613 P.2d 867 (1980); Spelts
v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>And summary is to include estimate of any fiscal impact upon the state or
any of its political subdivisions with an explanation thereof.  In re Second
Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141, 613 P.2d 867 (1980); Spelts
v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>Unless fiscal impact cannot be determined. Where the fiscal impact upon
local government could not be determined because of the variables involved, a
definitive statement concerning fiscal impact is not required.  Spelts v.
Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>The board may properly exercise its judgment in concluding that the fiscal
impact upon local government cannot be determined because of the variables
involved.  In re Title Pertaining to Sale of Table Wine in Grocery Stores, 646
P.2d 916 (Colo. 1982).
<P>If provisions of measure do not produce a separate and conflicting impact
and the aggregate impact is known, each provision of the proposed amendment
need not be addressed individually in the statement of fiscal impact.  Where
the board cannot determine the aggregate fiscal impact of a proposed measure,
but has adequate information to assess the impact of a particular provision,
the board should state with specificity which provision will have fiscal
impacts that are capable of being estimated and which are truly indeterminate.
In re Petition on Campaign and Political Finance, 877 P.2d 311 (Colo. 1994).
<P>Because the proposed amendment contains no definition of the term "strong
public trust doctrine", such a definition must await future judicial
construction and cannot appropriately be included in the title or submission
clause.  In re Proposed Initiative on Water Rights, 877 P.2d 321 (Colo. 1994).
<P>The title, submission clause, and summary must reflect the intent of the
initiative as drafted.  They need not reflect intentions of the proponents that
are not expressed in the measure itself.  In re Proposed Initiative on Water
Rights, 877 P.2d 321 (Colo. 1994).
<P>Although the texts of two initiatives are similar, the titles and
submission clauses set by the board accurately reflect an important distinction
between them.  Voters comparing the titles and submission clauses for the two
measures would be able to distinguish between the measures and would not be
misled into voting for or against either measure by reason of the words chosen
by the board.  In re Proposed Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 877 P.2d 329
(Colo. 1994).
<P>Summary need not mention the effect of the amendment on an existing
statute addressing the same or a similar subject as the proposed amendment.  In
re Mineral Prod. Tax Initiative, 644 P.2d 20 (Colo. 1982).
<P>The board is not required to provide lengthy explanations of every portion
of a proposed constitutional amendment as overly detailed titles and submission
clauses could by their very length confuse voters.  In re Proposed Initiative
Concerning State Personnel Systems, 691 P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1984).
<P>Mere ambiguity of a summary, if not clearly misleading, does not require
disapproval by court. In re Proposed Initiative Concerning State Personnel
System, 691 P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1984).
<P>Board is not required to give opinion regarding ambiguity of a proposed
initiative, nor is it necessary for the board to be concerned with legal issues
which the proposed initiative may create.  Matter of Title, Ballot Title, Etc.,
797 P.2d 1275 (Colo. 1990).
<P>Board may be challenged when misleading summary of amendment prejudicial.
A misleading summary of the fiscal impact of a proposed amendment is likely to
create an unfair prejudice against the measure and is a sufficient basis, under
this section, for challenging the board's action.  In re An Initiated
Constitutional Amendment, 199 Colo. 409, 609 P.2d 631 (1980).
<P>Request for agency assistance at board's discretion. The decision of
whether and from which of the two state agencies to request information is
within the discretion of the board. Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo.
1982).
<P>Technical correction of proposed initiative permitted. Allowing a
technical correction of the proposed initiative to conform with the intent of
the proponents does not frustrate the purpose of the statute.  Spelts v.
Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>Purpose of statutory time table for meetings of initiative title setting
review board is to assure that the titles, submission clause, and summary of an
initiated measure are considered promptly by the board well in advance of the
date by which the signed petitions must be filed with the secretary of state.
In re Second Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141, 613 P.2d 867
(1980).
<P>Section not frustrated by next-day continuance of statutory date for last
meeting. A continuance to the next day following the statutory date for the
last meeting in order to comply fully with other statutory requirements does
not frustrate the purpose of this section.  In re Second Initiated
Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141, 613 P.2d 867 (1980).
<P>V.  BALLOT TITLE AND SUBMISSION CLAUSE.
<P>A.  Sufficiency of Ballot Title.
<P>Explanation of effect on existing law permitted. The board is not
precluded from adopting language which explains to the signers of a petition
and the voter how the initiative fits in the context of existing law, even
though the specific language is not found in the text of the proposed statute.
In re Title Pertaining to Sale of Table Wine in Grocery Stores, 646 P.2d 916
(Colo. 1982).
<P>Although every possible effect need not be included. There is not
requirement that every possible effect be included within the title or the
ballot title and submission clause.  In re Title Pertaining to Sale of Table
Wine in Grocery Stores, 646 P.2d 916 (Colo. 1982); Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d
303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>The board is not required to include every aspect of a proposed measure in
the title and submission clause, provide specific explanations of a proposal,
or discuss every possible effect of an initiated measure.  The initiated
measure's title, ballot title and submission clause, and summary need only
fairly reflect the content of the measure.  In re Petition on Campaign and
Political Finance, 877 P.2d 311 (Colo. 1994).
<P>The board is only obligated to fairly summarize the central points of a
proposed measure and need not refer to every effect that the measure may have
on the current statutory scheme.  There is no requirement that the board
preface the ballot title with the note that limitations on independent
expenditures and reporting requirements currently exist by statute and that the
initiative imposes additional limits. In re Petition on Campaign and Political
Finance, 877 P.2d 311 (Colo. 1994).
<P>Initiated measure's title, as set by review board, must be proper and fair
and must correctly and fairly express the true intent and meaning of the
proposed measure.  In re Second Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo.
141, 613 P.2d 867 (1980); In re Proposed Initiative on Parental Notification of
Abortions for Minors, 794 P.2d 238 (Colo. 1990).
<P>No clear case presented for the invalidation of titles fixed by the board
where the wording of the titles attributes a meaning to the text that is
reasonable, although nor free from all doubt, and relates to a feature of the
proposed law that is both peripheral to its central purpose and of limited
temporal relevance.  In re Proposed Initiative Concerning Drinking Age, 691
P.2d 1127 (Colo. 1984).
<P>Ballot title found sufficient.  There is no requirement that ballot title
and submission clause identify any articles or sections which are amended.
Matter of Title, Ballot Title, Etc., 797 P.2d 1275 (Colo. 1990).
<P>Ballot title found insufficient and misleading. In re Tax Reform, 797 P.2d
1283 (Colo. 1990).
<P>B.  Submission Clause.
<P>"Catch phrases" are forbidden in ballot titles. Spelts v. Klausing, 649
P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>"Catch phrase" construed. A "catch phrase" consists of words which could
form the basis of a slogan for use by those who expect to carry out a campaign
for or against an initiated constitutional amendment.  Spelts v. Klausing, 649
P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>The board need not and cannot describe every feature of a proposed measure
in the titles and submission clause.  In re Proposed Initiative Concerning
State Personnel Systems, 691 P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1984).
<P>Failure of title, ballot title, and submission clause to include
definition of abortion which would impose a new legal standard which is likely
to be controversial made title, ballot title, and submission clause deficient
in that they did not fully inform signers of initiative petitions and voters
and did not fairly reflect the contents of the proposed initiative.  In re
Proposed Initiative on Parental Notification of Abortions for Minors, 794 P.2d
238 (Colo. 1990).
<P>D.  Brevity Required.
<P>Ballot title and submission clause of proposed initiative measure must be
brief. In re Second Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 200 Colo. 141, 613 P.2d
867 (1980).
<P>VI.  HEARING BY SUPREME COURT.
<P>Court's function limited. It is not the function of the supreme court to
rephrase the language of the summary and title in order to achieve the best
possible statement of the intent of the amendment.  In re Mineral Prod. Tax
Initiative, 644 P.2d 20 (Colo. 1982).
<P>Review limited to whether intent of initiative properly reflected. On
review, the supreme court can only consider whether the titles, summary, and
submission clause reflect the intent of the initiative, not whether they
reflect all possible problems that may arise in the future in applying the
language of the proposed initiative.  In re Title Pertaining to Sale of Table
Wine in Grocery Stores, 646 P.2d 916 (Colo. 1982).
<P>The supreme court can only consider whether the titles, submission clause,
and summary reflect the intent of the initiative, not whether they reflect all
possible problems that may arise in the future in applying the proposed
language.  Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).
<P>Review of board's action is limited to whether title, ballot title and
submission clause, and summary fairly represent intent of initiative so that
petition signers and voters will not be misled into support for or against a
proposition by reason of words employed by board.  In re Workers Comp
Initiative, 850 P.2d 144 (Colo. 1993); Matter of Title, Ballot Title &amp  S.
Clause, 875 P.2d 207 (Colo. 1994).
<P>As a general rule, court will reject the board's actions only where the
language it has adopted is so inaccurate as to clearly mislead the electorate.
In re Petition on Campaign and Political Finance, 877 P.2d 311 (Colo. 1994).
<P>And interpretation of initiative not permitted. It is not the function of
the supreme court in the review proceeding, nor is it the board's function, to
determine the meaning of the language of the initiative:  A judicial
interpretation of the meaning of the initiative must await an adjudication in a
specific factual context.  Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982); In re
Proposed Initiative on Parental Notification of Abortions for Minors, 794 P.2d
238 (Colo. 1990).
<P>The standards governing the court's review of the board's actions are well
established:  (1) The court must not in any way concern itself with the merit
or lack of merit of the proposed initiative since, under our system of
government, resolution rests with the electorate; (2) All legitimate
presumptions must be indulged in favor of the propriety of the board's action;
and (3) Only in a clear case should a title prepared by the board be held
invalid.  Matter of Title, Ballot Title &amp  S. Clause, 872 P.2d 689 (Colo. 1994).
<P>In reviewing determinations by title board, court will not address the
merits of the proposed initiative, but instead, gives great deference to
board's actions in exercising its drafting authority.  Matter of Title, Ballot
Title &amp  S. Clause, 875 P.2d 207 (Colo. 1994).
<P>Court will set aside board's action as invalid only when language used by
board is clearly misleading.  In re Campaign and Political Finance Initiative,
830 P.2d 954 (Colo. 1992); Matter of Title, Ballot Title &amp  S. Clause, 875 P.2d
207 (Colo. 1994).
<P>Constitutional challenge was beyond the scope of court's review of board
decisions in setting title, ballot title and submission clause, and summary.
Matter of Title, Ballot Title &amp  S. Clause, 875 P.2d 207 (Colo. 1994).
<P>Construction of language of proposed initiative is beyond scope of a
statutory review proceeding.  Matter of Title, Ballot Title &amp  S. Clause, 875
P.2d 207 (Colo. 1994).
<P>The court may not interpret the meaning of an initiative or speculate as
to its future application if adopted.  Because the proposed amendment contains
no definition of the term "strong public trust doctrine", such a definition
must await future judicial construction and cannot appropriately be included in
the title or submission clause.  In re Proposed Initiative on Water Rights, 877
P.2d 321 (Colo. 1994).
<P>The board is not required to state the effect that an initiative may have
on other constitutional provisions, and the court may not address the potential
constitutional interpretation implications of the initiative in the court's
review.  In re Proposed Initiative on Water Rights, 877 P.2d 321 (Colo. 1994).
<P>Court had no jurisdiction to entertain respondent's complaints regarding
the titles and summary set by the board where record on appeal included no
indication of any motion for rehearing with the secretary of state within
forty-eight hours after the return of the titles and summary.  Matter of
Election Reform Amendment, 852 P.2d 28 (Colo. 1993) (decided under law in
effect prior to 1993 amendment and relocation).
<P>In a proceeding under this statute, etc.
<P>In accord with original.  See In re An Initiated Constitutional Amendment,
199 Colo. 409, 609 P.2d 631 (1980); In re Title Pertaining to Sale of Table
Wine in Grocery Stores, 646 P.2d 916 (Colo. 1982); Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d
303 (Colo. 1982); In re Proposed Initiated Constitutional Amendment, 682 P.2d
480 (Colo. 1984); In re Proposed Initiative Concerning State Personnel System,
691 P.2d 1121 (Colo. 1984); In re Proposed Initiative Concerning Drinking Age,
691 P.2d 1127 (Colo. 1984); In re Proposed Initiative on Parental Notification
of Abortions for Minors, 794 P.2d 238 (Colo. 1990); In re Petition on Campaign
and Political Finance, 877 P.2d 311 (Colo. 1994).
1-40-102
<P>I.  GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Title, summary, and submission clause need only express intent and meaning
of the proposed constitutional amendment.  In re Proposed Initiative on Transf.
of Real Estate, 200 Colo. 40, 611 P.2d 981 (1980).
<P>Failure to mention existing similar statute of no effect. The failure to
mention the existence of a statute addressing the same or similar subject as
that of a proposed amendment does not have any effect on the acceptability of
the titles, summary, and submission clause.  In re Proposed Initiative on
Transf. of Real Estate, 200 Colo. 40, 611 P.2d 981 (1980).
<P>Summary need not mention the effect of the amendment on an existing
statute addressing the same or a similar subject as the proposed amendment.  In
re Mineral Prod. Tax Initiative, 644 P.2d 20 (Colo. 1982).
<P>The provisions of this statute, rather than those of the Administrative
Procedure Act, govern the Board's action in designating and fixing the title,
ballot title and submission clause, and summary of a proposed initiative
measure.  In re Proposed Initiative Entitled W.A.T.E.R., 831 P.2d 1301 (Colo.
1992).
<P>No requirement that provisions of section to be repealed must be set out
in the ballot title and submission clause.  Matter of Proposed Constitutional
Amendment, 757 P.2d 132 (Colo. 1988).
<P>Scope of supreme court review. The Colorado supreme court is limited in
its review to determining if the titles, summary, and submission clause are
unfair or do not clearly express the true meaning and intent of the proposed
law.  In re Branch Banking Initiative, 200 Colo. 85, 612 P.2d 96 (1980); Matter
of Educ. Tax Reform, 823 P.2d 1353 (Colo. 1991).
<P>The Colorado supreme court can only consider whether the titles, summary,
and submission clause reflect the intent of the amendment, not whether they
reflect all possible problems that may arise in the future in applying the
language of the proposed amendment.  In re Proposed Initiative on Transf. of
Real Estate, 200 Colo. 40, 611 P.2d 981 (1980); In re Proposed Initiative on
Confidentiality of Adoption Records, 832 P.2d 229 (Colo. 1992).
<P>Judicial determination of retroactive application of proposed amendment.
If a controversy arises in a specific factual context, then judicial
determination of retroactive application may be appropriate, but it is not
relevant to the determination of the accuracy of the language of the titles,
summary, and submission clause of a proposed amendment.  In re Proposed
Initiative on Transf. of Real Estate, 200 Colo. 40, 611 P.2d 981 (1980); In re
Proposed Initiative on Confidentiality of Adoption Records, 832 P.2d 229 (Colo.
1992).
<P>Plaintiff has a liberty right to challenge the decision of the title
board.  This section and section 101 insufficiently provide for the notice
required by the United States constitution to protect this liberty interest,
thereby depriving plaintiff of her constitutional rights.  Montero v. Meyer,
790 F. Supp. 1531 (D. Colo. 1992).
<P>As to all initiatives and referanda hearings governed by this section
occurring after April 27, 1992, defendants are ordered to publish pre-hearing
and post-hearing notices to electors at least sufficient to meet the fair
notice requirements of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the
United States Constitution.  Montero v. Meyer, 790 F. Supp. 1531 (D. Colo.
1992).
<P>In considering whether the title, ballot title and submission clause, and
summary accurately reflect the intent of the proposed initiative, it is
appropriate to consider the testimony of the proponent concerning the intent of
the proposed initiative which was offered at the public meeting at which the
title, ballot title and submission clause, and summary were set.  In re
Proposed Initiated Constitutional Amendment Concerning Unsafe Workplace
Environment, 830 P.2d 1031 (Colo. 1992).
<P>Applied in Spelts v. Klausing, 649 P.2d 303 (Colo. 1982).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-40-119.</H1>
1-40-119.  Procedure for hearings. At any hearing held under this article,
the party protesting the finding of the secretary of state concerning the
sufficiency of signatures shall have the burden of proof.  Hearings shall be
had as soon as is conveniently possible and shall be concluded within thirty
days after the commencement thereof, and the result of such hearings shall be
forthwith certified to the designated representatives of the signers and to the
protestors of the petition.  The hearing shall be subject to the provisions of
the Colorado rules of civil procedure.  Upon application, the decision of the
court shall be reviewed by the Colorado supreme court.

effective May 4. L. 95:  Entire section amended, p. 436,  14, effective May 8.
<P>Annotator's note. Since  1-40-119 is similar to  1-40-109 as it existed
prior to the 1993 amendment of title 1, article 40, which resulted in the
relocation of provisions, relevant cases construing that provision have been
included in the annotations to this section.  For additional cases see the

<P>VII.   Protests Before Secretary of State.
<P>V.  AMENDMENT AND WITHDRAWAL OF PETITION.
<P>The provision that a rejected petition, etc.
<P>Former subsection (2), which provided that a rejected petition may be
amended and refiled as an original, did not subject a cured petition to the
deadline set forth in Colo. Const. art. V,  11 (2).  Montero v. Meyer, 795 P.2d
242 (Colo. 1990) (decided under law in effect prior 1989 amendment).
<P>VII.  PROTESTS BEFORE SECRETARY OF STATE.
<P>Amended protest was properly dismissed by the secretary of state pursuant
to former version of this section, despite the secretary's incorrect
notification to the protestor that a protest could be filed by a specified
date.  The secretary of state lacked the authority to enlarge the protest
period provided in former version of this section and protestor cannot state
claim for relief under theory of estoppel against a state entity on the basis
of an unauthorized action or promise.  Montero v. Meyer, 795 P.2d 242 (Colo.
1990) (decided under law in effect prior to 1989 amendment).

counsels, procures, or assists any person in doing any of said acts commits a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as provided in

in every legal newspaper, as defined in sections 24-70-102 and 24-70-103 (1),
C.R.S., compactly and without unnecessary spacing, in not less than eight-point
standard type, a true copy of the title and text of each constitutional
amendment, initiated or referred measure, or part of a measure to be submitted
to the people with the number and form in which the ballot title thereof will
be printed in the official ballot. The charge for publication shall be at the

<HR>
<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-40-106.5.</H1>
1-40-106.5.  Single-subject requirements for initiated measures and
referred constitutional amendments - legislative declaration. (1)  The general
assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that:
<P>(a)  Section 1 (5.5) of article V and section 2 (3) of article XIX of the
state constitution require that every constitutional amendment or law proposed
by initiative and every constitutional amendment proposed by the general
assembly be limited to a single subject, which shall be clearly expressed in
its title.
<P>(b)  Such provisions were referred by the general assembly to the people
for their approval at the 1994 general election pursuant to Senate Concurrent
Resolution 93-4.
<P>(c)  The language of such provisions was drawn from section 21 of
article V of the state constitution, which requires that every bill, except
general appropriation bills, shall be limited to a single subject, which shall
be clearly expressed in its title.
<P>(d)  The Colorado supreme court has held that the constitutional
single-subject requirement for bills was designed to prevent or inhibit various
inappropriate or misleading practices that might otherwise occur, and the
intent of the general assembly in referring to the people section 1 (5.5) of
article V and section 2 (3) of article XIX was to protect initiated measures
and referred constitutional amendments from similar practices.
<P>(e)  The practices intended by the general assembly to be inhibited by
section 1 (5.5) of article V and section 2 (3) of article XIX are as follows:
<P>(I)  To forbid the treatment of incongruous subjects in the same measure,
especially the practice of putting together in one measure subjects having no
necessary or proper connection, for the purpose of enlisting in support of the
measure the advocates of each measure, and thus securing the enactment of
measures that could not be carried upon their merits;
<P>(II)  To prevent surreptitious measures and apprise the people of the
subject of each measure by the title, that is, to prevent surprise and fraud
from being practiced upon voters.
<P>(2)  It is the intent of the general assembly that section 1 (5.5) of
article V and section 2 (3) of article XIX be liberally construed, so as to
avert the practices against which they are aimed and, at the same time, to
preserve and protect the right of initiative and referendum.
<P>(3)  It is further the intent of the general assembly that, in setting
titles pursuant to section 1 (5.5) of article V, the initiative title setting
review board created in section 1-40-106 should apply judicial decisions
construing the constitutional single-subject requirement for bills and should
follow the same rules employed by the general assembly in considering titles
for bills.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-3-101.</H1>
2-3-101.  Legislative audit committee - membership - meetings - powers and
duties. (1)  There is hereby created a legislative audit committee, hereinafter
referred to as the "committee".  The membership of the committee shall consist
of four senators, two from each major political party, to be appointed by the
president of the senate with the approval of a majority of the members elected
to the senate and four representatives, two from each major political party, to
be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives with the approval
of a majority of the members elected to the house of representatives.
Appointments to the committee shall be made no later than sixty days after the
convening of the first regular session of the general assembly held in each
odd-numbered year. Membership on the committee shall terminate with the
appointment of a member's successor or upon the termination of a member's term
of office in the general assembly, whichever occurs first, and any member may
be appointed to succeed himself on the committee.  Vacancies in the committee's
membership shall be filled in the same manner as original appointments; except
that the approval of the members elected to the general assembly is not
necessary if any such appointment is made when the general assembly is not in
session.
<P>(2)  The committee shall select its chairman and vice-chairman from among
its membership, and it shall prescribe its own rules of procedure. The
committee may appoint subcommittees from the membership of the general assembly
and other persons to assist the committee in carrying out its functions.  The
committee may meet as often as may be necessary to perform its functions, but
it shall meet at least once in each quarter of the calendar year.
<P>(3)  It is the function of the committee:
<P>(a)  To examine persons applying for the position of state auditor as to
qualifications and ability but without regard to political affiliation and,
after consultation with the executive committee, to place the names of the most
qualified candidates in nomination before the general assembly for the position
of state auditor;
<P>(b)  To review the activities and reports of the state auditor relating to
postaudits of the financial transactions and accounts of all departments,
institutions, and agencies of the state government and of other public agencies
and to submit its recommendations thereon to the general assembly, the
governor, and other interested officials at such times as the committee
considers necessary;
<P>(c)  To keep minutes of its meetings which shall be available to all
members of the general assembly upon request and to allow any member of the
general assembly to attend any of the meetings of the committee and to present
his views on any subject which the committee may be considering;
<P>(d)  To conduct such other activities as may be required by law or by
joint resolution of the general assembly;
<P>(e)  Upon receipt of the investigation report as provided in section
24-50.5-106, C.R.S., to direct the state auditor to conduct a preliminary
investigation to determine the need for a fiscal audit, performance audit, or
management study of the matter set forth in such report.  Upon receipt of the
preliminary report from the state auditor, the committee may direct an
immediate special audit or management study of the matter or may provide that
such study shall be done in accordance with the scheduled audit of the agency
cited in such report.  Upon completion of any special audit or management study
pursuant to this paragraph (e), the committee shall submit its findings to the
governor and the members of the general assembly;
<P>(f)  To review enterprise designations of auxiliary facilities or groups
of auxiliary facilities which are submitted to the office of the state auditor
pursuant to the provisions of section 23-5-101.5, C.R.S., to ensure that such
designations conform to the requirements of section 23-5-101.5, C.R.S., and to
the provisions of section 20 of article X of the state constitution, to
determine which, if any designations, shall be allowed to expire pursuant to
section 23-5-101.5, C.R.S., and to recommend to the general assembly such
legislation regarding such designations as may be necessary; and
<P>(g)  To review any enterprise designation of the student loan division
that is submitted to the office of the state auditor pursuant to the provisions
of section 23-3.1-103.5, C.R.S., to ensure that the designation conforms to the
requirements of section 23-3.1-103.5, C.R.S., and to the provisions of section
20 of article X of the state constitution, to determine whether the designation
shall be allowed to expire pursuant to section 23-3.1-103.5, C.R.S., and to
recommend to the general assembly such legislation regarding the designation as
may be necessary.
<P>(4)  Members of the committee shall be reimbursed for necessary expenses
in connection with the performance of their duties and shall be paid the same
per diem as other members of interim committees in attendance at meetings.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-2-703.</H1>
2-2-703.  General assembly - bills which result in a net increase in
periods of imprisonment in state correctional facilities - funding must be
provided in the bill. On and after July 1, 1991, no bill may be passed by the
general assembly which would result in a net increase in periods of
imprisonment in state correctional facilities unless, in such bill, there is an
appropriation of moneys which is sufficient to cover any increased capital
construction costs and any increased operating costs which are the result of
such bill in each of the first five years in which there is a fiscal impact as
a result of the bill.  Moneys sufficient to cover such increased capital
construction costs and increased operating costs for the first five fiscal
years in which there is a fiscal impact as a result of the bill shall be
estimated by the appropriations committee, and after consideration of such
estimate the general assembly shall make a determination as to the amount of
moneys sufficient to cover the costs, and such moneys shall be appropriated in
the bill in the form of a statutory appropriation from the general fund in the
years affected.  Any such bill which is passed on or after July 1, 1991, which
is silent as to whether it is intended to be an exception to this section,
shall not be deemed to be such an exception.  Any bill which is enacted which
is intended to be an exception to this section shall expressly state such
exception in such bill.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-2-309.</H1>
2-2-309.  Method of payment. (1)  The presiding officer of each house
shall certify at such times as may be necessary during each session and
thereafter the number of days of service rendered by each officer and employee
of his respective house and the amount payable for such service, and the state
controller, upon receipt of such certification, shall issue vouchers and draw
warrants for the compensation due each officer and employee, without
certification from the state personnel director, and the state treasurer shall
pay the same out of the moneys appropriated for the purpose.
<P>(2)  Upon receipt of the certification required by section 2-2-307 (2)
(c), the controller shall issue vouchers and draw warrants for the compensation
due each member.  Such compensation shall be adjusted in accordance with the
provisions of section 2-2-307 (2) and (4).  In the event such certification
evidences an overpayment to a member for compensation during the session, the
controller shall cause a statement of deficiency to be issued for the recovery
of such funds previously disbursed to the member.  Any such statement of
deficiency shall be enforceable as a debt to the state of Colorado and may be
enforced in the appropriate court by the attorney general.
<P>(3)  The controller, upon taking official notice of the existing
membership of the general assembly, shall issue vouchers and draw warrants for
the monthly and semimonthly per diem compensation and for the reimbursement of
expenses and travel authorized by section 2-2-307.

<P>Annotator's note. The following annotations are taken from a case decided
under a former provision similar to this section.
<P>A certificate of the presiding officer of either house of the general
assembly as to the election and services of any officer or employee of such
house is conclusive upon the state auditor.  Lowell v. Bonney, 14 Colo. App.
230, 60 P. 830 (1900).
<P>And he has no authority to go behind such certificate to inquire whether
such officer was elected or whether he performed the services.  Lowell v.
Bonney, 14 Colo. App. 230, 60 P. 830 (1900).
<P>Furthermore his duty to issue a warrant for the salary of such officer
upon the presentation of such certificate is ministerial, and mandamus will lie
to compel the issuance of the warrant.  Lowell v. Bonney, 14 Colo. App. 230, 60
P. 830 (1900).
<P>Also, in the application for mandamus to compel the state auditor to issue
a warrant for services of an officer of the senate, it is not necessary to
allege that the money is in the treasury against which the warrant can be
drawn, but the warrant may be drawn in anticipation of the revenue.  Lowell v.
Bonney, 14 Colo. App. 230, 60 P. 830 (1900).

2-2-401.  Legislative declaration. The general assembly finds and declares
that in addition to the protections against interference with the legislative

18-8-306, and 18-9-110, C.R.S. 1973, there is a need for legislation under
which appropriate action may be taken to prevent the commission of acts
prohibited under said sections.

2-2-507.  Attachments and detachments. (1)  If any area of the state is
omitted from the reapportionment plan approved by the Colorado supreme court,
inadvertently or by virtue of the complexities of the census materials used in
the development of the plan, the secretary of state, upon discovery of such
omission, shall determine to which senatorial or representative district the
area should be assigned as follows:
<P>(a)  If the area is surrounded by a representative or senatorial district,
the area shall be assigned to said district; and
<P>(b)  If the area is contiguous to two or more representative or senatorial
districts, the area shall be assigned to the district that has the least
population according to the latest national census.
<P>(2)  If any area of the state is included in two or more senatorial or
representative districts in the reapportionment plan approved by the Colorado
supreme court, inadvertently or by virtue of the complexities of the census
materials used in the development of the plan, the secretary of state, upon
discovery of such inclusion, shall detach said area from the senatorial or
representative district or districts having the largest population and shall
designate such area as being assigned to the district having the least
population; except that, if such area is wholly surrounded by a senatorial or
representative district and by inadvertence is also included in another
district, the secretary of state shall assign such area to the district wholly
surrounding such area, regardless of population.
<P>(3)  Following the assignment of any area pursuant to the provisions of
subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the secretary of state shall certify the
population of such assigned area and any changes in populations of affected
senatorial or representative districts, based on the latest national census, to
the Colorado supreme court. If the supreme court determines that the
assignments made by the secretary of state would not result in a violation of
the population requirements of section 46 of article V of the state
constitution, the supreme court shall approve said assignments.  If the supreme
court determines that the assignments would result in a violation of the
population requirements of section 46 of article V of the state constitution,
the supreme court shall certify a revised reapportionment plan to the secretary
of state.

<P>Reapportionment leaving district without resident senator until 1985
unconstitutional.  Drawing boundaries of two senatorial districts so that one
district encompasses the residences of two incumbent state senators while no
state senator resides in the other, and setting the senatorial election for the
first district for 1982 and for the other district for 1984, with the result
that no senator will reside in the latter district until 1985, is a violation
of constitutional guarantees of legislative representation.  In re
Reapportionment of Colo. Gen. Ass'y, 647 P.2d 191 (Colo. 1982).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-2-204.</H1>
2-2-204.  Attachments and detachments. (1) If any area of this state is
omitted from the provisions of this part 2, inadvertently or by virtue of the
complexities of the information supplied to the general assembly, the secretary
of state, upon discovery of such omission, shall attach such area to the
appropriate representative district as follows:
<P>(a)  If the area is surrounded by a representative district, the area
shall be attached to such district.
<P>(b)  If the area is contiguous to two or more representative districts,
the area shall be attached to the district that has the least population
according to the last preceding national census of the United States bureau of
the census.
<P>(2)  If any area of this state is included in two or more representative
districts established by this part 2, inadvertently or by virtue of the
complexities of the information supplied to the general assembly, the secretary
of state, upon discovery of such inclusion, shall detach such area from the
representative district or districts having the largest population and shall
designate such area as being included in the representative district having the
least population; except that, if such area is wholly surrounded by a
representative district and by inadvertence is also included in another
representative district, the secretary of state shall designate such area as
included in the district wholly surrounding such area, regardless of
population.
<P>(3)  If any annexation occurring on or after May 1, 1972, changes a county
boundary which constitutes any portion of the boundary of a representative
district defined by this part 2, and if the population of the area annexed is
one hundred seventy persons or less according to the 1970 federal census, the
secretary of state shall detach the area annexed from the representative
district in which it is included pursuant to this part 2 and shall attach such
area to the adjacent representative district in the county to which the area
was annexed; except that if such attachment would result in any area in one
representative district being wholly surrounded by area in another
representative district, no adjustment in representative district boundaries
shall be made.  If the area annexed is adjacent to two or more representative
districts in the county to which it is annexed, the area shall be attached to
the representative district having the least population.  The area so attached
shall also be attached to any general election precinct adjacent to such area
in the county to which the area was annexed.
<P>(4)  If any annexation occurring on or after May 1, 1972, changes a county
boundary which constitutes any portion of the boundary of a representative
district defined by this part 2, and if the population of the annexed area is
more than one hundred seventy persons according to the 1970 federal census, no
adjustment in the boundaries of representative districts shall be made, but the
area annexed shall constitute a separate general election precinct.
<P>(5)  Any attachment or detachment made pursuant to the provisions of
subsections (1) to (4) of this section shall be certified in writing by and
kept on file with the secretary of state. No change may be made in any such
attachment or detachment until the representative districts are again
reapportioned.

<HR>
<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-2-203.</H1>
2-2-203.  Legislative declaration - findings of legislative fact. (1) The
general assembly declares it to be necessary to meet the equal population
requirements of section 46 of article V of the state constitution in some
instances to add part of one county to all or part of another county in forming
representative districts under this part 2.
<P>(2)  The general assembly further declares that some representative
districts are not comprised of areas whose boundaries are equidistant from the
geographic center of the respective areas, but that variations therefrom were
necessitated by population density and distribution, boundaries of enumeration
districts and other identifiable census units of area, natural boundaries, and
county lines in order to define representative districts having population as
nearly equal as may be.
<P>(3)  Pursuant to the requirements of section 47 of article V of the state
constitution, the representative districts established by this part 2 are based
upon the following factors:  (1)  Equal population;  (2) a minimum split of
counties; and (3) compactness based upon geographic areas whose boundaries are
as nearly equidistant from a center as possible, limited by variances caused by
the shape of county boundary lines, census enumeration lines, natural
boundaries, population density, and the need to retain compactness of adjacent
districts.
<P>Colorado's population as established by the 1970 federal census is
2,209,528.  An average representative district is 33,993.  The maximum
deviation in excess of this average for a representative district as provided
by this part 2 is 0.81 percent, while the smallest district is 1.02 percent
below average.
<P>The compactness of each individual district not only depends upon natural
boundaries, the irregular size and shape of census districts, and county lines,
but must be related to the overall approach used in developing districts of
approximately equal population.  (The term "census districts" is used in this
subsection (3) to include official census tracts, enumeration districts, block
groups, or blocks, as applicable.)
<P>The Front Range area which stretches from the Wyoming state line on the
north to the southern border of Pueblo county embodies thirteen counties (i.e.,
Larimer, Weld, Morgan, Boulder, Jefferson, Denver, Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas,
Elbert, El Paso, Teller, and Pueblo) which contain a total of 1,798,936 people.
<P>The house reapportionment plan as embodied in this part 2 allocates
fifty-three house districts to this Front Range area.  Fifty-three seats times
the ideal 33,993 people for each district equals 1,801,609 people.  The
fifty-three districts as contained in this part 2 have 1,800,425 people in
them.
<P>This approach leaves twelve house districts to be devised from the
remaining fifty counties -- since section 47 of article V of the state
constitution provides that counties may be split for purposes of equal
population only, the compactness of these twelve districts is dependent for the
most part on the shape of county boundaries.
<P>In order to achieve equal population in these remaining twelve districts,
and still retain the integrity of county boundaries wherever feasible, and to
strive for as compact districts as possible, parts of four counties contained
in the Front Range group were added to the outlying twelve districts.  (A part
of Larimer county was added to district 56; a part of Teller county was added
to district 61; a part of Elbert county was added to district 64; and a part of
Morgan county was added to district 64.)
<P>Aside from cutting across the said four county lines, only nine county
boundaries were crossed in devising the twelve outlying districts out of the
remaining fifty counties, and these were made for purposes of population
equality.
<P>In order to pick up the extra population necessary for the Front Range
group of districts after deducting the parts allocated to the outlying twelve
districts, population from the whole counties of Huerfano, Crowley, and Custer,
and a part of Fremont county were added to Pueblo county in order to create
four legislative districts.
<P>Within the Front Range group of legislative districts there are densely
populated areas interspersed within very sparsely populated areas, and this
contributes to the difficulties of drawing districts in a compact manner.
<P>Wherever feasible in the plan contained in this part 2, districts within
densely populated areas have been drawn as compact as possible.  However,
drawing five compact districts in Adams county, for example, necessitates a
sixth district which gives an appearance of noncompactness.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-2-106.</H1>
2-2-106.  Attachments and detachments. (1) If any area of this state is
omitted from the provisions of this part 1, inadvertently or by virtue of the
complexities of the information supplied to the general assembly, the secretary
of state, upon discovery of such omission, shall attach such area to the
appropriate senatorial or representative district as follows:
<P>(a)  If the area is surrounded by a senatorial or representative district,
the area shall be attached to such district;
<P>(b)  If the area is contiguous to two or more senatorial or representative
districts, the area shall be attached to the district that has the least
population according to the last preceding national census of the United States
bureau of the census.
<P>(2)  If any area of this state is included in two or more senatorial or
representative districts established by this part 1, inadvertently or by virtue
of the complexities of the information supplied to the general assembly, the
secretary of state, upon discovery of such inclusion, shall detach such area
from the senatorial or representative district or districts having the largest
population and shall designate such area as being included in the senatorial or
representative district having the least population; except that if such area
is wholly surrounded by a senatorial or representative district and by
inadvertence is also included in another senatorial or representative district,
the secretary of state shall designate such area as included in the district
wholly surrounding such area, regardless of population.
<P>(3)  If any annexation occurring on or after May 1, 1972, changes a county
boundary which constitutes any portion of the boundary of a senatorial district
defined by this part 1, and if the population of the area annexed is one
hundred seventy persons or less according to the 1970 federal census, the
secretary of state shall detach the area annexed from the senatorial district
in which it is included pursuant to this part 1 and shall attach such area to
the adjacent senatorial district in the county to which the area was annexed;
except that if such attachment would result in any area in one senatorial
district being wholly surrounded by area in another senatorial district, no
adjustment in senatorial district boundaries shall be made.  If the area
annexed is adjacent to two or more senatorial districts in the county to which
it is annexed, the area shall be attached to the senatorial district having the
least population.  The area so attached shall also be attached to any general
election precinct adjacent to such area in the county to which the area was
annexed.
<P>(4)  If any annexation occurring on or after May 1, 1972, changes a county
boundary which constitutes any portion of the boundary of a senatorial district
defined by this part 1, and if the population of the annexed area is more than
one hundred seventy persons according to the 1970 federal census, no adjustment
in the boundaries of senatorial districts shall be made, but the area annexed
shall constitute a separate general election precinct.
<P>(5)  Any attachment or detachment made pursuant to the provisions of
subsections (1) to (4) of this section shall be certified in writing by and
kept on file with the secretary of state. No change may be made in any such
attachment or detachment until the senatorial or representative districts are
again reapportioned.

<HR>
<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-2-105.</H1>
2-2-105.  Legislative declaration - findings of legislative fact. (1) The
general assembly declares it to be necessary to meet the equal population
requirements of section 46 of article V of the state constitution, and it has
therefore been necessary, in some instances, to add part of one county to all
or part of another county in forming senatorial districts under this part 1.
<P>(2)  The general assembly further declares that some senatorial districts
are not comprised of areas whose boundaries are equidistant from the geographic
center of the respective areas, but that variations therefrom were necessitated
by population density and distribution, boundaries of enumeration districts and
other identifiable census units of area, natural boundaries, and county lines
in order to define senatorial districts having population as nearly equal as
may be.
<P>(3)  Pursuant to the requirements of section 47 of article V of the state
constitution, the senatorial districts established by this part 1 are based
upon the following factors:  (1)  Equal population; (2)  a minimum split of
counties; and (3) compactness based upon geographic areas whose boundaries are
as nearly equidistant from a center as possible, limited by variances caused by
the shape of county boundary lines, census enumeration lines, natural
boundaries, population density, and the need to retain compactness of adjacent
districts.
<P>Colorado's population as established by the 1970 federal census is
2,209,528. An average senatorial district is 63,129.  The maximum deviation in
excess of this average for a senatorial district as provided by this part 1 is
0.83 percent, while the smallest district is only 0.66 percent below average.
<P>Of those fifty-four counties with populations smaller than that of the
average senatorial district, only seven counties were split or thirteen percent
of the total of such counties.  For the nine densely populated counties, it is
not possible to create a senatorial district which includes all the territory
in any one of these counties and meet the constitutional requirements for
equality of population; accordingly, more than one senatorial district is found
within the confines of each of these counties.
<P>Moreover, the compactness of each individual district not only depends
upon natural boundaries, the irregular size and shape of census districts, and
county lines, but must be related to the overall approach used in developing
districts of approximately equal population.  (The term "census districts" is
used in this subsection (3) to include official census tracts, enumeration
districts, block groups, or blocks, as applicable.)
<P>METROPOLITAN DENVER AREA DISTRICTS
<P>Denver has a surplus of population of over 9,700 after computing eight
senatorial districts.  Since Adams county is in need of 3,600 population to
achieve three senate seats, an exchange of areas was made between these two
counties, as explained in districts 1, 2, and 3.  When the population of
enclaves of Arapahoe county within the city and county of Denver (4,404) is
added to the population of Denver, it is obvious that some areas of Denver must
be added to predominantly Arapahoe county districts to maintain equal
population.
<P>Districts 17, 18, and 19.  District 19 begins with the census districts in
northeast Denver which were excluded from district 3.  Working northward and
westward into Adams county from these areas, extremely large and sparsely
populated census districts are encountered.  In order to achieve equal
population, contiguous areas in Commerce City and southern Westminster were
chosen to comprise the bulk of the population in district 19.
<P>District 18.  District 18 is composed of those parts of the remaining
population centers in Adams county - the communities of Northglenn, Thornton,
Sherrelwood, Welby, and Federal Heights - which are necessary to achieve
sufficient population for the district.  District 18's irregular southeastern
boundary, which is also a portion of the northern boundary of district 19, is
formed by the South Platte river. District 17 consists of the remainder of
Adams county.  The wide variations in the distribution of population in this
remaining area and the limitations placed upon its shape by district boundaries
already drawn determine the shape of district 17.
<P>Districts 1, 2, and 3.  Three giant blocks are formed for districts across
north Denver.  Only 5,563 persons, located in an area northeast of Stapleton
Field which cannot be split and which is surrounded on three sides by Adams
county, are excluded from the districts in north Denver and included in a
predominantly Adams county district.  To achieve equal population for district
1, a small portion of Adams county has been added.  The dividing line between
districts 1 and 2 is the South Platte river in the southern portion and Zuni
street in the northern portion.  Between districts 2 and 3, the dividing line
is Franklin street in the southern portion and York street in the northern
portion.  The location and size of census block number 501 in census tract
number 23 causes some irregularity in the Franklin street line.
<P>District 4.  District 4 forms nearly a perfect square.  Some irregularity
is required by equal population requirements.
<P>Districts 5 and 6.  These two districts in Denver form a giant square
between districts 3 and 7.  The dense population in the western end of district
5 (Capitol Hill) results in this district containing the smallest geographical
area in the Denver area.  Lowry Field (census tract number 44.02), to the east
of district 5, was added to Arapahoe county for three reasons:  The tract
cannot be split because interior population counts are not available; the
addition is essential for purposes of equal population; and, moreover, the
addition improves the compactness of districts 5 and 6.  Districts 5 and 6 are
divided by lst and 4th avenues.  The only significant variation from perfect
compactness in district 6 is census tract number 70.01, whose population of
2,640 is needed to meet the requirements of equal population.
<P>Districts 7 and 8.  The balance of Denver divides into two districts -
districts 7 and 8 - with the addition of census tract number 54.03 from
Arapahoe county, which juts northward into district 8 and has been added to
this district for purposes of equal population and compactness.  The shape of
the county will affect the compactness of the district formed in this area with
respect to the south, east, and most of the west borders.  The Valley highway
was utilized as a natural boundary in the northwest portion of the district,
with the northern boundary working eastward along block boundaries and the
western boundary southward along Clarkson street.  Variations from perfectly
straight boundaries occur because of equal population requirements and the
Children's Home area (which cannot be split).  The Arapahoe enclave of Holly
Hills is included in district 7.
<P>District 20.  On the southern border of Denver, district 20 is formed,
incorporating the communities of Englewood, Cherry Hills, and Greenwood
Village. In spite of large vacant areas in census tract number 56.05 and
sparsely populated areas in the eastern portion of the district generally, its
eastern and southern boundaries are relatively straight, and the western
boundary (following the county line) is also relatively straight.
<P>District 21.  District 21 is formed by the inclusion of Lowry Field in an
Arapahoe district extending southward from the Arapahoe county portion of
Aurora. The eastern boundary is a line following census district boundaries as
directly south as possible.  The remaining boundaries of the district are
determined either by Denver districts or by census district boundaries.
<P>DISTRICTS IN REMAINDER OF STATE
<P>District 31.  The other starting point in developing the plan under this
part 1 and in developing virtually every other proposed plan for the senate was
district 31.  District 31 is located in northwestern Colorado and is composed
of ten undivided counties.  The population of this district is 63,328, only
0.32 percent over the ideal senate district, and it is nearly square in shape.
This was chosen as a starting point, since its boundaries are identical to the
current senate district 35.
<P>The three additional senate seats to which western Colorado is entitled
were developed by working southward from this district.
<P>District 30.  Mesa county has a population of 54,374.  Since district 30's
northern boundary is fixed by district 31, the additional 8,700 persons needed
for population equality must be found in counties adjacent to the southeastern
boundary of Mesa county.  The selection of a portion of Delta county provides
the most compact district arrangement.  The shape of the census districts in
Delta county will create a jagged line along the eastern portion of district
30, regardless of which districts are selected.  Examination of the map reveals
that those enumeration districts selected yield the most compact senatorial
district.
<P>District 32.  District 32 lies directly south of district 30.  District
32's eastern boundary is a nearly direct north-south line formed by an
extension of the Delta county line directly south.  No additional counties are
split in the formation of this district.  If district 32 had been formed by
proceeding in an easterly or southeasterly direction, the district would have
become elongated and substantially less compact, or would  have had to be
expanded to the Front Range area to achieve equal population.
<P>District 33.  District 33 is formed by proceeding directly east of
district 32. Again, whole counties are utilized, with the exception of Fremont
county, as the basis for the establishment of the district.  Approximately
6,900 additional persons were needed from adjacent areas to the east or
northeast of the whole counties included in district 33.  The choice made - to
include a part of Fremont county in this district - had the advantages of
crossing only one county line and of leaving the remainder of Fremont county in
a position to be easily combined with an area in El Paso county which required
additional persons to achieve equal population in a district there.
<P>Because of the peculiar shapes of census districts and their widely
varying populations, and due to the presence of one enumeration district
composed of noncontiguous areas, no other reasonable division of Canon City
could be made. Block statistics are not available for Canon City, and,
accordingly, enumeration districts cannot be split since definite populations
cannot be certified for portions of an enumeration district.
<P>District 12.  The remainder of Fremont county, four enumeration districts
in the southern portion of Teller county, one enumeration district in Pueblo
county containing the remaining portion of Fort Carson, and an area in
southwest El Paso county following census district lines into Colorado Springs
comprise this district.  Again, irregularities in the shape of the district are
caused by the shapes of the census districts which had to be combined to
achieve equality of population.  The district forms a nearly square
configuration within these census areas.
<P>The splitting of Teller county was required to equalize population for
both this district and district 15, and the inclusion of this portion of Teller
county makes district 12's boundaries as equidistant as possible from a
geographic center.
<P>District 15.  District 15 is at the heart of the rapidly growing mountain
subdivisions of the central Front Range.  By extending the eastern Teller
county line northward to include two census enumeration districts in Douglas
county, the population of the district is equalized.  The western and southern
boundaries are formed by districts 12, 31, and 33.  The district includes the
whole counties of Park and Clear Creek and approximately 52,000 people from the
southern and central portions of Jefferson county.  The shape of the northeast
tip of district 15 is determined by boundaries of the three remaining densely
populated districts in Jefferson county which follow census district lines as
required to achieve equal population.
<P>District 14.  District 14 is the most densely populated area of Jefferson
county.  The district approaches a square shape, except for the exclusion of
census block number 101 in census tract number 105.01, which extends from
Kipling avenue on the east to Youngfield avenue on the west.  Since this block
cannot be split, the district cannot be made a perfect square.
<P>District 13.  The Jefferson county line on the east and a long portion of
6th avenue on the north establish two of the boundaries for this district.
Proceeding southwesterly to accumulate population for the district, large
census districts with minimum populations are encountered.  There are very few
options available with regard to the census districts.  For example,
enumeration district number 422A in census tract number 117.06 covers a massive
area and necessitates that the westerly portion of district 13 jut into
district 15.  If this westerly jutting were minimized by expanding district 13
into the southern portions of Jefferson county, a vertically elongated shape
for district 13 would result.
<P>District 16.  District 16 is bounded on the west by district 31, on the
south by the Gilpin county line, and on the east by the Jefferson county line.
The irregular shape of the northern boundary is due to following those census
district lines in Boulder county which were necessary to equalize population.
Boulder county is one of the nine densely populated counties and has population
in excess of that necessary for two ideal senate districts.  For purposes of
equal population, this surplus has been added to district 16. The addition also
makes a more compact district within the limitations imposed by census district
lines.  The southern border of district 16 is almost a straight line along west
52nd avenue from the eastern Jefferson county boundary to McIntyre avenue. From
McIntyre to the western Jefferson county line, the census district boundaries
determine the shape of the district.
<P>Districts 23 and 24.  In general, district 23 includes the densely
populated territory in the east of Boulder county just north of district 16.
The area included would extend in a broad belt from the city of Boulder east to
the county line.  Due to equal population requirements, it was necessary to
include census districts in the southern and southeastern parts of the city of
Boulder in district 23.  District 24 includes all of the remainder of Boulder
county extending northwest out of the city of Boulder.  Both districts 23 and
24 are wholly within the confines of Boulder county.
<P>District 27.  Working northward, the western boundary of district 27 in
Larimer county is fixed by district 31.  All of Larimer county is included
within the district with the exception of an eastern portion containing 26,843
people, located in an area extending eastward from Fort Collins to the Weld
county line.  The choice of this portion of Larimer county for combination with
area in another county was made because the other census districts in the area
were so sparsely populated, and the inclusion of them would make district 29
less compact.
<P>Districts 28 and 29.  Together with the balance of Larimer county,
district 29 encompasses all of Weld county, with the exception of those parts
of the city of Greeley and the heavily populated portions of southwest Weld
county which compose district 28. A perfectly compact district 28 was not
possible because of equal population requirements. For example, district 28
would have been a perfect square, if all of census tract number 19 could have
been included in the district.  Unfortunately, the inclusion of this additional
area would have increased the population of the district over that of the ideal
senate district by over 5,000 people.  To straighten the line actually drawn
would require a major split of the city of Greeley.  Finally, in order to
achieve equal population, an additional 10,358 people were included from Morgan
county in district 29.  The line dividing Morgan county north and south is
dictated by the census district boundaries.
<P>District 35.  All of the northeastern plains of Colorado are included in
district 35.  Bordered on the north and the east by Nebraska and Kansas, and on
the west by district 29, the district must extend south for necessary
population.  To make the district more square could be accomplished only by a
bulge westerly at a point south of the Weld county line.  Since Adams county is
3,600 short of the population necessary for three senatorial districts, further
depletion of that population was not desirable.
<P>District 34.  The five counties of Otero, Bent, Prowers, Baca, and Las
Animas form a logical block for a senatorial district, although the block has
an excess population of approximately 1,500.  Since district 35 was short of
population, adjustment was made by detaching a part of Prowers county from
district 34 and attaching it to district 35.  Again, census district lines
determine the shape of this adjustment, and populations of such districts
determine where it can be made.
<P>District 22.  The area of Arapahoe county which is not included in
districts 20 and 21 is placed in district 22.  District 22's boundaries follow
county lines in all instances except where they conform to the other Arapahoe
districts.  In order to accumulate sufficient population, the district extends
southward through Douglas county, picking up that portion not contained in
district 15, and includes all of Elbert, Lincoln, and Crowley counties. An
extension of the district into El Paso county rather than southeasterly would
have necessitated the crossing of additional county lines, and would have
reduced the population available in El Paso county below that needed for the
three remaining senatorial seats (district 12 already includes the southwestern
portion of El Paso county).
<P>Districts 9, 10, and 11.  El Paso county presents a problem for
districting, since the area of Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs is densely
populated and the remainder of the county is predominantly rural.  Accordingly,
a portion of the population in Colorado Springs must be allocated to districts
in the outlying portions of the county to meet compactness and equal population
requirements.  The main district dividing line is a natural boundary,
Interstate 25, which runs directly north and south.  In the north, Interstate
25 divides district 9 from the centrally located district 11.  In the south,
Interstate 25 again is a divider, but this time between districts 10 and 12.
Academy boulevard, another four-lane highway, also divides district 11 from
districts 9 and 10 in the northeast portions of Colorado Springs.  For district
11 in the southeast, Circle drive is the major dividing line.
<P>Some variations in these major boundaries are due to requirements of equal
population. Problems are also posed by the irregular shapes of census
districts.  For example, census block number 317 in census tract number 10
extends from west Van Buren to Uintah preventing an east-west crossing of the
tract.  Census block number 311 in census tract number 11.01 poses a similar
problem.  Numerous other examples exist, such as census tracts numbered 2, 24,
and 28, which hamper the development of perfectly straight lines in the
formation of districts.
<P>Districts 25 and 26.  Two major barriers are utilized in splitting the
city of Pueblo - the natural boundaries of Fountain creek and the Arkansas
river in the northern portion of the city, and Interstate 25 in the south.  A
significant part of the city, west of Interstate 25, is added to district 26
for purposes of population equality.  Pueblo county is approximately 8,000
people short of the population necessary for two senatorial districts, but,
when it is combined with the other areas of the state not yet included in any
district (the whole counties of Costilla and Huerfano), there is sufficient
population for the two districts which close the plan for the entire state.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 2-2-323.</H1>
2-2-323.  Service of process on the general assembly. (1)  The general
assembly hereby declares that the provisions of the Colorado rules of civil
procedure which govern the service of process on the state, on officers,
agents, or employees of the state, and on departments and agencies of the state
do not expressly address service on the general assembly; that such rules
require delivery of a copy of any process to the attorney general, even though
by statute the attorney general does not represent the general assembly; that
confusion has existed about how the general assembly should be served; and that
clarification of the procedure for serving the general assembly would be
beneficial for all parties who may become involved in future litigation.
<P>(2)  Service of process on the general assembly as an entity shall be upon
the chief clerk of the house of representatives and the secretary of the
senate.  The provisions of the Colorado rules of civil procedure concerning
service of process, including the contents of the summons, by whom process may
be served, and the manner of proof of service, shall continue to apply to
service of process on the general assembly.
<P>(3)  As quickly as possible after service of process on the general
assembly, the chief clerk of the house of representatives shall notify the

clerks and county clerk and recorders free of charge for use by candidates and
other persons required to file such statements and information under this
article;
<P>(b)  Prepare, publish, and furnish free of charge to municipal clerks and

<P>(c)  Develop a filing and indexing system for his office consistent with
the purpose of this article;
<P>(d)  Make the reports and statements filed with the secretary of state's

No information copied from such reports and statements shall be sold or
utilized by any person for the purpose of soliciting contributions or for any
commercial purpose.  Any fee collected pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall be
deposited in the department of state cash fund created in section 24-21-104
(3), C.R.S.
<P>(e)  Conduct hearings on any matter within the jurisdiction of the
secretary of state, as provided in subsection (2) of this section, subject to
appropriations made to the secretary of state.  Any complaints filed against
any candidate for the office of secretary of state shall be referred to the
attorney general.  Any administrative law judge employed pursuant to this
paragraph (e) shall be appointed pursuant to part 10 of article 30 of title 24,
C.R.S., subject to appropriations made to the department of personnel. Any
hearing conducted by an administrative law judge employed pursuant to this
paragraph (e) shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section

<P>(f)  Within three working days after the date of the deadline for filing

If the secretary of state determines, after a hearing, that such a violation
has occurred, he shall so notify the attorney general who may institute a civil
action for relief, including a permanent or temporary injunction, a restraining
order, or any other appropriate order, in the district court.  Upon a proper
showing that such person has engaged or is about to engage in such acts or
practices, a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other
order shall be granted without bond by such court.  If, within one hundred
twenty days after a complaint is filed with the secretary of state, no civil
action for relief is instituted by the attorney general, the complainant shall
have a private right of action based on an alleged violation of this article
and may institute a civil action in district court for any appropriate remedy.
Any such action shall be filed within one year from the date the final report
is filed with the appropriate officer.
<P>(b)  The attorney general shall investigate complaints made against any
candidate for the office of secretary of state.  After a determination that
probable cause exists that a violation has occurred, the attorney general shall
institute a civil action for relief, including a permanent or temporary
injunction, a restraining order, or any other appropriate order, in district
court.
<P>(c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection
(2), any person who believes a violation of section 1-45-116 has occurred may
file a written complaint no later than sixty days after the date of the
appropriate election with the secretary of state.  If the secretary of state
determines, after a timely hearing, that such a violation has occurred, the

civil action for relief, including a permanent or temporary injunction, a
restraining order, or any other appropriate order, in the district court.  If
the written complaint is filed within ten days of the election, the secretary
of state shall hold such hearing within seventy-two hours of the filing of such
complaint.  Upon a proper showing that a person or public entity identified in
section 1-45-116 has engaged or is about to engage in such acts or practices, a
permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order shall be
granted without bond by such court.

fund-raising events if such contributions or contributions in kind are intended
to be given to another organization or group of persons which in turn
distributes or contributes such contributions or contributions in kind to one
or more candidates or political committees.  The provisions of paragraph (b) of
subsection (4) of this section shall also apply to any such organization or
group of persons for each contribution or contribution in kind which exceeds
twenty-five dollars if such contribution or contribution in kind is intended to
be given to another organization or group of persons which in turn distributes
or contributes such contribution or contribution in kind to one or more
candidates or political committees.  The reporting provisions of this section
shall apply to the organization or group of persons receiving such
contributions or contributions in kind.
<P>(5.5)  The filing requirements of this section shall not apply to that
part of the organizational structure of a political party, as defined in
section 1-1-104 (25), which is responsible for only the day-to-day operations
of such political party at the national level if copies of the reports required
to be filed with the federal election commission pursuant to the "Federal
Election Commission Act of 1971", as amended, are filed with the secretary of
state and include the information required by this section.
<P>(6)  Notwithstanding any other reports required under this section, the

<P>(7) (a)  Any person or campaign treasurer making an independent
expenditure of five hundred dollars, or more, at any time after the sixteenth
day but more than twenty-four hours before the day of the election shall file a
report of such an expenditure.  This report shall be filed with the appropriate
officer within twenty-four hours after the independent expenditure is made.
The report shall include the identification and address of each person who made
a contribution to the campaign treasurer or person filing such report which was
made for the purpose of furthering an independent expenditure.

paragraph (a) of this subsection (7) shall provide, concurrent with such
filing, a copy of that report to the candidate running in the election or to
the political committee supporting or opposing the issue to be submitted in the
election for which the independent expenditure was made.
<P>(8)  The secretary of state shall conduct a study of the feasibility and
cost of implementing a computer information system that would allow computer
users to cross-reference and review, using the name of a candidate, incumbent,
lobbyist, or any other person, any report filed pursuant to this article, any

prior to the 1993 amendment of title 1, article 40, which resulted in the
relocation of provisions, a relevant case construing that provision has been

annotations under former  1-40-115 in the 1980 replacement volume.
<P>Law reviews. For note, "Referendum and Rezoning:  Margolis v. District
Court", see 53 U. Colo. L. Rev. 745 (1982).
<P>Referendum power coextensive with constitutional referendum power. The
statutory scheme on referendum and initiative to which statutory cities are
subject is coextensive with but not more expansive than the power reserved to
the people under the Colorado constitution.  Margolis v. District Court, 638

<P>Power of initiative is fundamental right. McKee v. City of Louisville, 200
Colo. 525, 616 P.2d 969 (1980).
<P>Reserved by people for themselves. The right of initiative is of the first
order; it is not a grant to the people but a reservation by them for
themselves.  McKee v. City of Louisville, 200 Colo. 525, 616 P.2d 969 (1980).
<P>Right of initiative pertains to any measure, whether constitutional or
legislative and, in the case of municipalities, it encompasses legislation of
every character.  McKee v. City of Louisville, 200 Colo. 525, 616 P.2d 969
(1980).
<P>Initiated measure clothed with presumption of validity. An initiated
measure proposed by the electors is clothed in the first instance with a
presumption of validity, and its actual validity may be considered by the court

Section 2.  Amendments to constitution - how adopted. (1)  Any amendment
or amendments to this constitution may be proposed in either house of the
general assembly, and, if the same shall be voted for by two-thirds of all the
members elected to each house, such proposed amendment or amendments, together
with the ayes and noes of each house thereon, shall be entered in full on their
respective journals.  The proposed amendment or amendments shall be published
with the laws of that session of the general assembly. At the next general
election for members of the general assembly, the said amendment or amendments
shall be submitted to the registered electors of the state for their approval
or rejection, and such as are approved by a majority of those voting thereon
shall become part of this constitution.
<P>(2)  If more than one amendment be submitted at any general election, each
of said amendments shall be voted upon separately and votes thereon cast shall
be separately counted the same as though but one amendment was submitted; but
each general assembly shall have no power to propose amendments to more than
six articles of this constitution.
<P>As amended November 6, 1900.  (See Laws 1899, p. 155.); as amended
November 4, 1980 -- Effective upon proclamation of the Governor, December 19,

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
I.  General Consideration.
<P>II.  Publication.
<P>III.  Submission of Several Amendments.
<P>I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Cross reference.  As to publication of proposed constitutional amendments
and initiated and referred bills, see  1 of art. XXIII, Colo. Const.
<P>Am. Jur.2d.  See 16 Am. Jur.2d, Constitutional Law,   34-51.
<P>C.J.S.  See 16 C.J.S., Constitutional Law,  7.
<P>Law reviews.  For article, "The Colorado Constitution", see 22 Dicta 29
(1945).
<P>Authority to propose amendments to constitution is vested in general
assembly by virtue of this section.  In re Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 10
of Forty-First Gen. Ass'y, 137 Colo. 491, 328 P.2d 103 (1958).
<P>Amendment of the Colorado constitution can be accomplished, in addition to
resort to the initiative and referendum device, through a majority vote of the
electorate on an amendment proposed by the general assembly following a
favorable vote thereon by two-thirds of all the members elected to each house
of the Colorado general assembly, pursuant to this section.  Lucas v.
Forty-Fourth Gen. Ass'y, 377 U.S. 713, 84 S. Ct. 1459, 12 L. Ed.2d 632 (1964).
<P>Section must be strictly observed.  Constitutional provisions are
generally to be considered mandatory rather than directory, and those
regulating the mode of making amendments to the constitution must, in general,
be strictly observed.  Nesbit v. People, 19 Colo. 441, 36 P. 221 (1894).
<P>As section provides exclusive method of proposing amendments.  The power
of the general assembly to propose amendments to the constitution is not
subject to the provisions of art. V, Colo. Const., regulating the introduction
and passage of ordinary legislative enactments.  This section prescribes the
method of proposing amendments to the constitution, and no other rule controls.
Nesbit v. People, 19 Colo. 441, 36 P. 221 (1894); People ex rel. Moore v.
Perkins, 56 Colo. 17, 137 P. 55, 1914D Ann. Cas. 1154 (1913).
<P>In proposing amendment to constitution, action of general assembly is
initiatory, not final; a change in the fundamental law cannot be fully and
finally consummated by legislative power.  Before a proposed amendment can
become a part of the constitution, it must receive the approval of a majority
of the qualified electors of the state voting thereon at the proper general
election.  When thus approved it becomes valid as part of the constitution by
virtue of the sovereign power of the people constitutionally expressed.  Nesbit
v. People, 19 Colo. 441, 36 P. 221 (1894); People ex rel. Moore v. Perkins, 56
Colo. 17, 137 P. 55, 1914D Ann. Cas. 1154 (1913).
<P>Amendment may be proposed at special session of the general assembly.
Pearce v. People ex rel. Tate, 53 Colo. 399, 127 P. 224 (1912).
<P>And it may constitute new and separate article.  An amendment to the
constitution may be proposed by the general assembly and adopted,  by the
addition to the constitution of a new and separate article.  People ex rel.
Elder v. Sours, 31 Colo. 369, 74 P. 167, 102 Am. St. R. 34 (1903).
<P>General assembly has authority under this section to change and amend
proposed amendment in special session prior to submission of said proposed
amendment to the people.  In re Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 10 of
Forty-First Gen. Ass'y, 137 Colo. 491, 328 P.2d 103 (1958).
<P>Clerical errors do not invalidate proposed amendments.  Where a proposed
amendment to the constitution was introduced in the senate and before final
passage was amended by striking out certain words and inserting the word "and"
but the amendment did not materially change the meaning, and as it passed the
senate was transmitted to the house, and the house journal shows that no
amendment was made or offered in the house and that it was not returned to the
senate after its passage in the house, but when it was entered in full upon the
house journal, by mistake it was entered as it was originally introduced in the
senate, and the house journal itself shows that the difference between the
entries of the two houses was due to a clerical error, and it was enrolled and
signed by the presiding officers of both houses and published in the session
laws as it was passed, the constitutional provision requiring proposed
amendments to the constitution to be entered in full upon the journal of each
house was satisfied and it is not invalid because of said difference in the
journal entries of the two houses.  People ex rel. Elder v. Sours, 31 Colo.
369, 74 P. 167, 102 Am. St. R. 34 (1903).
<P>But measure that is itself invalid cannot be regarded as amendment.  A
measure which, while in form and to all indicated purposes is a statute,
contravenes the constitution is not to be regarded as an amendment to the
constitution but is itself unconstitutional.  People ex rel. Tate v. Prevost,
55 Colo. 199, 134 P. 129 (1913).
<P>Even grave emergencies cannot justify attempted amendment to the state
constitution by city charter, nor an amendment of a city charter by a simple
ordinance.  McNichols v. People ex rel. Cook, 95 Colo. 235, 35 P.2d 863 (1934).
<P>This section deemed sui generis and not in pari materia with art. V.  It
is not by the "legislative" article, but by the article entitled "amendments",
that the legality of the action of the general assembly in proposing amendments
to the constitution is to be tested.  This article is sui generis; it provides
for revising, altering, and amending the fundamental law of the state, and is
not in pari materia with those provisions of art. V, Colo. Const., prescribing
the method of enacting ordinary statutory laws.  People ex rel. Moore v.
Perkins, 56 Colo. 17, 137 P. 55, 1914D Ann. Cas. 1154 (1913).  See Nesbit v.
People, 19 Colo. 441, 36 P. 221 (1894).
<P>Applied in Russell v. Courier Printing &amp  Publishing Co., 43 Colo. 321, 95
P. 936 (1908); People ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Curtice, 50 Colo. 503, 117 P.
357 (1911); Speer v. People ex rel. Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912); In
re Interrogatories of Governor Regarding Sweepstakes Races Act, 196 Colo. 353,
585 P.2d 595 (1978).
<P>II. PUBLICATION.
<P>Publication requirement relates to newspapers, not session laws. The
publication for "four successive weeks", prescribed by the constitution,
relates to the publication required to be made in the newspapers and not to
that in the session laws.  Pearce v. People ex rel. Tate, 53 Colo. 399, 127 P.
224 (1912).
<P>"Of general circulation" is descriptive of character of newspaper.  It
must be one of general -- not special, or limited -- circulation.  In re House
Resolution No. 10, 50 Colo. 71, 114 P. 293 (1911).
<P>Publication to be obtained at reasonable cost to people.  True
construction of this section contemplates that publication of proposed
amendments shall be obtained at reasonable cost to the people, and flagrant
departure from that construction is in violation of sound public policy.
Oliver v. Wilder, 27 Colo. App. 337, 149 P. 275 (1915).
<P>Time for publication in session laws not specified.  Under this section,
it is not required, for the effectual submission to the people of a proposed
amendment to the constitution, that it should appear in the session laws for
any certain time, or that such publication should occur previous to the
election at which the amendment is to be submitted.  Pearce v. People ex rel.
Tate, 53 Colo. 399, 127 P. 224 (1912).
<P>III. SUBMISSION OF SEVERAL AMENDMENTS.
<P>Last clause of proviso is for protection of people and was not written in
the constitution for the benefit of the general assembly.  People ex rel. Tate
v. Prevost, 55 Colo. 199, 134 P. 129 (1913).
<P>Proviso applies only to express amendments.  The provision of this section
that amendments to not more than six articles of the constitution shall be
proposed at the same session of the general assembly, applies to express
amendments and not to implied or incidental amendments or modifications of
other articles of the constitution than the one expressly amended.  People ex
rel. Elder v. Sours, 31 Colo. 369, 74 P. 167, 102 Am. St. R. 34 (1903).
<P>Constitutional amendment may embrace more than one subject. If the
amendment embraces several subjects all of which are germane to the general
subject or purpose of the amendment, the several subjects need not be
separately submitted but the amendment may be submitted and voted upon as a
single proposition.  People ex rel. Elder v. Sours, 31 Colo. 369, 74 P. 167,
102 Am. St. R. 34 (1903); People v. Prevost, 55 Colo. 199, 134 P. 129 (1913).
<P>There is no limitation on the number of subjects that may be included in a
constitutional amendment.  City &amp  County of Denver v. Mewborn, 143 Colo. 407,
354 P.2d 155 (1960); Coopersmith v. City &amp  County of Denver, 156 Colo. 469, 399
P.2d 943 (1965).
<P>The inhibition against more than one subject in legislative enactments has
no application to constitutional or organic law.  City &amp  County of Denver v.
Mewborn, 143 Colo. 407, 354 P.2d 155 (1960);Coopersmith v. City &amp  County of
Denver, 156 Colo. 469, 399 P.2d 943 (1965).

<H1>ARTICLE XX Home Rule Cities and Towns</H1>
Section 1.  Incorporated. The municipal corporation known as the city of
Denver and all municipal corporations and that part of the quasi-municipal
corporation known as the county of Arapahoe, in the state of Colorado, included
within the exterior boundaries of the said city of Denver as the same shall be
bounded when this amendment takes effect, are hereby consolidated and are
hereby declared to be a single body politic and corporate, by the name of the
"City and County of Denver". By that name said corporation shall have perpetual
succession, and shall own, possess, and hold all property, real and personal,
theretofore owned, possessed, or held by the said city of Denver and by such

assume, manage, and dispose of all trusts in any way connected therewith; shall
succeed to all the rights and liabilities, and shall acquire all benefits and
shall assume and pay all bonds, obligations, and indebtedness of said city of
Denver and of said included municipal corporations and of the county of
Arapahoe; by that name may sue and defend, plead and be impleaded, in all
courts and places, and in all matters and proceedings; may have and use a
common seal and alter the same at pleasure; may purchase, receive, hold, and
enjoy or sell and dispose of, real and personal property; may receive bequests,
gifts, and donations of all kinds of property, in fee simple, or in trust for

lease, add to, maintain, conduct, and operate water works, light plants, power
plants, transportation systems, heating plants, and any other public utilities
or works or ways local in use and extent, in whole or in part, and everything
required therefore, for the use of said city and county and the inhabitants

relation or connection with either, that may exist and which said city and
county may desire to purchase, in whole or in part, the same or any part
thereof may be purchased by said city and county which may enforce such
purchase by proceedings at law as in taking land for public use by right of
eminent domain, and shall have the power to issue bonds upon the vote of the
taxpaying electors, at any special or general election, in any amount necessary
to carry out any of said powers or purposes, as may by the charter be provided.
<P>The provisions of section 3 of article XIV of this constitution and the
general annexation and consolidation statutes of the state relating to counties
shall apply to the city and county of Denver. Any contiguous town, city, or
territory hereafter annexed to or consolidated with the city and county of

<P>The city and county of Denver shall alone always constitute one judicial
district of the state.
<P>(The preceding three paragraphs were amended by the People, November 5,

<P>No annexation or consolidation proceeding shall be initiated after the
effective date of this amendment pursuant to the general annexation and

counties, respectively, and three elected officials of the city and county of
Denver to be chosen by the mayor.  The commissioners from each of the said
counties shall be appointed by resolution of their respective boards.
<P>No land located in any county other than Adams, Arapahoe, or Jefferson
counties shall be annexed to or consolidated with the city and county of Denver
unless such annexation or consolidation is approved by the unanimous vote of
all the members of the board of county commissioners of the county in which
such land is located.
<P>Any territory attached to the city and county of Denver or the city of
Lakewood or the city of Aurora during the period extending from April 1, 1974,

review, shall be detached therefrom on July 1, 1975, unless any such annexation
is ratified by the boundary control commission on or before July 1, 1975.
<P>Nothing in this amendment shall be construed as prohibiting the entry of
any final judgment in any annexation judicial review proceeding pending on
April 1, 1974, declaring any annexation by the city and county of Denver to be
invalid.
<P>The boundary control commission shall have the power at any time by four
concurring votes to detach all or any portion of any territory validly annexed

adopted by the commission by majority vote.  Each commissioner shall have one
vote, including the commissioner who acts as the chairman of the commission.
All procedural rules adopted by the commission shall be filed with the

<H1>ARTICLE XIX Amendments</H1>
Section 1.  Constitutional convention - how called. The general assembly
may at any time by a vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house,
recommend to the electors of the state, to vote at the next general election
for or against a convention to revise, alter and amend this constitution; and
if a majority of those voting on the question shall declare in favor of such
convention, the general assembly shall, at its next session, provide for the
calling thereof.  The number of members of the convention shall be twice that
of the senate and they shall be elected in the same manner, at the same places,
and in the same districts.  The general assembly shall, in the act calling the
convention, designate the day, hour and place of its meeting; fix the pay of
its members and officers, and provide for the payment of the same, together
with the necessary expenses of the convention.  Before proceeding, the members
shall take an oath to support the constitution of the United States, and of the
state of Colorado, and to faithfully discharge their duties as members of the
convention.  The qualifications of members shall be the same as of members of
the senate; and vacancies occurring shall be filled in the manner provided for
filling vacancies in the general assembly.  Said convention shall meet within
three months after such election and prepare such revisions, alterations or
amendments to the constitution as may be deemed necessary; which shall be
submitted to the electors for their ratification or rejection at an election
appointed by the convention for that purpose, not less than two nor more than
six months after adjournment thereof; and unless so submitted and approved by a
majority of the electors voting at the election, no such revision, alteration
or amendment shall take effect.

Section 2.  Officers. The officers of the city and county of Denver shall
be such as by appointment or election may be provided for by the charter; and
the jurisdiction, term of office, duties and qualifications of all such
officers shall be such as in the charter may be provided; but the charter shall
designate the officers who shall, respectively, perform the acts and duties
required of county officers to be done by the constitution or by the general
law, as far as applicable.  If any officer of said city and county of Denver
shall receive any compensation whatever, he or she shall receive the same as a
stated salary, the amount of which shall be fixed by the charter, or, in the
case of officers not in the classified civil service, by ordinance within
limits fixed by the charter, and paid out of the treasury of the city and
county of Denver in equal monthly payments; provided, however, no elected
officer shall receive any increase or decrease in compensation under any
ordinance passed during the term for which he was elected.

The people have sovereign capacity to make, alter or change their constitution

conflict with the federal constitution, and ought to be enforced.  The supreme
court does not agree with decisions holding this section inoperative and void.

enforce this section, which is a part of the constitution, according to its
clear, unmistakable and unquestionable meaning.  People ex rel.  Attorney Gen.

<P>The warrant of authority given to the people of the city and county of
Denver to merely designate the agency by which governmental duties therein
shall be discharged is not obnoxious to any provision of the enabling act or of
the federal constitution, and therefore it may be lawfully done.  People ex
rel. Attorney Gen. v. Curtice, 50 Colo. 503, 117 P. 357 (1911), appeal
dismissed for want of jurisdiction sub nom. Cassiday v. Colorado, 223 U.S. 707,

681 (1946).
<P>Officers of Denver shall be as provided in the charter.  People ex rel.
McQuaid v. Pickens, 91 Colo. 109, 12 P.2d 349 (1932).
<P>Section does not set aside governmental duties and functions as to state
and county affairs.  This section not only does not set aside governmental
duties and functions as to state and county affairs in the city and county of
Denver, it does not even pretend to do so, and by no stretch of the imagination
can it be fairly held to do so.  People ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Curtice, 50
Colo. 503, 117 P. 357 (1911), appeal dismissed for want of jurisdiction sub
nom. Cassiday v. Colorado, 223 U.S. 707, 32 S. Ct. 518, 56 L. Ed. 622 (1911);
Hilts v. Markey, 52 Colo. 382, 122 P. 394 (1912).
<P>But recognizes that such duties exist and must be discharged, and
forthwith proceeds to provide and declare by whom they shall be performed.

P.2d 681 (1946).
<P>Such duties are absolutely fixed.  These duties are fixed, absolutely
fixed, until changed by the same power which created them.  People ex rel.
Attorney Gen. v. Curtice, 50 Colo. 503, 117 P. 357, appeal dismissed for want
of jurisdiction sub nom.  Cassiday v. Colorado, 223 U.S. 707, 32 S. Ct. 518, 56

<P>This article places duty of discharging local responsibilities on local
officers.  Four-County Metro. Capital Imp. Dist. v. Board of County Comm'rs,
149 Colo. 284, 369 P.2d 67 (1962).
<P>This section vests in Denver exclusive control over public officers, their
powers and duties.  International Bhd. of Police Officers Local 127 v. City &amp
County of Denver, 185 Colo. 50, 521 P.2d 916 (1974).
<P>Duties to be performed by one set of officers.  Under the provisions of
this section it was intended ultimately, so far as practicable, that all the
powers and duties pertaining to former county offices, as well as the powers
and duties of municipal offices, should be performed by one set of officers
each drawing one salary; the economy which could be thus secured was one of the
chief factors in causing the adoption of this amendment.  Aichele v. City &amp
County of Denver, 52 Colo. 183, 120 P. 149 (1911).
<P>The terms "officer" and "employee" are not interchangeable, and the two
are to be distinguished.  City &amp  County of Denver v. McNichols, 129 Colo. 251,
268 P.2d 1026 (1954).  See Evert v. Ouren, 37 Colo. App. 402, 549 P.2d 791
(1976).
<P>"County officers".  The words "county officers" in requiring that every
charter shall designate the officers who shall "perform the acts and duties
required of county officers to be done by the constitution or by the general
law, as far as applicable", mean "county officers" that are such by reason of
the provisions of art. XIV, Colo. Const., and none other.  Dixon v. People ex
rel. Elliott, 53 Colo. 527, 127 P. 930 (1912).
<P>Employees of Denver department of social services not "officers" of Denver
for the purposes of this section.  Evert v. Ouren, 37 Colo. App. 402, 549 P.2d
791 (1976).
<P>Salaries of state personnel system officers.  This section provides that
the officers in the classified state personnel system of the city shall receive
their compensation as a stated salary, the amount of which shall be fixed by
the charter.  Derby v. Police Pension &amp  Relief Bd., 159 Colo. 468, 412 P.2d 897
(1966).
<P>Applied in People ex rel. Parish v. Adams, 31 Colo. 476, 73 P. 866 (1903);

v. City &amp  County of Denver, 39 Colo. App. 421, 569 P.2d 329 (1977).
<P>II. CITY AND COUNTY OFFICERS.
<P>A. In General.
<P>Charter to designate officers to perform duties of county officers.  This
section requires that every charter designate the officers who shall perform
the acts and duties required of county officers to be done by the constitution
or by the general law, as far as applicable.  McMurray v. Wright, 19 Colo. App.
17, 73 P. 257 (1893); McNichnols v. City &amp  County of Denver, 109 Colo. 269, 124
P.2d 601 (1942).  See Lail v. City &amp  County of Denver, 88 Colo. 362, 297 P. 512
(1931).
<P>By this article the people of Denver were given the right to name their
own officers and to determine their selection, qualifications and tenure,
subject only to the provision that acts and duties required by the constitution
and statutory law of county officers be carried out by some officer designated
by the charter.  City &amp  County of Denver v. Rinker, 148 Colo. 441, 366 P.2d 548
(1961); Meller v. Municipal Court, 152 Colo. 130, 380 P.2d 668 (1963).
<P>Power to designate extends to statutory and constitutional officers.
Power to designate county officers by charter is not limited to those created
by the constitution, but includes those created by the general assembly.
People ex rel. Fairall v. Sabin, 75 Colo. 545, 227 P. 565 (1924).
<P>The power to designate by charter, given by this article, is not limited
to county offices created by  8 of art. XIV, Colo. Const., and does include the
office of public trustee; it includes county offices to be created by the
general assembly, to whom the necessary power is given by section 12 of that
article.  People ex rel. Fairall v. Sabin, 75 Colo. 545, 227 P. 565 (1924).
<P>Mayor may be empowered to make designations.  Under this section providing
charters shall designate officials to perform the duties of county officers,
the mayor may be empowered to make the designations.  People ex rel. Fairall v.
Sabin, 75 Colo. 545, 227 P. 565 (1924).
<P>Such designation is not legislative act. The designation of officers under
the provisions of a city charter pursuant to this section is not a legislative
act.  People ex rel. Fairall v. Sabin, 75 Colo. 545, 227 P. 565 (1924).
<P>Power not delegated to city and county of Denver to create any county
office, but to designate only the officers holding the offices which it had the
right to create, who should respectively perform the acts and duties required
of county officers to be done by the constitution and general laws.  Thrush v.
People ex rel. Elliott, 53 Colo. 544, 127 P. 937 (1912).
<P>Charter cannot change duties of officers relating to state and county
affairs.  The people of the city and county of Denver have not been given, and
do not have, the power by charter to in any way change the duties of
governmental officers, so far as they relate to state and county affairs.
People ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Curtice, 50 Colo. 503, 117 P. 357 (1911),
appeal dismissed for want of jurisdiction sub nom. Cassiday v. Colorado, 223
U.S. 707, 32 S. Ct. 518, 56 L. Ed. 662 (1911).
<P>In prescribing the "jurisdiction, term of office, duties, and
qualifications of all such officers", this section did not mean that the
charter convention could so prescribe in cases where it would operate to hinder
the performance of the acts and duties required of county officers to be done
by the constitution or by the general law, as far as applicable to the changed
conditions of the new municipality.  People ex rel. Miller v. Johnson, 34 Colo.
143, 86 P. 233 (1905).
<P>A consolidation of the office of district attorney, a state office, and of
attorney of the city and county, a transitional local office established by
section 3 of this article, was not a change which could be perpetuated by the
people of Denver in their charter as contemplated by this article, because by
this section their authority is limited to providing for city and county
offices.  Lindsley v. City &amp  County of Denver, 64 Colo. 444, 172 P. 707 (1918).
<P>General assembly retains exclusive control of such offices.  All that this
article purports to do relative to the county offices is to provide that the
people of the city and county of Denver, through their charter, shall designate
the agencies, which are to discharge the respective duties and functions which
pertain to them.  There is no warrant or authority in the article to the people
of the city and county of Denver to alter, change or dispense with such acts
and duties.  They remain, as before, subject to the constitution and general
laws, and are exclusively under the control of the general assembly.  People ex
rel. Attorney Gen. v. Curtice, 50 Colo. 503, 117 P. 357, appeal dismissed for
want of jurisdiction sub nom.  Cassiday v. Colorado, 223 U.S. 707, 32 S. Ct.
518, 56 L. Ed. 662 (1911); Reed v. Blakley, 115 Colo. 559, 176 P.2d 681 (1946).
<P>The duties of judges of the district court, county judges, district
attorneys, justices of the peace, and, generally, of county officers, are
mainly governmental; and, so far as they are governmental, they may not be
controlled by other than state agencies without undermining the very foundation
of our government.  People ex rel. Elder v. Sours, 31 Colo. 369, 74 P. 167, 102
Am. St. R. 34 (1903).
<P>Thus abolishing county offices did not abolish duties pertaining to them.
This article, by the abolishment of county offices as such, did not abolish the
duties pertaining to them, but they continued and it became the duty of someone
to continue to perform all such duties just the same as it had been prior to
the adoption of the article.  Arnold v. Hilts, 52 Colo. 391, 121 P. 753, 1913E
Ann. Cas. 724 (1912).
<P>Upon the adoption of this article and the charter the office of public
trustee of Arapahoe county ceased to exist within the limits of the
consolidated corporation, but there came into existence the office of public
trustee of the city and county of Denver.  Lail v. City &amp  County of Denver, 88
Colo. 362, 297 P.512 (1931).
<P>Statutory duties of public trustee cannot be abolished by charter of the
city and county of Denver either expressly or by a failure to obey the mandate
of the constitution.  Lail v. City &amp  County of Denver, 88 Colo. 362, 297 P. 512
(1931).
<P>Denver is subject to general constitutional provisions relating to
counties.  By this section the new corporation of Denver is made subject to the
general provisions of art. XIV, Colo. Const., providing for counties and county
officers, and of the state legislation enacted in pursuance of it; so that,
although a city, it is a county equally with any other legal subdivision of the
state to which the constitution and statutes have given the name of county.
McMurray v. Wright, 19 Colo. App. 17, 73 P. 257 (1903).
<P>B. Particular Officers.
<P>County judges are not included as "county officers".  Dixon v. People ex
rel. Elliott, 53 Colo. 527, 127 P. 930 (1912).
<P>Under the express authority of this section county judges may exercise not
only state jurisdiction but also municipal jurisdiction, if provided by charter
and ordinance.  Blackman v. County Court, 169 Colo. 345, 455 P.2d 885 (1969).
<P>Sheriff.  The office of sheriff is a county office and not a state office;
thus, the method of selection and tenure of the officer designated to carry out
the duties of the position became the concern of the people of Denver by
authority expressly granted to them by all of the people of the state under
this article even though those officers might be required to perform duties
which were of statewide concern such as the duties imposed by constitution upon
the county clerk and recorder, county sheriff, treasurer or assessor.  City &amp
County of Denver v. Rinker, 148 Colo. 441, 366 P.2d 548 (1961).
<P>Policemen.  Under charter provisions of the city and county of Denver,
policemen are officers, and their salaries being fixed by the charter under
constitutional mandate cannot be lawfully reduced by ordinance.  McNichols v.
People ex rel. Cook, 95 Colo. 235, 35 P.2d 863 (1934).
<P>Members of fire department are also officers.  See McNichols v. People ex
rel. Cook, 95 Colo. 235, 35 P.2d 863 (1934); Rogers v. City &amp  County of Denver,
121 Colo. 484, 217 P.2d 865 (1950).
<P>Mayor has sole power to appoint public trustee.  Under the existing
provisions of the charter of Denver, the mayor has the sole power to appoint
the public trustee.  People ex rel. Fairall v. Sabin, 75 Colo. 545, 227 P. 565
(1924).
<P>But may not consolidate such office with other offices.  The charter of
the city and county of Denver did not consolidate the office of public trustee
with that of the clerk and recorder and ex officio clerk; the mayor has no
power to make such consolidation, and until the enactment of a charter
provision authorizing a consolidation, the office of public trustee will
continue to be a separate office.  Lail v. City &amp  County of Denver, 88 Colo.
362, 297 P. 512 (1931).
<P>Only manager of safety and excise may issue licenses for sale of
intoxicating liquors.  The agency through which Denver shall perform and
discharge the duty of licensing dispensers of intoxicating liquors is within
the city and county's keeping, through appropriate charter enactment.  Since
Denver has designated an office or agency called manager of safety and excise,
to the occupant of which it has assigned all licensing authority, only that
official, and not the city council, has authority to issue, or refuse to grant,
licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors in the city and county of Denver,
and a statute passed by the general assembly authorizing the council of the
city and county of Denver to issue licenses violates this section.  Reed v.
Blakley, 115 Colo. 559, 176 P.2d 681 (1946).

Section 10.  Severability of constitutional provisions. If any provision
of any section of any article in this constitution is found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, the remaining provisions are
valid unless the court holds that the valid provisions are so essentially and
inseparably connected with, and so dependent upon, the void provision that it
cannot be presumed the enactment of the valid provisions would have occurred
without the void one; or unless the court determines that the valid provisions,
standing alone, are incomplete and not capable of being executed.
<P>As enacted November 3, 1992 -- Effective upon proclamation of the
Governor, January 14, 1993. (For the text of the amendment and the votes cast
thereon, see L. 92, p. 2314 and L. 93, p. 2156.)

Section 3.  Transfer of government. Immediately upon the canvass of the
vote showing the adoption of this amendment, it shall be the duty of the
governor of the state to issue his proclamation accordingly, and thereupon the
city of Denver, and all municipal corporations and that part of the county of
Arapahoe within the boundaries of said city, shall merge into the city and
county of Denver, and the terms of office of all officers of the city of Denver
and of all included municipalities and of the county of Arapahoe shall
terminate; except, that the then mayor, auditor, engineer, council (which shall
perform the duties of a board of county commissioners), police magistrate,
chief of police and boards, of the city of Denver shall become, respectively,
said officers of the city and county of Denver, and said engineer shall be ex
officio surveyor and said chief of police shall be ex officio sheriff of the
city and county of Denver; and the then clerk and ex officio recorder,
treasurer, assessor and coroner of the county of Arapahoe, and the justices of
the peace and constables holding office within the city of Denver, shall
become, respectively, said officers of the city and county of Denver, and the
district attorney shall also be ex officio attorney of the city and county of
Denver.  The foregoing officers shall hold the said offices as above specified
only until their successors are duly elected and qualified as herein provided
for; except that the then district judges, county judge and district attorney
shall serve their full terms, respectively, for which elected.  The police and
firemen of the city of Denver, except the chief of police as such, shall
continue severally as the police and firemen of the city and county of Denver
until they are severally discharged under such civil service regulations as
shall be provided by the charter; and every charter shall provide that the
department of fire and police and the department of public utilities and works
shall be under such civil service regulations as in said charter shall be
provided.

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
I.  General Consideration.
<P>II.  Particular Offices and Officers.
<P>I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Cross reference.  As to the appointment of officers of the city and county
of Denver to perform the acts and duties required of county officers, see  2 of
this article.
<P>C.J.S.  See 62 C.J.S., Municipal Corporations,   72-74.
<P>Purpose of section.  The manifest purpose of this section was to remedy
the administration of the functions of the city and county governments in the
same territory by two sets of officers by immediately setting in operation a
temporary or provisional government which the people of the city and county
could perpetuate in their charter.  Lindsley v. City &amp  County of Denver, 64
Colo. 444, 172 P. 707 (1918).
<P>This section did away with all county offices and officers as such.  This
section by express provision, terminated, upon its adoption, the terms of
office of all officers of the then city of Denver, of the included
municipalities and of the old county of Arapahoe, a portion of which, together
with the city of Denver and included municipalities, were then merged into the
consolidated municipality of the city and county of Denver.  It in effect did
away with all county officers and offices, purely as such, in the consolidated
territory, and provided a single set of officers or agencies to perform, in the
new municipality, all duties of a local nature and all duties pertaining to
governmental, state and county affairs as well.  Since the adoption of the
article, and the formation of the city and county of Denver, there has never
been, within that territory, a county office or county officer, as such. People
ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Curtice, 50 Colo. 503, 117 P. 357, appeal dismissed
for want of jurisdiction, 223 U.S. 707, 32 S. Ct. 518, 56 L. Ed. 622 (1911).
<P>This section in effect did away with all county officers and offices
purely as such.  In the territory comprising the city and county of Denver no
county office or county officer, as in other counties of the state, exists.
This being the case and this article of the constitution being a grant of
power, it follows that the only power granted to the city and county of Denver
pertaining to the duties of county officers under the constitution and general
laws was to designate the officers holding the offices properly created by the
charter who should perform the acts and duties required of county officers.
Thrush v. People ex rel. Elliott, 53 Colo. 544, 127 P. 937 (1912).
<P>All county officers and offices as such were abolished subject only to the
provisions that the duties and acts required of them by the constitution or by
general law should be carried out by some officer so designated by the charter.
City &amp  County of Denver v. Rinker, 148 Colo. 441, 366 P.2d 548 (1961); Meller
v. Municipal Court, 152 Colo. 130, 380 P.2d 668 (1963).
<P>It was intended to establish a temporary or provisional government in
which it is provided that governmental, as well as all municipal powers and
duties referred to, should be assumed and discharged by one set of officers;
for instance, it provides that the council shall perform the duties of the
board of county commissioners.  Aichele v. City &amp  County of Denver, 52 Colo.
183, 120 P. 149 (1911).
<P>This section made certain existing officers of the former city and its
boards officers and boards of the new municipality, to hold until their
successors were elected and qualified.  Hallett v. City &amp  County of Denver, 46
Colo. 487, 104 P. 1038 (1909).
<P>The mayor and the persons composing the council of the city of Denver
became, by virtue of this provision, the mayor and council of the city and
county of Denver.  The mayor and members of the council, as well as all other
officers of the new corporation, derive their title to office solely from the
article; they have therefore such powers as it expressly confers, or are
legitimately deducible from it and consistent with it, and no other.  The
council is clothed with all the powers of a board of county commissioners.
McMurray v. Wright, 19 Colo. App. 17, 73 P. 257 (1903).
<P>To perform duties of county officers until new charter adopted.  Without
this section there would have been no one to perform the duties of county
officers until the adoption of a new charter.  This is apparent for the reason
that the old county of Arapahoe had been abolished, its officers as such had
ceased to exist, and it was necessary to provide someone to perform the duties
of county officers under the constitution and general laws until the procedure
provided for in the article had been carried into effect.  Thrush v. People ex
rel. Elliott, 53 Colo. 544, 127 P. 937 (1912).
<P>Complete county and city government is furnished to corporation.  The
amendment provides it with a mayor, council and other city officers; and with a
body having the authority of a board of county commissioners, a sheriff, clerk,
recorder, county judge and all other county officers.  The duties of city
officers are prescribed by the charter, and the duties of county officers by
the general laws of the state.  McMurray v. Wright, 19 Colo. App. 17, 73 P. 257
(1903).
<P>And in the hands of the same persons.  And the fact that the city
government and the county government are in the hands of the same persons, is
immaterial.  The distinction between the functions pertaining to a city
government and those pertaining to a county government, is not, and does not
purport to be, affected by this article.  McMurray v. Wright, 19 Colo. App. 17,
73 P. 257 (1903).
<P>This section must be construed with section 2 of this article, which
provides that the officers of the city and county of Denver shall be such as by
appointment or election may be provided for by charter.  So construed, this
section did not require that the district attorney should perform the duties of
attorney until an attorney was "elected" by the people, but that the district
attorney should perform the duties of attorney for the city and county until an
attorney was "selected" in such manner as the charter might provide. People v.
Lindsley, 37 Colo. 476, 86 P. 352 (1906).
<P>Applied in Bratton v. Dice, 93 Colo. 593, 27 P.2d 1028 (1933); Hawkins v.
Hunt, 113 Colo. 468, 160 P.2d 357 (1945); Cain v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 159 Colo.
360, 411 P.2d 778 (1966).
<P>II. PARTICULAR OFFICES AND OFFICERS.
<P>Office of county assessor terminated.  By  the formation of the city and
county of Denver, the office of county assessor immediately terminated.  An
incumbent maintained in office by a decision of the supreme court which was
subsequently overruled was at best no more than a de facto official.  Arnold v.
Hilts, 61 Colo. 8, 155 P. 316 (1916).
<P>As did office of county commissioner.  By the plain, unambiguous language
of this section the terms of office of county commissioners of Arapahoe county
terminated immediately upon the canvass of the vote showing the adoption of
this article and the proclamation of the governor to that effect. Uzzell v.
Anderson, 38 Colo. 32, 89 P. 785 (1906).
<P>And office of city clerk.  Considering the purposes of this article,
including the phraseology of this section, it is clear the intent was, during
the ad interim period, that the office of city clerk as such should be
abolished just the same as the offices of county commissioners were, and that
the duties pertaining to this office should be transferred and attached to the
office of clerk and recorder for the city and county of Denver the same as
those of county commissioners were to the city council.  Aichele v. City &amp
County of Denver, 52 Colo. 183, 120 P. 149 (1911).
<P>But county clerk not entitled to salary as city clerk, during the period
intervening between the adoption of the article, and the going into operation
of the new charter adopted by the city, pursuant to its provisions.  Aichele v.
City &amp  County of Denver, 52 Colo. 183, 120 P. 149 (1911).
<P>County office of sheriff terminated.  This section terminated the county
office of sheriff in Denver and, together with the enabling provisions of
article XX, reposed in the people of Denver for later decision by adoption of
their charter whether to create the office of sheriff.  International Bhd. of
Police Officers Local 127 v. City &amp  County of Denver, 185 Colo. 50, 521 P.2d
916 (1974).
<P>And replaced by police department.  In lieu of office of sheriff, Denver
established a police department by charter.  International Bhd. of Police
Officers Local 127 v. City &amp  County of Denver, 185 Colo. 50, 521 P.2d 916
(1974).
<P>Treasurer of city and county of Denver, though performing duties of county
treasurer, was not entitled to a salary in the latter capacity.  Elder v. City
&amp  County of Denver, 53 Colo. 496, 127 P. 949 (1912).
<P>Fire and police board.  Upon the adoption of this article, the fire and
police board of the city of Denver became the fire and police board of the city
and county of Denver until their successors were elected and qualified as
should be provided in the charter, and the members thereof held their offices
by virtue of the amendment to the constitution and not by appointment of the
governor and the governor had no power to remove them from office and appoint
their successors.  People ex rel. Parish v. Adams, 31 Colo. 476, 73 P. 866
(1903).
<P>District attorney and attorney of city and county of Denver.  The language
of the provision, "and the district attorney shall also be ex officio attorney
of the city and county", plainly imports that plaintiff should hold two
offices, namely, the office of district attorney under state government, and
the office of attorney of the city and county under local government, which
were separate and distinct offices, the tenures of which were different,
terminating at different times and for different causes.  Lindsley v. City &amp
County of Denver, 64 Colo. 444, 172 P. 707 (1918).
<P>As district attorney, duties and power were defined by the state
constitution and general laws; as attorney for the city and county, by the city
charter and ordinances.  His responsibilities and duties in the two offices
were not only separate and distinct, but of an entirely different character,
having no possible relation to or connection with each other.  In such
circumstances, under all the authorities, the words, "and the district attorney
shall also be ex officio attorney of the city and county of Denver", mean that
plaintiff held separate and distinct offices.  Lindsley v. City &amp  County of
Denver, 64 Colo. 444, 172 P. 707 (1918).
<P>Deputy sheriffs and jailors.  The people of Denver have the power under
this article to include deputy sheriffs and jailors in a career service system.
City &amp  County of Denver v. Rinker, 148 Colo. 441, 366 P.2d 548 (1961).
<P>Departmental rules and directives of manager of safety govern deputy
sheriff's duties in Denver.  International Bhd. of Police Officers Local 127 v.
City &amp  County of Denver, 185 Colo. 50, 521 P.2d 916 (1974).
<P>No general police power in Denver deputy sheriffs.  There is no authority,
constitutional or statutory, granting to deputy sheriffs of the city and county
of Denver the same general police powers given sheriffs and their deputies in
other counties.  International Bhd. of Police Officers Local 127 v. City &amp
County of Denver, 185 Colo. 50, 521 P.2d 916 (1974).

Section 9.  Limited gaming permitted. (1)  Any provisions of section 2 of
this article XVIII or any other provisions of this constitution to the contrary
notwithstanding, limited gaming in the City of Central, the City of Black Hawk,
and the City of Cripple Creek shall be lawful as of October 1, 1991.
<P>(2)  The administration and regulation of this section 9 shall be under an
appointed limited gaming control commission, referred to in this section 9 as
the commission; said commission to be created under such official or department
of government of the state of Colorado as the general assembly shall provide by
May 1, 1991.  Such official or the director of the department of government
shall appoint the commission by July 1, 1991.  The commission shall promulgate
all necessary rules and regulations relating to the licensing of limited gaming
by October 1, 1991, in the manner authorized by statute for the promulgation of
administrative rules and regulations.  Such rules and regulations shall include
the necessary defining of terms that are not otherwise defined.
<P>(3)  Limited gaming shall be subject to the following:
<P>(a)  Limited gaming shall take place only in the existing Colorado cities
of: the City of Central, county of Gilpin, the City of Black Hawk, county of
Gilpin, and the City of Cripple Creek, county of Teller.  Such limited gaming
shall be further confined to the commercial districts of said cities as said
districts are respectively defined in the city ordinances adopted by: the City
of Central on October 7, 1981, the City of Black Hawk on May 4, 1978, and the
City of Cripple Creek on December 3, 1973.
<P>(b)  Limited gaming shall only be conducted in structures which conform,
as determined by the respective municipal governing bodies, to the
architectural styles and designs that were common to the areas prior to World
War I and which conform to the requirements of applicable respective city
ordinances, regardless of the age of said structures.
<P>(c)  No more than thirty-five percent of the square footage of any
building and no more than fifty percent of any one floor of such building, may
be used for limited gaming.
<P>(d)  Limited gaming operations shall be prohibited between the hours of
2:00 o'clock a.m. and 8:00 o'clock a.m.
<P>(e)  Limited gaming may occur in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic
beverages.
<P>(4)  As certain terms are used in regards to limited gaming:
<P>(a)  "Adjusted gross proceeds" means the total amount of all wagers made
by players on limited gaming less all payments to players; said payments to
players being deemed to include all payments of cash premiums, merchandise,
tokens, redeemable game credits, or any other thing of value.
<P>(b)  "Limited gaming" means the use of slot machines and the card games of
blackjack and poker, each game having a maximum single bet of five dollars.
<P>(c)  "Slot machine" means any mechanical, electrical, video, electronic,
or other device, contrivance, or machine which, after insertion of a coin,
token, or similar object, or upon payment of any required consideration
whatsoever by a player, is available to be played or operated, and which,
whether by reason of the skill of the player or application of the element of
chance, or both, may deliver or entitle the player operating the machine to
receive cash premiums, merchandise, tokens, redeemable game credits, or any
other thing of value other than unredeemable free games, whether the payoff is
made automatically from the machines or in any other manner.
<P>(5) (a)  Up to a maximum of forty percent of the adjusted gross proceeds
of limited gaming shall be paid by each licensee, in addition to any applicable
license fees, for the privilege of conducting limited gaming.  Such percentage
shall be established annually by the commission according to the criteria
established by the general assembly in the implementing legislation to be
enacted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection (5). Such payments shall
be made into a limited gaming fund that is hereby created in the state
treasury.
<P>(b) (I)  From the moneys in the limited gaming fund, the state treasurer
is hereby authorized to pay all ongoing expenses of the commission and any
other state agency, related to the administration of this section 9.  Such
payment shall be made upon proper presentation of a voucher prepared by the
commission in accordance with statutes governing payments of liabilities
incurred on behalf of the state.  Such payment shall not be conditioned on any
appropriation by the general assembly.
<P>(II)  At the end of each state fiscal year, the state treasurer shall
distribute the balance remaining in the limited gaming fund, except for an
amount equal to all expenses of the administration of this section 9 for the
preceding two-month period, according to the following guidelines: fifty
percent shall be transferred to the state general fund or such other fund as
the general assembly shall provide; twenty-eight percent shall be transferred
to the state historical fund, which fund is hereby created in the state
treasury; twelve percent shall be distributed to the governing bodies of Gilpin
county and Teller county in proportion to the gaming revenues generated in each
county; the remaining ten percent shall be distributed to the governing bodies
of the cities of: the City of Central, the City of Black Hawk, and the City of
Cripple Creek in proportion to the gaming revenues generated in each respective
city.
<P>(III)  Of the moneys in the state historical fund, from which the state
treasurer shall also make annual distributions, twenty percent shall be used
for the preservation and restoration of the cities of: the City of Central, the
City of Black Hawk, and the City of Cripple Creek, and such moneys shall be
distributed, to the governing bodies of the respective cities, according to the
proportion of the gaming revenues generated in each respective city. The
remaining eighty percent in the state historical fund shall be used for the
historic preservation and restoration of historical sites and municipalities
throughout the state in a manner to be determined by the general assembly.
<P>(c)  The general assembly shall enact, amend, or repeal such laws as are
necessary to implement the provisions of this section 9, by May 1, 1991.
<P>(d)  The general assembly shall make a general fund appropriation to the
limited gaming fund, in the form of a loan, to provide the state treasurer
sufficient funds to cover any and all organizational and administrative
expenses in connection with this section 9, to be effective no later than July
1, 1991.  This loan shall be repaid to the general fund by and at the
discretion of the state treasurer at the end of any fiscal year, out of the
adjusted gross proceeds paid into the limited gaming fund, not sooner than July
1, 1992 and such repayment may be extended to not later than July 1, 1997.  Any
repayment shall be made before the state treasurer makes any distributions
under subparagraph (II) of paragraph (b) of this subsection (5).
<P>(e)  The general assembly shall enact provisions for the special licensing
of qualifying nonprofit charitable organizations desiring to periodically host
charitable gaming activities in licensed gaming establishments.
<P>(f)  If any provision of this section 9 is held invalid, the remainder of
this section 9 shall remain unimpaired.
<P>(6)  Local vote on legality of limited gaming - election required.
(a)  Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this subsection (6), limited gaming
shall not be lawful within any city, town, or unincorporated portion of a
county which has been granted constitutional authority for limited gaming
within its boundaries unless first approved by an affirmative vote of a
majority of the electors of such city, town, or county voting thereon.  The
question shall first be submitted to the electors at a general, regular, or
special election held within thirteen months after the effective date of the
amendment which first adds such city, county, or town to those authorized for
limited gaming pursuant to this constitution; and said election shall be
conducted pursuant to applicable state or local government election laws.
<P>(b)  If approval of limited gaming is not obtained when the question is
first submitted to the electors, the question may be submitted at subsequent
elections held in accordance with paragraph (d) of this subsection (6); except
that, once approval is obtained, limited gaming shall thereafter be lawful
within the said city, town, or unincorporated portion of a county so long as
the city, town, or county remains among those with constitutional authority for
limited gaming within their boundaries.
<P>(c)  Nothing contained in this subsection (6) shall be construed to limit
the ability of a city, town, or county to regulate the conduct of limited
gaming as otherwise authorized by statute or by this constitution.
<P>(d) (I)  The question submitted to the electors at any election held
pursuant to this subsection (6) shall be phrased in substantially the following
form:  "Shall limited gaming be lawful within           ?"
<P>(II)  The failure to acquire approval of limited gaming in the
unincorporated portion of a county shall not prevent lawful limited gaming
within a city or town located in such county where such approval is acquired in
a city or town election, and failure to acquire such approval in a city or town
election shall not prevent lawful limited gaming within the unincorporated area
of the county in which such city or town is located where such approval is
acquired in an election in the unincorporated area of a county.
<P>(III)  If approval of limited gaming is not acquired when the question is
first submitted in accordance with this subsection (6), the question may be
submitted at subsequent elections so long as at least four years have elapsed
since any previous election at which the question was submitted.
<P>(e)  Nothing contained in this subsection (6) shall be construed to affect
the authority granted upon the initial adoption of this section at the 1990
general election, or the conduct and regulation of gaming on Indian
reservations pursuant to federal law.
<P>(f)  For purposes of this subsection (6), a "city, town, or county"
includes all land and buildings located within, or owned and controlled by,
such city, town, or county or any political subdivision thereof.  "City, town,
or county" also includes the city and county of Denver.
<P>Enacted by the People November 6, 1990 -- Effective upon proclamation of
the Governor, January 3, 1991. (For the text of the initiated measure and the
votes cast thereon, see L. 91, p. 2037.); (6) enacted November 3, 1992 --
Effective upon proclamation of the Governor, January 14, 1993. (For the text of
the amendment and the votes cast thereon, see L. 92, p. 2313 and L. 93, p.
2156.)
<P>Section 9a.  U.S. senators and representatives - limitation on terms.
(1)  In order to broaden the opportunities for public service and to assure
that members of the United States Congress from Colorado are representative of
and responsive to Colorado citizens, no United States Senator from Colorado
shall serve more than two consecutive terms in the United States Senate, and no
United States Representative from Colorado shall serve more than six
consecutive terms in the United States House of Representatives.  This
limitation on the number of terms shall apply to terms of office beginning on
or after January 1, 1991.  Any person appointed or elected to fill a vacancy in
the United States Congress and who serves at least one half of a term of office
shall be considered to have served a term in that office for purposes of this
subsection (1).  Terms are considered consecutive unless they are at least four
years apart.
<P>(2)  The people of Colorado hereby state their support for a nationwide
limit of twelve consecutive years of service in the United States Senate or
House of Representatives and instruct their public officials to use their best
efforts to work for such a limit.
<P>(3)  The people of Colorado declare that the provisions of this section
shall be deemed severable from the remainder of this measure and that their
intention is that federal officials elected from Colorado will continue
voluntarily to observe the wishes of the people as state in this section in the
event any provision thereof is held invalid.
<P>Adopted by the People November 6, 1990 -- Effective upon proclamation of
the Governor, January 3, 1991. (For the text of the initiated measure and the
votes cast thereon, see L. 91, p. 2036.)

Section 4.  First charter. (1)  The charter and ordinances of the city of
Denver as the same shall exist when this amendment takes effect, shall, for the
time being only, and as far as applicable, be the charter and ordinances of the
city and county of Denver; but the people of the city and county of Denver are
hereby vested with and they shall always have the exclusive power in the
making, altering, revising or amending their charter and, within ten days after
the proclamation of the governor announcing the adoption of this amendment the
council of the city and county of Denver shall, by ordinance, call a special
election, to be conducted as provided by law, of the qualified electors in said
city and county of Denver, for the election of twenty-one taxpayers who shall
have been qualified electors within the limits thereof for at least five years,
who shall constitute a charter convention to frame a charter for said city and
county in harmony with this amendment. Immediately upon completion, the charter
so framed, with a prefatory synopsis, shall be signed by the officers and
members of the convention and delivered to the clerk of said city and county
who shall publish the same in full, with his official certification, in the
official newspaper of said city and county, three times, and a week apart, the
first publication being with the call for a special election, at which the
qualified electors of said city and county shall by vote express their approval
or rejection of the said charter.  If the said charter shall be approved by a
majority of those voting thereon, then two copies thereof (together with the
vote for and against) duly certified by the said clerk, shall, within ten days
after such vote is taken, be filed with the secretary of state, and shall
thereupon become and be the charter of the city and county of Denver.  But if
the said charter be rejected, then, within thirty days thereafter, twenty-one
members of a new charter convention shall be elected at a special election to
be called as above in said city and county, and they shall proceed as above to
frame a charter, which shall in like manner and to the like end be published
and submitted to a vote of said voters for their approval or rejection.  If
again rejected, the procedure herein designated shall be repeated (each special
election for members of a new charter convention being within thirty days after
each rejection) until a charter is finally approved by a majority of those
voting thereon, and certified (together with the vote for and against) to the
secretary of state as aforesaid, whereupon it shall become the charter of the
said city and county of Denver and shall become the organic law thereof, and
supersede any existing charters and amendments thereof.  The members of each of
said charter conventions shall be elected at large; and they shall complete
their labors within sixty days after their respective election.
<P>(2)  Every ordinance for a special election of charter convention members
shall fix the time and place where the convention shall be held, and shall
specify the compensation, if any, to be paid the officers and members thereof,
allowing no compensation in case of non-attendance or tardy attendance, and
shall fix the time when the vote shall be taken on the proposed charter, to be
not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days after its delivery to the
clerk.  The charter shall make proper provision for continuing, amending or
repealing the ordinances of the city and county of Denver.
<P>(3)  All expenses of charter conventions shall be paid out of the treasury
upon the order of the president and secretary thereof.  The expenses of
elections for charter conventions and of charter votes shall be paid out of the
treasury upon the order of the council.
<P>(4)  Any franchise relating to any street, alley, or public place of the
said city and county shall be subject to the initiative and referendum powers
reserved to the people under section 1 of article V of this constitution.  Such
referendum power shall be guaranteed notwithstanding a recital in an ordinance
granting such franchise that such ordinance is necessary for the immediate
preservation of the public peace, health, and safety.  Not more than five
percent of the registered electors of a home rule city shall be required to
order such referendum.  Nothing in this section shall preclude a home rule
charter provision which requires a lesser number of registered electors to
order such referendum or which requires a franchise to be voted on by the
registered electors.  If such a referendum is ordered to be submitted to the
registered electors, the grantee of such franchise shall deposit with the
treasurer the expense (to be determined by said treasurer) of such submission.
The council shall have power to fix the rate of taxation on property each year
for city and county purposes.
<P>Added November 4, 1902.  (See Laws 1901, p. 101.); as amended November 6,
1984 -- Effective upon proclamation of the Governor, January 14, 1985.  (For
the text of this amendment and the votes cast thereon, see L. 84, p. 1145, and
L. 85, p. 1791.); as amended November 4, 1986 -- Effective upon proclamation of
the Governor, December 17, 1986. (For the text of this amendment and the votes
cast thereon, see L. 86, p. 1239, and L. 87, p. 1859.)

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
I.  General Consideration.
<P>II.  Control of Franchises.
<P>III.  Power of Taxation.
<P>I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>C.J.S.  See 16 C.J.S., Constitutional Law,  140; 62 C.J.S., Municipal
Corporations,   88-90, 93.
<P>People are given exclusive right to amend charter.  Under this and the
following section the inhabitants of the city and county of Denver are given
the exclusive power to amend their charter, and are entitled to demand the
submission of anything which falls within the definition of an amendment.
People ex rel. Moore v. Perkins, 56 Colo. 17, 137 P. 55, 1914D Ann. Cas. 1154
(1913).
<P>This article is not invalid on the ground that it is dependent on future
contingencies.  People ex rel. Elder v. Sours, 31 Colo. 369, 74 P. 167, 102 Am.
St. R. 34 (1903).
<P>City and county of Denver invested with all power prior to adoption of
charter.  Under this section the city and county of Denver, during the interim
between the adoption of the constitutional amendment and the adoption of the
new charter, was invested with all the authority, which was not made or
rendered inapplicable by the article itself, previously reposed in the city of
Denver, including the power to create sidewalk districts and assess the cost of
the sidewalk constructed therein upon the abutting properties.  Hallett v. City
&amp  County of Denver, 46 Colo. 487, 104 P. 1038 (1909).
<P>Council of city and county possesses powers conferred on old city council.
The old charter of the city of Denver, insofar as it is the charter of the city
and county of Denver, is to be considered in determining the extent of the
council's authority, but the old charter is not the charter of the city and
county except qualifiedly.  It is such charter only insofar as it is applicable
to the constitution of the new corporation.  Subject to this qualification, the
council of the city and county of Denver possesses all the powers conferred by
the charter upon the city council of the city of Denver.   McMurray v. Wright,
19 Colo. App. 17, 73 P. 257 (1903).
<P>Prior ordinances remain in effect.  Ordinances in force at date of new
charter, which were not inconsistent therewith, remain in force until repealed
or amended by the council, or until they expire by their own limitations.  To
receive such prior ordinance in evidence, in an action for negligence founded
on the disregard of the requirements of the ordinance, is not to give it
retroactive effect.  Denver City Tramway Co. v. Carson, 21 Colo. App. 604, 123
P. 680 (1912).
<P>Courts to take judicial notice of charter.  The courts will judicially
notice the charter of the city of Denver, adopted under this article by the
people of that municipality, to the same extent as the former charter granted
by the general assembly.  Denver City Tramway Co. v. Carson, 21 Colo. App. 604,
123 P. 680 (1912).
<P>Charter election was governed as provided by general law.  While the
charter of the old corporation is made the charter of the new body corporate
until after the election is determined, the requirement as to the election is
that it shall be conducted, not as provided by that charter, but as provided by
law.  If it had been the intention to apply the charter to the election, the
word "charter", instead of the word "law", would have been used. McMurray v.
Wright, 19 Colo. App. 17, 73 P. 257 (1903).
<P>Canvass of returns of election for members of charter convention.  It is
the duty of the clerk of said city and county, assisted by two justices of the
peace, and not of the city council, to canvass the returns of an election for
members of the charter convention, and to issue certificates of election to the
members elected thereto.  McMurray v. Wright, 19 Colo. App. 17, 73 P. 257
(1903).
<P>Successive charter elections are not required.  The contention that
successive charter elections must be held until a new charter has been
approved, under this section and section 5 of this article was rejected by the
supreme court.  Mahood v. City &amp  County of Denver, 118 Colo. 338, 195 P.2d 379
(1948).
<P>Distinction between modes of amending or making new charter.  This
article, while investing the people of the city under this section with
"exclusive power in the making, altering, revising, or amending their charter",
makes a distinction  between the modes of amending it and of revising it in
extenso or making a new one, the difference being that an amendment may be
initiated by petition and directly voted upon and adopted by the electors,
while a revised or new charter requires the intervention of a charter
convention.  City &amp  County of Denver v. New York Trust Co., 229 U.S. 123, 33 S.
Ct. 657, 57 L. Ed. 1101 (1913).
<P>Ordinance effecting amendment of charter held invalid.  A Denver ordinance
was invalid because in effect it would be an amendment of the charter, which
power of amendment under this section is exclusively reserved to the people of
Denver.  McNichols v. City &amp  County of Denver, 109 Colo. 269, 124 P.2d 601
(1942).
<P>New charter cannot be framed and submitted by those not possessing
qualifications prescribed in this section although initiatory steps with
respect to matters prescribed in section 5 of this article may be taken by
qualified electors, whether taxpayers or not, and without regard to the length
of time they have been such electors.  Speer v. People ex rel. Rush, 52 Colo.
325, 122 P. 768 (1912).
<P>Applied in People ex rel. Parish v. Adams, 31 Colo. 476, 73 P. 866 (1903).
<P>II. CONTROL OF FRANCHISES.
<P>"Franchise" is defined as the privilege of doing that which does not
belong to the citizens of the country generally by common right.  It is a
right, privilege or power, of public concern, which ought not to be exercised
by private individuals at their mere will and pleasure, but should be reserved
for public control and administration.  City of Englewood v. Crabtree, 157
Colo. 593, 404 P.2d 525, cert. dismissed, 382 U.S. 934, 86 S. Ct. 385, 15 L.
Ed.2d 347 (1965).
<P>A "franchise" by definition is a special right or privilege granted by a
government to an individual or corporation -- such a right as does not
ordinarily belong to citizens in general.  City of Englewood v. Mountain States
Tel. &amp  Tel. Co., 163 Colo. 400, 431 P.2d 40 (1967).
<P>The object of this provision relating to franchises is to give the
taxpaying electors absolute control over the granting of franchises.  Ward v.
Colorado E. R. R., 22 Colo. App. 332, 125 P. 567 (1912); Berman v. City &amp
County of Denver, 120 Colo. 218, 209 P.2d 754 (1949).
<P>Power to grant franchises was transferred from city council to the
qualified taxpaying electors when this article took effect.  Ward v. Colorado
E. R. R., 22 Colo. App. 332, 125 P. 567 (1912); Berman v. City &amp  County of
Denver, 120 Colo. 218, 209 P.2d 754 (1949).  See Williams v. People, 38 Colo.
497, 88 P. 463 (1906).
<P>Franchise must be approved by electors.  Under this section the people of
the new organization are vested with the exclusive power to make their own
municipal charter, but, with this limitation, inter alia, that a franchise
relating to any street, alley or public place of the city cannot be granted
except upon the vote of its qualified taxpaying electors.  Williams v. People,
38 Colo. 497, 88 P. 463 (1906).
<P>The city council of Denver is without authority to grant to a street
railway company a so-called revocable license, in effect a franchise, to use
the streets of the city for street railway purposes, except upon a vote of the
qualified taxpaying electors, under the provisions of this section.  Baker v.
Denver Tramway Co., 72 Colo. 233, 210 P. 845, 29 A.L.R. 1453 (1922); Berman v.
City &amp  County of Denver, 120 Colo. 218, 209 P.2d 754 (1949).
<P>City franchising power not applicable to party franchised by state.  The
constitutional provisions permitting home rule cities to grant franchises are
applicable to situations where the individual or corporation does not have some
type of a state franchise.  City of Englewood v. Mountain States Tel. &amp  Tel.
Co., 163 Colo. 400, 431 P.2d 40 (1967).
<P>By its original city franchise, obtained before the city became a home
rule city, the telephone company acquired what in law is a valid state
franchise or right.  This permitted it not only to maintain its facilities in
the city's public ways, but also to construct and operate additional ones
therein without obtaining a city franchise. City of Englewood v. Mountain
States Tel. &amp  Tel. Co., 163 Colo. 400, 431 P.2d 40 (1967).
<P>Provision for payment before vote is subordinate part of limitation.
While this section provides that the question of granting a desired franchise
shall be submitted to the electors upon the deposit with the city treasurer of
the expense of the submission, it is a subordinate part of a limitation or
restriction to the effect that no franchise to occupy or use the streets of the
city shall be granted except upon an approving vote of the electors, and is
evidently intended to be merely regulatory of the payment of the expense of
taking the vote, and not to make such payment the only test of the right to
have the vote taken.  City &amp  County of Denver v. New York Trust Co., 229 U.S.
123, 33 S. Ct. 657, 57 L. Ed. 1101 (1913).
<P>Franchise election upheld.  When the vast majority of the votes cast on a
franchise matter were for the franchise, an election will not be voided on the
basis of the claim that the limitation of votes on the franchise matter to
qualified taxpaying electors was invalid, when the result would have been the
same even if those who had not been permitted to vote were allowed to do so.
DeMoulin v. City &amp  County of Denver, 177 Colo. 129, 495 P.2d 203, cert. denied,
409 U.S. 934, 93 S. Ct. 232, 34 L. Ed.2d 188 (1972).
<P>Sports stadium is not street, alley or avenue requiring franchise vote any
more than the auditorium, the arena, the coliseum or any other facility that
the city from time to time leases to persons.  Ginsberg v. City &amp  County of
Denver, 164 Colo. 572, 436 P.2d 685 (1968).
<P>Sale of land was not grant of franchise.  The sale of a block in the city
of Denver on which the courthouse was formerly located was not the grant of a
franchise relating to a public place within the meaning of this section.  Hall
v. City &amp  County of Denver, 115 Colo. 538, 177 P.2d 234 (1946).
<P>The reverter provision of the contract for sale of land is nothing more
than the reservation of a right in property which the owner thereof retains in
itself upon conveyance of a major interest in that property to the city.  The
interest thus retained is not a franchise but is an interest in real property.
City of Englewood v. Crabtree, 157 Colo. 593, 404 P.2d 525, cert. dismissed,
382 U.S. 934, 86 S. Ct. 385, 15 L. Ed.2d 347 (1965).
<P>Nor is lease.  The user arrangement whereby the city leases a sports
stadium for professional sports and other uses is a mere lease or rental
arrangement and is not a franchise. Ginsberg v. City &amp  County of Denver, 164
Colo. 572, 436 P.2d 685 (1968).
<P>But maintenance of telephone facilities on streets is.  The right of a
telephone or telegraph company to maintain its facilities on or in the streets
is a franchised right.  City of Englewood v. Mountain States Tel. &amp  Tel. Co.,
163 Colo. 400, 431 P.2d 40 (1967).
<P>Attempt to grant franchise privileges contrary to section invalid.  An
ordinance of the Denver city council adopted subsequent to this article and
prior to the adoption of the charter thereunder, granting to a railway company
the right to occupy certain streets and alleys, was without effect, either as a
grant or as a mere permit or license; it conferred no right whatever.  Ward v.
Colorado E. R. R., 22 Colo. App. 332, 125 P. 567 (1912).
<P>An ordinance granting to a tramway corporation authority to eliminate rail
lines on certain streets and operate trolley coaches or motor busses and fixing
maximum fares constituted an attempt to grant, extend and enlarge franchise
privileges contrary to, and in violation of, this section.  Berman v. City &amp
County of Denver, 120 Colo. 218, 209 P.2d 754 (1949).
<P>III. POWER OF TAXATION.
<P>Duty of city council in fixing rate of taxation is purely ministerial.
The power to fix the rate of taxation given the council is limited to the
necessities of the case, and such rate must be based upon fixed charges, levies
and estimated expenses.  The duty of the council in that respect is neither
legislative nor judicial, but is purely ministerial.  Perkins v. People ex rel.
McFarland, 59 Colo. 107, 147 P. 356 (1915).
<P>And does not include power to determine validity of tax directed by
people.   The power to fix the rate of taxation granted the council in this
section does not include the power to determine the necessity or validity of a
tax arising from a fixed levy for the construction and maintenance of public
improvements directed by the people, whether in the form of bonds, the interest
and principal of which must be paid by the levy of a tax, or whether from any
specific levy for a stated purpose.  Such a power would enable the council to
nullify every act of the people providing for a public improvement. Perkins v.
People ex rel. McFarland, 59 Colo. 107, 147 P. 356 (1915).
<P>But confers no power to limit the rate of taxation for county purposes.
The provision of the charter adopted by the people of Denver, under authority
of this article is construed to apply only to taxes levied for municipal
purposes, and is of no effect upon the power and duty of the board of
supervisors in fixing the rate of taxation for state and county purposes.
Hilts v. Markey, 52 Colo. 382, 122 P. 394 (1912).
<P>Since that is matter solely under state control.  If by the charter of the
city and county of Denver it is undertaken to legislate upon, or in any way
control and fix, the method of making, or the amount of the levy, by way of
limitation or otherwise, within the consolidated territory, for county
purposes, such attempt is futile, because that is a matter solely under state
control, and may not be interfered with in any way by local legislation.  Hilts
v. Markey, 52 Colo. 382, 122 P. 394 (1912).
<P>And is performed by board of supervisors of city and county.  The board of
supervisors of the city and county of Denver, in levying taxes for county
purposes, performs the same office as the board of county commissioners in
other counties.  They have authority, and are under an absolute duty to
determine the amount to be levied.  And this authority is not limited by the
provision of this section.  Hilts v. Markey, 52 Colo. 382, 122 P. 394 (1912).
<P>Excise tax payable to milk producers upheld.  Ordinance laying an excise
tax of two cents per quart upon milk intended for human consumption in the city
and county of Denver was held constitutional within the provisions of this
section.  Bowles v. Stapleton, 53 F. Supp. 336 (D. Colo. 1943).

<HR>
Section 5.  New charters, amendments or measures. The citizens of the city
and county of Denver shall have the exclusive power to amend their charter or
to adopt a new charter, or to adopt any measure as herein provided;
<P>It shall be competent for qualified electors in number not less than five
percent of the next preceding gubernatorial vote in said city and county to
petition the council for any measure, or charter amendment, or for a charter
convention.  The council shall submit the same to a vote of the qualified
electors at the next general election not held within thirty days after such
petition is filed; whenever such petition is signed by qualified electors in
number not less than ten percent of the next preceding gubernatorial vote in
said city and county, with a request for a special election, the council shall
submit it at a special election to be held not less than thirty nor more than
sixty days from the date of filing the petition; provided, that any question so
submitted at a special election shall not again be submitted at a special
election within two years thereafter.  In submitting any such charter, charter
amendment or measure, any alternative article or proposition may be presented
for the choice of the voters, and may be voted on separately without prejudice
to others.  Whenever the question of a charter convention is carried by a
majority of those voting thereon, a charter convention shall be called through
a special election ordinance as provided in section four (4) hereof, and the
same shall be constituted and held and the proposed charter submitted to a vote
of the qualified electors, approved or rejected, and all expenses paid, as in
said section provided.
<P>The clerk of the city and county shall publish, with his official
certification, for three times, a week apart, in the official newspapers, the
first publication to be with his call for the election, general or special, the
full text of any charter, charter amendment, measure, or proposal for a charter
convention, or alternative article or proposition, which is to be submitted to
the voters.  Within ten days following the vote the said clerk shall publish
once in said newspaper the full text of any charter, charter amendment,
measure, or proposal for a charter convention, or alternative article or
proposition, which shall have been approved by majority of those voting
thereon, and he shall file with the secretary of state two copies thereof (with
the vote for and against) officially certified by him, and the same shall go
into effect from the date of such filing.  He shall also certify to the
secretary of state, with the vote for and against, two copies of every defeated
alternative article or proposition, charter, charter amendment, measure or
proposal for a charter convention.  Each charter shall also provide for a
reference upon proper petition therefor, of measures passed by the council to a
vote of the qualified electors, and for the initiative by the qualified
electors of such ordinances as they may by petition request.
<P>The signatures to petitions in this amendment mentioned need not all be on
one paper.  Nothing herein or elsewhere shall prevent the council, if it sees
fit, from adopting automatic vote registers for use at elections and
references.
<P>No charter, charter amendment or measure adopted or defeated under the
provisions of this amendment shall be amended, repealed or revived, except by
petition and electoral vote.  And no such charter, charter amendment or measure
shall diminish the tax rate for state purposes fixed by act of the general
assembly, or interfere in any wise with the collection of state taxes.
<P>The city council, or board of trustees, or other body in which the
legislative powers of any home rule city or town may then be vested, on its own
initiative, may submit any measure, charter amendment, or the question whether
or not a charter convention shall be called, at any general or special state or
municipal election held not less than 30 days after the effective date of the
ordinance or resolution submitting such question to the voters.
<P>As amended November 7, 1950.  (See Laws 1951, p.  232.)

<P>Charter.
<P>A. In General.
<P>B. Procedure.
<P>I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Cross reference.  As to procedure and requirements for adoption of a home
rule charter by the qualified electors of each city and county, city, and town
of the state, see  9 of this article.
<P>Am. Jur.2d.  See 56 Am. Jur.2d, Municipal Corporations, Counties, and
Other Political Subdivisions,  127.
<P>C.J.S.  See 16 C.J.S., Constitutional Law,  140; 62 C.J.S., Municipal
Corporations,   88-90, 93.
<P>This section is not one of limitation.  City &amp  County of Denver v.
Mewborn, 143 Colo. 407, 354 P.2d 155 (1960).
<P>Construction of charter where it differs from constitution.  If the
charter differs from the constitution in any respect, it does not thereby
diminish the power reserved by the constitution.  If the powers reserved by the
charter exceed those reserved in the constitution, the effect of the charter
would be to give the people the additional powers there described.  Burks v.
City of Lafayette, 142 Colo. 61, 349 P.2d 692 (1960).
<P>"Special elections" mentioned in this section are special municipal
elections, although not specifically so designated.  People ex rel. Austin v.
Billig, 72 Colo. 209, 210 P. 324 (1922).
<P>"General election".  The term "general election" used in this section
refers to a general municipal election, and does not include a general state
election.  People ex rel. Austin v. Billig, 72 Colo. 209, 210 P. 324 (1922).
<P>Within the specific context of this section, a "general election" is a
regularly scheduled election at which all qualified electors may participate.
Election Comm'n v. McNichols, 193 Colo. 263, 565 P.2d 937 (1977).
<P>Change in plan of government can only be effected by a charter convention.
A measure proposed as an amendment, inasmuch as it changed the city council
from a body composed of two houses, the members chosen from designated
districts, to a single body of five commissioners chosen at large, so that all
may come from one locality, denying to the mayor the veto of power now vested
in him, reposing in the five commissioners all administrative powers which, by
the existing charter, are vested in separate boards, commissions and officials,
was not a mere amendment but an entire change in the plan of government which
can only be effected by a charter convention.  Speer v. People ex rel. Rush, 52
Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912).
<P>Proposition held to be amendment, not new charter.  A charter must be
complete in itself, and a proposition for the amendment of twenty sections out
of three hundred and sixty, for the repeal of twenty sections, and the addition
of twenty sections, leaving approximately three hundred sections untouched;
which is germane to the subject of municipal government; which fails to provide
for the appointment or election of many officers and employees required in the
existing charter, or their duties or salaries; which makes no provisions as to
the civil service, the fire and police department, the management of municipal
finance, public utilities, and the control thereof, the public health,
franchises and public improvements, must be regarded as amendatory to the
charter, and not as a new charter.  People ex rel. Moore v. Perkins, 56 Colo.
17, 137 P. 55, 1914D Ann. Cas. 1154 (1913).
<P>Prohibition against revival limited to particular measure.  The
prohibition in the next to last paragraph of this section lies against the
reenactment or revival of the particular ordinance or measure defeated, and not
against all legislation on the subject matter thereof.  Hall v. City &amp  County
of Denver, 115 Colo. 538, 177 P.2d 234 (1946).
<P>Such prohibition was amended by implication.  That part of this section
which states: "No charter, charter amendment or measure adopted or defeated
under the provisions of this amendment shall be amended, repealed or revived
except by petition and electoral vote", was amended by implication by a later
constitutional amendment granting the city council the same power as held by
the electorate to initiate such changes.  Coopersmith v. City &amp  County of
Denver, 156 Colo. 469, 399 P.2d 943 (1965).
<P>No charter or charter amendment can interfere with state taxes.  There is
nothing in this article, nor in the charter of the former city government under
which the new municipality acts until it secures a new charter and new
ordinances, which prohibits an act of the general assembly which imposes a
license fee by a tax upon lawful occupations within the city of Denver for the
purpose of securing state revenue.  Parsons v. People, 32 Colo. 221, 76 P. 666
(1904).
<P>Charter must include referendum and initiative provisions.  The effect of
this section is to require that referendum and initiative provisions be
included in home rule charters.  It does not specify as to the scope and extent
of the power but the presence of this provision indicates the importance of
this reservation.  Burks v. City of Lafayette, 142 Colo. 61, 349 P.2d 692
(1960).
<P>But scope and extent of provisions not specified.  The Colorado
constitution requires that referendum and initiative provisions be included in
home rule charters, but includes no requirement as to the scope and extent that
must be allowed.  Witkin Homes, Inc. v. City &amp  County of Denver, 31 Colo. App.
410, 504 P.2d 1121 (1972).
<P>Home rule charter is not subject to constitutional limitation on
referendum.  The limitation does not operate to restrict the referendum to the
same boundaries existing at the state level, it not being a maximum limitation,
but the minimum which must be reserved to the people of a locality.  Burks v.
City of Lafayette, 142 Colo. 61, 349 P.2d 692 (1960).
<P>City may restrict or reserve full measure of referendum authority to
voters.  Inasmuch as the home rule city has the power to adopt its own charter
and can within its sphere exercise as much legislative power as the general
assembly, it follows that such a city has authority to either restrict the
power of referendum by allowing its council to declare health and safety or it
may validly reserve a full measure of referendum authority to the voters of the
community by not restricting it -- by providing that it shall be exercisable
with respect to any measure--even those measures which have become effective.
Witkin Homes, Inc. v. City &amp  County of Denver, 31 Colo. App. 410, 504 P.2d 1121
(1972).
<P>A home rule city may adopt a charter which reserves to the voters
authority to refer all measures, and which withholds from the council power to
thwart referendum by the expedient of declaring health and safety.  Such a
charter provision is valid and there is no reason for implied incorporation
within it of the safety exception.  Burks v. City of Lafayette, 142 Colo. 61,
349 P.2d 692 (1960).
<P>Council may preclude referendum by petition through acceleration of
effective date of ordinance based upon a determination and declaration that the
ordinance is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health and
safety.  Witkin Homes, Inc. v. City &amp  County of Denver, 31 Colo. App. 410, 504
P.2d 1121 (1972).
<P>Power of referendum should be broadly construed.  The interpretative
approach to the power of referendum which gives broad effect to the reservation
in the people and which refrains from implying or incorporating restrictions
not specified in the constitution or the charter is supported by the terms of
art. V, Colo. Const.  Being a reservation of the people, it should not be
narrowly construed, and there should be strict construction of the authority
which would nullify the referendum.  Burks v. City of Lafayette, 142 Colo. 61,
349 P.2d 692 (1960).
<P>In construing a home rule charter, broad effect is given to the power
granted a city council to submit a matter to a vote of the people, and any
limitations on that power will be narrowly construed.  Witkin Homes, Inc. v.
City &amp  County of Denver, 31 Colo. App. 410, 504 P.2d 1121 (1972).
<P>When ordinances are "adopted".  Referendum provisions are negative in
their operation and an ordinance submitted to referendum is not "adopted" by a
subsequent favorable vote of the people, but on the contrary such had already
been "adopted" by the earlier action of the city council.  Interstate Trust
Bldg. Co. v. Denver Urban Renewal Auth., 172 Colo. 427, 473 P.2d 978 (1970).
<P>Council may amend ordinance adopted by council and approved by electors.
Though this section and the corresponding Denver city charter provisions would
appear to bar the Denver city council from amending initiated ordinances,
nevertheless such constitutional and charter provisions do not contain any
similar words of limitations as concerns the power of city council to amend an
ordinance which it adopted and which was thereafter referred to a vote of the
qualified electors and approved by them.  Interstate Trust Bldg.  Co. v. Denver
Urban Renewal Auth., 172 Colo. 427, 473 P.2d 978 (1970).
<P>Ordinances submitted for referendum not limited to certain types.  Where
the charter provision in question allows the city council to submit for a
referendum "any ordinance passed by it in the same manner and with the same
force and effect as hereinabove provided", the language is not limited to those
types of ordinances allowed to be the subject of referendum initiated by
petition, and thus, "any ordinance" includes an ordinance previously enacted
and in effect, including zoning ordinances.  Witkin Homes, Inc. v. City &amp
County of Denver, 31 Colo. App. 410, 504 P.2d 1121 (1972).
<P>Applied in City of Englewood v. Crabtree, 157 Colo. 593, 404 P.2d 525
(1965); International Bhd. of Police Officers Local 127 v. City &amp  County of
Denver, 185 Colo. 50, 521 P.2d 916 (1974).
<P>II. POWER TO AMEND OR TO ADOPT NEW CHARTER.
<P>A. In General.
<P>Home rule cities have power to amend charter.  Home rule cities are vested
with, and shall always have, power to make, amend, add to or replace the
charter of the city or town, which shall be its organic law and extend to all
its local and municipal matters.  Four-County Metro. Capital Imp. Dist. v.
Board of County Comm'rs, 149 Colo. 284, 369 P.2d 67 (1962).
<P>Citizens of Denver have legislative power over municipal matters.  Under
this section the citizens of the municipality of Denver, so far as concerns
municipal matters, have all the powers of the legislature.  Speer v. People ex
rel. Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912).  See City &amp  County of Denver v.
Hallett, 34 Colo. 393, 83 P. 1066 (1905); Londoner v. City &amp  County of Denver,
52 Colo. 15, 119 P. 156 (1911).
<P>The power to amend or adopt a new charter expressly granted to the
citizens of Denver is a legislative one.  The power thus granted is plainly not
executive nor judicial.  It is a power to make laws, to legislate, and cannot
be other than legislative.  Speer v. People ex rel. Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P.
768 (1912).
<P>Power is granted not to citizens and city council, but to citizens only.
Speer v. People ex rel. Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912).
<P>Such power is exclusive in citizens.  As the power thus granted is
expressly exclusive in the citizens, of necessity all other governmental
agencies, departments, bodies, and officers are excluded from exercising it.
This exclusion is direct, positive and unequivocal.  Speer v. People ex rel.
Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912).
<P>And includes power to initiate proposed charter amendments.  The petition
for an amendment is part of the act of legislation, and the petitioners, in
submitting their petition, are exercising legislative power; they who thus
initiate the measure, and the whole body of electors who vote upon it,
constituting the legislature of the municipality.  Speer v. People ex rel.
Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912).
<P>Any matter germane to principal subject may be submitted as amendment.
Where the word "amendment" is used without limitation as in this section, any
matter which is germane to the principal subject, to wit, that of municipal
government, is proper to be submitted as an amendment.  People ex rel. Moore v.
Perkins, 56 Colo. 17, 137 P. 55, 1914D Ann. Cas. 1154 (1913).
<P>New charter may not be submitted as amendment.  The article does not
authorize the submission to the people, as an amendment to the charter, of what
is in effect a new charter.  Speer v. People ex rel. Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P.
768 (1912).
<P>Amendment need not be limited to single subject.  This section does not
require that a charter amendment be limited to a single subject or proposition.
City &amp  County of Denver v. Mewborn, 143 Colo. 407, 354 P.2d 155 (1960).
<P>The use of the singular form "amendment" in this section is not to be
construed as prohibiting more than one subject within a single amendment to the
charter of a home rule city, the constitutional provision not being one of
limitation.  Several subjects can be constitutionally included within a single
charter amendment.  City &amp  County of Denver v. Mewborn, 143 Colo. 407, 354 P.2d
155 (1960).
<P>Where the several propositions in an amendment to the charter of a home
rule city are related and deal with subjects within the power of the
municipality there is no constitutional objection to such an amendment, even
though it is multi-purposed.  City &amp  County of Denver v. Mewborn, 143 Colo.
407, 354 P.2d 155 (1960).
<P>If the subjects submitted were germane to each other or if the subjects
were so interconnected and dependent on each other that it is not desirable to
adopt one without the others, it is unnecessary to submit to the voters each
subject individually.  Coopersmith v. City &amp  County of Denver, 156 Colo. 469,
399 P.2d 943 (1965).
<P>The inhibition against more than one subject in legislative enactments has
no application to constitutional or organic law.  City &amp  County of Denver v.
Mewborn, 143 Colo. 407, 354 P.2d 155 (1960); Coopersmith v. City &amp  County of
Denver, 156 Colo. 469, 399 P.2d 943 (1965).
<P>Section 21 of art. V, Colo. Const., providing that no bill shall contain
more than one subject which shall be clearly expressed in its title, has no
application to charter amendments made pursuant to this article by
municipalities.  Hoper v. City &amp  County of Denver, 173 Colo. 390, 479 P.2d 967
(1971).
<P>But submission of many amendments as one not permitted.  This section does
not permit the submission, as one, of many amendments.  If more than one be
submitted, the voter must be enabled to approve or reject them separately.
People ex rel. Walker v. Stapleton, 79 Colo. 629, 247 P. 1062 (1926); City &amp
County of Denver v. Mewborn, 143 Colo. 407, 354 P.2d 155 (1960).
<P>A proposed amendment consisted of several distinct propositions, many of
them entirely foreign to the proposed change in the form of government, all to
be submitted as a single amendment where the elector was afforded no
opportunity to vote for those which he favored, and against those of which he
disapproved, was improper.  The necessity of voting for or against all is in
conflict with the letter as well as the spirit of our election laws, and
condemned by an unbroken line of authority.  Speer v. People ex rel. Rush, 52
Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912).
<P>A charter amendment proposal containing several unrelated propositions,
submitted to the voters as a single amendment, and under which the voters have
no opportunity to accept or reject each such proposal, is a "package deal",
with the result that the ballot title used is in clear violation of the
provisions of this section of the constitution.  Any purported amendment
adopted under such circumstance is of no force or effect.  Howard v. City of
Boulder, 132 Colo. 401, 290 P.2d 237 (1955).
<P>B. Procedure.
<P>The procedure outlined in this section is definite and complete.  Cook v.
City of Delta, 100 Colo. 7, 64 P.2d 1257 (1937).
<P>General provisions for initiative and referendum do not apply to
amendment.  A charter amendment may be proposed only by petition of the
electors and must be passed by a majority vote of the electorate before it
becomes effective.  It is in its very nature an initiated measure and the
general constitutional and statutory provisions for initiative and referendum
do not apply to a charter amendment.  Cook v. City of Delta, 100 Colo. 7, 64
P.2d 1257 (1937).
<P>Amendment may be initiated by petition or by ordinance.  This section
provides that a charter amendment may be initiated either by a petition signed
by qualified electors in number not less than five percent of the next
preceding gubernatorial vote, or by an ordinance passed by the council.  City &amp
County of Denver v. Mewborn, 143 Colo. 407, 354 P.2d 155 (1960).
<P>Power to propose amendments is limited to authority prescribed and must be
initiated in manner required.  The authority of the people to initiate
legislation by petition is limited to that prescribed, and must be initiated in
the manner required.  If they should undertake to initiate legislation which
they have no authority to initiate, or do not follow the steps prescribed,
their action would certainly be futile; consequently, it is only when they have
acted within the authority conferred and in the manner prescribed, that their
right to have proposed legislation submitted attaches.  Speer v. People ex rel.
Rush, 52 Colo. 325 122 P. 768 (1912).
<P>Proceeding is analagous to that provided by constitution for amendment of
fundamental law.  The petitioners stand in the same relation to the proposed
amendment as does the general assembly to any amendment proposed to the
constitution.  Speer v. People ex rel. Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912).
<P>This article authorizes the city and county of Denver to make its charter,
which in a sense is its constitution, concerning local affairs; the state
constitution provides the method by which it can be amended.  This does not
include the restrictions placed upon the general assembly in the enactment of
laws, or any restrictions other than the word "amendment" would imply.  This
makes the rules pertaining to amendments to constitutions more applicable to
those under consideration, than amendments pertaining to general laws.  People
ex rel. Moore v. Perkins, 56 Colo. 17, 137 P. 55, 1914D Ann. Cas. 1154 (1913).
<P>Exact form of petition is governed by charter provisions.  No form of
petition, no procedure for the ascertainment of the sufficiency of the
signatures, no form of submission of a proposed amendment or other necessary
details are provided for in the constitution.  These, therefore, are all proper
subjects to be regulated and controlled by charter.  Speer v. People ex rel.
Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912).
<P>Purpose of publication is to prevent confusion. The purpose of a municipal
charter provision that ordinances must be published and shall not be revised or
amended by title only, is to prevent the confusion which results from amending
ordinances by reference to the title, or by interpolating words without
restating the part amended.  This reasoning applies as well to the publication
of ordinances under this section.  Thiele v. City &amp  County of Denver, 135 Colo.
442, 312 P.2d 786 (1957).
<P>Object of title of amendment is to notify those concerned with the act as
to what is being proposed in the body of the ordinance.  Coopersmith v. City &amp
County of Denver, 156 Colo. 469, 399 P.2d 943 (1965).
<P>Charter may require ballot title to show nature of amendment.  While the
governing body of a home rule municipality may not circumvent or seek to avoid
such constitutional requirements as the publication requirement, there is no
illegality in a municipal charter requirement that the ballot title of an
amendment be clear and comprehensive and show the nature of the amendment.  The
power to establish minimum standards for ballot titles is clearly expressed in
both the general and specific provisions of section 6 of this article.  Hoper
v. City &amp  County of Denver, 173 Colo. 390, 479 P.2d 967 (1971).
<P>Section does not provide for submission to electors by ordinance.  This
section provides that whenever petitions providing for the submission of
amendments to the charter are signed by qualified electors in number not less
than ten percent, with a request for a special election, the council shall
submit it at a special election to be held not less than 30 days nor more than
60 days from the date of filing the petition, but it does not state that it
shall be by ordinance.  People ex rel. Moore v. Perkins, 56 Colo. 17, 137 P.
55, 1914D Ann. Cas. 1154 (1913).
<P>Submission of compiled code by referral numbering was proper.  It was not
improper to use the 1960 compilation of Denver city ordinances as referral
numbering in submitting the questioned amendment to the voters.  The city has
the implied power to make periodically a compilation of its city charter,
charter amendments and ordinances so that they are in some coherent and logical
order.  Coopersmith v. City &amp  County of Denver, 156 Colo. 469, 399 P.2d 943
(1965).
<P>Council to determine whether proposal is within constitutional
prescription.  The city council is vested with power to determine in the first
instance whether what is proposed is within the constitutional prescription,
and if not, to refuse to submit it to the electors, their action being subject
to review by the courts.  And the courts in determining the propriety of the
action of the council in such case, are not invading the functions of the
legislative department, or interfering with the formative stages of
legislation.  Speer v. People ex rel. Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912).
<P>Under this section before an election may be called by the Denver city
council to amend the charter, it must determine that the petition therefor
bears the specified number of signatures, that the same question has not been
submitted within the two preceding years, and that the proposed legislation
does not diminish the state tax rates or interfere with the collection of state
taxes.  People ex rel. Walker v. Stapleton, 79 Colo. 629, 247 P. 1062 (1926).
<P>But cannot judge as to validity of proposed measure.  An assumption by the
city council of authority to judge of any legislation proposed by such
petition, and to refuse to submit it to the electorate, as required by the
constitution, because it would be invalid if enacted, is an attempted exercise
of legislative power from which the council is excluded by the express terms of
the constitution.  The council has no such authority.  It is no part of its
duty to inquire into the validity of the proposed measure.  Its only duty is
the ministerial one expressly prescribed by the constitution, to submit the
proposed measure to the vote of the electors.  Speer v. People ex rel. Rush, 52
Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912).
<P>Mandamus lies upon refusal of council to submit proposed measure.  When
the municipal council, or any section or body thereof, of a city having by the
constitution power to enact their own charter and from time to time to amend
it, refuses to submit to the electors an amendment proposed in the manner, and
by the number of electors prescribed by the constitution, it is the duty of the
courts by the writ of mandamus to compel the performance by the obstructive
body of the ministerial duty which the constitution imposes.  Speer v. People
ex rel. Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912).
<P>Courts cannot pass upon effect of validity of proposed measure.  While any
proposed amendment of the charter of the city and county of Denver is pending,
the courts have no power to inquire into or pass upon the effect or validity of
the measure proposed.  Speer v. People ex rel. Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P. 768
(1912).
<P>Until after it is approved and placed in charter.  When it has received
the approval of the electors, and assumed a place in the charter, the courts
may, when actual litigants whose rights are affected are before them, determine
the validity and effect of the measure--and only then.  Speer v. People ex rel.
Rush, 52 Colo. 325, 122 P. 768 (1912).

Section 6.  Home rule for cities and towns. The people of each city or
town of this state, having a population of two thousand inhabitants as
determined by the last preceding census taken under the authority of the United
States, the state of Colorado or said city or town, are hereby vested with, and
they shall always have, power to make, amend, add to or replace the charter of
said city or town, which shall be its organic law and extend to all its local
and municipal matters.
<P>Such charter and the ordinances made pursuant thereto in such matters
shall supersede within the territorial limits and other jurisdiction of said
city or town any law of the state in conflict therewith.
<P>Proposals for charter conventions shall be submitted by the city council
or board of trustees, or other body in which the legislative powers of the city
or town shall then be vested, at special elections, or at general, state or
municipal elections, upon petition filed by qualified electors, all in
reasonable conformity with section 5 of this article, and all proceedings
thereon or thereafter shall be in reasonable conformity with sections 4 and 5
of this article.
<P>From and after the certifying to and filing with the secretary of state of
a charter framed and approved in reasonable conformity with the provisions of
this article, such city or town, and the citizens thereof, shall have the
powers set out in sections 1, 4 and 5 of this article, and all other powers
necessary, requisite or proper for the government and administration of its
local and municipal matters, including power to legislate upon, provide,
regulate, conduct and control:
<P>a.  The creation and terms of municipal officers, agencies and
employments; the definition, regulation and alteration of the powers, duties,
qualifications and terms or tenure of all municipal officers, agents and
employees;
<P>b.  The creation of police courts; the definition and regulation of the
jurisdiction, powers and duties thereof, and the election or appointment of
police magistrates therefor;
<P>c.  The creation of municipal courts; the definition and regulation of the
jurisdiction, powers and duties thereof, and the election or appointment of the
officers thereof;
<P>d.  All matters pertaining to municipal elections in such city or town,
and to electoral votes therein on measures submitted under the charter or
ordinances thereof, including the calling or notice and the date of such
election or vote, the registration of voters, nominations, nomination and
election systems, judges and clerks of election, the form of ballots,
balloting, challenging, canvassing, certifying the result, securing the purity
of elections, guarding against abuses of the elective franchise, and tending to
make such elections or electoral votes non-partisan in character;
<P>e.  The issuance, refunding and liquidation of all kinds of municipal
obligations, including bonds and other obligations of park, water and local
improvement districts;
<P>f.  The consolidation and management of park or water districts in such
cities or towns or within the jurisdiction thereof; but no such consolidation
shall be effective until approved by the vote of a majority, in each district
to be consolidated, of the qualified electors voting therein upon the question;
<P>g.  The assessment of property in such city or town for municipal taxation
and the levy and collection of taxes thereon for municipal purposes and special
assessments for local improvements; such assessments, levy and collection of
taxes and special assessments to be made by municipal officials or by the
county or state officials as may be provided by the charter;
<P>h.  The imposition, enforcement and collection of fines and penalties for
the violation of any of the provisions of the charter, or of any ordinance
adopted in pursuance of the charter.
<P>It is the intention of this article to grant and confirm to the people of
all municipalities coming within its provisions the full right of
self-government in both local and municipal matters and the enumeration herein
of certain powers shall not be construed to deny such cities and towns, and to
the people thereof, any right or power essential or proper to the full exercise
of such right.
<P>The statutes of the state of Colorado, so far as applicable, shall
continue to apply to such cities and towns, except insofar as superseded by the
charters of such cities and towns or by ordinance passed pursuant to such
charters.
<P>All provisions of the charters of the city and county of Denver and the
cities of Pueblo, Colorado Springs and Grand Junction, as heretofore certified
to and filed with the secretary of state, and of the charter of any other city
heretofore approved by a majority of those voting thereon and certified to and
filed with the secretary of state, which provisions are not in conflict with
this article, and all elections and electoral votes heretofore had under and
pursuant thereto, are hereby ratified, affirmed and validated as of their date.
<P>Any act in violation of the provisions of such charter or of any ordinance
thereunder shall be criminal and punishable as such when so provided by any
statute now or hereafter in force.
<P>The provisions of this section 6 shall apply to the city and county of
Denver.
<P>This article shall be in all respects self-executing.
<P>As amended November 5, 1912.  (See Laws 1913, p.  669.)

Section 7.  City and county of Denver single school district -
consolidations. The city and county of Denver shall alone always constitute one
school district, to be known as District No.  1, but its conduct, affairs and
business shall be in the hands of a board of education consisting of such
numbers, elected in such manner as the general school laws of the state shall
provide, and until the first election under said laws of a full board of
education which shall be had at the first election held after the adoption of
this amendment, all the directors of school district No.  1, and the respective
presidents of the school boards of school districts Nos.  2, 7, 17 and 21, at
the time this amendment takes effect, shall act as such board of education, and
all districts or special charters now existing are hereby abolished.
<P>The said board of education shall perform all the acts and duties required
to be performed for said district by the general laws of the state.  Except as
inconsistent with this amendment, the general school laws of the state shall,
unless the context evinces a contrary intent, be held to extend and apply to
the said "District No.  1".
<P>Upon the annexation of any contiguous municipality which shall include a
school district or districts or any part of a district, said school district or
districts or part shall be merged in said "District No.  1", which shall then
own all the property thereof, real and personal, located within the boundaries
of such annexed municipality, and shall assume and pay all the bonds,
obligations and indebtedness of each of the said included school districts, and
a proper proportion of those of partially included districts.
<P>Provided, however, that the indebtedness, both principal and interest,
which any school district may be under at the time when it becomes a part, by
this amendment or by annexation, of said "District No.  1", shall be paid by
said school district so owing the same by a special tax to be fixed and
certified by the board of education to the council which shall levy the same
upon the property within the boundaries of such district, respectively, as the
same existed at the time such district becomes a part of said "District No.
1", and in case of partially included districts such tax shall be equitably
apportioned upon the several parts thereof.
<P>Added November 4, 1902.  (See Laws 1901, p. 105.)

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
C.J.S.  See 16 C.J.S., Constitutional Law,  140.
<P>Annexation of territory to city and county of Denver changed boundaries of
school districts affected.  See Board of County Comm'rs v. City &amp  County of
Denver, 150 Colo. 198, 372 P.2d 152 (1962), appeal dismissed, 372 U.S. 226, 83
S. Ct. 679, 9 L. Ed. 714 (1963).
<P>Purpose of this section is merely to require that assets and liabilities
of school districts lying partly or wholly within annexed territory be
consolidated into the constitutionally created single Denver school district.
Board of County Comm'rs v. City &amp  County of Denver, 193 Colo. 211, 565 P.2d 212
(1977).
<P>And not to restrict annexations to certain land.  The language of this
section evinces no intent to restrict Denver annexations to land within other
incorporated municipalities.  Board of County Comm'rs v. City &amp  County of
Denver, 193 Colo. 211, 565 P.2d 212 (1977).
<P>Territory to be annexed not defined.  This section of the state
constitution does not define what territory, whether incorporated or not
incorporated, is subject to annexation.  Board of County Comm'rs v. City &amp
County of Denver, 193 Colo. 211, 565 P.2d 212 (1977).
<P>School district created under this section has power to sue and be sued
and to compromise actions and claims against such district.  School Dist. No. 1
v. Faker, 106 Colo. 356, 105 P.2d 406 (1940).
<P>Office of county superintendent of schools terminated.  Immediately upon
the taking effect of this article of the constitution, the official term of the
superintendent of schools next theretofore elected for the old county of
Arapahoe, terminated.  No such office existed in the new entity, the city and
county of Denver, and there could be no incumbent thereof.  The person chosen
to the office of superintendent of schools for the city and county of Denver,
at the first election under its charter, adopted pursuant to this article, was
not entitled to receive, in such office, the salary prescribed by the general
law, but only that fixed by the charter.  Lawson v. Meyer, 54 Colo. 96, 129 P.
197 (1913).
<P>Applied in Mountain States Legal Foundation v. Denver School Dist. No. 1,
459 F. Supp. 357 (D. Colo. 1978).

of sale, of any spurious, poisonous or drugged spirituous liquors, or
spirituous liquors adulterated with any poisonous or deleterious substance,
mixture, or compound; and shall prohibit the compounding or manufacture within

whether they be denominated spirituous, vinous, malt or otherwise; and shall
also prohibit the sale of any such liquors to be used as a beverage, and any

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
This section deals only with poisonous and drugged liquors.  It was
neither the intent nor the purpose of the framers of the constitution, by this
mandatory provision for the prohibition of poisonous and drugged liquors, to
treat the entire general subject.  This is a mandate upon the general assembly,
imposing a duty to enact laws to carry out this provision directed against a
particular kind of liquor; and, at the same time, it is a limitation upon the
power of the general assembly to pass other laws affecting this kind of liquor,
under any guise or upon any pretense or pretext.  The language is clear, plain,
direct, concise and needs no interpretation.  It carries with it no necessary
implication that, by its adoption, the general assembly was deprived of all
power to prohibit, if it should see fit so to do, or in any other way deal
with, pure and unadulterated intoxicants.  This construction leaves the general
assembly free to act, under the general grant of authority and under its police
power, from time to time, as the exigencies of the case and the needs and
requirements of the people, in reference to the general subject, should be
developed and disclosed.  Schwartz v. People, 46 Colo. 239, 104 P. 92 (1909).

Section 8.  Conflicting constitutional provisions declared inapplicable.
Anything in the constitution of this state in conflict or inconsistent with the
provisions of this amendment is hereby declared to be inapplicable to the
matters and things by this amendment covered and provided for.
<P>Added November 4, 1902.  (See Laws 1901, p. 106.)
<HR>
<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
Parts of constitution in conflict with this article are inapplicable.
Under this section, it is only the things in the constitution that are in
conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of this article that are declared
to be inapplicable to the matters covered therein.  Dixon v. People ex rel.
Elliott, 53 Colo. 527, 127 P. 930 (1912).
<P>The provisions of this section did not apply to art. XXII, Colo. Const.
See People ex rel. Carlson v. City Council, 60 Colo. 370, 153 P. 690 (1915).
<P>Power to issue bonds is not limited by this section.  A bond issue
authorized by municipal ordinance does not violate the limitations imposed by
section 6 as the home rule amendment specifically empowers a home rule city to
issue revenue bonds.  Davis v. City of Pueblo, 158 Colo. 319, 406 P.2d 671
(1965).
<P>Or by  8 of art. XI, Colo. Const.  A home rule city which undertakes to
issue bonds and finance a program of capital improvements, a matter of local
and municipal concern, is not limited in its power to do so by  8 of art. XI,
Colo. Const. Berman v. City &amp  County of Denver, 156 Colo. 538, 400 P.2d 434
(1965).
<P>This article has superseded art. XI, Colo. Const. Davis v. City of Pueblo,

Section 4.  Felony defined. The term felony, wherever it may occur in this
constitution, or the laws of the state, shall be construed to mean any criminal
offense punishable by death or imprisonment in the penitentiary, and none
other.
<HR>
<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
Law reviews.  For article, "Prosecution of Habitual Criminals", see 27
Dicta 376 (1950).  For article, "Commitment of Misdemeanants to the Colorado
State Reformatory", see 29 Dicta 294 (1952).  For article, "One Year Review of
Criminal Law", see 34 Dicta 98 (1957).  For comment on Smalley v. People, 134
Colo. 360, 304 P.2d 902 (1957), appearing below, see 34 Dicta 126 (1957).  For

Dicta 79 (1957).  For article, "One Year Review of Criminal Law and Procedure",
see 40 Den. L. Ctr. J. 89 (1963).
<P>Supreme court has recognized this section as definition of "felony".
Smalley v. People, 134 Colo. 360, 304 P.2d 902 (1956).
<P>Felony determined by punishment prescribed.  The test by which to
determine whether an offense is a felony is by the punishment prescribed.
Smalley v. People, 134 Colo. 360, 304 P.2d 902 (1956).
<P>The test by which to determine whether an offense shall be deemed a felony
or a misdemeanor is made to depend upon whether the same is punishable by
imprisonment in the penitentiary or in the county jail.  People v. Enlow, 135
Colo. 249, 310 P.2d 539 (1957).
<P>Although actual sentence to penitentiary requisite.  While this section
defines the term "felony" wherever it may occur in the constitution or laws to
mean a criminal offense, punishable by death or imprisonment in the
penitentiary and none other, it does not follow, in the absence of language in
the constitution to that effect, that everyone convicted of felony must, of
necessity, be sentenced to the penitentiary.  The constitution does not thus
provide, and such has never been the uniform practice in this state.  Martin v.
People, 69 Colo. 60, 168 P. 1171 (1917).
<P>That offense may be visited alternatively, by imprisonment or fine, does
not change rule.  People v. Godding, 55 Colo. 579, 136 P. 1011 (1913).
<P>"Punishable", as used in this section, is identical in meaning with
"liable to punishment".  People v. Godding, 55 Colo. 579, 136 P. 1011 (1913).
<P>Meaning of "the penitentiary".  "The penitentiary" does not mean a
penitentiary or any penitentiary; it means the penitentiary of this state.
Whether infamous or not, an offense is a felony if punishable by death or
imprisonment in the state penitentiary.  The word "the" is a word of
limitation--a word used before nouns, with a specifying or particularizing
effect, opposed to the indefinite or generalizing force of "a" or "any".
People v. Enlow, 135 Colo. 249, 310 P.2d 539 (1957).
<P>"And none other" means no other offense; that is it relates to the word
"offense", and not to the character or mode of punishment.  Martin v. People,
69 Colo. 60, 168 P. 1171 (1917).
<P>General assembly has no power to depart from classification of section.
Every offense which may be punished by death or imprisonment in the
penitentiary is a felony, even though in the discretion of the court a lesser
penalty may be inflicted.  And though the general assembly may expressly
denominate the offense a high misdemeanor, or the like, it is still in law
felony, the general assembly having no power to depart from this constitutional
classification. People v. Godding, 55 Colo. 579, 136 P. 1011 (1913).
<P>Penitentiary sentence is more severe than reformatory sentence because it
carries the stigma of a felony.  Petsche v. Clingan, 273 F.2d 688 (10th Cir.
1960).
<P>Defendant between ages of 16 and 21 usually sentenced to reformatory.  A
defendant between the ages of 16 and 21, convicted of a felony for the first
time, with certain exceptions, must be sentenced to the state reformatory, the
court having no discretion in the matter.  Barrett v. People, 136 Colo. 144,
315 P.2d 192 (1957).
<P>And, sentence to reformatory will not answer requirements for felony
conviction.  Barrett v. People, 136 Colo. 144, 315 P.2d 192 (1957).
<P>A reformatory sentence does not suffice for a felony conviction under the
habitual criminal act, and where a court has imposed a life sentence under such
circumstances the judgment will be set aside.  Smalley v. People, 134 Colo.
360, 304 P.2d 902 (1956).
<P>Incorrigible reformatory inmates transferable to penitentiary though not
convicted of felony.  The statute authorizing the governor to order the
transfer of incorrigible inmates does not provide that the power can be
exercised by him only if the reformatory inmate involved has been convicted of
a felony.  Tinsley v. Crespin, 137 Colo. 302, 324 P.2d 1033 (1958).
<P>"Felony" distinguished from "feloniously".  Feloniously no longer
possesses the distinctive or restricted meaning it had at the common law.
Under this section, a felony is any criminal offense punishable by death or
imprisonment in the penitentiary; and an act that is done feloniously is one
that is done with a more or less deliberate purpose or intent to commit a crime
of the nature of a felony.  Williams v. People, 26 Colo. 272, 57 P. 701 (1899).
<P>Applied in In re Lowrie, 8 Colo. 499, 9 P. 489, 54 Am. R. 558 (1885); In
re Pratt, 19 Colo. 138, 34 P. 680 (1893); Ritchey v. People, 23 Colo. 314, 47
P. 272 (1896); West v. People, 60 Colo. 488, 156 P. 137 (1915); Martinez v.
Tinsley, 142 Colo. 495, 351 P.2d 879 (1960); Pigg v. Tinsley, 158 Colo. 160,
405 P.2d 687 (1965); People v. Austin, 162 Colo. 10, 424 P.2d 113 (1967);
Sandoval v. People, 162 Colo. 416, 426 P.2d 968 (1967); Lacey v. People, 166

Section 9.  Procedure and requirements for adoption. (1)  Notwithstanding
any provision in sections 4, 5, and 6 of this article to the contrary, the
registered electors of each city and county, city, and town of the state are
hereby vested with the power to adopt, amend, and repeal a home rule charter.
<P>(2)  The general assembly shall provide by statute procedures under which
the registered electors of any proposed or existing city and county, city, or
town may adopt, amend, and repeal a municipal home rule charter.  Action to
initiate home rule shall be by petition, signed by not less than five percent
of the registered electors of the proposed or existing city and county, city,
or town, or by proper ordinance by the city council or board of trustees of a
town, submitting the question of the adoption of a municipal home rule charter
to the registered electors of the city and county, city, or town.  No municipal
home rule charter, amendment thereto, or repeal thereof, shall become effective
until approved by a majority of the registered electors of such city and
county, city, or town voting thereon.  A new city or town may acquire home rule
status at the time of its incorporation.
<P>(3)  The provisions of this article as they existed prior to the effective
date of this section, as they relate to procedures for the initial adoption of
home rule charters and for the amendment of existing home rule charters, shall
continue to apply until superseded by statute.
<P>(4)  It is the purpose of this section to afford to the people of all
cities, cities and counties, and towns the right to home rule regardless of
population, period of incorporation, or other limitation, and for this purpose
this section shall be self-executing.  It is the further purpose of this
section to facilitate adoption and amendment of home rule through such
procedures as may hereafter be enacted by the general assembly.
<P>Adopted November 3, 1970 -- Effective January 1, 1972. (See Laws 1969, p.
1250.); (1) and (2) amended November 6, 1984 -- Effective upon proclamation of
the Governor, January 14, 1985. (For the text of this amendment and the votes

<H1>ARTICLE XXI Recall from Office</H1>
Section 1.  State officers may be recalled. Every elective public officer
of the state of Colorado may be recalled from office at any time by the
registered electors entitled to vote for a successor of such incumbent through
the procedure and in the manner herein provided for, which procedure shall be
known as the recall, and shall be in addition to and without excluding any
other method of removal provided by law.
<P>The procedure hereunder to effect the recall of an elective public officer
shall be as follows:
<P>A petition signed by registered electors entitled to vote for a successor
of the incumbent sought to be recalled, equal in number to twenty-five percent
of the entire vote cast at the last preceding election for all candidates for
the position which the incumbent sought to be recalled occupies, demanding an
election of the successor to the officer named in said petition, shall be filed
in the office in which petitions for nominations to office held by the
incumbent sought to be recalled are required to be filed; provided, if more
than one person is required by law to be elected to fill the office of which
the person sought to be recalled is an incumbent, then the said petition shall
be signed by registered electors entitled to vote for a successor to the
incumbent sought to be recalled equal in number to twenty-five percent of the
entire vote cast at the last preceding general election for all candidates for
the office, to which the incumbent sought to be recalled was elected as one of
the officers thereof, said entire vote being divided by the number of all
officers elected to such office, at the last preceding general election; and
such petition shall contain a general statement, in not more than two hundred
words, of the ground or grounds on which such recall is sought, which statement
is intended for the information of the registered electors, and the registered
electors shall be the sole and exclusive judges of the legality, reasonableness
and sufficiency of such ground or grounds assigned for such recall, and said
ground or grounds shall not be open to review.
<P>Added November 5, 1912.  (See Laws 1913, p. 672.); as amended November 6,
1984 -- Effective upon  proclamation of the Governor, January 14, 1985. (For
the text of this amendment and the votes cast thereon, see L. 84, p. 1147, and
L. 85, p. 1791.)

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
Am. Jur.2d.  See 63 Am. Jur.2d, Public Officers and Employees,  241.
<P>C.J.S.  See 67 C.J.S., Officers and Public Employees,   182-185.
<P>Law reviews.  For note, "A Study of the Colorado Commission on Judicial
Qualifications", see 47 Den. L.J. 491 (1970).
<P>Recall, initiative, and referendum are fundamental rights of a republican
form of government which the people have reserved unto themselves.  Such a
reservation of power in the people must be liberally construed in favor of the
right of the people to exercise it.  Conversely, limitations on the power of
referendum must be strictly construed.  Bernzen v. City of Boulder, 186 Colo.
81, 525 P.2d 416 (1974).
<P>"Every elective public officer of the state of Colorado" refers to
officers of state, as distinguished from members of school boards and county,
city, town, and precinct officers. Guyer v. Stutt, 68 Colo. 422, 191 P. 120
(1920).
<P>Where it was contended that the second paragraph of this section relates
to all elective public officers instead of elective public officers of the
state; but if so why does not the first paragraph omit the words "of the state
of Colorado"?  Since it does not, and since not elsewhere in the article is
there any statement that any other elective public officer may be recalled
under its provisions, it is fair to say that the second paragraph refers to
state officers only.  This conclusion is strengthened by the provision that,
under section 2 of this article, the petition must be submitted to the governor
and that the governor must order the election and fix the date for holding it,
and, by the provisions of section 4 of this article, that the state shall pay
the election expenses of the unrecalled incumbent.  Hall v. Cummings, 73 Colo.
74, 213 P. 328 (1923).
<P>Except as provided in section 4 of this article.  The recall was intended
to apply only to the elective public officers of the state except as provided
in section 4 of this article for the recall of city, county, and town officers.
Guyer v. Stutt, 68 Colo. 422, 191 P. 120 (1920).
<P>Article held inapplicable to school directors.  See Guyer v. Stutt, 68
Colo. 422, 191 P. 120 (1920).
<P>Effect of signature requirement.  The framers, by requiring that a recall
petition contain the signatures of at least 25 percent of all votes cast in the
last election for all candidates for the position which the person sought to be
recalled occupies, assured that a recall election will not be held in response
to the wishes of a small and unrepresentative minority.  Bernzen v. City of
Boulder, 186 Colo. 81, 525 P.2d 416 (1974).
<P>Right is given by third paragraph of section to set up in petition for
recall of  judge facts upon which recall is sought, even though they might tend
to obstruct the administration of the law.  Marians v. People ex rel. Hines, 69
Colo. 87, 169 P. 155 (1917).
<P>As act on which recall based must be mentioned in petition.  The provision
of this section as to statement in the petition intends that when a citizen is
of the opinion that a public officer, subject to recall, has done that which
shows him to be unfit for the office which he holds, the citizen may make such
act the basis of an attempt to recall the officer; and to do that he must
necessarily mention said act in the recall petition.  Marians v. People ex rel.
Hines, 69 Colo. 87, 169 P. 155 (1917).
<P>Dissatisfaction sufficient grounds. Colorado is not a state in which
official misconduct is necessarily required as a ground for recall.  Rather,
the dissatisfaction, whatever the reason, of the electorate is sufficient to
set the recall procedures in motion.  Bernzen v. City of Boulder, 186 Colo. 81,
525 P.2d 416 (1974).
<P>And court's inquiry into sufficiency of grounds prohibited.  Trial court's
inquiry into the sufficiency of the statement of the grounds for recall clearly
infringes upon the powers reserved by the people and was error.  Bernzen v.
City of Boulder, 186 Colo. 81, 525 P.2d 416 (1974).
<P>Recall political in nature.  The limitation on judicial review of the
grounds for recall makes it clear that the recall intended by the framers of
the Colorado constitution is purely political in nature.  Bernzen v. City of
Boulder, 186 Colo. 81, 525 P.2d 416 (1974).
<P>Circulation of petition for recall of district judge is not contempt of
court, where the facts set out in the petition are truthfully stated, though
with uncalled-for bitterness.  Such a petition is privileged.  Marians v.
People ex rel. Hines, 69 Colo. 87, 169 P. 155 (1917).
<P>Applied in People v. Losavio, __ Colo. __, 606 P.2d 856 (1980).

Section 2.  Lotteries prohibited - exceptions. (1)  The general assembly
shall have no power to authorize lotteries for any purpose; except that the
conducting of such games of chance as provided in subsections (2) to (4) of
this section shall be lawful on and after January 1, 1959, and the conducting
of state-supervised lotteries pursuant to subsection (7) of this section shall
be lawful on and after January 1, 1981.
<P>(2)  No game of chance pursuant to this subsection (2) and subsections (3)
and (4) of this section shall be conducted by any person, firm, or
organization, unless a license as provided for in this subsection (2) has been
issued to the firm or organization conducting such games of chance.  The
secretary of state shall, upon application therefor on such forms as shall be
prescribed by the secretary of state and upon the payment of an annual fee as
determined by the general assembly, issue a license for the conducting of such
games of chance to any bona fide chartered branch or lodge or chapter of a
national or state organization or to any bona fide religious, charitable,
labor, fraternal, educational, voluntary firemen's or veterans' organization
which operates without profit to its members and which has been in existence
continuously for a period of five years immediately prior to the making of said
application for such license and has had during the entire five-year period a
dues-paying membership engaged in carrying out the objects of said corporation
or organization, such license to expire at the end of each calendar year in
which it was issued.
<P>(3)  The license issued by the secretary of state shall authorize and
permit the licensee to conduct games of chance, restricted to the selling of
rights to participate and the awarding of prizes in the specific kind of game
of chance commonly known as bingo or lotto, in which prizes are awarded on the
basis of designated numbers or symbols on a card conforming to numbers or
symbols selected at random and in the specific game of chance commonly known as
raffles, conducted by the drawing of prizes or by the allotment of prizes by
chance.
<P>(4)  Such games of chance shall be subject to the following restrictions:
<P>(a)  The entire net proceeds of any game shall be exclusively devoted to
the lawful purposes of organizations permitted to conduct such games.
<P>(b)  No person except a bona fide member of any organization may
participate in the management or operation of any such game.
<P>(c)  No person may receive any remuneration or profit for participating in
the management or operation of any such game.
<P>(5)  Subsections (2) to (4) of this section are self-enacting, but laws
may be enacted supplementary to and in pursuance of, but not contrary to, the
provisions thereof.
<P>(6)  The enforcement of this section shall be under such official or
department of government of the state of Colorado as the general assembly shall
provide.
<P>(7)  Any provision of this constitution to the contrary notwithstanding,
the general assembly may establish a state-supervised lottery.  Unless
otherwise provided by statute, all proceeds from the lottery, after deduction
of prizes and expenses, shall be allocated to the conservation trust fund of
the state for distribution to municipalities and counties for park, recreation,
and open space purposes.
<P>As amended November 4, 1958.  (See Laws 1959, p. 867.); as amended
November 4, 1980 -- Effective upon proclamation of the Governor, December 19,
1980.  (See L. 79, p. 1676.)

<P>Legislative power of state may not be used to authorize lotteries, whether
or not that exercise of legislative power is ratified directly by the people
through a referendum.  In re Interrogatories of Governor Regarding Sweepstakes
Races Act, 196 Colo. 353, 585 P.2d 595 (1978).
<P>All gambling not lottery.  It unquestionably is true that all lotteries
are forms of gambling, but it does not follow that all gambling is a "lottery"
as those terms are defined in law.  Ginsberg v. Centennial Turf Club, 126 Colo.
471, 251 P.2d 926 (1952).
<P>Valuable consideration must be paid, directly or indirectly, for chance to
draw prize by lot, to bring the transaction within the class of lotteries or
gift enterprises that the law prohibits as criminal.  Ginsberg v. Centennial
Turf Club, 126 Colo. 471, 251 P.2d 926 (1952).
<P>Statutes authorizing pari-mutuel betting on racing events are valid
against the contention that such betting constitutes a lottery.  Ginsberg v.
Centennial Turf Club, 126 Colo. 471, 251 P.2d 926 (1952).
<P>Since element of chance does not control races.  While an element of
chance no doubt enters into horse and dog races, it does not control them.  The
bettor makes his own choice of the animal he believes will finish the race in
first, second or third place.  In making that selection he has available the
previous records of the animal and the jockey, and various other facts which he
may take into consideration in choosing the animal upon which he places a
wager.  Ginsberg v. Centennial Turf Club, 126 Colo. 471, 251 P.2d 926 (1952).
<P>And section violated when chance controlling factor in award.  A lottery
is present when consideration is paid for the opportunity to win a prize
awarded by chance and this section is violated if chance is the controlling
factor in award.  In re Interrogatories of Governor Regarding Sweepstakes Races
Act, 196 Colo. 353, 585 P.2d 595 (1978).
<P>Section as basis for jurisdiction.  See Bills v. People, 113 Colo. 326,

Section 2.  Form of recall petition. Any recall petition may be circulated
and signed in sections, provided each section shall contain a full and accurate
copy of the title and text of the petition; and such recall petition shall be
filed in the office in which petitions for nominations to office held by the
incumbent sought to be recalled are required to be filed.
<P>The signatures to such recall petition need not all be on one sheet of
paper, but each signer must add to his signature the date of his signing said
petition, and his place of residence, giving his street number, if any, should
he reside in a town or city.  The person circulating such sheet must make and
subscribe an oath on said sheet that the signatures thereon are genuine, and a
false oath, willfully so made and subscribed by such person, shall be perjury
and be punished as such.  All petitions shall be deemed and held to be
sufficient if they appear to be signed by the requisite number of signers, and
such signers shall be deemed and held to be registered electors, unless a
protest in writing under oath shall be filed in the office in which such
petition has been filed, by some registered elector, within fifteen days after
such petition is filed, setting forth specifically the grounds of such protest,
whereupon the officer with whom such petition is filed shall forthwith mail a
copy of such protest to the person or persons named in such petition as
representing the signers thereof, together with a notice fixing a time for
hearing such protest not less than five nor more than ten days after such
notice is mailed.  All hearings shall be before the officer with whom such
protest is filed, and all testimony shall be under oath.  Such hearings shall
be summary and not subject to delay, and must be concluded within thirty days
after such petition is filed, and the result thereof shall be forthwith
certified to the person or persons representing the signers of such petition.
In case the petition is not sufficient it may be withdrawn by the person or a
majority of the persons representing the signers of such petition, and may,
within fifteen days thereafter, be amended and refiled as an original petition.
The finding as to the sufficiency of any petition may be reviewed by any state
court of general jurisdiction in the county in which such petition is filed,
upon application of the person or a majority of the persons representing the
signers of such petition, but such review shall be had and determined
forthwith.  The sufficiency, or the determination of the sufficiency, of the
petition referred to in this section shall not be held, or construed, to refer
to the ground or grounds assigned in such petition for the recall of the
incumbent sought to be recalled from office thereby.
<P>When such petition is sufficient, the officer with whom such recall
petition was filed, shall forthwith submit said petition, together with a
certificate of its sufficiency to the governor, who shall thereupon order and
fix the date for holding the election not less than thirty days nor more than
sixty days from the date of submission of said petition; provided, if a general
election is to be held within ninety days after the date of submission of said
petition, the recall election shall be held as part of said general election.
<P>Added November 5, 1912.  (See Laws 1913, p. 673.); as amended November 6,
1984 -- Effective upon proclamation of the Governor, January 14, 1985. (For the
text of this amendment and the votes cast thereon, see L. 84, p. 1148, and L.

<P>Importance of petition is fully recognized in this article by the several
provisions concerning it.  The signers must be qualified electors; each one
must add to his signature the date of signing and his place of residence, with
street and number, if in town or city; and the genuineness of the signatures
must be attested under oath by the circulator of the sheets for signature.  The
petition is to contain a statement of the grounds of recall, in not more than
two hundred words, and must be signed by electors in number equal to one
quarter of the vote cast at the last preceding election.  Each section of the
petition must contain its full title and text.  Landrum v. Ramer, 64 Colo. 82,
172 P. 3 (1918).
<P>And petition must conform with this section.  This section provides for a
series of steps leading up to a recall election, and the first act which
partakes of an official character is the filing of a recall petition in the
office of the secretary of state.  The instrument to be filed is to be of the
form and substance prescribed by the amendment, and nothing short of that is a
petition with a right to be filed.  Until there is such a petition, the
movement for an election is not initiated.  Landrum v. Ramer, 64 Colo. 82, 172
P. 3 (1918).
<P>Date of signing and place of residence must be added.  A signature is not
complete, and the writer of it not a "signer" unless there be added the date of
signing and place of residence.  Until it has been determined that the
requisite number of persons have signed, and added to their signatures the
matters required, and the verifying affidavits have been made, no one can say
that there is a recall petition at all.  These matters can be determined from
the papers by inspection and computation.  Landrum v. Ramer, 64 Colo. 82, 172
P. 3 (1918).
<P>However, electors are presumed qualified.  Whether or not signers of a
recall petition are qualified electors need not be considered in the first
instance; their qualification is presumed until a protest is filed.  This is a
reasonable and almost necessary provision, in order to make it possible to file
a petition within a reasonable time after it is presented.  There is no such
reason for presuming correctness as to the matters which appear on the face of
the papers, and it is worthy of notice that there is but one of all the
requirements to which this presumption attaches.  Landrum v. Ramer, 64 Colo.
82, 172 P. 3 (1918).
<P>Secretary of state may examine petition before filing it.  The secretary
of state is not under duty to immediately file in his office a paper presented
to him as a petition for an election to recall an officer.  It is his duty to
examine what is presented and to determine whether it complies with the
requirements of this section, and he is entitled to a reasonable time for such
examination.  Landrum v. Ramer, 64 Colo. 82, 172 P. 3 (1918).
<P>Applied in Bernzen v. City of Boulder, 186 Colo. 81, 525 P.2d 416 (1974).

Section 3.  Resignation - filling vacancy. If such officer shall offer his
resignation, it shall be accepted, and the vacancy caused by such resignation,
or from any other cause, shall be filled as provided by law; but the person
appointed to fill such vacancy shall hold his office only until the person
elected at the recall election shall qualify.  If such officer shall not resign
within five days after the sufficiency of the recall petition shall have been
sustained, the governor shall make or cause to be made publication of notice
for the holding of such election, and officers charged by law with duties
concerning elections shall make all arrangements for such election, and the
same shall be conducted, returned and the result thereof declared in all
respects as in the case of general elections.
<P>On the official ballot at such elections shall be printed in not more than
200 words, the reasons set forth in the petition for demanding his recall, and
in not more than three hundred words there shall also be printed, if desired by
him, the officer's justification of his course in office.  If such officer
shall resign at any time subsequent to the filing thereof, the recall election
shall be called notwithstanding such resignation.
<P>There shall be printed on the official ballot, as to every officer whose
recall is to be voted on, the words, "Shall (name of person against whom the
recall petition is filed) be recalled from the office of (title of the
office)?" Following such question shall be the words, "Yes" and "No", on
separate lines, with a blank space at the right of each, in which the voter
shall indicate, by marking a cross (X), his vote for or against such recall.
<P>On such ballots, under each question, there shall also be printed the
names of those persons who have been nominated as candidates to succeed the
person sought to be recalled; but no vote cast shall be counted for any
candidate for such office, unless the voter also voted for or against the
recall of such person sought to be recalled from said office.  The name of the
person against whom the petition is filed shall not appear on the ballot as a
candidate for the office.
<P>If a majority of those voting on said question of the recall of any
incumbent from office shall vote "no", said incumbent shall continue in said
office; if a majority shall vote "yes", such incumbent shall thereupon be
deemed removed from such office upon the qualification of his successor.
<P>If the vote had in such recall elections shall recall the officer then the
candidate who has received the highest number of votes for the office thereby
vacated shall be declared elected for the remainder of the term, and a
certificate of election shall be forthwith issued to him by the canvassing
board.  In case the person who received the highest number of votes shall fail
to qualify within fifteen days after the issuance of a certificate of election,
the office shall be deemed vacant, and shall be filled according to law.
<P>Candidates for the office may be nominated by petition, as now provided by
law, which petition shall be filed in the office in which petitions for
nomination to office are required by law to be filed not less than fifteen days
before such recall election.
<P>Added November 5, 1912.  (See Laws 1913, p.  674.)

Section 4.  Limitation - municipal corporations may adopt, when. No recall
petition shall be circulated or filed against any officer until he has actually
held his office for at least six months, save and except it may be filed
against any member of the state legislature at any time after five days from
the convening and organizing of the legislature after his election.
<P>After one recall petition and election, no further petition shall be filed
against the same officer during the term for which he was elected, unless the
petitioners signing said petition shall equal fifty percent of the votes cast
at the last preceding general election for all of the candidates for the office
held by such officer as herein above defined.
<P>In any recall election of a state elective officer, if the incumbent whose
recall is sought is not recalled, he shall be repaid from the state treasury
for the expenses of such election in the manner provided by law.  The general
assembly may establish procedures for the reimbursement by a local governmental
entity of expenses incurred by an incumbent elective officer of such
governmental entity whose recall is sought but who is not recalled.
<P>If the governor is sought to be recalled under the provisions of this
article, the duties herein imposed upon him shall be performed by the
lieutenant-governor; and if the secretary of state is sought to be recalled,
the duties herein imposed upon him, shall be performed by the state auditor.
<P>The recall may also be exercised by the registered electors of each
county, city and county, city and town of the state, with reference to the
elective officers thereof, under such procedure as shall be provided by law.
<P>Until otherwise provided by law, the legislative body of any such county,
city and county, city and town may provide for the manner of exercising such
recall powers in such counties, cities and counties, cities and towns, but
shall not require any such recall to be signed by registered electors more in
number than twenty-five percent of the entire vote cast at the last preceding
election, as in section 1 hereof more particularly set forth, for all the
candidates for office which the incumbent sought to be recalled occupies, as
herein above defined.
<P>Every person having authority to exercise or exercising any public or
governmental duty, power or function, shall be an elective officer, or one
appointed, drawn or designated in accordance with law by an elective officer or
officers, or by some board, commission, person or persons legally appointed by
an elective officer or officers, each of which said elective officers shall be
subject to the recall provision of this constitution; provided, that, subject
to regulation by law, any person may, without compensation therefor, file
petitions, or complaints in courts concerning crimes, or do police duty only in
cases of immediate danger to person or property.
<P>Nothing herein contained shall be construed as affecting or limiting the
present or future powers of cities and counties or cities having charters
adopted under the authority given by the constitution, except as in the last
three preceding paragraphs expressed.
<P>In the submission to the electors of any petition proposed under this
article, all officers shall be guided by the general laws of the state, except
as otherwise herein provided.
<P>This article is self-executing, but legislation may be enacted to
facilitate its operations, but in no way limiting or restricting the provisions
of this article, or the powers herein reserved.

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
Power of recall is fundamental right of citizens within a representative
democracy.  Shroyer v. Sokol, 191 Colo. 32, 550 P.2d 309 (1976).
<P>Reservation of power of recall in people must be liberally construed in
favor of the ability to exercise it; conversely, limitations on the power of
recall must be strictly construed.  Shroyer v. Sokol, 191 Colo. 32, 550 P.2d
309 (1976).
<P>Applicability of section.  This section, by referring expressly to the
last preceding general election, shows the recall applies to state officers
only, except as it otherwise makes direct provision for the recall of city,
county, and town officers.  Guyer v. Stutt, 68 Colo. 422, 191 P. 120 (1920).
<P>As recall power not in conflict with state constitution delegated.  The
Colorado constitution delegates the recall power to the subordinate levels of
state government; however, this delegation of power must be limited to
procedural matters and substantive provisions not in conflict with the state
constitution.   Bernzen v. City of Boulder, 186 Colo. 81, 525 P.2d 416 (1974);
Shroyer v. Sokol, 191 Colo. 32, 550 P.2d 309 (1976).
<P>Local officers may not be recalled without further legislation.  A county
officer cannot be recalled without further legislation.  Hall v. Cummings, 73
Colo. 74, 213 P. 328 (1923).
<P>This section provides that the recall may also be exercised with reference
to the elective officers of each county, city, and town, but, until otherwise
provided by law, leaves the manner of exercising the recall power, as to these
officers, to be provided by the legislative body of the county, city, and town,
showing that, for the purpose of the recall, in the sense contained in this
article, the elective officers of counties, cities, and towns are not regarded
as public officers of the state, but as city, county, and town officers.  Of
course, it follows that the recall power mentioned in this section cannot apply
to county, city, and town officers until the manner of exercising it shall be
provided according to law.  Nowhere in the instrument is it said that school
directors may be recalled.  Guyer v. Stutt, 68 Colo. 422, 191 P. 120 (1920).
<P>School directors intentionally omitted from recall.  By classifying
practically all of the elective public officers, and omitting school directors,
it would seem they were intentionally omitted from the recall.  The framers of
the amendment must be presumed to have intended what is expressly and
specifically therein stated rather than what might be inferred from the use of
ambiguous generalities.  Guyer v. Stutt, 68 Colo. 422, 191 P. 120 (1920).
<P>Application of 25 percent limitation.  The 25 percent limitation expressed
in this section does not apply only to local recall ordinances; it also applies
to statutory enactments, such as section 30-10-202.  Shroyer v. Sokol, 191
Colo. 32, 550 P.2d 309 (1976).
<P>Incorporation of provisions into section 30-10-202.  Both the 25 percent
limitation and the electors (not necessarily registered) requirements, set
forth in this section, can be incorporated by implication into section
30-10-202.  Shroyer v. Sokol, 191 Colo. 32, 550 P.2d 309 (1976).
<P>Provision of city charter amendment providing for compulsory, binding
arbitration of all unresolved municipal-police union labor disputes arising
from collective bargaining agreement was unlawful as removing governmental
decision-making from aegis of elected representatives, and placing it in the
hands of an outside person who had no accountability to the public.  Greeley
Police Union v. City Council, 191 Colo. 419, 553 P.2d 790 (1976).

<H1>ARTICLE XXII Intoxicating Liquors</H1>
Section 1.  Repeal of intoxicating liquor laws. On the thirtieth day of
June, 1933, all statutory laws of the state of Colorado heretofore enacted
concerning or relating to intoxicating liquors shall become void and of no
effect; and from and after July 1st, 1933, the manufacture, sale and
distribution of all intoxicating liquors, wholly within the state of Colorado,
shall, subject to the constitution and laws of the United States, be performed
exclusively by or through such agencies and under such regulations as may
hereafter be provided by statutory laws of the state of Colorado; but no such
laws shall ever authorize the establishment or maintenance of any saloon.
<P>As amended November 8, 1932.  (See Laws 1933, p. 390.)

Cross reference.  As to statutory provisions regulating the manufacture
and sale of intoxicating liquors, see  12-47-101 et seq.
<P>Am. Jur.2d.  See 45 Am. Jur.2d, Intoxicating Liquors,  76.
<P>C.J.S. See 16 C.J.S., Constitutional Law,  43; 48 C.J.S., Intoxicating
Liquors,   20, 22, 23, 29, 33, 237.
<P>Law reviews.  For article, "Has The Doctrine of Stare Decisis Been
Abandoned in Colorado?", see 25 Dicta 91 (1948).  For note, "The Power of
Municipalities in Colorado to Levy an Occupational Tax on Liquor Dealers", see
21 Rocky Mt. L. Rev. 209 (1949).
<P>Aim, intent, and primary purpose of the people in the adoption of this
article and of the general assembly in the passage of the liquor code, section
12-47-101 et seq., was to completely outlaw and eradicate the old-time public
saloon or barroom with its well-known obnoxious characteristics, vices and
effects, and, at the same time, to authorize, under proper regulations and
safeguards, the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquors in bona fide
restaurants and hotels.  Heuston v. Gilman, 98 Colo. 301, 56 P.2d 40 (1936);
City &amp  County of Denver v. Gushurst, 120 Colo. 465, 210 P.2d 616 (1949).
<P>Section prohibits establishment or maintenance of any saloon.  People ex
rel. Inter-Church Temperance Movement v. Baker, 133 Colo. 398, 297 P.2d 273
(1956).
<P>But neither this article nor section 12-47-102 prohibits consumption of
liquor where no element of sale is involved and in the absence of such a
prohibition, such consumption is permissive, and this applies as well to a gift
of liquor.  City &amp  County of Denver v. Protocrats, Inc., 136 Colo. 384, 318
P.2d 600 (1957).
<P>Power of regulation of sale of intoxicating liquor is exclusively in
general assembly, to be declared only by statutory laws.  Geer v. Rabinoff, 138
Colo. 8, 328 P.2d 375 (1958).  See Gettman v. Board of County Comm'rs, 122
Colo. 185, 221 P.2d 363 (1950).
<P>By this article the people of the state authorized the general assembly to
designate the agencies which shall perform the acts necessary for the
manufacture, sale, and distribution of liquor, and to exclusively make
regulations concerning the same.  Hamilton v. City &amp  County of Denver, 176
Colo. 6, 490 P.2d 1289 (1971).
<P>But exclusive power of general assembly to regulate is limited to the
specific acts of manufacture, sale and distribution of intoxicating liquors,
and does not affect any other regulation.  Hamilton v. City &amp  County of Denver,
176 Colo. 6, 490 P.2d 1289 (1971).
<P>All other governmental powers, including power to tax, are deliberately
omitted from the constitutional provision.  Hamilton v. City &amp  County of
Denver, 176 Colo. 6, 490 P.2d 1289 (1971).
<P>General assembly may draw line at which beverage becomes intoxicating.
There is no longer any doubt regarding the competence of the general assembly
within reasonable limits to draw the line at which a beverage becomes
intoxicating.  Such action represents a reasonable exercise of legislative
authority under this article.  Big Top, Inc. v. Schooley, 149 Colo. 116, 368
P.2d 201 (1962).
<P>Delegation of power to secretary of state.  If, under such constitutional
provision, the general assembly has any power of delegation of its authority to
regulate, such power has clearly been delegated to the secretary of state as
state licensing authority, who by statute has been given the duties and
authority to make such general rules and regulations and such special rulings
and findings as he may deem necessary for the proper regulation and control of
the sale such liquors.  Geer v. Rabinoff, 138 Colo. 8, 328 P.2d 375 (1958).
See Gettman v. Board of County Comm'rs, 122 Colo. 185, 221 P.2d 363 (1950).
<P>Extent of department of revenue's regulatory power under liquor code.  The
general assembly did not intend department of revenue's regulatory power under
the liquor code to extend to regulation and taxation of liquor sales occurring
outside the state.  Frontier Airlines v. Department of Revenue, 194 Colo. 230,
571 P.2d 1088 (1977).
<P>Board of county commissioners has no authority to regulate the sale of
malt and vinous liquors, other than 3.2 percent beer, but only to grant,
suspend or revoke licenses as provided by statute.  Geer v. Rabinoff, 138 Colo.
8, 328 P.2d 375 (1958).  See Gettman v. Board of County Comm'rs, 122 Colo. 185,
221 P.2d 363 (1950).
<P>Regulation of three and two-tenths percent beer.  The general assembly, in
1945, repealed its declaration that three and two-tenths percent beer was not
intoxicating and left the scheme for its regulation adrift without an anchor.
Since that repeal there remains no legislative standard by which to test
whether such beverage is legally intoxicating, and the question becomes one of
fact which must be determined by the trier of facts from the evidence.  Houpt
v. Town of Milliken, 128 Colo. 147, 260 P.2d 735 (1953).
<P>In the absence of a finding that three and two-tenths percent beer is in
fact intoxicating, a town has the right to reasonably regulate its sale.  Houpt
v. Town of Milliken, 128 Colo. 147, 260 P.2d 735 (1953).
<P>Municipal tax not an infringement of state police power.  Municipal
ordinance which imposed an annual occupation tax on holders of restaurant and
hotel liquor licenses and which explicitly stated "no delinquency in the
payment of this tax shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of the liquor
license" did not amount to a regulation of the liquor industry encroaching upon
the state's police power.  Tom's Tavern, Inc. v. City of Boulder, 186 Colo.
321, 526 P.2d 1328 (1974).
<P>Distinction between power of state to regulate and power of city to tax.
The authority of the state to regulate the sale of liquor is predicated upon
the police power, and is exercised in the interest of the health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the people.  On the other hand, the power of the
city to levy a tax is based upon its taxing power to provide revenue for the
maintenance of local government.  This distinction is thoroughly established,
and with few exceptions, universally recognized.  Post v. City of Grand
Junction, 118 Colo. 434, 195 P.2d 958, 6 A.L.R.2d 731 (1948).
<P>"Statutory laws of the state of Colorado", as contained in this article,
does not authorize the adoption of a municipal ordinance in conflict with the
state law on the subject, the word "statutory" refers only to a state or
federal statute and not to a municipal ordinance.  Geer v. Rabinoff, 138 Colo.
8, 328 P.2d 375 (1958).
<P>Applied in People v. Kagan, 195 Colo. 76, 575 P.2d 416 (1978).

<H1>ARTICLE XXIV Old Age Pensions</H1>
Section 1.  Fund created. A fund to be known as the old age pension fund
is hereby created and established in the treasury of the state of Colorado.
<P>Added November 3, 1936; as amended November 6, 1956.  (See Laws 1937, p.
881; Laws 1957, p. 554.)
<HR>
<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
C.J.S.  See 81 C.J.S., Social Security and Public Welfare,  96.
<P>Law reviews.  For article, "One Year Review of Constitutional and
Administrative Law", see 34 Dicta 79 (1957).
<P>Constitutionality of article.  This article is not repugnant to section 4
of the enabling act; neither is it repugnant to  10 of art. I, U.S. Const.,  4
of art. IV, U.S. Const., and  1 of amend. XIV, U.S. Const.; nor is it invalid
as containing matter which is not constitutional or fundamental in character;
and it is not invalid because never lawfully or actually adopted by the vote of
the electors contrary to  5 of art. II, Colo. Const., and  2 of art. XIX, Colo.
Const.  In re Interrogatories by Governor, 99 Colo. 591, 65 P.2d 7 (1937).
<P>This article does not conflict with  31 of art. V, Colo. Const. and,
hence, does not supersede it.  In re Interrogatories by Governor, 99 Colo. 591,
65 P.2d 7 (1937).
<P>And this section is self-executing as to estabishment of specified fund;
otherwise not, save that the fund so created becomes the fund out of which
payments will be made under the laws heretofore in force until this article is
otherwise effectuated by legislation.  In re Interrogatories by Governor, 99
Colo. 591, 65 P.2d 7 (1937); Fairall v. Frisbee, 104 Colo. 553, 92 P.2d 748
(1939).
<P>This amendment is not self-executing except as to the establishment of the
pension fund.  Bedford v. Sinclair, 112 Colo. 176, 147 P.2d 486 (1944).
<P>This article has no application to proceeds of city sales and use tax;
state taxation in the same field as that of a municipality can coexist.  The
old age pension and the state sales and use tax statutes deal exclusively with
state levies and have no application to taxes levied by home rule cities, which
are purely local and municipal.  Berman v. City &amp  County of Denver, 156 Colo.
538, 400 P.2d 434 (1965).
<P>Outstanding feature of pension fund program is its trust fund character.
The Colorado supreme court has recognized that the beneficiaries have a high
degree of interest in the preservation of the fund. Gonzales v. Shea, 318 F.
Supp. 572 (D. Colo. 1970), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 403 U.S. 927,
91 S. Ct. 2259, 29 L. Ed.2d 706 (1971).
<P>Applied in City &amp  County of Denver v. People, 103 Colo. 565, 88 P.2d 89
(1939).

Section 2.  Moneys allocated to fund. There is hereby set aside, allocated
and allotted to the old age pension fund sums and money as follows:
<P>(a)  Beginning January 1, 1957, eighty-five percent of all net revenue
accrued or accruing, received or receivable from any and all excise taxes now
or hereafter levied upon sales at retail, or any other purchase transaction;
together with eighty-five percent of the net revenue derived from any excise
taxes now or hereafter levied upon the storage, use, or consumption of any
commodity or product; together with eighty-five percent of all license fees
imposed by the provisions of sections 138-6-1 to 138-6-42, both inclusive, of
Colorado Revised Statutes 1953, and amendments thereto; provided, however, that
no part of the revenue derived from excise taxes now or hereafter levied, for
highway purposes, upon gasoline or other motor fuel, shall be made a part of
said old age pension fund.
<P>(b)  Beginning January 1, 1957, eighty-five percent of all net revenue
accrued or accruing, received or receivable from taxes of whatever kind upon
all malt, vinous, or spirituous liquor, both intoxicating and non-intoxicating,
and license fees connected therewith.
<P>(c)  All unexpended money in any fund of the state of Colorado, or
political subdivision thereof, as of January 1, 1957, which prior to said date
has been allocated to the payment of an old age pension.
<P>(d)  All grants in aid from the federal government for old age assistance.
<P>(e)  All inheritance taxes and incorporation fees appropriated under

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
C.J.S.  See 81 C.J.S., Social Security and Public Welfare,   96-101.
<P>Amendment of section constitutional.  This section and section 5 of this
article are not invalid by reason of the fact that the 1936 amendment of the
section attempted to extend or amend an act by reference to its title only,
contrary to the provisions of  24 of art. V, Colo. Const.  In re
Interrogatories of the Governor, 99 Colo. 591, 65 P.2d 7 (1937).
<P>Amendment not retroactive.  The amendment providing, inter alia, that
beginning January 1, 1937, 85 percent of the revenue derived from excise taxes
on liquors shall become a part of the old-age pension fund, is not retroactive.
City &amp  County of Denver v. People, 103 Colo. 565, 88 P.2d 89, appeal dismissed,
307 U.S. 615, 59 S. Ct. 1044, 83 L. Ed. 1496, rehearing denied, 308 U.S. 633,
60 S. Ct. 69, 84 L. Ed. 527 (1939).
<P>Provision self-executing.  This section of the constitution sets aside 85
percent of license fees and allots them to the old-age pension fund, which
provision is self-executing.  Sheridan Hotel, Inc. v. Perkins, 118 Colo. 499,
197 P.2d 468 (1948).
<P>Funds allocated but no tax levied under this amendment.  While the pension
amendment to the constitution directly allocates certain excise tax levies and
license fees, and, contingently, other revenues, to the old-age pension fund,
still, in and of its terms, such amendment does not operate to levy a tax of
any kind upon anything.  Bedford v. Sinclair, 112 Colo. 176, 147 P.2d 486
(1944).
<P>Revenue from municipal tax not included.  Subsection (a) contains no
language which expressly or by reasonable inference refers to taxes or license
fees that have been imposed by a municipality, or otherwise than by the usual
legislative procedure of the state as a whole.  State v. City &amp  County of
Denver, 106 Colo. 519, 107 P.2d 317 (1940).
<P>The revenue from a cigarette tax collected under an ordinance of the city
of Denver does not come within the purview of this section.  State v. City &amp
County of Denver, 106 Colo. 519, 107 P.2d 317 (1940).
<P>A tax imposed on all liquor dealers in the city of Grand Junction by a
city ordinance is not a tax upon liquor, but an occupational excise tax upon
the business of selling liquor, and such taxes do not come within the purview
of this section of the constitution.  Post v. City of Grand Junction, 118 Colo.
434, 195 P.2d 958, 6 A.L.R.2d 731 (1948).
<P>Mandamus will not lie to compel funding.  Mandamus will not lie to compel
state officers to set aside and place in old age pension fund 85 percent of net
revenues from a public revenue service tax, although petitioner was not
receiving minimum pension authorized.  Conklin v. Armstrong, 106 Colo. 376, 105
P.2d 854 (1940).
<P>Courts will not be responsible for diverting state funds in interest of
particular fund.  Since this amendment does not in terms segregate liquor
values from values of other property, nor has the general assembly clothed the
state taxing authority with power to make such segregation, or upon its value
to levy a tax in behalf of the pension fund, nor has such authority attempted
to take such steps, it was held that the courts would not assume responsibility
for diverting legally established state funds in the interest of a particular
fund, however worthy and appealing.  Bedford v. Sinclair, 112 Colo. 176, 147
P.2d 486 (1944).
<P>But certain percentage of all revenue from liquor taxes should go to
pension fund.  Since by this amendment a certain percentage of all revenue
arising from taxes of whatever kind on liquor shall be allocated to the old age
pension fund, to the extent funds resulting from ad valorem levies by the
state, the counties, municipalities and school districts are augmented by the
value of liquor included in total valuations, it was held that such percentage
should be withheld from the funds of those several legal entities and allocated
to the pension fund.  Bedford v. Sinclair, 112 Colo. 176, 147 P.2d 486 (1944).
<P>Where proceedings should have been dismissed by trial court.  Where a
county treasurer, perplexed as to his duty in relation to the allocation of
revenues, sought a declaratory judgment in the premises, and the trial court
adjudged that subsection (b) of this section operates upon all taxes on liquor,
including ad valorem taxes, but that such provision "is not self-executing", it
was held that the trial court should have dismissed the proceedings.  Bedford
v. Sinclair, 112 Colo. 176, 147 P.2d 486 (1944).
<P>Applied in People ex rel. Inter-Church Temperance Movement v. Baker, 133
Colo. 398, 297 P.2d 273 (1956).

Section 8.  County commissioners to fix rates for water, when. The general
assembly shall provide by law that the board of county commissioners in their
respective counties, shall have power, when application is made to them by
either party interested, to establish reasonable maximum rates to be charged
for the use of water, whether furnished by individuals or corporations.

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
Cross references.  As to fixing a reasonable maximum rate of compensation
for water, see also  37-85-103 et seq.  As to public ownership of natural
stream waters, see  5 of this article.
<P>Am. Jur.2d.  See 45 Am. Jur.2d, Irrigation,  53.
<P>Purpose of this section.  The evident purpose of this section is that
actual and beneficial consumers of water may not be subjected to extortionate
demands.  Combs v. Agricultural Ditch Co., 17 Colo. 146, 28 P. 966, 31 Am. St.
R. 275 (1892).
<P>The primary objects of this section were to encourage and protect the
beneficial use of water, and, while recognizing the carrier's right to
reasonable compensation for its carriage, collectible in a reasonable manner,
the constitution also unequivocally asserts the consumer's right to its use
upon payment of such compensation.  Wheeler v. Northern Colo. Irrigation Co.,
10 Colo. 582, 17 P. 487, 3 Am. St. R. 603 (1887).
<P>"To be charged for the use of water", relating to the carrier's
compensation, does not recognize a like ownership in such use.  Wheeler v.
Northern Colo. Irrigation Co., 10 Colo. 582, 17 P. 487, 3 Am. St. R. 603
(1887).
<P>Section forbids enforcement of unreasonable payment demands.  By fair
implication, this section forbids the carrier's enforcement of unreasonable and
oppressive demands in relation to the time and manner of collecting rates.
Wheeler v. Northern Colo. Irrigation Co., 10 Colo. 582, 17 P. 487, 3 Am. St. R.
603 (1887).
<P>The constitutional right of individual consumers, upon tender of the
carriage fee, to water diverted by a carrier and not already applied to
beneficial uses, can no more be evaded or qualified by a regulation compelling
the purchase of stock as a condition precedent to use, than it can by a
regulation fixing a sum in excess of the price charged for carriage, to be thus
paid for the constitutional right of user.  Combs v. Agricultural Ditch Co., 17
Colo. 146, 28 P. 966, 31 Am. St. R. 275 (1892).
<P>Power to fix rate vested exclusively in county commissioners.  Under this
section neither the general assembly nor any court has power to fix a maximum
rate for the delivery of water.  The power is vested exclusively in the boards
of county commissioners.  The board can act only on the petition for an
interested party.  The rate fixed by the board, when acting within its
jurisdiction, is binding upon all persons affected thereby until vacated by the
decree of some court of competent jurisdiction.  The board is not charged with
the duty of seeing that the prescribed rate is observed by the carriers of
water.  McCracken v. Montezuma Water &amp  Land Co., 25 Colo. App. 280, 137 P. 903
(1914).
<P>No stipulation of the parties and no decree of the trial court can have
any validity as to the rates to be charged by a ditch company to users who are
neither stockholders nor coowners of such ditch company, the authority to set
reasonable rates for the carriage and delivery of such water being vested
exclusively in the board of county commissioners.  Farmers Water Dev. Co. v.
Barrett, 151 Colo. 140, 376 P.2d 693 (1962).
<P>And ratemaking power cannot be delegated to others.  Farmers Water Dev.
Co. v. Barrett, 151 Colo. 140, 376 P.2d 693 (1962).
<P>General assembly cannot confer power to fix rates on carrier.  This
section expressly commands the general assembly to provide by law that county
commissioners shall have the power to fix rates for the use of water; it is not
a divisible power and the general assembly cannot divest itself thereof and
confer it upon the carrier.  Northern Colo. Irrigation Co. v. Board of Comm'rs,
95 Colo. 555, 38 P.2d 889 (1934); Farmers Water Dev. Co. v. Barrett, 151 Colo.
140, 376 P.2d 693 (1962).
<P>Contract fixing rate between carrier and consumer not binding.  A contract
between the carrier and the consumer, whereby the carrier attempts to fix and
collect the rate for carrying and delivering water to the consumer, is not
binding on the latter because this section of the constitution and section
37-85-103 et seq., which provide for the fixing of reasonable maximum rates
charged for water, have conferred upon and vested in the county commissioners
of the respective counties the exclusive power to fix the rate for such
service. Farmers Water Dev. Co. v. Barrett, 151 Colo. 140, 376 P.2d 693 (1962).
<P>County commissioners may only establish maximum amount of rate.  They
cannot be empowered to dictate the exact rate that shall be collected, or to
fix the time or conditions of payment.  The time and conditions of payment are
proper subjects for legislation.  Wheeler v. Northern Colo. Irrigation Co., 10
Colo. 582, 17 P. 487, 3 Am. St. R. 603 (1887).
<P>This section provides for a tribunal to fix the maximum rate in case of
disagreement.  Wheeler v. Northern Colo. Irrigation Co., 10 Colo. 582, 17 P.
487, 3 Am. St. R. 603 (1887).
<P>With maximum rates subject to judicial control.  The maximum reasonable
rates fixed by the board of county commissioners are subject to judicial
control.  Montezuma Water &amp  Land Co. v. McCracken, 62 Colo. 394, 163 P. 286
(1917).
<P>When courts may interfere with rate making.  The only time the courts can
interfere with rate making is after the board of county commissioners either
acts or fails to act, and then only to determine whether what was done or not
done was unreasonable, arbitrary or an abuse of discretion.  Farmers Water Dev.
Co. v. Barrett, 151 Colo. 140, 376 P.2d 693 (1962).
<P>However, court lacks jurisdiction to fix rates.  Where section 37-85-103
et seq. enacted pursuant to this section, provides that the board of county
commissioners shall have power to establish reasonable maximum rates to be
charged for the use of water, the trial court erred in enjoining the board from
fixing rates in excess of 20 dollars per cubic foot for carriage and delivery
of such water pursuant to prior decree of district court, that court being
without jurisdiction to fix such rates.  Farmers Water Dev. Co. v. Barrett, 151
Colo. 140, 376 P.2d 693 (1962).
<P>Assessment provided for by court decree not rate fixing.  An assessment
provided for by a court decree directing a ditch company to assess and
plaintiff to pay a reasonable rate for carrying extra water for plaintiff is
not a rate to be charged for use of water to be determined by the county
commissioners, and the court's decree does not usurp the rate power of the
county commissioners.  Zoller v. Mail Creek Ditch Co., 31 Colo. App. 99, 498
P.2d 1169 (1972).
<P>Irrigation company must provide service for reasonable maximum rate
established.  A corporation operating a canal or ditch for conveying water for
irrigation to the proprietors of the land thereunder is bound to carry and
deliver water to the class of consumers named in its certificate of
incorporation, and the service must be performed for a reasonable maximum
charge, to be fixed by the board of county commissioners, upon proper
application made.  Northern Colo. Irrigation Co. v. Pouppirt, 22 Colo. App.
563, 127 P. 125 (1912).
<P>And cannot complain if rate fixed gives adequate return.  An irrigation
company has nothing of which to complain, if the rate fixed by the board
provided for by this section is an adequate return for its services and on the
value of its property, even if the county board erred in the method of arriving
at the rate.  Pioneer Irrigation Co. v. Board of Comm'rs, 251 F. 264 (8th Cir.
1918).
<P>Carrying ditch is not given power to appropriate water for sale and hence
cannot by the purchase of water acquire any right or title to it.  Pioneer
Irrigation Co. v. Board of Comm'rs, 236 F. 790 (D. Colo. 1916), aff'd, 251 F.
264 (8th Cir. 1918).
<P>Mutual ditch companies do not charge for use of water.  Zoller v. Mail
Creek Ditch Co., 31 Colo. App. 99, 498 P.2d 1169 (1972).
<P>But consumers, who are sole owners of ditch and diversion works, share
costs of operation without profit.  Zoller v. Mail Creek Ditch Co., 31 Colo.
App. 99, 498 P.2d 1169 (1972).
<P>Applied in Golden Canal Co. v. Bright, 8 Colo. 144, 6 P. 142 (1884); Post
Printing &amp  Publishing Co. v. Shafroth, 53 Colo. 129, 124 P. 176 (1912).

<HR>
Section 3.  Persons entitled to receive pensions. From and after January
1, 1957, every citizen of the United States who has been a resident of the
state of Colorado for such period as the general assembly may determine, who
has attained the age of sixty years or more, and who qualifies under the laws
of Colorado to receive a pension, shall be entitled to receive the same;
provided, however, that no person otherwise qualified shall be denied a pension
by reason of the fact that he is the owner of real estate occupied by him as a
residence; nor for the reason that relatives may be financially able to
contribute to his support and maintenance; nor shall any person be denied a
pension for the reason that he owns personal property which by law is exempt
from execution or attachment; nor shall any person be required, in order to
receive a pension, to repay, or promise to repay, the state of Colorado any
money paid to him as an old age pension.
<P>Added November 3, 1936; as amended November 6, 1956.  (See Laws 1937, p.
882; Laws 1957, p. 555.)

Cross reference.  As to eligibility for public assistance in the form of
old age pensions, see  26-2-111.
<P>C.J.S.  See 81 C.J.S., Social Security and Public Welfare,  97.
<P>Pension classifications unconstitutional.  The establishment of two
classes of needy citizens between the ages of 60 and 65, indistinguishable from
each other except that one is composed of residents who have resided
continuously in Colorado for 35 years, and the second for residents who have
resided in Colorado less than 35 continuous years, which works to deny
critically needed old-age pension benefits to those who have resided in
Colorado less than 35 continuous years, is unconstitutional as violative of
equal protection.  Jeffrey v. Colorado State Dep't of Social Servs., __ Colo.
<P>, 599 P.2d 874 (1979).
<P>Exempt personal property determined under Colorado rather than federal
law.  Provision of this section excluding from calculations of need "personal
property which by law is exempt from execution or attachment", refers to
Colorado law, not federal law, by reason of section 26-2-109 implementing the
constitution. Francis v. Colorado Bd. of Social Servs., 184 Colo. 136, 518 P.2d
1174 (1974).
<P>Classification of railroad retirement annuity as income in computing need
for old age pension does not conflict with this section.  Francis v. Colorado
Bd. of Social Servs., 184 Colo. 136, 518 P.2d 1174 (1974).
<P>But income including railroad retirement annuities is not personal
property within the meaning of this provision.  Francis v. Colorado Bd. of
Social Servs., 184 Colo. 136, 518 P.2d 1174 (1974).

<P>Section complete in itself and precludes legislative action.  This section
does not merely declare principles.  On the contrary, it is complete in itself,
and by its own terms, confers a right and prescribes the rules and conditions
by means of which such right may be enforced.  It employs no language to
indicate that the subject with which it deals is to be referred to the general
assembly for action.  Town of Lyons v. City of Longmont, 54 Colo. 112, 129 P.
198 (1912).
<P>And is self-executing.  This section confers a right and prescribes the
rule by means of which, in an appropriate action in a court of competent
jurisdiction, that right may be enforced without further legislation, and is,
therefore, self-executing.  Town of Lyons v. City of Longmont, 54 Colo. 112,
129 P. 198 (1912).
<P>Although does not provide for assessment of compensation.  This section is
not self-executing in the sense that it does not provide the manner in which
compensation can be assessed; it nevertheless does confer the right in express
terms.  Lamborn v. Bell, 18 Colo. 346, 32 P. 989, 20 L.R.A. 241 (1893).
<P>Assessment of compensation is expressly provided for by statute.  See
Lamborn v. Bell, 18 Colo. 346, 32 P. 989, 20 L.R.A. 241 (1893).
<P>Section confers right-of-way upon all persons and corporations.
Manifestly, the intent of this section was to confer upon all persons and
corporations the right-of-way across lands, either public or private, by
whomsoever owned, through which to carry water for domestic purposes, and
necessarily embraces a municipal corporation seeking a right-of-way for such
purposes.  Town of Lyons v. City of Longmont, 54 Colo. 112, 129 P. 198 (1912).
<P>Under this provision of the constitution and   37-86-104 to 37-86-106,
dealing with the construction of ditches on rights-of-way through private
property, a plaintiff is entitled to possession, under the eminent domain laws,
of the lands of a defendant of such dimensions as are necessary to convey his
irrigation water to his own property.  Mott v. Coleman, 132 Colo. 306, 287 P.2d
655 (1955).
<P>It covers every form in which water is used, domestic, irrigation, mining
and manufacturing, and its object is to be ascertained from its language and
not from the title or heading the compiler of the constitution has given the
article in which it is found.  Town of Lyons v. City of Longmont, 54 Colo. 112,
129 P. 198 (1912).
<P>And right to spill waste water is part of right to transport water where
essential to the maintenance of the ditch.  Hitti v. Montezuma Valley
Irrigation Co., __ Colo. App. __, 599 P.2d 918 (1979).
<P>Right-of-way for ditch to convey water to operate electric light plant may
be condemned-- that being a manufacturing purpose within the meaning of this
and the preceding section.  Lamborn v. Bell, 18 Colo. 346, 32 P. 989, 20 L.R.A.
241 (1893).
<P>Section covers milling of ore.  This section,  14 of art. II, Colo.
Const., and sections 38-1-101 and 38-2-101 cover the milling of ore.  Pine
Martin Mining Co. v. Empire Zinc Co., 90 Colo. 529, 11 P.2d 221 (1932).
<P>As "milling" is synonymous with "manufacturing".  See Lamborn v. Bell, 18
Colo. 346, 32 P. 989, 20 L.R.A. 241 (1893).
<P>Section contemplates use of pipelines in permitting right-of-way.  This
section does not mention a pipeline, but its evident object was to permit a
right-of-way for a conduit through which to convey water for the purposes
designated, and hence, the kind of conduit employed and utilized is of no
material moment, so far as any question in the case at bar is involved.  Town
of Lyons v. City of Longmont, 54 Colo. 112, 129 P. 198 (1912).
<P>Applied in Trippe v. Overacker, 7 Colo. 72, 1 P. 695 (1883); Knoth v.
Barclay, 8 Colo. 300, 6 P. 924 (1885); Wheeler v. Northern Colo. Irrigating

Section 4.  The state board of public welfare to administer fund. The
state board of public welfare, or such other agency as may be authorized by law
to administer old age pensions, shall cause all moneys deposited in the old age
pension fund to be paid out as directed by this article and as required by
statutory provisions not inconsistent with the provisions hereof, after
defraying the expense of administering the said fund.

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
C.J.S.  See 81 C.J.S., Social Security and Public Welfare,   96-101.
<P>Intended effect of this section is that the pensioners shall receive all
moneys that enter into the old age pension fund, except such as are required to
defray the expense of administering the fund.  Redmon v. Davis, 115 Colo. 415,
174 P.2d 945 (1946).
<P>Balance of allocation for administrative expenses belongs to pensioners.
The intended effect of this section is that the pensioners shall receive all
moneys that enter into the old age pension fund except that allocated for
administrative expenses, and if only a portion of the latter is used for the
payment of such expenses, the balance belongs to the pensioners.  Davis v.
Pensioners Protective Ass'n, 110 Colo. 380, 135 P.2d 142 (1943).
<P>Administration expenses of other relief schemes cannot be paid from old
age  fund.  Insofar as money allocated from the old age pension fund is used to
defray the expenses of administering relief schemes other than those of the old
age pension plan of relief, this constitutes an unconstitutional diversion of
pension funds from their constitutionally prescribed use.  Davis v. Pensioners
Protective Ass'n, 110 Colo. 380, 135 P.2d 142 (1943).
<P>Authority to prorate fund.  Under this article authority to prorate the
old age pension fund is vested by necessary implication in state board of
public welfare.  Fairall v. Redmon, 107 Colo. 195, 110 P.2d 247 (1941).
<P>Payment of funeral and burial expenses of deceased old age pensioners out
of the old age pension fund is payment of a "pension" as the word is used in
this article and does not violate this section or section 7 of this article.
Redmon v. Davis, 115 Colo. 415, 174 P.2d 945 (1946).

Section 6.  Diverting unappropriated water - priority preferred uses. The
right to divert the unappropriated waters of any natural stream to beneficial
uses shall never be denied.  Priority of appropriation shall give the better
right as between those using the water for the same purpose; but when the
waters of any natural stream are not sufficient for the service of all those
desiring the use of the same, those using the water for domestic purposes shall
have the preference over those claiming for any other purpose, and those using
the water for agricultural purposes shall have preference over those using the
same for manufacturing purposes.

Section 5.  Revenues for old age pension fund continued. The excise tax on
sales at retail, together with all license fees levied by the provisions of
sections 138-6-1 to 138-6-42, both inclusive, Colorado Revised Statutes 1953,
and amendments thereto, are hereby continued in full force and effect beyond
the date on which said taxes and license fees would otherwise expire, and shall
continue until repealed or amended; provided, however, that no law providing
revenue for the old age pension fund shall be repealed, nor shall any such law
be amended so as to reduce the revenue provided for the old age pension fund,
except in the event that at the time of such repeal or amendment, revenue is
provided for the old age pension fund in an amount at least equal to that
provided by the measure amended or repealed during the calendar year
immediately preceding the proposed amendment or repeal.

<P>This section and three following sections comprise all of constitution
that deals with subject of water rights, a subject second to none in its
importance and intricacy.  In re Senate Resolution, 9 Colo. 620, 21 P. 470
(1886); Archuleta v. Boulder &amp  Weld County Ditch Co., 118 Colo. 43, 192 P.2d
891 (1948).
<P>This section guarantees right to appropriate, not a right to speculate,
and the right to appropriate is for use, not merely for profit.  Colorado River
Water Conservation Dist. v. Vidler Tunnel Water Co., 197 Colo. 413, 594 P.2d
566 (1979).
<P>And this section was intended to preserve historical appropriation system
of water rights upon which the irrigation economy in Colorado was founded,
rather than to assure public access to waters for purposes other than
appropriation.  People v. Emmert, ____ Colo. ____, 597 P.2d 1025 (1979).
<P>As rights of water appropriation are reserved to the people. Central Colo.
Water Conservancy Dist. v. Colorado River Water Conservation Dist., 186 Colo.
193, 526 P.2d 302 (1974).
<P>The rivers and streams and the right to appropriate the waters therefrom
belong to the people.  Central Colo. Water Conservancy Dist. v. Colorado River
Water Conservation Dist., 186 Colo. 193, 526 P.2d 302 (1974).
<P>State justified in asserting ownership of all natural streams. The natural
streams of Colorado are nonnavigable.  Their entire volume is made up of the
rains and snow which fall upon its surface.  The state was therefore justified
in asserting by virtue of this section its ownership of all these natural
streams.  Congress in the enabling act, and the president in proclaiming the
admission of the state must be assumed to have been aware of the situation, and
to have consented to the assertion of title so made by the state.  Stockman v.
Leddy, 55 Colo. 24, 129 P. 220, 1916B Ann. Cas. 1052 (1912).
<P>And general assembly has power and is charged with duty to protect
interest of state in natural streams. The public moneys may be appropriated for
the protection and defense of the rights of the state, and its citizens, in
these waters.  Stockman v. Leddy, 55 Colo. 24, 129 P. 220, 1916B Ann. Cas. 1052
(1912).
<P>So it is highly questionable whether general assembly can give town
permission to befoul and contaminate public streams by discharging raw and
unpurified sewage therein.  Mack v. Town of Craig, 68 Colo. 337, 191 P. 101
(1920).
<P>"Not heretofore appropriated", in this section, is a mere recognition of
the rights acquired by appropriations then already existing.  Fort Collins
Milling &amp  Elevator Co. v. Larimer &amp  Weld Irrigation Co., 61 Colo. 45, 156 P.
140 (1916).  See Colorado Milling &amp  Elevator Co. v. Larimer &amp  Weld Irrigation
Co., 26 Colo. 47, 56 P. 185 (1899).
<P>The use of the words "not heretofore appropriated", in this section, and
"unappropriated waters", in section 6 of this article, clearly indicates an
intention to limit the application of these provisions to the future.
Strickler v. City of Colorado Springs, 16 Colo. 61, 26 P. 313, 25 Am. St. R.
245 (1891).
<P>"Public" and "people" in this section are synonymous, and the declaration
that the unappropriated waters are "the property of the public", and "dedicated
to the use of the people of the state, subject to appropriation", does not mean
that the ownership of water should remain inalienable in the public, but that
it should pass to the people by the first appropriation to a beneficial use.
Wyatt v. Larimer &amp  Weld Irrigation Co., 1 Colo. App. 480, 29 P. 906 (1892),
rev'd on other grounds, 18 Colo. 298, 33 P. 144 (1893).
<P>Public interest in preserving water resources. Under the inferences in
this section and under the many cases of the supreme court, the public has a
vital interest in preserving the water resources of this state and adhering to
correct rules for the allotment and administration of water.  In re Wadsworth,
193 Colo. 95, 562 P.2d 1114 (1977).
<P>Waters of natural streams of Colorado are, under constitution, property of
public, not any segment thereof or any geographical portion of the state, and
the right to appropriate water and put it to beneficial use at any place in the
state is no longer open to question.  Metropolitan Sub. Water Users Ass'n v.
Colorado River Water Conservation Dist., 148 Colo. 173, 365 P.2d 273 (1961).
<P>And title to unappropriated waters is vested in public, with perpetual
right to its use in the people. Wheeler v. Northern Colo. Irrigation Co., 10
Colo. 582, 17 P. 487, 3 Am. St. R. 603 (1887).  See Strickler v. City of
Colorado Springs, 16 Colo. 61, 26 P. 313, 25 Am. St. R. 245 (1891).
<P>Such waters subject to appropriation as private property. By this and the
following section the people of Colorado dedicated to the public all
unappropriated waters of every natural stream within its borders, and made them
subject to appropriation as private property.  Cascade Town Co. v. Empire Water
&amp  Power Co., 181 F. 1011 (D. Colo. 1910), rev'd on other grounds, 205 F. 123
(8th Cir. 1913); People ex rel. Park Reservoir Co. v. Hinderlider, 98 Colo.
505, 57 P.2d 894 (1936); Metropolitan Sub. Water Users Ass'n v. Colorado River
Water Conservation Dist., 148 Colo. 173, 365 P.2d 273 (1961).
<P>All unappropriated waters in the streams belong to the state, the public,
the people.  Any person wishing to divert (appropriate) any unappropriated
water for a beneficial use has a constitutional right to do so that cannot be
denied.  Wyatt v. Larimer &amp  Weld Irrigation Co., 1 Colo. App. 480, 29 P. 906
(1892), rev'd on other grounds, 18 Colo. 298, 33 P. 144 (1893).
<P>And appropriators are owners of use of such waters. The title, right,
property, and ownership to unappropriated water remains in the state, in the
public generally, until some person diverts it, appropriates it, segregates it
from the volume of the stream and applies it to a beneficial use by some legal
method.  The title of the state, of the public, as to the water so
appropriated, is then divested.  The appropriator becomes the proprietor of the
water or the use of the water -- it is immaterial which term is used, they are
in effect the same -- and he remains the proprietor, owner of the use, so long
as the beneficial use to which it was appropriated is continued.  While it so
remains it is the subject of exclusive ownership and control, the property of
the appropriator in every legal aspect.  Wyatt v. Larimer &amp  Weld Irrigation
Co., 1 Colo. App. 480, 29 P. 906 (1892), rev'd on other grounds, 18 Colo. 298,
33 P. 144 (1893).  See, Gossard Breeding Estates, Inc. v. Texas Co., 76 F.
Supp. 20 (D. Colo. 1946), rev'd and remanded pursuant to stipulation, 166 F.2d
571 (10th Cir. 1948).
<P>Consent to use stream necessary from property owner. Individuals do not
have a right under this section to float and fish on a nonnavigable natural
stream as it flows through, across and within the boundaries of privately owned
property without first obtaining the consent of the property owner.  People v.
Emmert, ____ Colo. ____, 597 P.2d 1025 (1979).
<P>Vested rights to water may be acquired. Under this section and sections 6
to 8 of this article, and the legislation enacted pursuant thereto, vested
rights to waters in natural streams may be acquired.  Archuleta v. Boulder &amp
Weld County Ditch Co., 118 Colo. 43, 192 P.2d 891 (1948).
<P>But appropriation applies only to water in natural streams. This and the
following section recognize the doctrine of appropriation as applicable only to
the water in "natural streams".  Whitten v. Coit, 153 Colo. 157, 385 P.2d 131
(1963).
<P>Only that portion of underground water which supplies a natural stream is
subject to the doctrine of appropriation in like manner as surface waters.
Whitten v. Coit, 153 Colo. 157, 385 P.2d 131 (1963).
<P>"Natural stream" used in its broadest sense. Considering that from the
beginning of settlement in Colorado irrigation has been the declared public
policy; that the precipitation is small, and that many natural streams always
have been dry during a portion of every year, held that the phrase "natural
stream", in this and the following section was used in the broadest sense and
intended to include all tributaries, and the streams draining into other
streams.  In re German Ditch Reservoir Co., 56 Colo. 252, 139 P. 2 (1914).
<P>Including ground water. Ground water, in Colorado's century of water use
development is regarded as property of the public, except in such instances
where it is not tributary to a natural stream.  Whitten v. Coit, 153 Colo. 157,
385 P.2d 131 (1963).
<P>If ground water is in motion so as to be tributary to a natural stream, or
part of the stream water table, it has always been subject to priorities of
appropriation on the natural stream.  But unless it is tributary to the natural
stream, it is not subject to the law of appropriation.  Whitten v. Coit, 153
Colo. 157, 385 P.2d 131 (1963).
<P>Such as underground flowing, seepage, and percolation waters. All
underground waters which by flowage, seepage, or percolation will eventually,
if not intercepted, reach and become a part of some natural stream either on or
beneath the surface, are governed and controlled by the terms of the
constitution and statutes relative to appropriation, the same as the surface
waters of such stream.  City of Colorado Springs v. Bender, 148 Colo. 458, 366
P.2d 552 (1961).
<P>Tributary underground waters are public waters; they are subject to
appropriation because they belong to the river and therefore to the people of
the state by this section.  Whitten v. Coit, 153 Colo. 157, 385 P.2d 131
(1963).
<P>Since seepage and percolation waters belong to the river they belong to
the people of the state by virtue of this section.  Nevius v. Smith, 86 Colo.
178, 279 P. 44 (1929).
<P>Reservoir seepage which would be tributary to a natural stream, if allowed
to flow unarrested, is a part of that natural stream and thus the property of
the people of the state of Colorado under this section, subject to decreed
priorities.  This water is subject to appropriation in the same manner as other
water in a natural stream; it is not the property of the reservoir and is
distinguishable from irrigation waste water or natural seepage.  Lamont v.
Riverside Irrigation Dist., 179 Colo. 134, 498 P.2d 1150 (1972).
<P>And spring waters. Once spring waters have been established as tributary
to a stream, they cannot be interrupted in their course and diverted from the
stream; they belong to the creek, which in turn belongs to the people of the
state by this section.  Cline v. Whitten, 150 Colo. 179, 372 P.2d 145 (1962).
<P>There is presumption that all water is tributary to some natural stream.
Whitten v. Coit, 153 Colo. 157, 385 P.2d 131 (1963).
<P>The natural presumption is that all flowing water finds its way to a
stream.  Cresson Consol. Gold Mining &amp  Milling Co. v. Whitten, 139 Colo. 273,
338 P.2d 278 (1959).
<P>But that presumption is prima facie only and is therefore rebuttable.
Whitten v. Coit, 153 Colo. 157, 385 P.2d 131 (1963).
<P>Burden of proof on issue of whether water is or is not tributary to a
stream is upon the party asserting it is not tributary, not upon the one
asserting that it is.  Cresson Consol. Gold Mining &amp  Milling Co. v. Whitten,
139 Colo. 273, 338 P.2d 278 (1959).
<P>Ground water management act is not unconstitutional in violation of this
section and section 6 of this article insofar as said act applies to tributary
ground water.  Kuiper v. Lundvall, 187 Colo. 40, 529 P.2d 1328 (1974), appeal
dismissed, 421 U.S. 996, 95 S. Ct. 2391, 44 L. Ed.2d 663 (1975).
<P>This section abolishes common-law doctrine of continuous flow. The
common-law doctrine of continuous flow of a natural stream is inapplicable to
conditions in this state, and, by necessary construction of our local customs,
statutes and constitution, it is abolished.  Sternberger v. Seaton Mt. Elec.
Light, Heat &amp  Power Co., 45 Colo. 401, 102 P. 168 (1909).
<P>Colorado has rule of priority of appropriation as distinguished from the
rule of riparian rights.  Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 65 S. Ct. 1332, 89
L. Ed. 1815 (1945).
<P>Colorado applies the doctrine of prior appropriation in establishing
rights to the use of water.  Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United
States, 424 U.S. 800, 96 S. Ct. 1236, 47 L. Ed.2d 483 (1976).
<P>Under the doctrine of prior appropriation, one acquires a right to water
by diverting it from its natural source and applying it to some beneficial use.
Continued beneficial use of the water is required in order to maintain the
right.  In periods of shortage, priority among confirmed rights is determined
according to the date of initial diversion.  Colorado River Water Conservation
Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 96 S. Ct. 1236, 47 L. Ed.2d 483 (1976).
<P>Evidence insufficient to demonstrate intent to put water to beneficial
use. See Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. Vidler Tunnel Water Co.,
197 Colo. 413, 594 P.2d 566 (1979).
<P>Time provisions for appropriations not limit on constitutional right. The
ground water management act's time provisions, including the portions which
authorize extensions upon good cause shown, do not prohibit nor impermissibly
limit the constitutional right to appropriate the unappropriated waters of this
state's natural streams, but rather, regulate the manner of effecting an
appropriation in the designated ground water context.  Kuiper v. Warren, 195
Colo. 541, 580 P.2d 32 (1978).
<P>And right of appropriators to use in perpetuity. Contract between a water
district to sell and deliver water to a city outside the district's boundaries
in perpetuity was not null and void since the state grants the right to
appropriators to the use of water in perpetuity.  Cherokee Water Dist. v.
Colorado Springs, 184 Colo. 161, 519 P.2d 339 (1974).
<P>Appropriations of water prior to adoption of constitution stand upon same
footing as appropriations subsequently made. They are tested by the same
principles, and controlled by the same rules and regulations, save as affected
by the classification made in the constitution.  Fort Collins Milling &amp
Elevator Co. v. Larimer &amp  Weld Irrigation Co., 61 Colo. 45, 156 P. 140 (1916).
<P>But this and following section do not authorize interference with rights
of prior appropriators for irrigating purposes, whose rights vested before the
adoption of the constitution, in order to supply later comers with water for
domestic uses.  Armstrong v. Larimer County Ditch Co., 1 Colo. App. 49, 27 P.
235 (1891).
<P>Thus owners of prior vested rights entitled to compensation. This and the
following section were not intended to affect, and do not affect, prior vested
rights, but all owners of such rights are entitled to compensation therefor
before the same can be taken or injuriously affected.  Strickler v. City of
Colorado Springs, 16 Colo. 61, 26 P. 313, 25 Am. St. R. 245 (1891).
<P>This section and following section are self-executing. People ex rel. Park
Reservoir Co. v. Hinderlider, 98 Colo. 505, 57 P.2d 894 (1936).
<P>This and following section are so plain that no construction whatever is
needed. Wyatt v. Larimer &amp  Weld Irrigation Co., 1 Colo. App. 480, 29 P. 906
(1892), rev'd on other grounds, 18 Colo. 298, 33 P. 144 (1893).
<P>This section and following section must be construed so as to harmonize
with  15 of art. II, Colo. Const. The right to the use of water secured by
legal appropriation is property, and a proper construction of this and the
following section harmonizes these provisions with the declaration of  15 of
art. II, Colo. Const., "that private property shall not be taken or damaged for
public or private use without just compensation".  Armstrong v. Larimer County
Ditch Co., 1 Colo. App. 49, 27 P. 235 (1891).
<P>As neither public waters nor beds or channels of public streams can be
condemned and taken under eminent domain.  Mack v. Town of Craig, 68 Colo. 337,
191 P. 101 (1920).
<P>And section not to subvert bed owner's exclusive control of surface use.
Constitutional provisions historically concerned with appropriation such as
this section should not be applied to subvert a riparian bed owner's common-law
right to the exclusive surface use of waters bounded by his lands.  Without
permission, the public cannot use such waters for recreation.  People v.
Emmert, ____ Colo. ____, 597 P.2d 1025 (1979).
<P>Adjudication of federal reserved water rights. Whatever rights the United
States has to water can be recognized and adjudicated by the federal district
courts just as adequately as in any other forum.  No adequate reason exists to
withhold reserved rights from adjudication.  United States v. District Court,
169 Colo. 555, 458 P.2d 760 (1969), aff'd, 401 U.S. 520, 91 S. Ct. 998, 28 L.
Ed.2d (1971).
<P>Congress in the McCarran amendment, 43 U.S.C.  666 (1970), intended to
include the water adjudicative procedure of Colorado among the suits in which
sovereign immunity of the United States would be waived.  United States v.
District Court, 169 Colo. 555, 458 P.2d 760 (1969), aff'd, 401 U.S. 520, 91 S.
Ct. 998, 28 L. Ed.2d 278 (1971).
<P>Priorities with respect to water rights are decreed under state laws, but
any water rights of the United States in Colorado remain largely uncatalogued
and unrelated to decreed water rights.  This creates an undesirable,
impractical and chaotic situation which the McCarran amendment, 43 U.S.C.  666
(1970), was designed to remedy.  United States v. District Court, 169 Colo.
555, 458 P.2d 760 (1969), aff'd, 401 U.S. 520, 91 S. Ct. 998, 28 L. Ed.2d 278

this article, every person entitled to and receiving an old age pension from
the state of Colorado under any former law or constitutional provision shall be
entitled to receive the basic minimum award hereinafter provided for, without
being required to make a new application therefor, and such basic minimum award
shall be paid each month thereafter, so long as he remains qualified, to each
person receiving an old age pension at the time of the adoption of this
article, and such basic minimum award shall likewise be paid to each person who
hereafter becomes qualified to receive an old age pension; subject, however, to
the provisions of this article relating to net income from other sources.
<P>(b)  From and after the effective date of this article, the basic minimum
award payable to those persons qualified to receive an old age pension shall be
one hundred dollars monthly, provided, however, that the amount of net income,
from whatever source, that any person qualified to receive a pension may have
shall be deducted from the amount of the pension award unless otherwise
provided by law.
<P>(c)  The state board of public welfare, or such other agency as may be
authorized by law to administer old age pensions, shall have the power to
adjust the basic minimum award above one hundred dollars per month if, in its
discretion, living costs have changed sufficiently to justify that action.

<H1>ARTICLE XXV Public Utilities</H1>
In addition to the powers now vested in the General Assembly of the State
of Colorado, all power to regulate the facilities, service and rates and
charges therefor, including facilities and service and rates and charges
therefor within home rule cities and home rule towns, of every corporation,
individual, or association of individuals, wheresoever situate or operating
within the State of Colorado, whether within or without a home rule city or
home rule town, as a public utility, as presently or as may hereafter be
defined as a public utility by the laws of the State of Colorado, is hereby
vested in such agency of the State of Colorado as the General Assembly shall by
law designate.
<P>Until such time as the General Assembly may otherwise designate, said
authority shall be vested in the Public Utilities Commission of the State of
Colorado; provided however, nothing herein shall affect the power of
municipalities to exercise reasonable police and licensing powers, nor their
power to grant franchises; and provided, further, that nothing herein shall be
construed to apply to municipally owned utilities.
<P>Added November 2, 1954. (See Laws 1955, p. 693.)

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
Cross references.  As to home rule cities and towns, see art. XX, Colo.
Const.  As to public utilities, see  40-1-101 et seq.
<P>Am. Jur.2d.  See 64 Am. Jur.2d, Public Utilities,  9.
<P>C.J.S.  See 73 C.J.S., Public Utilities,  11.
<P>Power to regulate public utilities vested in public utilities commission.
This article vests all power to regulate rates of public utilities within a
home rule city, as well as elsewhere in the state, in the public utilities
commission.  Public Util. Comm'n v. City of Durango, 171 Colo. 553, 469 P.2d
131 (1970).  See Intermountain Rural Elec. Ass'n v. District Court, 160 Colo.
128, 414 P.2d 911 (1966).
<P>There is no requirement that company engage in every stage of
manufacturing and distribution process in order to achieve the position of a
utility.  K.C. Elec. Ass'n v. Public Util. Comm'n, 191 Colo. 96, 550 P.2d 871
(1976).
<P>This article has granted to public utilities commission authority to issue
certificates of public convenience and necessity.  Miller Bros. v. Public Util.
Comm'n, 185 Colo. 414, 525 P.2d 443 (1974).
<P>Purpose of this article is to grant to general assembly authority to
regulate privately owned public utilities within home rule cities, for without
the grant of such power the regulation of service among the inhabitants of the
city was a local matter, and laws of the state in conflict with ordinances and
charter provisions enacted pursuant to art. XX, Colo. Const., had no force and
effect within the municipality.  City &amp  County of Denver v. Public Util.
Comm'n, 181 Colo. 38, 507 P.2d 871 (1973).
<P>Not municipally owned utilities operating within corporate boundaries.
The public utilities commission has no jurisdiction to regulate or control the
operation of a municipally owned utility which operates wholly within the
territorial boundaries of a home rule city.  City &amp  County of Denver v. Public
Util. Comm'n, 181 Colo. 38, 507 P.2d 871 (1973).
<P>The rationale of this article is that when a municipally owned utility
operates within the municipality, there is no one who needs the protections of
the public utilities commission.  The electorate of the city exercises ultimate
power and control over the city-run utility and if the people of the city are
in any way dissatisfied with the operation of the utility, they may demonstrate
their discontent at the next municipal election.  K.C. Elec. Ass'n v. Public
Util. Comm'n, 191 Colo. 96, 550 P.2d 871 (1976).
<P>This provision establishes that (1) the public utilities commission cannot
interfere with towns and cities in the exercise of their police power, and (2)
that the commission has no jurisdiction over municipally owned utilities.
United States Disposal Systems v. City of Northglenn, 193 Colo. 277, 567 P.2d
365 (1977).
<P>Where a home rule city was not concerned with supplying anyone other than
its own citizens, and, in purchasing power, it was acting strictly as a
municipally owned utility for the benefit of its own residents, the public
utilities commission had no jurisdiction to require the city to purchase its
power from any particular utility.  K.C. Elec. Ass'n v. Public Util. Comm'n,
191 Colo. 96, 550 P.2d 871 (1976).
<P>Public utilities commission may regulate rates fixed by contract.  Unless
otherwise provided by constitution or statute, a general grant of power to
regulate rates authorizes a public utilities commission to regulate or modify
rates fixed by contract, including those specified in franchise agreements,
even though such contracts or agreements were executed prior to the passage of
the statute by which the power is conferred, since they must be deemed to have
been made subject to a proper exercise of the reserve police power of the
state.  Zelinger v. Public Serv. Co., 164 Colo. 424, 435 P.2d 412 (1967).
<P>Unless suspension of power clearly and unmistakably shown.  Assuming,
without deciding, that at the time a franchise granting a gas company the right
to operate a gas plant in a home rule city and to supply gas service to
citizens of that city was entered into, art. XX, Colo. Const., gave a home rule
city the power to establish by contract the rates to be charged by a public
service corporation for a definite term and thereby suspend during the life of
the contract the governmental power of fixing and regulating rates, yet it has
been noted by the supreme court that it must clearly and unmistakably appear
that the contract by its terms suspends the power of the state to regulate and
all doubts must be resolved in favor of the continuance of the power of the
state to regulate.  Public Util. Comm'n v. City of Durango, 171 Colo. 553, 469
P.2d 131 (1970).
<P>Franchise ordinance did not suspend state's power to regulate.  A
franchise ordinance adopted by a home rule city granting to a gas company the
right to operate a gas plant in the city and to supply gas service to citizens
of that city did not suspend the power of the state to regulate and did not
intend to do so.  Public Util. Comm'n v. City of Durango, 171 Colo. 553, 469
P.2d 131 (1970).
<P>The phrase in a section of a franchise granting a gas company the right to
operate a gas plant in a home rule city and to supply gas service to the
citizens of that city, which specified that the rates shall remain in effect
"unless and until changed in accordance with law" means not in accordance with
due process but in accordance with the statutory or constitutional law of the
state relating to rate fixing authority and jurisdiction.  Public Util. Comm'n
v. City of Durango, 171 Colo. 553, 469 P.2d 131 (1970).
<P>City had regulatory power to set rates only as long as it saw fit to
exercise power.  When it withdrew from the field of the regulation of rates
charged by public utilities by a charter amendment, the law of the state became
automatically effective, and the public utilities commission had jurisdiction
to regulate the rates of a public service company from and after the date of
the charter amendment without regard to the question of whether the company
operations were of "local and municipal" or "statewide" concern.  Zelinger v.
Public Serv. Co., 164 Colo. 424, 435 P.2d 412 (1967).
<P>But city may not regulate statewide telephone system.  A statewide
telephone system, with its need for coordinated intra and interstate
communications is a matter of statewide concern heavily outweighing any
possible municipal interest.  City of Englewood v. Mountain States Tel. &amp  Tel.
Co., 163 Colo. 400, 431 P.2d 40 (1967).
<P>The question as to whether a city has the power to require a statewide
telephone company to obtain a city franchise in order to maintain its
facilities within the limits of the city is answered by saying that the company
already has such a right granted to it by the state and need not seek a second
one, and the city cannot force it to, either.  City of Englewood v. Mountain
States Tel. &amp  Tel. Co., 163 Colo. 400, 431 P.2d 40 (1967).
<P>Trash hauling matter of statewide concern.  The constitution and the
statutes of this state have given to the business of trash hauling the status
of a matter of statewide concern, subject to the jurisdiction of the public
utilities commission.  Under such circumstances, a city has no power to pass an
ordinance which is in conflict with the exercise by the commission of its
statutory power.  Givigliano v. Veltri, 180 Colo. 10, 501 P.2d 1044 (1972).
<P>Acquisition of municipal utility determined by people.  The acquisition by
the city of the utility's facilities could not be prevented or interfered with
by any agency once the people of the city determined by their vote that the
system was to be acquired.  City of Thornton v. Public Util. Comm'n, 157 Colo.
188, 402 P.2d 194 (1965).
<P>Exercise of temporary authority by commission authorized.  Even in the
absence of an express delegation of legislative powers, the public utilities
commission's exercise of temporary authority to provide airline transportation
to the public appears fully authorized by this section's general grant to the
commission of all power to regulate the service of public utilities.  Aspen
Airways, Inc. v. Rocky Mt. Airways, Inc., 196 Colo. 285, 584 P.2d 629 (1978).
<P>But public utilities commission lacks authority to effect social
legislation by ordering that pay phone rates be reduced according to age and
indigency classifications.  Colorado Mun. League v. Public Util. Comm'n, 197
Colo. 106, 591 P.2d 577 (1979).
<P>And restricted power to set preferential rates.  Although the public
utilities commission has been granted broad rate making powers by this section,
the commission's power to effect social policy through preferential rate making
is restricted by sections 40-3-106(1) and 40-3-102 no matter how deserving the
group benefiting from the preferential rate may be.  Mountain States Legal
Foundation v. Public Util. Comm'n, 197 Colo. 56, 590 P.2d 495 (1979).
<P>Commission cannot impose monetary fines.  The constitutional and statutory
provisions which have created the public utilities commission and defined its
powers do not authorize it to impose monetary fines.  Haney v. Public Utils.
Comm'n, 194 Colo. 481, 574 P.2d 863 (1978).
<P>Authority of public utilities commission to order public utility to pay
attorney's fees and costs of intervenor emanates from this article.  Mountain
States Tel. &amp  Tel. Co. v. Public Utils. Comm'n, 195 Colo. 130, 576 P.2d 544
(1978); Colorado Ute Elec. Ass'n v. Public Util. Comm'n, __ Colo. __, 602 P.2d
861 (1979).
<P>Commission's standard for determining attorneys' fee or costs award has
three criteria:  (1) the representation and expenses incurred relate to general
consumer interests; (2) the testimony, evidence and exhibits provided
"materially assist the commission" in reaching its decision; and (3) the fees
and costs incurred are reasonable.  Colorado Ute Elec. Ass'n v. Public Util.
Comm'n, __ Colo. __, 602 P.2d 861 (1979).
<P>Jurisdiction of district court extends only to review of commission's
decision. Since jurisdiction over the adequacy, installation and extension of
power services and facilities necessary to supply, extend, and connect the same
is vested exclusively in the public utilities commission, it follows that the
jurisdiction of the district court extends only to a review of the decision of
the public utilities commission in appropriate proceedings.  Intermountain
Rural Elec. Ass'n v. District Court, 160 Colo. 128, 414 P.2d 911 (1966).
<P>Applied in Denver Bar Ass'n v. Public Util. Comm'n, 154 Colo. 273, 391
P.2d 467, 13 A.L.R.3d 799 (1964); Shoemaker v. Mountain States Tel. &amp  Tel. Co.,
38 Colo. App. 321, 559 P.2d 721 (1976); People v. Fierro, __ Colo. __, 606 P.2d
1291 (1980).

explosive device, a competent state official or agency designated by the
governor shall first have certified that sufficient and secure financial
resources exist in the form of applicable insurance, self-insurance, indemnity
bonds, indemnification agreements, or otherwise, without utilizing state funds,
to compensate in full all parties that might foreseeably suffer damage to

other hazard attributable to such detonation.  Damage is attributable to such
detonation without regard to negligence and without regard to any concurrent or
intervening cause.

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
Am. Jur.2d. See 16A Am. Jur.2d, Constitutional Law,   661, 662, 665-668.
<P>Section does not affect  4 of art. XIV, Colo. Const. The provisions of  4
of art. XIV, Colo. Const., being special provisions for specified objects, they
are not affected by this section.  In re House Bill No. 122, 9 Colo. 639, 21 P.
478 (1886).
<P>Act authorizing annexation not retrospective.   A legislative act whereby
one municipal corporation becomes annexed to another, forming one consolidated
town or city, the surviving municipality assuming all the corporate debts and
taking all the corporate property of the annexed municipality, together with
the authority to levy and collect taxes throughout the enlarged municipality,
is not an act retrospect in its operation; nor does it impose on the people of
either municipality a new liability in respect to transactions or
considerations already past.  The benefit accruing to the people of the
surviving city is a present and prospective consideration, and is based upon a
present and not upon a past transaction. So, too, there is a present
consideration accruing to the people of the annexed territory; they receive and
enjoy the greater privileges and protection which the larger municipality
affords, and at the same time are relieved from the burdens of an independent
municipal government.  Mayor of Valverde v. Shattuck, 19 Colo. 104, 34 P. 947,
41 Am. St. R. 208 (1893).
<P>Municipality may create own liability. Charter amendment providing for
police pensions and payments in lieu of sick leave.  An amendment to the
charter of the city and county of Denver, providing for police pensions and
authorizing the payment of a lump sum in lieu of sick leave to those members of
the department who, upon retirement, have exhausted none or only a portion of
their sick leave allowance, does not violate this section of the constitution,
since this section does not prevent a municipality from creating its own
liability.  McNichols v. Police Protective Ass'n, 121 Colo. 45, 215 P.2d 303
(1949).
<P>Applied in School Dist. No. 1 v. School Dist. No. 7, 33 Colo. 43, 78 P.
690 (1904); Colorado Fuel &amp  Iron Corp. v. Industrial Comm'n, 148 Colo. 557, 367

Section 11.  Street railroads - consent of municipality. No street
railroad shall be constructed within any city, town, or incorporated village,
without the consent of the local authorities having the control of the street
or highway proposed to be occupied by such street railroad.

Cross reference. As to electric and street railroads, see also  40-24-101
et seq.
<P>C.J.S. See 74 C.J.S., Railroads,  395.
<P>Section intended as restraint on power of general assembly. In the absence
of constitutional restraint, the general assembly of the state could have
granted directly the authority to construct, maintain, and operate street
railroads within cities, towns, or incorporated villages, upon such terms as
the general assembly might impose, without reference to the wish or consent of
the inhabitants of such city, town, or incorporated village.  This section was
intended simply as a restraint upon the power of the general assembly in this
respect, that the general assembly could not directly grant authority for the
construction, maintenance, or operation of a street railroad in such
municipalities, without the consent of the municipality.  It did not, however,
withhold from the general assembly the power to prohibit municipalities from
granting to street railroads authority to occupy the public streets of the
municipality except on terms which the general assembly should see fit to
impose, but it gave to municipalities authority to impose other and additional
terms from those prescribed by the general assembly, or to withhold consent
entirely.  City of Denver v. Mercantile Trust Co., 201 F. 790 (8th Cir. 1912).

<P>"Issuance" determined upon substance of transaction. In determining
whether an "issuance" occurred, a court will look to the substance of the
transaction rather than its technical form.  Burch v. Exploration Data
Consultants, Inc., 33 Colo. App. 155, 518 P.2d 288 (1973).
<P>Shares not "issued" within meaning of this section. See Burch v.
Exploration Data Consultants, Inc., 33 Colo. App. 155, 518 P.2d 288 (1973).
<P>Both this section and section 7-4-105 aim at preventing watering of
corporate stock. Their purpose is to prevent corporations from issuing stock
without receiving full value, and so to prevent the diluting of the holdings of
innocent stockholders, and the reliance by creditors on false or nonexistent
capital resulting from the issuance of watered stock.  Haselbush v. Alsco of
Colo., Inc., 161 Colo. 138, 421 P.2d 113 (1966).
<P>Policy behind section 7-4-105 (2) and this section is to protect other
stockholders of the corporation, creditors, and good faith future stockholders
from the dilution of their investment by "watered" stock.  Burch v. Exploration
Data Consultants, Inc., 33 Colo. App. 155, 518 P.2d 288 (1973).
<P>Section not available as defense in action brought on promissory note
given for stock of corporation. If a corporation is prohibited by this section
from delivering its stock in return for promissory notes, it would constitute
no defense to an action on the notes where the transaction was consummated in
good faith.  Boldt v. Motor Sec. Co., 74 Colo. 55, 218 P. 743 (1923); Haselbush
v. Alsco of Colo., Inc., 161 Colo. 138, 421 P.2d 113 (1966).
<P>The purpose of this section and section 7-4-105 would not be served by
holding that these provisions may be used to defeat an action by the
corporation seeking to enforce payment on a promissory note given for the
issuance of stock when the transaction has been made in good faith.  Haselbush
v. Alsco of Colo., Inc., 161 Colo. 138, 421 P.2d 113 (1966).
<P>As shares bought with promissory notes not void. The fact that this
section and section 7-4-105 (2) may prohibit execution and delivery of share
certificates in exchange for promissory notes does not render the shares void.
Burch v. Exploration Data Consultants, Inc., 33 Colo. App. 155, 518 P.2d 288
(1973).
<P>Applied in Lilylands Canal &amp  Reservoir Co. v. Wood, 56 Colo. 130, 136 P.
1026 (1913); Pueblo Foundry &amp  Mach. Co. v. Lannon, 68 Colo. 131, 187 P. 1031

Section 8.  Eminent domain - police power - not to be abridged. The right
of eminent domain shall never be abridged nor so construed as to prevent the
general assembly from taking the property and franchises of incorporated
companies, and subjecting them to public use, the same as the property of
individuals; and the police power of the state shall never be abridged or so
construed as to permit corporations to conduct their business in such manner as
to infringe the equal rights of individuals or the general well-being of the
state.

Am. Jur.2d. See 26 Am. Jur.2d, Eminent Domain,   7, 8.
<P>C.J.S. See 29A C.J.S., Eminent Domain,  73.
<P>Colorado has recognized broad power of general assembly in area of police
power. People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of America, Inc., 177 Colo. 97, 493 P.2d
660 (1972).
<P>But legislative regulations must bear reasonable relationship to public
health, safety, etc. In the exercise of the police powers, legislative
regulations, restraints and proscriptions must bear a reasonable relation to
the public health, safety, morals and welfare.  People ex rel. Orcutt v.
Instantwhip Denver, Inc., 176 Colo. 396, 490 P.2d 940 (1971).
<P>And legislation must have real and substantial relation to accomplishment
of objectives which form the basis of the police regulation.  People ex rel.
Orcutt v. Instantwhip Denver, Inc., 176 Colo. 396, 490 P.2d 940 (1971).
<P>Governmental purpose may not be achieved by unnecessarily broad means. A
governmental purpose to control or prevent certain activities, which may be
constitutionally subject to state or municipal regulation under the police
power, may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly.  People
v. Von Tersch, 180 Colo. 295, 505 P.2d 5 (1973).
<P>Police power of regulation does not include absolute prohibition of trade
in useful and harmless articles of commerce; where prohibitory, the act must be
declared to be invalid.  People ex rel. Orcutt v. Instantwhip Denver, Inc., 176
Colo. 396, 490 P.2d 940 (1971).
<P>Police power relates to public physical, mental, and financial safety.
Police power relates not only to the public's physical or mental health and
safety, but also to public financial safety.  People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of
America, Inc., 177 Colo. 97, 493 P.2d 660 (1972).
<P>Power to take property already devoted to public use. This section does
not change or modify the general rule that property already devoted to public
use cannot be taken for another in such manner or to such extent that the use
to which it is devoted is wholly defeated or superseded, unless the power to so
take be granted expressly or by necessary implication.  Denver Power &amp
Irrigation Co. v. Denver &amp  R. G. R. R., 30 Colo. 204, 69 P. 568, 60 L.R.A. 383
(1902).
<P>Particular business, etc., practices may be subject to state control. If
the power to regulate activities which are affected with a public interest is a
legitimate function of the police power, it follows that if particular
business, commercial, or trade practices affect the public interest, they in
turn may be subject to state control.  People ex rel. Dunbar v. Gym of America,
Inc., 177 Colo. 97, 493 P.2d 660 (1972).  See People ex rel. Orcutt v.

<P>Applied in City &amp  County of Denver v. Stenger, 277 F. 865 (8th Cir. 1921);

Section 3.  Moneys allocated to Trust Fund. (1)  Beginning with the
proceeds from the fourth quarter of the State's Fiscal Year 1992-1993, all
proceeds from all programs, including Lotto and every other state-supervised
lottery game operated under the authority of Article XVIII, Section 2 of the
Colorado Constitution, whether by the Colorado Lottery Commission or otherwise
(such programs defined hereafter in this Article as "Lottery Programs"), net of
prizes and expenses of the state lottery division and after a sufficient amount
of money has been reserved, as of the end of any fiscal quarter, to ensure the
operation of the lottery for the ensuing fiscal quarter (such netted proceeds
defined hereafter in this Article as "Net Proceeds") are set aside, allocated,
allotted, and continuously appropriated as follows, and the Treasurer shall
distribute such proceeds no less frequently than quarterly, as follows:
<P>(a)  For each quarter through the fourth quarter of the State's Fiscal
Year 1997-1998:
<P>(I)  to the Conservation Trust Fund and the Division of Parks and Outdoor
Recreation in the amounts allocable thereto under statute as amended through
January 1, 1992;
<P>(II)  to the State's Capital Construction Fund for payment of debt service
due from and including September 1, 1993, to and including November 30, 1998,
on the obligations described in Subsection (1)(c) of this Section 3, but only
to the extent such debt service is due during such period according to the
terms of the documents originating such obligations, and only if such debt
service has not been prepaid or other moneys have not been dedicated or set
aside for such debt service payments as of January 1, 1992, or thereafter;
provided, however, that such obligations may be refunded and debt service from
and including September 1, 1993, or the date of such refunding, if later, on
any such refunding obligation shall be payable from Net Proceeds, even if
payable after November 30, 1998, to the extent the debt service on such
refunding obligation does not exceed the total amount of debt service payable
on the applicable refunded obligation from and including September 1, 1993, or
from the date of such refunding, if later, to and including November 30, 1998,
according to the terms of the documents originating the applicable refunded
obligation; and
<P>(III)  The State Treasurer shall deposit all remaining Net Proceeds, if
any, in trust for the Board of the Trust Fund.
<P>(b)  For each quarter including and after the first quarter of the State's
Fiscal Year 1998-1999:
<P>(I)  Forty percent to the Conservation Trust Fund for distribution to
municipalities and counties and other eligible entities for parks, recreation
and open space purposes;
<P>(II)  Ten percent to the Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation for the
acquisition, development and improvement of new and existing state parks,
recreation areas and recreational trails; and
<P>(III)  All remaining Net Proceeds in trust to the Board of the Trust Fund,
provided, however, that in any state fiscal year in which the portion of the
Net Proceeds which would otherwise be given in trust to the State Board of the
Trust Fund exceeds the amount of $35 million, to be adjusted each year for
changes from the 1992 Consumer Price Index-Denver, the Net Proceeds in excess
of such amount or adjusted amount shall be allocated to the General Fund of the
State of Colorado.
<P>(c) (I)  The people intend that debt service on the following obligations
shall continue to be payable from Lottery Program Net Proceeds to the extent
allowed in Section 3(1)(a) above:
<P>(A)  State of Colorado Certificates of Deposit (1979); Wheat Ridge,
Colorado Project, in the original principal amount of $6,895,000 (Issue A);
Pueblo, Colorado Project, in the original principal amount of $5,320,000 (Issue

Disabilities Projects);
<P>(C)  Original principal amount of $36,000,000 Colorado Convention Center

<P>(II)  Except to the extent allowed in Section 3(1)(a) above for refunding
obligations, debt service on obligations originated on or after January 1,
1992, shall not be payable from Net Proceeds.
<P>(d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3(1)(a) above, the Board of
the Trust Fund in its sole discretion may authorize payment of Net Proceeds for
additional amounts of interest above the amounts authorized by Section 3(1)(a)
for the refunding of any of the obligations listed above in Section 3(1)(c).
<P>(e)  Nothing in this Section 3 shall prohibit the General Assembly from
appropriating additional amounts from sources other than Net Proceeds or the
Trust Fund for payment of the obligations listed above in Section 3(1)(c)(I) if
Net Proceeds set aside, allocated, allotted, and continuously appropriated for
such purpose by this Article are less than amounts needed for debt service on
such obligations.  Debt service payable prior to September 1, 1993, according
to the terms of the documents originating such obligations shall not be paid
from Net Proceeds allocated pursuant to this Article.
<P>(2)  From July 1, 1993, the following sums of money and property, in

specific purpose of benefitting the Trust Fund, including contributions,
grants, gifts, bequests, donations, and federal, state, or local grants; and

General Assembly.

the Governor, January 14, 1993. (For the text of the initiated measure and the
votes cast thereon, see L. 93, p. 2169.)

<P>(IV)  Competitive matching grants to local governments or other entities
which are eligible for distributions from the conservation trust fund, to
acquire, develop or manage open lands and parks, consistent with the purposes
set forth in Section 1(1)(d) of this article;
<P>(b)  Provided, however, that the State Board of the Great Outdoors
Colorado Trust Fund shall have the discretion (a) to direct that any portion of
available revenues be reinvested in the Trust Fund and not expended in any
particular year, (b) to make other expenditures which it considers necessary
and proper to the accomplishment of the purposes of this amendment.
<P>(2)  All funds provided to state agencies from the Trust Fund shall be
deemed to be custodial in nature, and the expenditure of those funds shall not
be subject to legislative appropriation or restriction.

<HR>
Section 6.  The State Board of the Great Outdoors Colorado Trust Fund.
(1)  There shall be established a State Board of the Great Outdoors Colorado
Trust Fund.  The Board shall consist of two members of the public from each
congressional district, a representative designated by the State Board of Parks
and Outdoor Recreation, a representative designated by the Colorado Wildlife
Commission, and the Executive Director of the Department of Natural Resources.
The public members of the Board shall be appointed by the Governor, subject to
the consent of the Senate, for terms of four years - provided, however, that
when the first such members are appointed, one of the public members from each
congressional district shall be appointed for a two-year term, to assure
staggered terms of office thereafter. At least two members shall reside west of
the Continental Divide. At least one member shall represent agricultural
interests.  The public members of the board shall be entitled to a reasonable
per diem compensation to be determined by the Board plus their actual expenses
for each meeting of the Board or a committee of the Board.  The Board's
composition shall reflect, to the extent practical, Colorado's gender, ethnic
and racial diversity, and no two of the representatives of any one
congressional district shall be members of the same political party.  Members
of the Board shall be subject to removal as provided in Article IV, Section 6
of this constitution.
<P>(2)  The Board shall be responsible for, and shall have the power to
undertake the following actions:
<P>(a)  To direct the Treasurer to disburse expendable income from the Trust
Fund as the Board may determine by resolution, and otherwise to administer the
Trust Fund, provided, however, that the Board shall not have the power to
acquire any interest in real property other than (I) temporarily to hold real
property donated to it and (II) to acquire leased office space;
<P>(b)  To promulgate rules and regulations as are necessary or expedient for
the conduct of its affairs and its meetings and of meetings of any committees
and generally for the administration of this article, provided, however, that
such rules and regulations shall give the public an opportunity to comment on
the general policies of the Board and upon specific grant proposals before the
Board;
<P>(c)  To cause to be published and distributed an annual report, including
a financial report, to the citizens, the Governor and the General Assembly of
Colorado, which will set out the Board's progress in administering the funds
appropriated to it, and the Board's objectives and its budget for the
forthcoming year, and to consult with the General Assembly from time to time
concerning its objectives and its budget;
<P>(d)  To administer the distribution of grants pursuant to Sections
1(1)(c), 1(1)(d), 5(1)(a)(III), and 5(1)(a)(IV) of this article, with the
expense of administering said grants to be defrayed from the funds made
available to the program elements of said sections;
<P>(e)  Commencing July 1, 1993, to determine what portions, if any, of
moneys allocated to the Trust Fund should be invested in an interest-bearing
Trust Fund account by the Treasurer of the State of Colorado, to remain in the
Trust Fund and available for expenditure in future years;
<P>(f)  To employ such staff and to contract for such office space and
acquire such equipment and supplies and enter into such other contracts as it
may consider necessary from time to time to accomplish its purposes, and to pay
the cost thereof from the funds appropriated to the Board under this article,
provided, however, that to the extent it is reasonably feasible to do so the
Board shall (I) contract with the Colorado Department of Natural Resources or
other state agency for necessary administrative support and (II) endeavor to
keep the level of administrative expense as low as may be practicable in
comparison with its expenditures for the purposes set forth in Section 1 of
this article, and the Board may contract with the State Personnel Board or any
successor thereof for personnel services.
<P>(3)  The Board shall be a political subdivision of the state, and shall
have all the duties, privileges, immunities, rights, liabilities and
disabilities of a political subdivision of the state, provided, however, that
its organization, powers, revenues and expenses shall not be affected by any
order or resolution of the general assembly, except as provided in this
constitution.  It shall not be an agency of state government, nor shall it be
subject to administrative direction by any department, commission, board,
bureau or agency of the state, except to the extent provided in this
constitution.  The Board shall be subject to annual audit by the state auditor,
whose report shall be a public document.  The Board shall adopt rules
permitting public access to its meetings and records which are no less
restrictive than state laws applicable to state agencies, as such laws may be
amended from time to time.  The Board members, officers and directors of the
Board shall have no personal liability for any actions or refusal to act by the
Board as long as such action or refusal to act did not involve willful or
intentional malfeasance or gross negligence.
<P>Enacted by the People November 3, 1992 -- Effective upon proclamation of
the Governor, January 14, 1993. (For the text of the initiated measure and the
votes cast thereon, see L. 93, p. 2169.)

Section 4.  Railroads - common carriers - construction - intersection. All
railroads shall be public highways, and all railroad companies shall be common
carriers.  Any association or corporation organized for the purpose, shall have
the right to construct and operate a railroad between any designated points
within this state, and to connect at the state line with railroads of other
states and territories.  Every railroad company shall have the right with its
road to intersect, connect with or cross any other railroad.

<P>Right of road to join onto another declared for protection of public. The
regulations of the constitution respecting railroad corporations are, in
general, limitations of the powers of those corporations for the protection of
the public interests, and to facilitate the transportation business of the
country.  The right of a road to join onto another is declared, certainly, for
the protection of the public rather than to enable corporations to perform
their agreement.  To say that it is an enabling act only, is to divest it of
any useful purpose. It is more reasonable to believe that by the union of
tracks it was intended to make the roads practically continuous for all that
may come in the usual course of business between companies friendly to each
other; that the companies are to be brought into harmony when they fail or
refuse to agree in the due and proper exercise of their public function as
common carriers.  Denver &amp  N. O. R. R. v. Atchison, T. &amp  S. F. R. R., 13 F. 546
(D. Colo. 1882).
<P>With due regard for rights of interested corporations. The constitution
requiring that railroad tracks shall be connected, it follows necessarily that
some use is to be made of the roads so united, and this we interpret to be such
as is usual and customary with connecting lines throughout the country, and may
be said to stand with the public convenience and a due regard for the rights of
the corporations interested.  Denver &amp  N. O. R. R. v. Atchison, T. &amp  S. F. R.
R., 13 F. 546 (D. Colo. 1882).
<P>Roads to be connected physically, as distinguished from business
connection always existing between roads which have approximate termini.  It is
a union of tracks admitting of the passage of cars from one road to the other,
and not a mere meeting of roads which may admit of continuous traffic in some
form.  Denver &amp  N. O. R. R. v. Atchison, T. &amp  S. F. R. R., 13 F. 546 (D. Colo.
1882).
<P>As constitutional right to connect railroad with railroad does not itself
imply right of connecting business with business. The railroad companies are
not to be connected, but their roads.  A connection of roads may make a
connection in business convenient and desirable, but the one does not
necessarily carry with it the other.  The language of the constitution is that
railroads may "intersect, connect with, or cross" each other.  This clearly
applies to the road as a physical structure, not to the corporation or its
business.  Atchison, T. &amp  S. F. R. R. v. Denver &amp  N. O. R. R., 110 U.S. 667, 4
S. Ct. 185, 28 L. Ed. 291 (1884).
<P>"Designated points". As to where one of the "designated points" is within
the corporate limits of some city or town, see Denver &amp  S. F. R. R. v. Domke,
11 Colo. 247, 17 P. 777 (1888).
<P>Character of railroad may be determined in condemnation proceeding. This
section does not prohibit the determining of the character of a railroad in a
proceeding by it to condemn land under  15 of art. II, Colo. Const. Denver R.
R. Land &amp  Coal Co. v. Union Pac. Ry., 34 F. 386 (D. Colo. 1888).
<P>Moffat tunnel not road or highway within meaning of section. The nearest
the Moffat tunnel will come to being a railroad is that one of the uses to
which it will be put, not the only use, is that of a right of way for a
railroad.  Even if it can be said that the tunnel, when completed, will be a
road, highway, or railroad, it will not be such a "road or highway" as is
contemplated by this constitutional provision.  Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel Imp.
Dist., 72 Colo. 268, 211 P. 649 (1922), aff'd, 262 U.S. 710, 43 S. Ct. 694, 67
L. Ed. 1194 (1923).
<P>Applied in Colorado &amp  S. Ry. v. State Rd. Comm'n, 54 Colo. 64, 129 P. 506
(1912).

Cross reference. As to prohibition of special laws, see  25 of art. V,
Colo. Const.
<P>Am. Jur.2d. See 18 Am. Jur.2d, Corporations,   24, 25.
<P>Law reviews. For note, "The Constitutionality of Industrial Development
Acts", see 35 U. Colo. L. Rev. 556 (1963).
<P>Subject matter of this article relates to private corporations. The
reference to municipal and other corporations named in this section was for the
purpose of excepting them from the operation of the provision respecting
special legislation.  Carpenter v. People ex rel. Tilford, 8 Colo. 116, 5 P.
828 (1885).
<P>But power to create municipal corporations by special charters is clearly
given by this section, and absolute control over them, extending to the right
to alter, revoke, or annul any charter, is given by section 3 of this article.
Which powers may be granted and which withheld, and what restrictions shall be
imposed in the exercise of the powers granted are clearly within legislative
control, and the right to limit and circumscribe granted powers by repeal of
former grants is unquestionably with the general assembly.  Johnson v. People,
6 Colo. App. 163, 40 P. 576 (1895).
<P>And general assembly may create public quasi-corporation. And also under
this section and  35 of art. V, Colo. Const., it is within the power of the
general assembly to create a public quasi-corporation, which has for its object
the discharge of the specific public, or municipal, duty of supplying water, as
a part of the municipal machinery, even for municipal corporations.  Donahue v.
Morgan, 24 Colo. 389, 50 P. 1038 (1897).
<P>Distinction between municipal and quasi-municipal corporation. There is a
broad distinction between the legal signification of the term municipal
corporation, employed in this section, and the term quasi-municipal
corporation.  A municipal corporation, such as a city or incorporated town, is
created by the consent of the people composing it, for their advantage and
convenience, and is invested with the power of local self-government.
Quasi-corporations, on the other hand, rank low down in the scale of corporate
existence, are endowed with but few corporate functions, and are merely
auxiliaries of the state.  Carpenter v. People ex rel. Tilford, 8 Colo. 116, 5
P. 828 (1884).
<P>Corporations enumerated in this section include both classes, according to
the primary import and natural signification of the words employed.  The
substitution of the words, "quasi-municipal corporation" for the words
"municipal corporations", excludes from the section a whole class of
corporations specifically named therein.  There is no necessity whatever for
such a construction.  Both classes are "under the control of the state" -- that
is, under its legislative control, which is a broader and more natural
signification of the words employed than ministerial control.  The former is
applicable to all the classes named in the section, while the latter is not, it
being conceded that municipal corporations proper are not under the ministerial
control of the state.  Carpenter v. People ex rel. Tilford, 8 Colo. 116, 5 P.
828 (1885).
<P>This section does not abrogate previously existing special charters. The
city of Denver was organized and existing under and by virtue of a special
charter long before and at the time of the adoption of our state constitution.
The constitution did not abrogate such charters, nor does it exempt them from
legislative amendments.  City of Denver v. Coulehan, 20 Colo. 471, 39 P. 425,
27 L.R.A. 751 (1894).
<P>Applied in In re Constitutionality of Senate Bill No. 69, 15 Colo. 601, 26
P. 157 (1890); Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel Imp. Dist., 72 Colo. 268, 211 P. 649
(1922).

Section 18.  Intergovernmental relationships. (1) (a) Any other provisions
of this constitution to the contrary notwithstanding:

rights, properties, and other assets and assume the obligations of any other
political subdivision included partially or entirely within such authority,
incident to the powers vested in, and the functions, services, and facilities
authorized to be provided by the service authority, whether vested and

<P>(c)  The general assembly may provide by statute for the terms and
conditions under which a county, home rule county, city and county, home rule
city or town, statutory city or town, or quasi-municipal corporation, or any
combination thereof may succeed to the rights, properties, and other assets and
assume the obligations of any quasi-municipal corporation located partially or

<P>(2) (a)  Nothing in this constitution shall be construed to prohibit the
state or any of its political subdivisions from cooperating or contracting with
one another or with the government of the United States to provide any
function, service, or facility lawfully authorized to each of the cooperating
or contracting units, including the sharing of costs, the imposition of taxes,

be used through voluntary participation by cooperating or contracting political
subdivisions.

political subdivision of the state from contracting with private persons,
associations, or corporations for the provision of any legally authorized
functions, services, or facilities within or without its boundaries.
<P>(d)  Nothing in this constitution shall be construed to prohibit the
general assembly from providing by statute for state imposed and collected
taxes to be shared with and distributed to political subdivisions of the state

Section 17.  Service authorities. (1) (a)  The general assembly shall
provide by statute for the organization, structure, functions, services,
facilities, and powers of service authorities pursuant to the following
requirements:
<P>(b)  A service authority may be formed only upon the approval of a
majority of the registered electors voting thereon in the territory to be
included.
<P>(c)  The territory within a service authority may include all or part of
one county or home rule county or all or part of two or more adjoining counties
or home rule counties, but shall not include only a part of any city and
county, home rule city or town, or statutory city or town at the time of
formation of the service authority.  No more than one service authority shall
be established in any territory and, in no event, shall a service authority be
formed in the metropolitan area composed of the city and county of Denver, and
Adams, Arapahoe, and Jefferson counties which does not include all of the city
and county of Denver and all or portions of Adams, Arapahoe, and Jefferson
counties.
<P>(d)  The boundaries of any service authority shall not be such as to
create any enclave.
<P>(e)  No territory shall be included within the boundaries of more than one
service authority.
<P>(2) (a)  The general assembly shall also provide by statute for:
<P>(b)  The inclusion and exclusion of territory in or from a service
authority;
<P>(c)  The dissolution of a service authority;
<P>(d)  The merger of all or a part of two or more adjacent service
authorities, except that such merger shall require the approval of a majority
of the registered electors voting thereon in each of the affected service
authorities; and,
<P>(e)  The boundaries of any service authority or any special taxing
districts therein or the method by which such boundaries are to be determined
or changed; and
<P>(f)  The method for payment of any election expenses.
<P>(3) (a)  The general assembly shall designate by statute the functions,
services, and facilities which may be provided by a service authority, and the
manner in which the members of the governing body of any service authority
shall be elected from compact districts of approximately equal population by
the registered electors of the authority, including the terms and
qualifications of such members; but for the first five years after formation of
any service authority, the members of the governing body shall be elected by
the registered electors within the boundaries of the authority from among the
mayors, councilmen, trustees, and county commissioners holding office at the
time of their election in home rule and statutory cities, cities and counties,
home rule and statutory towns, and home rule and statutory counties located
within or partially within the authority. This restriction shall expire January
1, 1980.  The general assembly may provide that members of the governing body
may be elected by a vote of each compact district or by an at-large vote or
combination thereof. Notwithstanding any provision in this constitution or the
charter of any home rule city and county, city, town, or county to the
contrary, mayors, councilmen, trustees, and county commissioners may
additionally hold elective office with a service authority and serve therein
either with or without compensation, as provided by statute.
<P>(b)  A service authority shall provide any function, service, or facility
designated by statute and authorized as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of
this subsection.
<P>(c)  All propositions to provide functions, services, or facilities shall
be submitted, either individually or jointly, to the registered electors in the
manner and form prescribed by law.
<P>(d)  Each such function, service, or facility shall be authorized if
approved by a majority of the registered electors of the authority voting
thereon; but if the service authority includes territory in more than one
county, approval shall also require a majority of the registered electors of
the authority voting thereon in those included portions of each of the affected
counties.
<P>(e)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of
this subsection, where, upon formation of a service authority, any function,
service, or facility is already being provided in at least four counties or
portions thereof by a single special district, regional planning commission or
metropolitan council, or an association of political subdivisions, the general
assembly may provide, without a vote of the registered electors, for assumption
by one or more service authorities of such function, service, or facility.
<P>(f)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of
this subsection, a service authority may contract with any other political
subdivision to provide or receive any function, service, or facility designated
by statute; but a service authority shall not be invested with any taxing power
as a consequence of such contract.
<P>(4) (a)  A service authority shall be a body corporate and a political
subdivision of the state.
<P>(b)  Any other provision of this constitution to the contrary
notwithstanding, any service authority formed under this article and the
statutes pursuant thereto may exercise such powers to accomplish the purposes
and to provide the authorized functions, services, and facilities of such
authority as the general assembly may provide by statute.
<P>(c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of article XX of this constitution,
any authorized function, service, or facility may be provided exclusively by
the authority or concurrently with other jurisdictions as may be prescribed by
statute, subject to the provisions of subsections (3) (c), (3) (d), (3) (e),
and (3) (f) of this section.
<P>Adopted November 3, 1970 -- Effective January 1, 1972. (See Laws 1969, p.
1247.); (1)(b), (2)(d), (3)(a), (3)(c), (3)(d), and (3)(e) amended November 6,

Section 16.  County home rule. (1)  Notwithstanding the provisions of
sections 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 15 of this article, the registered electors of
each county of the state are hereby vested with the power to adopt a home rule
charter establishing the organization and structure of county government

<P>(2)  The general assembly shall provide by statute procedures under which
the registered electors of any county may adopt, amend, and repeal a county
home rule charter.  Action to initiate home rule may be by petition, signed by
not less than five percent of the registered electors of the county in which
home rule is sought, or by any other procedure authorized by statute. No county
home rule charter, amendment thereto, or repeal thereof, shall become effective
until approved by a majority of the registered electors of such county voting

Section 15.  Compensation and fees of county officers. The general
assembly shall fix the compensation of county officers in this state by law,
and shall establish scales of fees to be charged and collected by such county
officers.  All such fees shall be paid into the county general fund.
<P>When fixing the compensation of county officers, the general assembly
shall give due consideration to county variations, including population; the
number of persons residing in unincorporated areas; assessed valuation; motor
vehicle registrations; building permits; military installations; and such other
factors as may be necessary to prepare compensation schedules that reflect
variations in the workloads and responsibilities of county officers and in the
tax resources of the several counties.
<P>The compensation of any county officer shall be increased or decreased
only when the compensation of all county officers within the same county, or
when the compensation for the same county officer within the several counties
of the state, is increased or decreased.
<P>Except for the schedule of increased compensation for county officers
enacted by the general assembly to become effective on January 1, 1969, county
officers shall not thereafter have their compensation increased or decreased
during the terms of office to which they have been elected or appointed.
<P>Repealed and reenacted November 5, 1968.  (See Laws 1968, p. 260.)

<P>Law reviews.  For article, "Colorado Constitutional Amendments:  An
Analysis", see 3 Den. B. Ass'n Rec. 4 (Nov. 1926).
<P>"Law".  The word "law", as used in this section, is not synonymous with
"act".  The "law" means here law in a general sense -- whatever has been
enacted by the general assembly, whether it is embodied in one act or in any
number of acts; and so far as the use of the term "law" in this section is
concerned, it cannot be construed as compelling the general assembly to embody
in one act provisions for fees and salaries.  Airy v. People, 21 Colo. 144, 40
P. 362 (1895).
<P>Authority to fix compensation for county officers is vested exclusively in
general assembly.  Van Cleave v. Board of County Comm'rs, 33 Colo. App. 227,
518 P.2d 1371 (1973).
<P>This section is not self-executing.  Legislation was required to give it
effect.  Glaister v. Board of County Comm'rs, 22 Colo. App. 326, 123 P. 955
(1912).
<P>Elimination of illegal housing allowance not violative of section.
Because housing allowance paid to sheriff-jailer was unauthorized and illegal,
its elimination did not violate constitutional prohibitions against salary or
compensation reduction during the term of office of a public official.  Van
Cleave v. Board of County Comm'rs, 33 Colo. App. 227, 518 P.2d 1371 (1973).
<P>Judge of county court is liable to account to county for fees received by
him under the authority of the acts of congress, for oaths administered,
affidavits taken, and proofs made before him, in his official capacity,
relating to the entry of public lands, even though such services could not have
been compelled, nor the officer required to exact or collect the fee.  That the
fee prescribed by the act of congress is less than that prescribed by the
statute of the state is not material.  Glaister v. Board of County Comm'rs, 22
Colo. App. 326, 123 P. 955 (1912).

Section 14.  Existing cities and towns may come under general law. The

town or village, incorporated by any special or local law, may elect to become

<P>General assembly may exercise almost plenary power over cities and towns.
By this and the preceding section the whole subject of towns and cities is,
with two slight limitations, relegated to the general assembly.  In connection
with such municipal corporations, that body is, by these provisions, left to
exercise almost plenary power.  It determines the mode of organization, and
provides for all matters pertaining to government, including the number and
kind of officers, their election or appointment, and duties.  It may or may
not, at its option, create the office of mayor.  People ex rel. Barton v.

general laws.  Town of Eaton v. Bouslog, 133 Colo. 130, 292 P.2d 343, 54
A.L.R.2d 1320 (1956).
<P>Town not under general law limited to charter powers.  Where a town does
not elect to become subject to laws passed under section 13 of this article,
its original charter is the sole measure of its powers, rights and liabilities
except insofar as the charter has been amended or is in conflict with the
constitution.  Georgetown v. Bank of Idaho Springs, 99 Colo. 519, 64 P.2d 132
(1936).
<P>This section neither abrogates special charters nor exempts them from
amendments.  The city of Denver was organized and existing under and by virtue
of a special charter long before and at the time of the adoption of our state
constitution.  The constitution did not abrogate such charters, nor does it
exempt them from legislative amendments.  City of Denver v. Coulehan, 20 Colo.

of the right to amend as well as to retain existing special charters.  People

<P>Law Review.  For article, "Annexation in Colorado", see 37 Dicta 259
(1960).
<P>Intent of section.  This section indicates intent to preserve state
sovereignty over cities and towns.  City &amp  County of Denver v. Sweet, 138 Colo.
41, 329 P.2d 441 (1958).
<P>The object to be attained by this section was to prevent the granting by
the general assembly of any special charters to cities and towns, to provide
for a classification of all existing cities and towns, and to provide a uniform
municipal code of laws for the government of all such corporations of the same
class.  People ex rel. Johnson v. Earl, 42 Colo. 238, 94 P. 294 (1908).
<P>"Powers" and "restrictions".  The "powers" and "restrictions" contemplated
by this section are manifestly such powers and restrictions as relate to
subjects pertaining to local self-government, such as may be designated as
strictly corporate municipal subjects, as distinguished from such subjects as
involve the relations of the citizens or the cities and towns to the state.
People ex rel. Johnson v. Earl, 42 Colo. 238, 94 P. 294 (1908).
<P>General assembly may exercise almost plenary power over cities and towns.
By this and the following section the whole subject of towns and cities is,
with two slight limitations, relegated to the general assembly.  In connection
with such municipal corporations, that body is, by these provisions, left to
exercise almost plenary power.  It determines the mode of organization, and
provides for all matters pertaining to government, including the number and
kind of officers, their election or appointment, and duties.  It may or may
not, at its option, create the office of mayor.   People ex rel. Barton v.
Londoner, 13 Colo. 303, 22 P. 764, 6 L.R.A. 444 (1889).
<P>Statutory cities and towns derive their sole powers from constitutional
authority which must be defined by general law.  City of Aurora v. Bogue, 176
Colo. 198, 489 P.2d 1295 (1971).
<P>As do incorporated towns.  Incorporated towns derive their sole powers
from constitutional authority, and these must be defined by general laws.
Eckley v. Meyers, 116 Colo. 536, 181 P.2d 1014 (1947).  See Town of Eaton v.
Bouslog, 133 Colo. 130, 292 P.2d 343, 54 A.L.R.2d 1320 (1956).
<P>Statutes granting powers to cities and towns must be strictly construed
and no powers may be exercised except those which are expressly conferred, or
which exist by necessary implication.  City of Aurora v. Bogue, 176 Colo. 198,
489 P.2d 1295 (1971). See City of Sheridan v. City of Englewood,___Colo.___,
609 P.2d 108 (1980).
<P>If a doubt exists as to a municipality's power, that doubt must be
resolved against the municipality.  City of Aurora v. Bogue, 176 Colo. 198, 489
P.2d 1295 (1971).
<P>Cities and towns classified.  The general assembly, pursuant to this
provision, classified cities and towns into cities of the first and second
class and incorporated towns; cities of the first class having a population of
15,000 inhabitants and upwards; cities of the second class having a population
exceeding 2,000 and less than 15,000; and incorporated towns having less than
2,000 population.  People ex rel. Johnson v. Earl, 42 Colo. 238, 94 P. 294
(1908).
<P>Different powers and restrictions may be granted to different classes of
municipal cities.  And there is clear constitutional authority for bestowing
upon one class, within certain limits, exclusive legislative control over a
given subject pertaining to local self-government, while another class is
allowed only concurrent power in connection therewith.  Rogers v. People, 9
Colo. 450, 12 P. 843, 59 Am. R. 146 (1886).
<P>General assembly cannot fix municipal boundaries by general law.  The
general assembly cannot, by general law, fix the boundaries of towns and cities
that may be thereafter incorporated under it.  The operation of such general
law must necessarily be made to depend upon contingencies, and the power to
take the initiative steps to bring the law into operation upon the happening of
the contingent event must be delegated to some body or persons.  This power
arises under the general rule that when a constitution gives a general power,
or enjoins a duty, it also gives, by implication, every particular power
necessary for the exercise of the one or the performance of the other.  People
ex rel. Rhodes v. Fleming, 10 Colo. 553, 16 P. 298 (1887).
<P>The passing of a general law is the limit of the power expressly conferred
upon the general assembly for the organization of cities and towns, and, in
passing such law, it has exercised all the legislative authority it can
exercise at that time; but, in providing for the means for carrying the law
into effect, it must of necessity confer upon some bodies or individuals the
power to do such acts as could not be done by it.  The fixing of the boundaries
of such cities and towns is among the acts that must be performed by and
through such conferred power.  People ex rel. Rhodes v. Fleming, 10 Colo. 553,
16 P. 298 (1887).
<P>The power to fix boundaries conferred upon the petitioners and the county
court, and the clerk of said court, and upon the electors of the territory
within the limits of the proposed city or town, is not a delegation of
legislative authority, because it can in no sense be said to confer upon such
individuals the power to make laws, in that it does not confer upon them the
power to do that which the constitution requires of the general assembly to do.
People ex rel. Rhodes v. Fleming, 10 Colo. 553, 16 P. 298 (1887).
<P>Special laws as to organization of towns and cities are prohibited.  By
virtue of this section it is determined by the sovereign power that a general
law for the organization of cities and towns can be made applicable, and it
necessarily follows that all special laws upon that subject are prohibited.
People ex rel. Rhodes v. Fleming, 10 Colo. 553, 16 P. 298 (1887).
<P>It is apparent from this and the following section and the inhibition
against special laws,  25 of art. V, Colo. Const., first, that the general
assembly is prohibited from granting a special charter to any city or town;
second, it is required to provide by general law for the incorporation of
cities and towns.  In re Constitutionality of Senate Bill No. 293, 21 Colo. 38,
39 P. 522 (1895).
<P>Unless city not subject to general law relating to corporations.  This and
the folowing section do not prohibit the passing of a special act to amend a
city charter, granted by a local act passed prior to the adoption of the
constitution, where such city has not elected to become subject to, and to be
governed by, the general law relating to corporations.  Carpenter v. People ex
rel. Tilford, 8 Colo. 116, 5 P. 828 (1884).
<P>In view of this section it was no doubt the intention of the framers of
the constitution that cities and towns, organized after its adoption, should be
organized under general and not special laws.  But that it was not intended to
interfere with the city of Denver, and other cities and towns acting under
special charters previously granted by the territorial legislature, is apparent
from the following section.  Brown v. City of Denver, 7 Colo. 305, 3 P. 455
(1884).
<P>This section does not prohibit dissolution of towns and cities organized
by any appropriate exercise of legislative power.  Mayor of Valverde v.
Shattuck, 19 Colo. 104, 34 P. 947, 41 Am. St. R. 208 (1893).
<P>The object being to free all towns and cities from local or special
legislation, it is clear that the inhibition of this section must be held to
extend to the disincorporation, as well as the incorporation of such cities and
towns.  In re Extension of Boundaries, 18 Colo. 288, 32 P. 615 (1893).
<P>Section as basis for jurisdiction.  Carl Ainsworth, Inc. v. Town of
Morrison, 189 Colo. 223, 539 P.2d 1267 (1975).
<P>Applied in McInerney v. City of Denver, 17 Colo. 302, 29 P. 516 (1892);
City of Denver v. Coulehan, 20 Colo. 471, 39 P. 425, 27 L.R.A. 751 (1894);
Kirkpatrick v. People ex rel. Stanley, 66 Colo. 100, 179 P. 338 (1919); Milheim

<P>C.J.S.  See 20 C.J.S., Counties,  101.
<P>Powers and duties of county officers are prescribed by constitution or by
statute, or both, and they are measured by the terms and necessary implication
of the grant, and must be executed in the manner directed and by the officer
specified.  Skidmore v. O'Rourke, 152 Colo. 470, 383 P.2d 473 (1963).
<P>Broader powers must be conferred by proper authority.  If broader powers
are desirable for county officers, they must be conferred by the proper
authority.  They cannot be merely assumed by administrative officers; nor can
they be created by the courts in the proper exercise of their judicial
functions.  Skidmore v. O'Rourke, 152 Colo. 470, 383 P.2d 473 (1963).
<P>No consideration of public policy can properly induce a court to reject
the statutory definition of the powers of a county officer.  Skidmore v.
O'Rourke, 152 Colo. 470, 383 P.2d 473 (1963).
<P>General assembly has plenary power to create municipal offices.  Municipal
corporations are created by law, partly as the agents of the state, but chiefly
to administer the local affairs of the territory incorporated; and the general
assembly, in the absence of constitutional limitations, has plenary power to
adopt for their government such measures as, in its judgment, best accomplish
the purpose for which they are created, including the creation and manner of
filling municipal offices, as provided by this section.  People ex rel. Johnson

<P>There is no constitutional provision expressly withholding from the
general assembly power to authorize the appointment by the governor of such
municipal officers as are contemplated by an act providing for the creation of
a board of public works for the city of Denver.  In re Senate Bill, 12 Colo.

<P>C.J.S.  See 20 C.J.S., Counties,  76.
<P>"Eligible" refers to capacity of holding office.  The word "eligible" as
used in constitutions and statutes has reference to the capacity not of being
elected to office, but of holding office, and that, therefore, if qualified at
the time of commencement of the term or induction into office, disqualification
of the candidate at the time of election or appointment is immaterial.  Cox v.
Starkweather, 128 Colo. 89, 260 P.2d 587 (1953).
<P>Notary public is county officer within meaning of section.  This section
makes ineligible to hold any county office every person who is not a qualified
elector.  A notary public, while holding his office by the appointment of the
governor, can exercise the functions thereof only in the county for which he is
appointed.  In this sense he is a county officer.  In re House Bill No. 166, 9

Section 9.  Vacancies - how filled. In case of a vacancy occurring in the
office of county commissioner  a vacancy committee of the same political party
as the vacating commissioner constituted as provided by law shall, by a
majority vote, fill the vacancy by appointment within ten days after occurrence
of the vacancy.  If the vacancy committee fails to fill the vacancy within ten
days after occurrence of the vacancy, the governor shall fill the same by
appointment within fifteen days after occurrence of the vacancy.  The person
appointed to fill a vacancy in the office of county commissioner shall be a
member of the same political party, if any, as the vacating commissioner.  In
case of a vacancy in any other county office, or in any precinct office, the
board of county commissioners shall fill the same by appointment.  Any person
appointed pursuant to this section shall hold the office until the next general
election, or until the vacancy is filled by election according to law.

<P>This section refers only to elected officers.  Walsh v. People ex rel.
McClenahan, 72 Colo. 406, 211 P. 646 (1922).
<P>It is self-executing.  This section empowers the governor to make
designated appointments in case of vacancies, which appointees, in turn, are
authorized to fill all others in county and precinct offices, a provision which
is self-executing, and can be resorted to independent of any statutory
provision.  Frost v. Pfeiffer, 26 Colo. 338, 58 P. 147 (1899).
<P>It applies to county treasurers.  The power to fill a vacancy in the
office of county treasurers is lodged in the board of county commissioners by
this section.  In re House Bill No. 38, 9 Colo. 631, 21 P. 474 (1886).
<P>And to assessors and coroners.  This section provides, in effect, that in
case of a vacancy in the office of assessor or coroner, the board of county
commissioners shall fill such vacancy by appointment, and that the persons so
appointed shall hold office until the next "general election", when, according
to the plain intendment of the law, the terms of such appointees expire and
their successors must be elected.  Mannix v. Selbach, 31 Colo. 502, 74 P. 460
(1903).
<P>Vacancy applies to term or office or both.  Vacancy applies not to the
incumbent, but to the term, or to the office, or both, whether to the term, or
to the office, or both, depending generally upon the context.  People v.
Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>A new vacancy exists when one term expires and new term of office begins.
People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>Appointee holds until next general election if no new term intervenes.  An
appointee to fill a vacancy under this section holds until the next general
election, if no new term intervenes between the time of his appointment and the
time of such election.  People ex rel. Callaway v. DeGuelle, 47 Colo. 13, 105
P.1110 (1909); People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>But if new term commences during interval, term of appointee ends.  If a
new term commences during the interval between the time of appointment to fill
a vacancy and the time of the next general election the term of the appointee
ends and the one entitled to the new term has a right thereto.  People ex rel.
Callaway v. DeGuelle, 47 Colo. 13, 105 P. 1110 (1909); People v. Quimby, 152
Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>Term of appointee does not extend beyond term in which vacancy occurred.
Where a county commissioner is re-elected to a new four-year term and dies
following his election, an appointment by the governor to fill the vacancy
"until the next general election" does not extend beyond the term in which the
vacancy occurred.  People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>Death before qualification of one entitled to new term leaves vacancy.  If
one entitled to the new term on the arrival of the term does not appear and
qualify, though the reason thereof be death, there is a vacancy in the office
for the term.  People ex rel. Callaway v. DeGuelle, 47 Colo. 13, 105 P. 1110
(1909); People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>The county clerk elect, dying before qualification, a vacancy in the
office occurs on the expiration of the term of the then incumbent, to be filled
by appointment of the county commissioners.  Gibbs v. People ex rel. Watts, 66
Colo. 414, 182 P. 894 (1919).
<P>Until appointment is made, incumbent of previous term holds over.  Where
there is a vacancy in an office for the term, until an appointment is made, the
incumbent of the previous term holds over.  People ex rel. Callaway v.
DeGuelle, 47 Colo. 13, 105 P. 1110 (1909); People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381
P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>But when appointment is made and appointee qualifies, rights of incumbent
are ended.  When an appointment is made, and the appointee qualifies, the
previous term, and the rights of the incumbent to the office, are ended.
People ex rel. Callaway v. DeGuelle, 47 Colo. 13, 105 P. 1110 (1909); People v.
Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>Right to office is contingent upon qualifying.  Considering together this
section and  10 of art. XII, Colo. Const., and giving to each the meaning which
the language necessarily implies, it is clear that when a person is elected to
a term, under the constitution, a contingent or inchoate right to the office is
vested in him, which becomes absolute upon his qualification.  He is elected to
the term and no one else can enter therein until he is ousted therefrom, which
can never be until the commencement of the term.  When he does not qualify, the
contingent right is gone.  People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963)
<P>There is no one legally entitled to a term, and when the date of the term
arrives there is a vacancy under the Colorado constitution, though there be
some one actually and legally performing the duties of the office.  People v.
Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>Appointee has same rights as predecessor.  A person elected or appointed
to fill a vacancy in an unexpired term of a public office, such as sheriff,
holds precisely as his predecessor would have held had he continued in office,
and in no other way; and has the same rights, and none other, that such
predecessor would have had.  People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275
(1963).
<P>Applied in People v. Rucker, 5 Colo. 455 (1877); People v. Wright, 6 Colo.
92 (1881).

Other Political Subdivisions,  235.
<P>C.J.S. See 20 C.J.S., Counties,   75, 79.
<P>Courts may not confer or limit powers of county officers.  In general, the
powers and duties of county officers such as the treasurer, are prescribed by
the constitution or by statute, or both, and they are measured by the terms and
necessary implication of the grant, and must be executed in the manner directed
and by the officers specified.  If broader powers are desirable, they must be
conferred by the proper authority.  They cannot be merely assumed by
administrative officers; nor can they be created by the courts in the proper
exercise of their judicial functions.  Skidmore v. O'Rourke, 152 Colo. 470, 383
P.2d 473 (1963).
<P>No consideration of public policy can properly induce a court to reject
the statutory definition of the powers of a county officer.  Skidmore v.
O'Rourke, 152 Colo. 470, 383 P.2d 473 (1963).
<P>It is not a proper function of the judiciary to add to, detract from, or
impose other conditions governing actions of treasurers.  Skidmore v. O'Rourke,
152 Colo. 470, 383 P.2d 473 (1963).
<P>County treasurers are constitutional officers.  Skidmore v. O'Rourke, 152
Colo. 470, 383 P.2d 473 (1963).
<P>But they have no constitutional duties to perform or constitutional
authority to do any particular act such as commencing a suit.  Skidmore v.
O'Rourke, 152 Colo. 470, 383 P.2d 473 (1963).
<P>Their authority is limited to that expressly delegated by general
assembly.  County treasurers being only administrative agents of the state,
their authority is limited to that expressly delegated by the general assembly.
Skidmore v. O'Rourke, 152 Colo. 470, 383 P.2d 473 (1963).
<P>County treasurers do not have inherent power to sue taxpayers.  Enactments
of the general assembly relating to taxation negate any suggestion that county
treasurers have inherent, implied or general powers to sue taxpayers for
delinquent real estate taxes.  Skidmore v. O'Rourke, 152 Colo. 470, 383 P.2d
473 (1963).
<P>County treasurer is collector of taxes.  The election of a county assessor
and a county treasurer in each county is provided for by this section, and the
treasurer is thereby expressly made the collector of taxes.  Chase v. Board of
Comm'rs, 37 Colo. 268, 86 P. 1011 (1906).
<P>This section does not prescribe duties of county assessors.  The
constitution creates many offices, the duties of which it does not prescribe,
but places no limitation upon the creation of others.  Among the former is that
of county assessor.  State Bd. of Equalization v. Bimetallic Inv. Co., 56 Colo.
512, 138 P. 1010 (1914), aff'd, 239 U.S. 441, 36 S. Ct. 141, 60 L. Ed. 372
(1915).
<P>Under this section, a county assessor is a constitutional officer, and
though his duties are left unprescribed, the essential duties of an assessor
must be presumed to have been contemplated.  People v. Lothrop, 3 Colo. 428
(1877).
<P>Such duties are prescribed by legislative acts.  The office of county
assessor in each county is created by the constitution, but the duties thereof
are prescribed by legislative acts.  Weidenhaft v. Board of County Comm'rs, 131
Colo. 432, 283 P.2d 164 (1955); Bartlett &amp  Co. v. Board of County Comm'rs, 152
Colo. 388, 382 P.2d 193 (1963).
<P>The general assembly may adopt a plan whereby the work of assessors may be
corrected, supplemented, added to or changed.  Weidenhaft v. Board of County
Comm'rs, 131 Colo. 432, 283 P.2d 164 (1955).
<P>Duties of county assessors.  It not only is the duty of the assessor to
see to it that all property within his county is returned for tax assessment,
and to finally fix the valuation upon each item for that purpose, but he
further is obligated to undertake, so far as within his power and judgment, to
see to it that taxes shall be uniformly assessed within his county.  Bartlett &amp
Co. v. Board of County Comm'rs, 152 Colo. 388, 382 P.2d 193 (1963).
<P>No authority is conferred by the constitution upon assessors to perform
duties other than the duties of county assessors.  These duties he must perform
within his county, and must assess all of the taxable property in his county,
unless that power is taken away and lodged elsewhere by virtue of some
legislation enacted under express authority of the constitution.  The only
power so conferred is that which authorizes the state and county boards of
equalization to perform such other duties as may be prescribed by law.  No
authority whatever is found in the constitution empowering an assessor to
perform the duties of his office outside of the county for which he was
elected.  The general assembly was wholly without power or authority to clothe
the assessors of the state as a body with the right to select and appoint 13 of
their number to do an act which they could not do by virtue of their office as
county assessors under the provisions of the constitution.  Union P. R. R. v.
Alexander, 113 F. 347 (D. Colo. 1901).
<P>Control of property valuation may not be taken from assessors.  In view of
this provision and of other constitutional limitations it may be gravely
doubted whether it is competent for the legislative authority to take from
county assessors the substantial control of valuations of property for state
taxation, and vest it in a central authority.  People v. Lothrop, 3 Colo. 428
(1877).
<P>The duty of listing and valuing all taxable property devolves upon the
assessor, and him alone.  Bartlett &amp  Co. v. Board of County Comm'rs, 152 Colo.
388, 382 P.2d 193 (1963).
<P>But railroad property may be assessed by board other than county assessor.
This section in merely providing for the election of county assessors in each
county does not inhibit the general assembly from passing a law authorizing the
assessment of railroad property by some other tribunal or board if, in its
wisdom, it determines that thereby a just valuation of this class of property
may best be secured, and if the act on its face is not palpably ineffectual to
accomplish that object.  Ames v. People ex rel. Temple, 26 Colo. 83, 56 P. 656
(1899).  See Chase v. Board of Comm'rs, 37 Colo. 268, 86 P. 1011 (1906).
<P>And tax commission may assess certain classes of property.  The tax
commission has authority to make original assessment of certain classes of
property and can require the proper officials to make like assessments of all
other property.  Weidenhaft v. Board of County Comm'rs, 131 Colo. 432, 283 P.2d
164 (1955).
<P>The constitutionality of the statutes pursuant to which the tax commission
functions have been established with respect to this section.  Weidenhaft v.
Board of County Comm'rs, 131 Colo. 432, 283 P.2d 164 (1955).
<P>Because assessor does not have sole authority to assess property.  While
the office of assessor is stipulated by the constitution, the general assembly
is not inhibited from passing a law placing the fixing of valuation for
assessment of certain properties under another authority.  Generally, control
of matters of taxation is plenary to the legislative branch of the government,
unless restricted by some constitutional provision; this section is not such a
limitation, and the assessor is not thereby clothed with the sole authority of
assessing property.  Weidenhaft v. Board of County Comm'rs, 131 Colo. 432, 283
P.2d 164 (1955).
<P>Section does not make office of county attorney either elective or
appointive.  This section created the office of county attorney, but it did not
determine whether it was to be an elective or an appointive office, the purpose
being simply to provide for the time of the election, if the general assembly
made it an elective office.  There is no act of the general assembly upon the
subject, and, in the absence of legislation, there is no means provided for
filling the office.  Therefore, there is, until the general assembly determines
whether the office is elective or appointive, in effect no such office as that
of county attorney proper, and the statute which authorizes county
commissioners to employ counsel has not been superseded by this section.
People v. Lindsley, 37 Colo. 476, 86 P. 352 (1906).
<P>Applied in Mannix v. Selbach, 3l Colo. 502, 74 P. 460 (1903); People ex
rel. Stidger v. Horan, 34 Colo. 304, 86 P. 252, 114 Am. St. R. 163 (1905);

COUNTY OFFICERS
<P>Section 6.  County commissioners - election - term. In each county having
a population of less than seventy thousand there shall be elected, for a term
of four years each, three county commissioners who shall hold sessions for the
transaction of county business as provided by law; any two of whom shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  Two of said commissioners
shall be elected at the general election in the year nineteen hundred and four,
and at the general election every four years thereafter; and the other one of
said commissioners shall be elected at the general election in the year
nineteen hundred and six, and at the general election every four years
thereafter; provided, that when the population of any county shall equal or
exceed seventy thousand, the board of county commissioners may consist of five
members, any three of whom shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business.  Three of said commissioners in said county shall be elected at the
general election in the year nineteen hundred and four, and at the general
election every four years thereafter; and the other two of said commissioners
in such county shall be elected at the general election in the year nineteen
hundred and six and every four years thereafter; and all of such commissioners
shall be elected for the term of four years.
<P>The term of office of the county commissioners in each county that expires

1905, and the term of office of the county commissioners that expires in
January, 1906, is hereby extended to the second Tuesday in January, A.D.  1907;
and in counties having a population of more than seventy thousand, the term of
office of the commissioners that expires in 1904 shall be extended to the
second Tuesday in January, 1905, and the term of office of the county
commissioners that expires in 1906 is hereby extended to the second Tuesday in
January, 1907.  This section shall govern, except as hereafter otherwise
expressly directed or permitted by constitutional enactment.
<P>As amended November 4, 1902.  (See Laws 1901, p. 112.)

<P>This section is mandatory as to number of commissioners of counties of
less than 70,000.  Uzzell v. Anderson, 38 Colo. 32, 89 P. 785 (1906).
<P>The provision of this section adopted at the general election in 1902, by
which the number of commissioners in counties of less than 70,000 population
was limited to three, did not operate to prevent commissioners elected at that
election in counties of less than 70,000, having five commissioners, from
qualifying and serving out their terms.    Such commissioners were entitled to
serve out their terms which by the amendment were extended so as to expire
January, 1907, instead of January, 1906.  People ex rel. Lankford v. Long, 32
Colo. 486, 77 P. 251 (1904).  See Long v. People ex rel. Low, 33 Colo. 159, 79

<P>But optional as to counties exceeding 70,000.  This section, while
mandatory as to the number of county commissioners of counties of less than
70,000, by the use of the word "may", when the population of any county shall
exceed 70,000, leaves it optional with such counties to have three or five
commissioners.  Uzzell v. Anderson, 38 Colo. 32, 89 P. 785 (1906).
<P>Language in section is sufficient to provide for county officers named.
The language in this section and sections 8 and 11 of this article has been
recognized (since its adoption in 1876) as sufficient to provide for the county
officers named.  Thrush v. People ex rel. Elliott, 53 Colo. 544, 127 P. 937
(1912).
<P>Powers and duties of county commissioners are statutory.  County
commissioners are constitutional officers.  Their duties and powers as a board,
are statutory.  The board possesses only such powers as are by the constitution
and statutes expressly conferred upon it, and, in addition, such implied powers
as are reasonably necessary to the proper execution of its express powers.
Robbins v. Hoover, 50 Colo. 610, 115 P. 526 (1911); Skidmore v. O'Rourke, 152
Colo. 470, 383 P.2d 473 (1963).
<P>The well-established rule of law is that county commissioners are officers
with only delegated powers.  Skidmore v. O'Rourke, 152 Colo. 470, 383 P.2d 473
(1963).
<P>Broader powers must be conferred by proper authority.  If broader powers
are desirable for county officers, they must be conferred by the proper
authority.  They cannot be merely assumed by administrative officers; nor can
they be created by the courts in the proper exercise of their judicial
functions.  Skidmore v. O'Rourke, 152 Colo. 470, 383 P.2d 473 (1963).
<P>No consideration of public policy can properly induce a court to reject
the statutory definition of the powers of a county officer.  Skidmore v.
O'Rourke, 152 Colo. 470, 383 P.2d 473 (1963).
<P>County judge is not county officer.  The proposal and adoption of this
section and sections 8 and 11 of this article, art. XX, Colo. Const., dealing
with the city and county of Denver, and   21 and 22 of art. VI, Colo. Const.,
dealing with district attorneys and county judges, as they now stand, evidence
a legislative intent to exclude from the operation of art. XX, Colo. Const., as
a county officer, that of county judge.  Dixon v. People ex rel.  Elliott, 53
Colo. 527, 127 P. 930 (1912).
<P>Sections providing for election of county officers do not apply to city
and county of Denver.  This section and sections 8 and 11 of this article
provide, in effect, that they shall not apply to the city and county of Denver,
as the power is therein granted to the people of the city and county of Denver
to designate the agencies to perform such functions within that territory.

Section 4.  New county shall pay proportion of debt. In all cases of the
establishment of any new county, the new county shall be held to pay its
ratable proportion of all then existing liabilities, of the county or counties
from which such new county shall be formed.
<HR>
<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
Am. Jur.2d.  See 56 Am. Jur.2d, Municipal Corporations, Counties, and
Other Political Subdivisions,   92, 94-95.
<P>C.J.S. See 20 C.J.S., Counties,   35, 36.
<P>Distinction between this and following section.  While this and the
following section relate to a common subject, viz., the pro rata payment of
existing liabilities upon a subdivision of a county or counties, yet they
relate to this subject under wholly different circumstances and conditions.  A
distinct and different rule is likewise provided for each case.  This section
refers to the liabilities of a new county created out of a part or parts of one
or more existing counties.  Section 5 has no reference to the formation of a
new county, but to the division of an existing county, whereby a portion of its
territory is stricken off and added to another existing county.  In the first
case, the new county, as a distinct organization, is "held to pay its ratable
proportion of all then existing liabilities of the county or counties from
which such new county shall be formed"; in the second, the original liability
of the part stricken off is continued. In re Senate Resolution, 9 Colo. 639, 21
P. 478 (1886).
<P>This construction of this section and the following section is not
inconsistent with  25 of art. II, Colo. Const., and the provisions of this
section, being special provisions for specified objects, are not affected by
<P>12 of art. XV, Colo. Const. In re Senate Resolution, 9 Colo. 639, 21 P. 478
(1886).
<P>General assembly may delegate determination of ratable proportion of
existing liability.  The general assembly may, should it see fit so to do,
"ascertain or determine" the ratable proportion of existing liability to be
assumed by the new county.  But such ascertainment or determination involves a
careful and thorough investigation of the various matters necessarily relating
to the subject.  And while the general assembly may enter into such
investigation, it is eminently proper to remit the same to the appropriate
local authorities under suitable legislation.  In re House Bill No. 231, 9
Colo. 624, 21 P. 472 (1886).
<P>There is no provision as to distribution of assets of old county.  This
section contains a provision requiring that each new county, upon the
establishment thereof, shall be made responsible for a ratable proportion of
the "then existing liabilities of the county or counties from which such new
county shall be formed", but is wholly silent as to the distribution of the
assets belonging to the old corporation.  Washington County v. Weld County, 12
Colo. 152, 20 P. 273 (1882).
<P>New county not entitled to part of surplus funds of old county.  This
section requires that each new county, on its establishment, shall be made
responsible for a ratable proportion of the "then existing liabilities of the
county or counties from which such new county shall be formed".  Two counties
were carved out of an old one, under acts providing for the enforcement of this
mandate, and that "all county records and other property" theretofore belonging
to the old county should remain its property.  They further provided for a
tribunal to adjust and settle all matters of revenue proper to be done on
account of the formation of the new county, and to apportion the indebtedness
of the old county.  Held, that the new counties were not entitled to any part
of the surplus funds of the old county.   Washington County v. Weld County, 12
Colo. 152, 20 P. 273 (1888).
<P>In the absence of restrictive constitutional or statutory provision, a new
county carved from an existing county receives none of the assets and assumes
none of the burdens of the parent county.  Washington County v. Weld County, 12
Colo. 152, 20 P. 273 (1888).

Section 3.  Striking off territory - vote. Except as otherwise provided by
statute, no part of the territory of any county shall be stricken off and added
to an adjoining county, without first submitting the question to the registered
electors of the county from which the territory is proposed to be stricken off;
nor unless a majority of all the registered electors of said county voting on
the question shall vote therefor.
<P>As amended by the People November 5, 1974 -- Effective upon proclamation

<P>This section does not restrict power of general assembly to create new
counties from territory embraced in one or more existing counties.  Frost v.
Pfeiffer, 26 Colo. 338, 58 P. 147 (1899).
<P>And there is no vested right in existence of a county.  Parties claiming
to be aggrieved by the detachment of land from a county are not denied due
process or equal protection of the law under the federal constitution, since
they have no vested right in the existence of the county, which, being an
adjunct of the state for administrative purposes, may be increased or
diminished in size by the people by constitutional amendment, or under this
section of the Colorado constitution.  City &amp  County of Denver v. Miller, 151
Colo. 444, 379 P.2d 169 (1963).
<P>The people of the entire state have been and are free to increase or
decrease  the size of a county, or abolish it altogether by a constitutional
amendment or proper legislative act consistent with this section.  City &amp
County of Denver v. Miller, 151 Colo. 444, 379 P.2d 169 (1963).
<P>This section is modified and limited by art. XX, Colo. Const.  People ex
rel. Simon v. Anderson, 112 Colo. 558, 151 P.2d 972 (1944).
<P>Section 1 of art. XX, Colo. Const., modifies and limits this section,
insofar as a proposed annexation of territory to the city and county of Denver
is concerned, and such annexation can be effected without the consenting vote
of a majority of qualified voters of the county from which the annexed
territory is detached.  Board of County Comm'rs v. City &amp  County of Denver, 150
Colo. 198, 372 P.2d 152 (1962), appeal dismissed, 372 U.S. 226, 83 S. Ct. 679,
9 L. Ed.2d 714 (1963).
<P>Even if there existed some constitutional restraint in the maintenance of
county boundaries, the fact that the annexation provisions of  1 of art. XX,
Colo. Const., apply to the city and county of Denver to the exclusion of other
counties would not, on that basis alone, constitute a denial of equal
protection of the laws to the people of a neighboring county.  Board of County
Comm'rs v. City &amp  County of Denver, 150 Colo. 198, 372 P.2d 152 (1962), appeal
dismissed, 372 U.S. 226, 83 S. Ct. 679, 9 L. Ed.2d 714 (1963).
<P>Proceedings for annexation of city to city and county of Denver are not
governed by this section.  Simon v. Arapahoe County, 80 Colo. 445, 252 P. 811

Section 2.  Removal of county seats. The general assembly shall have no

Cross references.  As to location and removal of county seats, see
<P>30-8-101 et seq.
<P>Am. Jur.2d.  See 56 Am. Jur.2d, Municipal Corporations, Counties, and
Other Political Subdivisions,   44-48.
<P>C.J.S.  See 20 C.J.S., Counties,   61-63.
<P>This section requires passage of general law on the subject, the evident
purpose of the requirement being that such law shall provide the regulations
and prescribe the qualifications and requirements necessary and proper for the
exercise of the right under consideration.  Alexander v. People ex rel.
Schoolfield, 7 Colo. 155, 2 P. 894 (1883).
<P>But limits power of general assembly in respect to such law.  The plain,
common sense import of the language used in this section indicates an intention
to restrict or limit the power of the general assembly in respect to the
general law which it was required to pass on the subject.  Alexander v. People
ex rel. Schoolfield, 7 Colo. 155, 2 P. 894 (1883).
<P>There are four principal limitations upon power of general assembly over
the subject of removal of county seats: First, the power to remove a county
seat without a vote of the people is taken away.  Second, the minimum vote
necessary to effect a removal is prescribed.  Third, a minimum limit is fixed
as to the number of years that must elapse between successive submissions of
the question.  Fourth, the power of the general assembly is limited as to the
qualifications of the voters.  Alexander v. People ex rel. Schoolfield, 7 Colo.
155, 2 P. 894 (1883).
<P>Rule as to residence in location of county seat question for general
assembly. Whether the same rule as to residence should be adopted in elections
for the location of a county seat as in one for the removal of a county seat is
a question for the general assembly.  Town of Sugar City v. Board of Comm'rs,
57 Colo. 432, 140 P. 809 (1914).
<P>The clause, "The general assembly shall have no power to remove a county
seat of any county", has not the remotest relation to the question whether the
general assembly may fix the vote, or whether it has been unalterably fixed in
the constitution.  Its effect is to prohibit the general assembly from removing
a county seat without submitting the matter to a vote of the citizens
interested.  Alexander v. People ex rel. Schoolfield, 7 Colo. 155, 2 P. 894
(1883).
<P>"Qualified electors".  Without any accompanying explanation or limitation
the term "qualified electors" means those qualified to vote at elections for
public officers.  Board of Comm'rs v. People ex rel. Love, 26 Colo. 297, 57 P.
1080 (1899).
<P>Applied in Board of Comm'rs v. People ex rel. Love, 26 Colo. 297, 57 P.
1080 (1899); People ex rel. Roberg v. Board of Comm'rs, 86 Colo. 249, 281 P.

<P>And are not protected against state action by fourteenth amendment.  The
equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment of the United States
constitution was not designed to protect state instrumentalities such as
municipalities and counties against state action, much less against the
constitutional right of the people to alter and abolish their constitution and
form of government whenever they may deem it necessary to their safety and
happiness.  Board of County Comm'rs v. City &amp  County of Denver, 150 Colo. 198,

Section 3.  Officers not subject to impeachment subject to removal. All
officers not liable to impeachment shall be subject to removal for misconduct
or malfeasance in office in such manner as may be provided by law.
<HR>
<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
Am. Jur.2d. See 63 Am. Jur.2d, Public Officers and Employees,  178, 181.
<P>C.J.S. See 67 C.J.S., Officers and Public Employees,   117, 118, 145, 186;
81A C.J.S., States,   94-101.
<P>Law reviews. For note, "Impeachment of a State Official", see 8 Rocky Mt.
L. Rev. 50 (1935).
<P>"As may be provided by law", when applied to an elective officer whose
term of office is definitely fixed, can have no other reference than to
constitutional or statutory law.  Burkholder v. People ex rel. Nazarene, 59
Colo. 99, 147 P. 347 (1915).  See Trimble v. People ex rel. Phelps, 19 Colo.
187, 34 P. 981, 41 Am. St. R. 236 (1893).
<P>It is obvious that the words "as may be provided by law" must be held to
include something more than statutory law, or else some limit must be placed
upon the words "all other officers", as used in this section, for, the house of
representatives is authorized to choose its other officers as well as the
speaker; and it certainly cannot be maintained that the subordinate officers of
the house, having once been chosen, and not being liable to impeachment, cannot
be removed, however unworthy or unfit they may be, simply because no statute
has been provided for their removal.  In re Speakership of House of
Representatives, 15 Colo. 520, 25 P. 707, 11 L.R.A. 241 (1890).
<P>Speaker of house of representatives is not included in "officers", as used
in this section, and hence the power of removal can in no way be affected
thereby.  In re Speakership of House of Representatives, 15 Colo. 520, 25 P.
707, 11 L.R.A. 241 (1890).
<P>But he is removable at will and pleasure of house. Conceding that the
speaker is included in this section, nevertheless, the common parliamentary
law, as it existed in this country at the time of the adoption of this
constitution, provided that the speaker might be removed at the will and
pleasure of the house; and such law, not having been repealed or superseded by
any constitutional or statutory enactment, still exists as an adequate
provision for the removal of the speaker in conformity to this section.  In re
Speakership of House of Representatives, 15 Colo. 520, 25 P. 707, 11 L.R.A. 241
(1890).
<P>Police commissioner may be removed under this section, if a statute
provides the basis for such action.  Trimble v. People ex rel. Phelps, 19 Colo.
187, 34 P. 981 (1893).
<P>Mayor can be removed only for grounds specified in constitution. See Board
of Trustees v. People ex rel. Keith, 13 Colo. App. 553, 59 P. 72 (1899).  See
In re Speakership of House of Representatives, 15 Colo. 520, 25 P. 707, 11
L.R.A. 241 (1890); Trimble v. People ex rel. Phelps, 19 Colo. 187, 34 P. 981,
41 Am. St. R. 236 (1893).
<P>Provisions of sections 2 and 3 of this article are mutually exclusive: the
contention that a state officer can be impeached under section 2 or, in the
alternative, can be removed according to the provisions of a legislative
statute contradicts the specific language of this section and is inconsistent
with the plain and unambiguous language of the article.  People v. Losavio,
____ Colo. ____, 606 P.2d 856 (1980).

Section 15.  Veterans' preference. (1) (a)  The passing grade on each
competitive examination shall be the same for each candidate for appointment or
employment in the personnel system of the state or in any comparable civil
service or merit system of any agency or political subdivision of the state,
including any municipality chartered or to be chartered under article XX of
this constitution.
<P>(b)  Five points shall be added to the passing grade of each candidate on
each such examination, except any promotional examination, who is separated
under honorable conditions and who, other than for training purposes, (i)
served in any branch of the armed forces of the United States during any period
of any declared war or any undeclared war or other armed hostilities against an
armed foreign enemy, or (ii) served on active duty in any such branch in any
campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge is authorized.
<P>(c)  Ten points shall be added to the passing grade of any candidate of
each such examination, except any promotional examination, who has so served,
other than for training purposes, and who, because of disability incurred in
the line of duty, is receiving monetary compensation or disability retired
benefits by reason of public laws administered by the department of defense or
the veterans administration, or any successor thereto.
<P>(d)  Five points shall be added to the passing grade of any candidate of
each such examination, except any promotional examination, who is the surviving
spouse of any person who was or would have been entitled to additional points
under paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection (1) or of any person who died
during such service or as a result of service-connected cause while on active
duty in any such branch, other than for training purposes.
<P>(e)  No more than a total of ten points shall be added to the passing
grade of any such candidate pursuant to this subsection (1).
<P>(2)  The certificate of the department of defense or of the veterans
administration, or any successor thereto, shall be conclusive proof of service
under honorable conditions or of disability or death incurred in the line of
duty during such service.
<P>(3) (a)  When a reduction in the work force of the state or any such
political subdivision thereof becomes necessary because of lack of work or
curtailment of funds, employees not eligible for added points under subsection
(1) of this section shall be separated before those so entitled who have the
same or more service in the employment of the state or such political
subdivision, counting both military service for which such points are added and
such employment with the state or such political subdivision, as the case may
be, from which the employee is to be separated.
<P>(b)  In the case of such a person eligible for added points who has
completed twenty or more years of active military service, no military service
shall be counted in determining length of service in respect to such retention
rights.  In the case of such a person who has completed less than twenty years
of such military service, no more than ten years of service under subsection
(1) (b) (i) and (ii) shall be counted in determining such length of service for
such retention rights.
<P>(4)  The state personnel board and each comparable supervisory or
administrative board of any such civil service or merit system of any agency of
the state or any such political subdivision thereof, shall implement the
provisions of this section to assure that all persons entitled to added points
and preference in examinations and retention shall enjoy their full privileges
and rights granted by this section.
<P>(5)  Any examination which is a promotional examination, but which is also
open to persons other than employees for whom such appointment would be a
promotion, shall be considered a promotional examination for the purposes of
this section.
<P>(6)  Any other provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding,
no person shall be entitled to the addition of points under this section for
more than one appointment or employment with the same jurisdiction, personnel
system, civil service, or merit system.
<P>(7)  This section shall be in full force and effect on and after July 1,
1971, and shall grant veterans' preference to all persons who have served in
the armed forces of the United States in any declared or undeclared war,
conflict, engagement, expedition, or campaign for which a campaign badge has
been authorized, and who meet the requirements of service or disability, or
both, as provided in this section.  This section shall apply to all public
employment examinations, except promotional examinations, conducted on or after
such date, and it shall be in all respects self-executing.
<P>Adopted November 3, 1970 -- Effective July 1, 1971. (See L. 69, p. 1254.);
(7) amended November 6, 1990 -- Effective upon proclamation of the Governor,
January 3, 1991. (For the text of the amendment and the votes cast thereon, see
L. 90, p. 1861, and L. 91, p. 2033.); as amended November 3, 1992 -- Effective
upon proclamation of the Governor, January 14, 1993. For the text of the
amendment and the votes cast thereon, see L. 92, p. 2319 and L. 93, p. 2159.)

<P>Annotator's note. Since this section is substantially the same as former
<P>14 of art. XII, Colo. Const., as it existed prior to its amendment in 1970,
relevant cases construing that former section have been included in the
annotations to this section.
<P>Purpose of this section is manifest, and that purpose was to add five
points to the passing grade of any honorably discharged veteran as provided,
and the section should be so construed as to give it that effect without
assault on the words employed.  Perry v. O'Farrell, 120 Colo. 561, 212 P.2d 848
(1949).
<P>And this section should be liberally construed. Perry v. O'Farrell, 120
Colo. 561, 212 P.2d 848 (1949).
<P>There is no distinction between enlistees and draftees expressed in this
section.  Hanebuth v. Patton, 115 Colo. 166, 170 P.2d 526 (1946).
<P>Manner of claiming preference. Where an applicant for a state personnel
examination listed his military service on the application form and submitted
his honorable discharge with his application, it was evident that the applicant
was claiming his veterans' preference.  People ex rel. Metzger v. Watrous, 121
Colo. 282, 215 P.2d 344 (1950).
<P>Demand made prior to appointment of other persons deemed timely. An
honorably discharged veteran, whose name was on an existing promotional
eligibility list, does not waive the veterans' preference, as provided in this
section, if he makes no specific demand for such preference prior to the
certification of others upon such list, but does make such demand prior to the
appointment of the other persons certified.  Perry v. O'Farrell, 120 Colo. 561,
212 P.2d 848 (1949).
<P>Where preference not waived in application. Where the form provided an
applicant to answer questions in connection with a state personnel examination
was arranged so that all of the questions relating to service with the armed
forces could not be answered, the applicant could not be deemed to have waived
his veterans' preference by reason of his manner of filling in the form.
People ex rel. Metzger v. Watrous, 121 Colo. 282, 215 P.2d 344 (1950).
<P>Certificate of service conclusive. A certificate from the United States
veterans administration or from the department of defense that certifies
certain facts with reference to that candidate's service is conclusive.
Bingham v. Bach, 151 Colo. 332, 377 P.2d 741 (1963).
<P>This section contains no language limiting its application to percentage
of disability. Bingham v. Bach, 151 Colo. 332, 377 P.2d 741 (1963).
<P>Applied in Freed v. Baldi, 166 Colo. 344, 443 P.2d 716 (1968); MacManus v.
Love, C.A. no. C-24520 (D.C. Denver, Colo., filed Nov. 24, 1971).

Section 14.  State personnel board - state personnel director. (1) There
is hereby created a state personnel board to consist of five members, three of
whom shall be appointed by the governor with the consent of the senate, and two
of whom shall be elected by persons certified to classes and positions in the
state personnel system in the manner prescribed by law.  Each member shall be
appointed or elected for a term of five years, and may succeed himself, but of
the members first selected, the members appointed by the governor shall serve
for terms of one, two, and three years, respectively, and the members elected
shall serve for terms of four and five years, respectively.  Each member of the
board shall be a qualified elector of the state, but shall not be otherwise an
officer or employee of the state or of any state employee organization, and
shall receive such compensation as shall be fixed by law.
<P>(2)  Any member of the board may be removed by the governor for willful
misconduct in office, willful failure or inability to perform his duties, final
conviction of a felony or of any other offense involving moral turpitude, or by
reason of permanent disability interfering with the performance of his duties,
which removal shall be subject to judicial review.  Any vacancy in office shall
be filled in the same manner as the selection of the person vacating the
office, and for the unexpired term.
<P>(3)  The state personnel board shall adopt, and may from time to time
amend or repeal, rules to implement the provisions of this section and sections
13 and 15 of this article, as amended, and laws enacted pursuant thereto,
including but not limited to rules concerning standardization of positions,
determination of grades of positions, standards of efficient and competent
service, the conduct of competitive examinations of competence, grievance
procedures, appeals from actions by appointing authorities, and conduct of
hearings by hearing officers where authorized by law.
<P>(4)  There is hereby created the department of personnel, which shall be
one of the principal departments of the executive department, the head of which
shall be the state personnel director, who shall be appointed under
qualifications established by law.  The state personnel director shall be
responsible for the administration of the personnel system of the state under
this constitution and laws enacted pursuant thereto and the rules adopted
thereunder by the state personnel board.
<P>(5)  Adequate appropriations shall be made to carry out the purposes of
this section and section 13 of this article.

Section 13.  Personnel system of state - merit system. (1) Appointments
and promotions to offices and employments in the personnel system of the state
shall be made according to merit and fitness, to be ascertained by competitive
tests of competence without regard to race, creed, or color, or political
affiliation.
<P>(2)  The personnel system of the state shall comprise all appointive
public officers and employees of the state, except the following: Members of
the public utilities commission, the industrial commission of Colorado, the
state board of land commissioners, the Colorado tax commission, the state
parole board, and the state personnel board; members of any board or commission
serving without compensation except for per diem allowances provided by law and
reimbursement of expenses; the employees in the offices of the governor and the
lieutenant governor whose functions are confined to such offices and whose
duties are concerned only with the administration thereof; appointees to fill
vacancies in elective offices; one deputy of each elective officer other than
the governor and lieutenant governor specified in section 1 of article IV of
this constitution; officers otherwise specified in this constitution; faculty
members of educational institutions and departments not reformatory or
charitable in character, and such administrators thereof as may be exempt by
law; students and inmates in state educational or other institutions employed
therein; attorneys at law serving as assistant attorneys general; and members,
officers, and employees of the legislative and judicial departments of the
state, unless otherwise specifically provided in this constitution.
<P>(3)  Officers and employees within the judicial department, other than
judges and justices, may be included within the personnel system of the state
upon determination by the supreme court, sitting en banc, that such would be in
the best interests of the state.
<P>(4)  Where authorized by law, any political subdivision of this state may
contract with the state personnel board for personnel services.
<P>(5)  The person to be appointed to any position under the personnel system
shall be one of the three persons ranking highest on the eligible list for such
position, or such lesser number as qualify, as determined from competitive
tests of competence, subject to limitations set forth in rules of the state
personnel board applicable to multiple appointments from any such list.
<P>(6)  All appointees shall reside in the state, but applications need not
be limited to residents of the state as to those positions found by the state
personnel board to require special education or training or special
professional or technical qualifications and which cannot be readily filled
from among residents of this state.
<P>(7)  The head of each principal department shall be the appointing
authority for the employees of his office and for heads of divisions, within
the personnel system, ranking next below the head of such department.  Heads of
such divisions shall be the appointing authorities for all positions in the
personnel system within their respective divisions. Nothing in this subsection
shall be construed to affect the supreme executive powers of the governor
prescribed in section 2 of article IV of this constitution.
<P>(8)  Persons in the personnel system of the state shall hold their
respective positions during efficient service or until reaching retirement age,
as provided by law.  They shall be graded and compensated according to
standards of efficient service which shall be the same for all persons having
like duties.  A person certified to any class or position in the personnel
system may be dismissed, suspended, or otherwise disciplined by the appointing
authority upon written findings of failure to comply with standards of
efficient service or competence, or for willful misconduct, willful failure or
inability to perform his duties, or final conviction of a felony or any other
offense which involves moral turpitude, or written charges thereof may be filed
by any person with the appointing authority, which shall be promptly
determined.  Any action of the appointing authority taken under this subsection
shall be subject to appeal to the state personnel board, with the right to be
heard thereby in person or by counsel, or both.
<P>(9)  The state personnel director may authorize the temporary employment
of persons, not to exceed six months, during which time an eligible list shall
be provided for permanent positions.  No other temporary or emergency
employment shall be permitted under the personnel system.
<P>(10)  The state personnel board shall establish probationary periods for
all persons initially appointed, but not to exceed twelve months for any class
or position.  After satisfactory completion of any such period, the person
shall be certified to such class or position within the personnel system, but
unsatisfactory performance shall be grounds for dismissal by the appointing
authority during such period without right of appeal.
<P>(11)  Persons certified to classes and positions under the classified
civil service of the state immediately prior to July 1, 1971, persons having
served for six months or more as provisional or acting provisional employees in
such positions immediately prior to such date, and all persons having served
six months or more in positions not within the classified civil service
immediately prior to such date but included in the personnel system by this
section, shall be certified to comparable positions, and grades and
classifications, under the personnel system, and shall not be subject to
probationary periods of employment.  All other persons in positions under the
personnel system shall be subject to the provisions of this section concerning
initial appointment on or after such date.
<P>Repealed and reenacted, with amendments, November 3, 1970 -- Effective
July 1, 1971.  (See Laws 1969, p.  1252.)

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
I.  General Consideration.
<P>II.  Officers to Whom Section
<P>Applicable.
<P>III.  Power of Removal.
<P>I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Am. Jur.2d.  See 15A Am. Jur.2d, Civil Service,  3.
<P>C.J.S.  See 67 C.J.S., Officers and Public Employees,   49-65; 81A C.J.S.,
States,   93, 108, 136-140.
<P>Law reviews.  For article, "Some Legal Aspects of the Colorado Coal
Strike", see 4 Den. B. Ass'n Rec. 22 (Dec. 1927).  For note, "Colorado's
Ombudsman Office", see 45 Den. L. J. 93 (1969).
<P>Purpose of state personnel system legislation is to protect employees from
arbitrary and capricious political action and to insure employment during good
behavior.  Such protection applies during authorized service.  Tenure, however,
is not meant to guarantee duration of employment for any number of set years or
over any particular period of time.  Coopersmith v. City &amp  County of Denver,
156 Colo. 469, 399 P.2d 943 (1965).
<P>This section and state personnel system act, section 24-50-101 et seq.,
are liberally construed so as to accomplish their purpose, which is to promote
efficiency in the state personnel system by appointing or employing those only
who, upon examination, have shown their qualification for the office or
position.  Shinn v. People ex rel. Rush, 59 Colo. 509, 149 P. 623 (1915);
Roberts v. People ex rel. Dunbar, 81 Colo. 338, 255 P. 461 (1927).
<P>This section is not repugnant to  9 of art. IX, Colo. Const., relating to
the terms of the state board of land commissioners.  People ex rel. Murphy v.
Field, 66 Colo. 367, 181 P. 526 (1919).
<P>And not applicable to judicial branch employees.  The provisions of this
section as to the terms and conditions of employment of the employees of the
executive branch of Colorado's government do not apply to those who work in the
judicial department.  Hamm v. Scott, 426 F. Supp. 950 (D. Colo. 1977).
<P>Amendment to this section in 1970 replaced "rule of one" with "rule of
three" so that appointments are to be filled by one of three top ranked persons
on the eligible list rather than automatically by the top ranked person.
Haines v. Colorado State Personnel Bd., 39 Colo. App. 459, 566 P.2d 1088
(1977).
<P>Personnel rule adopted for filling multiple vacancies valid.  Rule
4-7-2(b) of the Colorado state personnel system, adopted for filling multiple
vacancies, whereby the Colorado state personnel board added another individual
to the eligible list as each position was filled, thereby providing a list of
three applicants for each of the positions, was not in conflict with subsection
(5) of this section, and was valid.  Haines v. Colorado State Personnel Bd., 39
Colo. App. 459, 566 P.2d 1088 (1977).
<P>Department heads make determination as to what is needed and the state
personnel board cannot substitute its judgment for that of other departmental
heads as to what positions should be filled.  Vessa v. Johnson, 135 Colo. 284,
310 P.2d 564 (1957).
<P>If request from proper officials is made, the state personnel board fills
such position from an eligible list if such exists; if such list does not
exist, it then holds a competitive examination for the position, and in the
meantime, may make a provisional appointment until the results of the
examination are obtained.  Vessa v. Johnson, 135 Colo. 284, 310 P.2d 564
(1957).
<P>Promotions result only from competitive examinations.  This section makes
it imperative that promotions shall result only from competitive examinations
and shall be according to seniority.  Schmidt v. Hurst, 109 Colo. 207, 124 P.2d
235 (1942).
<P>Under this section a promotion is invalid without a competitive test, in
which the person ascertained to be the most fit and of the highest excellence
is entitled to appointment, notwithstanding any rule to the contrary.  Schmidt
v. Hurst, 109 Colo. 207, 124 P.2d 235 (1942).
<P>And may not be made under name of transfers.  Attempts to make promotions
under the name of transfers are in conflict with the state personnel
regulations.  Transfers, without any requirements as to examinations, can only
be made when they do not in fact constitute promotions.  Schmidt v. Hurst, 109
Colo. 207, 124 P.2d 235 (1942).
<P>Mode of examination discretionary.  The fact that a hearing officer was
appointed on the basis of an oral examination does not invalidate his
appointment, because the mode of examination is discretionary with the state
personnel board.  Campbell v. State, 176 Colo. 202, 491 P.2d 1385 (1971).
<P>General assembly may not avoid this section by abolishing office and
creating new one with duties substantially the same, to which new officers are
appointed.  People ex rel. Kelly v. Milliken, 74 Colo. 456, 223 P. 40 (1924);
Colorado State Civil Serv. Employees Ass'n v. Love, 167 Colo. 436, 448 P.2d 624
(1968).
<P>And change in nomenclature from "officer" to "commissioner" does not
change essence of position nor thereby destroy the validity of the person's
qualification or appointment.  Campbell v. State, 176 Colo. 202, 491 P.2d 1385
(1971).
<P>Temporary appointment ceases upon certification of permanent appointment.
A temporary appointment to office under the state personnel system ceases on
the date upon which the board certifies to the appointing power a person for
permanent appointment upon completion of an eligible list.  Roberts v. People
ex rel. Dunbar, 81 Colo. 338, 255 P. 461 (1927).
<P>Conditions of state employment, or election to state office, are to be
limited to those either prescribed in the constitution, enumerated in
applicable statutes, or implemented, where applicable, by the state personnel
board.  Hamilton v. City &amp  County of Denver, 176 Colo. 6, 490 P.2d 1289 (1971).
<P>But imposition of tax upon state employees does not interfere with or add
additional qualifications for state employment, for payment of the tax is not a
prerequisite to being appointed or elected, nor does continuation to the state
position depend on payment of the tax.  Hamilton v. City &amp  County of Denver,
176 Colo. 6, 490 P.2d 1289 (1971).
<P>Power to fix compensation remains in general assembly.  The power to fix
compensation within the classified state personnel system still abides in the
general assembly.  Vivian v. Bloom, 115 Colo. 579, 177 P.2d 541 (1947).
<P>But power is limited by this section.  While authority of the assembly to
fix compensation has not been transferred by the amendment from the assembly to
the board, its authority has been limited thereby.  Under this amendment the
assembly can no longer fix the salary of an individual employee, but only the
salary of each class and grade as established by the state personnel board.
Thus equal salaries for all persons having like classification are assured.
Vivian v. Bloom, 115 Colo. 579, 177 P.2d 541 (1947).
<P>Thus assembly has no authority to discriminate in regard to salaries
between members of any class and grade as established by the state personnel
board.  Vivian v. Bloom, 115 Colo. 579, 177 P.2d 541 (1947).
<P>Although authority may be delegated.  In the fixing of salaries the
assembly has the power of delegation of its authority, but to whomever the
authority may be delegated, it is still subject to the limitation imposed by
this amendment.  Vivian v. Bloom, 115 Colo. 579, 177 P.2d 541 (1947).
<P>Order of dismissal where funds are insufficient to be based on seniority.
In case of failure of the assembly to appropriate sufficient funds for the
account of any department for payment of the employees at the rate to which
they are legally entitled for a full biennium, the proper salary shall
nevertheless be paid to all who are employed so long as funds are available and
employees shall be dismissed, on failure of appropriations, in accordance with
the assembly's restrictions on its appropriation, and the order of seniority
rights.  Vivian v. Bloom, 115 Colo. 579, 177 P.2d 541 (1947).
<P>State personnel are entitled to longevity pay based on time spent in state
service rather than in a particular grade.  Colorado Ass'n of Pub. Employees v.
Colorado Civil Serv. Comm'n, 31 Colo. App. 369, 505 P.2d 54 (1972).
<P>City of Denver has authority to determine term or tenure of service of its
employees, agents and officers, and it follows that it may establish a
mandatory retirement age for its firemen without contravening provisions of
state personnel system legislation requiring that firemen can only be removed
for cause and then only after following the requisite procedure of giving
notice and holding a hearing.  Coopersmith v. City &amp  County of Denver, 156
Colo. 469, 399 P.2d 943 (1965).
<P>One holding office unlawfully was not retained upon adoption of merit
system. People ex rel. Beach v. Chew, 68 Colo. 158, 187 P. 513 (1920).
<P>The failure of hearing officer to take oath of office is not fatal to the
effective performance of his duties.  Campbell v. State, 176 Colo. 202, 491
P.2d 1385 (1971).
<P>Review of historical background relative to appointment of state
personnel.  See Haines v. Colorado State Personnel Bd., 39 Colo. App. 459, 566
P.2d 1088 (1977).
<P>Applied in People ex rel. Clay v. Bradley, 66 Colo. 186, 179 P. 871
(1919); People ex rel. Beach v. Chew, 68 Colo. 158, 187 P. 513 (1920); Lee v.
Morley, 79 Colo. 481, 247 P. 178 (1926); Bratton v. Dice, 93 Colo. 593, 27 P.2d
1028 (1933); Getty v. Gaffy, 96 Colo. 454, 44 P.2d 506 (1935); Raymond v.
Colorado Civil Serv. Comm'n, 104 Colo. 458, 92 P.2d 331 (1939); Aspgren v.
Burress, 160 Colo. 302, 417 P.2d 782 (1966); MacManus v. Love, C.A. no. C-24520
(D.C. Denver, Colo., filed Nov. 24, 1971); Paris v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 32
Colo. App. 21, 510 P.2d 910 (1973).
<P>II. OFFICERS TO WHOM SECTION APPLICABLE.
<P>Merit system in government is generally limited so as to exclude from its
operation certain classes of public officers and employees; such as those made
by law subject to confirmation by legislative bodies, heads of departments,
professional experts, positions of a confidential nature, and those involving
the exercise of judgment and discretion in important matters,  as well as
judges, their clerks and confidential employees.  Board of Educ. v. Spurlin,
141 Colo. 508, 349 P.2d 357 (1960).
<P>This section applies only to officers and employees of state, the word
"state" being used in the sense of employer, or the entity for whom the service
is performed, rather than as a territorial limitation.  People ex rel. Walker
v. Higgins, 67 Colo. 441, 184 P. 365 (1919); People ex rel. Riordan v. Hersey,
69 Colo. 492, 196 P. 180, 14 A.L.R. 631 (1921).
<P>This section embraces officers and employees of the state only.  Although
legislative officers are constitutional officers, they are not state officers.
Officers of the court are not state officers.  This section applies only to
officers and employees of the executive branch of state government.  Colorado
State Civil Serv. Employees Ass'n v. Love, 167 Colo. 436, 448 P.2d 624 (1968).
<P>Officers and employees of court are not within terms of this section,
unless the supreme court so directs.  People ex rel. Riordan v. Hersey, 69
Colo. 492, 196 P. 180 (1921); In re Interrogatory of the Governor, 162 Colo.
188, 425 P.2d 31 (1967).
<P>Clerk of court and his deputies are not state officers and are not under
the state personnel system.  People ex rel. Fisher v. Luxford, 71 Colo. 442,
207 P. 477 (1922).
<P>Jury commissioner is not state officer.  He is an officer of the court,
exercising judicial functions.  People ex rel. Riordan v. Hersey, 69 Colo. 492,
196 P. 180, 14 A.L.R. 631 (1921).
<P>Court bailiffs are officers of court, not state officers and are not
within the terms of this section.  People ex rel. Clifford v. Morley, 67 Colo.
331, 184 P. 386 (1919).
<P>Employees in county departments of public welfare are not state employees
in the classified state personnel system as provided by this section.  However,
the state department of public welfare may provide for the selection,
retention, and promotion of all such employees on a basis of merit and fitness.
In re Employees in County Welfare Dep'ts, 106 Colo. 475, 106 P.2d 464 (1940).
<P>Also educators excluded. It was the intention in adopting this section to
exclude from the classified state personnel system all educators except those
who teach in institutions reformatory or charitable in character.  The
officials of the department of education involved are trained educators.  They
are teachers by training and although they do not practice their profession in
classrooms but are for the most part engaged in research, planning and
promulgation of plans, it is impossible to draw a distinction between them and
teachers whose activities are devoted directly to the classroom.  Board of
Educ. v. Spurlin, 141 Colo. 508, 349 P.2d 357 (1960).
<P>"Educational institution" is subject to both narrow and broad
interpretation and its particular meaning depends not alone on definitions but
also on the history of the amendment as a whole, including the intent of the
framers, the context in which it appears, together with the applicable facts.
Board of Educ. v. Spurlin, 141 Colo. 508, 349 P.2d 357 (1960).
<P>But commissioner of insurance is within this section. He is a state
officer, and is not appointed to perform judicial functions, and is within the
personnel system of the state.  Wilson v. People ex rel. Cochrane, 71 Colo.
456, 208 P. 479 (1922).
<P>And water commissioner.  Considering that the water commissioner is a
peace officer, authorized by statute to arrest and take before the magistrate,
anyone interfering with him in his duties, or disobeying his orders; that his
duties concern the whole state; that he is part of the system prescribed by the
statute for the distribution of water for irrigation -- one principal purpose
of which is the preservation of the public peace -- and is controlled only by
state authority, held that he is an officer of the state.  People ex rel.
Walker v. Higgins, 67 Colo. 441, 184 P. 365 (1919).
<P>And chief inspector of coal mines.  From the time of the passage of this
section a chief inspector of coal mines, theretofore appointed for a four-year
term, held his office thereunder and not under his original appointment.  His
salary having been thereafter increased by legislative enactment, and that
increase approved by the state personnel board, the presumption is that it was
so increased "according to standards of efficient service", and there is no
constitutional prohibition barring him from receiving the benefit thereof.
People ex rel. Dalrymple v. Stong, 67 Colo. 599, 189 P. 27 (1920).
<P>And office of state bank commissioner is under classified state personnel
system.  People ex rel. Beardsley v. Harl, 109 Colo. 223, 124 P.2d 233 (1942).
<P>And chief of Colorado state patrol is to be appointed by the head of the
state department of highways and the appointment must be made from a list of
three persons ranking highest on the eligible list for such position as
determined from a competitive test of competence administered by the Colorado
state personnel board.  Schippers v. Colorado State Personnel Bd., 178 Colo.
154, 496 P.2d 307 (1972).
<P>III. POWER OF REMOVAL.
<P>Employee of state who is within this section cannot be discharged without
hearing on the charges preferred against him.  Board of Capitol Managers v.
Rusan, 72 Colo. 197, 210 P. 328 (1922).
<P>But provisional employee not entitled to such hearing.  A provisional
employee in the service of the state, who has not been appointed according to
merit and fitness as ascertained by competitive examination, is not in the
classified service, and is not entitled to a hearing before removal.  Wilson v.
People ex rel. Cochrane, 71 Colo. 456, 208 P. 479 (1922); Getty v. Witter, 107
Colo. 302, 111 P.2d 636 (1941).
<P>A provisional appointee is not entitled either to notice or a hearing as a
condition precedent to removal.  State Civil Serv. Comm'n v. Cummings, 83 Colo.
379, 265 P. 687 (1928).
<P>State personnel board has power to remove employees upon charges of
inefficiency being filed and after a hearing, if the evidence supports the
charge.  State Civil Serv. Comm'n v. Hoag, 88 Colo. 169, 293 P. 338 (1922).
<P>And courts cannot interfere if evidence sufficient.  If the evidence at
any hearing is sufficient to justify the state personnel board in the exercise
of its discretionary power of removal, the courts are powerless to interfere
with such exercise of discretion.  State Civil Serv. Comm'n v. Hoag, 88 Colo.
169, 293 P. 338 (1922); State Civil Serv. Comm'n v. Hazlett, 119 Colo. 173, 201
P.2d 616 (1948).
<P>The scope of review in certiorari proceedings, and the authority of courts
to interfere with the findings of tribunals vested with exclusive jurisdictions
to determine particular issues, have been judicially defined.  The supreme
court cannot consider herein whether the board's findings are right or wrong,
substitute its judgment for that of the board, or interfere in any manner with
the board's findings if there is any competent evidence to support the same.
State Civil Serv. Comm'n v. Hazlett, 119 Colo. 173, 201 P.2d 616 (1948).
<P>In absence of abuse of personnel board's discretion the supreme court
cannot interfere with the judgment of the board.  Meredith v. Smith, 166 Colo.
256, 443 P.2d 975 (1968).
<P>However, in some instances courts have power of review.  Where a complaint
has been made that no sufficient evidence was introduced to support the charges
made, the court undoubtedly has the jurisdiction and power to review such
proceedings.  State Civil Serv. Comm'n v. Hoag, 88 Colo. 169, 293 P. 338
(1930).

Section 10.  Refusal to qualify - vacancy. If any person elected or
appointed to any office shall refuse or neglect to qualify therein within the
time prescribed by law, such office shall be deemed vacant.
<HR>
<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
Cross reference.  As to how vacancies in county offices are filled, see  9
of art. XIV, Colo. Const.
<P>Am. Jur.2d.  See 63 Am. Jur.2d, Public Officers and Employees,  134.
<P>C.J.S.  See 67 C.J.S., Officers and Public Employees,  48; 81A C.J.S.,
States,  91.
<P>Law reviews.  For note, "One Year Review of Constitutional Law", see 41
Den. L. Ctr. J. 77 (1964).
<P>This section and  9 of art. XIV, Colo. Const., must be read and construed
together.  People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>Provisions of  9 of art. XIV, Colo. Const., are limited by this and
following section.  People ex rel. Callaway v. DeGuelle, 47 Colo. 13, 105 P.
1110 (1909).
<P>"Vacancy" relates to term of office as well as to office itself,  either
or both, according to the facts of the particular case.  People ex rel. Bentley
v. Le Fevre, 21 Colo. 218, 40 P. 882 (1895); Gibbs v. People ex rel. Watts, 66
Colo. 414, 182 P. 894 (1919); People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275
(1963).
<P>The word "vacancy", as used in modern times, relates not only to the
office which is to be filled, but to the term for which the appointment is to
be made.  It is constantly used in statutes and constitutions with reference to
both office and tenure, and the proper interpretation of the word, when power
is given to an executive or a board to fill a vacancy, is a power to fill the
office designated for the unexpired term which may remain after the death,
removal, or resignation of the antecedent incumbent.  When the incumbent dies,
is removed, or resigns, there is a vacancy not only in the office, but in the
term, for which he was appointed, if that was for a definite period.  Monash v.
Rhodes, 11 Colo. App. 404, 53 P. 236 (1898), aff'd, 27 Colo. 235, 60 P. 569
(1900); People ex rel. Callaway v. DeGuelle, 47 Colo. 13, 105 P. 1110 (1909).
<P>Right to office contingent upon qualifying.  When a person is elected to a
term, under the constitution, a contingent or inchoate right to the office is
vested in him, which becomes absolute upon his qualification.  He is elected to
the term and no one else can enter therein until he is ousted therefrom, which
can never be until the commencement of the term.  When he does not qualify, the
contingent right is gone.  There is no one legally entitled to the term, and
when the date of the term arrives there is a vacancy under the constitution,
though there be some one actually and legally performing the duties of the
office.  People ex rel. Callaway v. DeGuelle, 47 Colo. 13, 105 P. 1110 (1909).
<P>A person chosen to fill a term of office is not permitted to assume the
duties of the office until he files a bond and oath of office, which must be
done before the commencement of the term, or the office shall be deemed vacant.
People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>And vacancy occurs whether failure to qualify comes through wilful
neglect, refusal, or impossibility because of death.  Gibbs v. People ex rel.
Watts, 66 Colo. 414, 182 P. 894 (1919).
<P>If one entitled to a new term on the arrival of the term does not appear
and qualify, though the reason thereof be death, there is a vacancy in the
office for the term.  People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>Section recognizes legal vacancy although incumbent continues to perform
duties of office.  This section recognizes a legal vacancy that will authorize
the appointment of a successor, even though nothing has happened to the real
incumbent, and he is continuing to perform the duties of the office.  People ex
rel. Callaway v. DeGuelle, 47 Colo. 13, 105 P. 1110 (1909); People v. Quimby,
152 Colo. 231, 381 P. 2d 275 (1963).
<P>Incumbent of previous term holds over where there is a vacancy in an
office, until an appointment is made.  People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381
P.2d 275 (1963).
<P>Vacancy exists when one term expires and new term of office begins.
People v. Quimby, 152 Colo. 231, 381 P.2d 275 (1963).
