						Investors can do it themselves and avoid the high fees and inflexibility of annuities<p>By Joanmarie Kalter<p>Never underestimate the power of a tax break to make investors behave irrationally. How else to explain the phenomenal growth in the sales of annuities? Investors poured $97 billion into these tax- deferred-savings vehicles in 1995, according to LIMRA International, a financial research association -- almost as much as the record $116 billion that flowed into domestic-equity mutual funds last year.<p>Yet half of those sales were to people whose money was already sheltered from taxes in retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, 403b's, and IRAs. Those investors received no tax benefit from buying annuities. They also paid higher fees and, consequently, earned lower returns than if they had simply invested in a mutual fund. "How can somebody in good conscience sell that?" asks financial planner J. Michael Martin, president of Financial Advantage in Columbia, Maryland. "The benefits don't outweigh the disadvantages," adds David Bohannon, a financial planner in Louisville, Kentucky.<p>Annuities are just complex enough to make it hard for most people to weigh costs and benefits. Most simply, an annuity is an investment contract wrapped in an insurance policy. Investors pay either a lump sum or periodic installments to buy a fixed or variable annuity. With a fixed product, the insurance company that underwrites the annuity and invests those payments guarantees a fixed rate of return, usually for a year. After that, the rate is adjusted annually, based loosely on interest rates, with a guaranteed minimum return of about 3.5 percent currently. Variable annuities let purchasers make their own choices from a menu of mutual funds.<p>The insurance part of the annuity, or wrapper, provides a small death benefit to the investor's heirs and a large tax break to the investor, allowing money in the annuity to grow tax free until it is withdrawn in retirement.<p>The payout on an annuity can take many forms. Investors can withdraw the money in a lump sum or in installments. They can "annuitize" their payout by assigning it to the insurer in exchange for a fixed monthly, quarterly, or annual payment for life. All withdrawals are taxable as income.<p>But even with the tax break, annuities underperform comparable mutual funds. The typical fund offered through a variable annuity charges fees of 2.1 percent a year, compared with the 1.4 percent assessed by the average equity mutual fund, according to Morningstar, which tracks mutual funds and annuities. The extra fees go to compensate insurers for the small risk that they'll have to pay a death benefit and to pay a commission to the insurance agent who sold the annuity. Annuities also charge a surrender fee to investors who withdraw funds early, typically a 6 percent penalty that declines over six years.<p>It's those extra fees that make annuities a poor investment -- even though the tax on accumulated gains is deferred. Consider this example: A 52-year-old (the average age of annuity buyers) in the 31 percent federal-tax bracket puts $25,000 into a variable annuity and chooses a growth fund that pays an average gross return of 10 percent a year. Fees of 1.98 percent a year turn that into a net return of 8.02 percent annually. When he withdraws the money 13 years later at age 65, he'll net $51,835 after taxes, assuming that he's still in the 31 percent federal income-tax bracket. An identical investor puts that $25,000 into a growth mutual fund with the same gross return of 10 percent. This fund charges just 1.19 percent a year in fees -- the average for a growth fund, according to Lipper Analytical Services -- so this investor nets 8.81 percent a year. Each year, he pays income taxes on dividends generated by the fund and the lower 28 percent tax rate on any capital gains. When he retires, he pays capital-gains taxes on any undistributed earnings in the fund. His total nest egg? Almost $1,000 more than the investor who purchased the annuity, or $52,749.<p>That's not the only bad news. Annuities expose investors to two large tax liabilities. First, all earnings on money withdrawn are taxed as ordinary income (at federal rates as high as 39.6 percent), even if those earnings are capital gains, which would otherwise be taxed at just 28 percent. Second, an investor's heirs will be socked with a big tax bill (on top of estate taxes) should the investor die with funds in the annuity. If the initial $25,000 had grown to $100,000, but hadn't yet been withdrawn, the heirs would owe income tax on the $75,000 appreciation. The same gain in a fund or other security would enjoy a stepped-up cost basis at death, freeing it from taxes.<p>The death benefit -- the insurance part of the annuity -- doesn't outweigh these disadvantages. It ensures that heirs will receive at least the investor's initial investment even if the stock market is down when he or she dies. But since most annuities are bought as long-term investments, a return of capital isn't a great reward for a lifetime of saving.<p>Financial planners suggest alternatives that should put more dollars in investors' pockets and that offer more flexibility than most annuities. Martin recommends that conservative investors tempted by fixed annuities (paying an average initial rate of 5.55 percent in December 1995) consider Treasurys with staggered maturities or 
a no-load, triple-tax-free municipal-bond fund. An investor can equal the after-tax return -- and retain the option to cash out before the age of 59 1/2 without a 10 percent tax penalty.<p>Rather than a variable annuity, Bohannon recommends a tax-efficient no-load growth fund, such as the Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio. Its three-year pretax average annual return of 15.56 percent drops to just 14.5 percent after taxes, thanks to the very low 4 percent rate of turnover in the fund's portfolio. The fund charges 0.2 percent in fees annually.<p>Investors can find more information on annuities in The Morningstar Variable Annuities/Life Performance Report ($45 a year, 800-735-0700). It lists almost all annuities on the market, including new variable annuities with low fees and no surrender charges from such companies as T. Rowe Price Associates, USAA Life Insurance, Janus Capital, and the Vanguard Group. <p><p><p>

						More than ever, the safety of your 401(k) is in your own hands -- but a recent court case may shift the onus to employers<p>By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>Is your 401(k) money safe? That's the question of the hour for the 
nation's 22 million 401(k) investors -- most of them baby boomers -- who are relying on the $553 billion in their accounts to see them through their elderboomer years. Given the clout of this group, it's not surprising that First Boomer Bill Clinton, who turns 50 on August 19, recently proposed legislation intended to alleviate boomer worries about retirement.<p>Behind this concern lurks a harsh reality: As corporate paternalism wanes -- 30,000 pension plans have vanished since 1990 -- 
employers are increasingly shoving liability for the rising tide of 401(k) plans onto workers. The Department of Labor regulates the nation's 140,000 401(k) plans, but it will not bail out plans that go belly up, the way the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. saves pensions. So far, thank goodness, no 401(k)s have tanked. It's also illegal for companies to lend money to their 401(k)s in the event of a loss.<p>Critics also say that companies don't apply the same tough fiduciary oversight to 401(k)s that they apply to pensions. That could prove important: Elderboomers stuck with lousy plan choices now could face a dangerously reduced standard of living in retirement, with little recourse to make up the difference.<p>The Labor Department recently proposed new rules to clarify the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which outlines a company's fiduciary responsibility in administering 401(k) plans. The rules describe the fine line employers must walk if they want to avoid responsibility for bad investments undertaken in their plans. For employees, this can be both good and bad. On the one hand, an employer who follows the rules (they're optional) is more likely to offer a solid plan. On the other hand, by following the rules, an employer protects itself against lawsuits and complaints, even if the employer put poor investment choices into a 401(k) plan.<p>The crucial part of the new rules sets the criteria for determining when information becomes advice. Giving investment advice makes an employer potentially liable for the performance of investments. If the employer stays on the information side of the line, you are legally and squarely in control of your 401(k).<p>By law, a boss must give workers the choice of a minimum of three investment options with different risk and return characteristics. Since employers are liable even if they give advice unwittingly, expect less individualized communication. For instance, employers should not offer individual recommendations about 401(k) assets or personal retirement-planning reports.<p>Asset-allocation models are not considered advice. Likewise, you can't hold employers responsible if they merely offer questionnaires, work sheets, and software to help you estimate future retirement-income needs, as long as the guidelines are based on generally accepted investment theories. Basically, employees should no longer expect investment guidance from benefits professionals on 401(k) accounts.<p>For the most part, employers are not liable for plan losses as long as they do all of the following: make a prudent selection of investment funds and managers; offer an array of appropriate asset classes; leave control over 401(k) money to each employee; conduct ongoing due diligence; and release periodic performance evaluations of the investments or managers. "The conventional wisdom is 'Prudence takes precedence,'" says Dennis Coleman, a principal at Kwasha Lipton, a benefits consulting firm in Fort Lee, New Jersey.<p>If an employer doesn't exercise prudence in selecting investment options, however, it can't assert that employees are responsible for their losses. That's what a federal appeals court in Philadelphia said in January when it ruled in favor of employees who are suing Unisys, the computer maker, over $100 million in 401(k) losses stemming from a guaranteed investment contract and bond fund offered in the company's 401(k) plan. The case still has to return to district court for a final decision, but the appeals decision could set a precedent on behalf of investors. This case is "indicative of how unsettled the law is," says Coleman. "When the market cracks, we're going to see all kinds of suits coming out of the woodwork."<p>Unisys got its investments from Executive Life Insurance of California, which went bust in 1991 because of heavy junk-bond losses. The employees argued that Unisys had breached its fiduciary duties of prudence and due diligence by not suciently warning them about the riskiness of the investments or about Executive Life's horrid financial situation. Employees showed that management's due diligence consisted largely of looking at Executive Life's good credit ratings. <p>Unisys employees also claimed that they lacked control over their plan because the company made them wait a year before they could switch out of certain investments. In its defense, Unisys argued that it was protected under ERISA because its employees controlled their 401(k) assets. The court agreed that Unisys had protection under the law, but also concluded that it may have violated its fiduciary duties of prudence and remanded the case back to district court for trial. "If an employer offers a rat hole of an investment," says Martha Priddy Patterson, an employee-benefits expert at KPMG Peat Marwick in Washington, D.C., "the boss's fiduciary duty does not end by merely disclosing that it was a lousy investment." This issue should become clearer when the district court reaches its decision. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Experts<p>FACE THE FUTURE
The geek chorus (the personal-finance press) is singing the wrong tune about 401(k) plans.<p>By Susan Lee<p>I know, I know. I, too, am loath to read one more word on 401(k)s. Almost every biz magazine and financial newspaper has run a mega-lecture on these self-directed retirement accounts. Worse, this large volume of advice has been high volume as well, with writers complaining that people aren't taking these plans seriously and hectoring those who do about the "correct" investment policy. <p>But if you want a contrarian take on 401(k)s, keep reading. I'm going to argue that a casual attitude toward these plans may be sensible given current constraints, and that as these plans begin to permit a more sophisticated approach to investing the conventional wisdom on the "correct" approach becomes all wet.<p>On the surface, 401(k)s do seem like bonanzas: They let participants invest pretax earnings in a personal account, where the money can grow tax-free until retirement. Even better, some employers match these contributions. So it seems a shame that, according to BPS&M, an employee-benefits consulting firm in Nashville, 26 percent of those eligible do not participate and 95 percent of those who do participate contribute less than they could.<p>But a closer look reveals two major roadblocks. First, the amount contributed in any one year is limited by both the Internal Revenue Service and employers. The maximum allowed by the IRS for 1996 is $9,500. The IRS, however, has a complicated set of regulations that can reduce this ceiling under certain circumstances. And many employers choose to lower it even further. Second, the investment options offered by most employers are awfully motley. A typical combination might include company stock, a money-market fund, and/or a stock-and-bond mutual fund. Some employers offer only one of these options. Given the limits on contributions and investment choices, a somewhat cavalier attitude from potential and actual 401(k) participants seems rational. <p>But perhaps the most misguided view in the recent spate of commentary is that 401(k) holders are not following the correct strategy. The advice swamis carp that investors behave like little old ladies, hewing to conservative, low-return investments. The remedy offered__over and over again__is for participants to pump up their investments in stocks, often to as much as 100 percent of their 401(k) portfolios.<p>Now, if this were the end of the story, there wouldn't be much harm done. But changes ahead will transform 401(k)s into important investment vehicles, and this advice could cause plenty of damage.<p>As employers accelerate the switch from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans (pensions and the like) and as Social Security and Medicare benefits dwindle, 401(k)s will represent a larger percent of retirement assets. Ted Benna of 401(k) Association, an advocacy firm, estimates that in five years the average account size will grow from about $30,000 today to $45,000 and will represent 40 percent of a family's retirement assets. In five years, total assets in 401(k)s will bulge from the current $640 billion to more than $1 trillion. Observers expect the number to top $10 trillion by 2020, with average accounts in the $200,000 range.<p>Also, a Department of Labor regulation that took effect in 1994 encourages these plans to be more sophisticated. Employers seeking relief from much of their fiduciary responsibilities for employees' retirements must now offer plans that provide three features: a choice of at least three asset categories, sufficient information to make informed choices, and the opportunity to transfer funds among the categories at least four times a year. Employers have responded__by the end of 1995, 80 percent of those offering 401(k)s had expanded the number of investment choices.<p>In short, by the year 2000, we'll be talking not only serious money but serious opportunities. And the exhortation to load up on stocks could become dangerous. Why? Because this advice is based on two dubious premises.<p>The first one says that stocks will produce higher returns than alternative investments in the long run. <p>Probably true, but not decisive.<p>This argument is usually bolstered with a gee-whiz chart showing that an investment in stocks would have returned an annual rate of almost 9 percent over 90 years as opposed to an annual return of 4 percent for bonds. But the performance being measured represents the overall stock market__to get those returns, you would have had to own the entire market. Returns on individual portfolios and stocks varied widely. And overall market-performance figures do not take into account the erosion in value caused by commissions and fees. <p>Moreover, tiresome as it is to repeat, past performance is no guarantee of future performance. It may be just your luck to buy equities at the start of a period of subnormal returns. Yes, the average annual return for stocks over the past 70 years has been around 10 percent. But in the 1970s, according 
to Ned Davis Research, the average return was just 5.7 percent. (By the way, bonds__that little-old-lady investment__achieved an average annual return of 12.8 percent in the 1980s.)<p>Dubious premise number two: An investment in stocks carries little risk. <p>Mostly false. <p>Usually, advice swamis don't point out that the pursuit of high returns also involves high risk. But that's the trade-off, and it should be gravely considered.<p>By switching to defined contribution plans and giving people the opportunity to manage their own money, employers are forcing employees to bear 100 percent of the investment risk. Overloading on stocks adds to that risk.<p>Higher risk, of course, means a higher probability that investments won't perform. If you have dogs in your regular portfolio, you can always compensate by saving more and pumping that money into other investments. But 401(k) contributions are capped. If your investments lose value, you can't recoup. Where's the beauty in tax-free compounding if the value of your portfolio falls to zero? Since the size of your retirement nest egg matters (a quaint but accurate notion), so does safety.<p>Depressed? Don't be. It's possible to structure 401(k) investments to generate both decent and safe returns. Even if you're stuck in a poky plan now, chances are that over the next several years, as companies continue to focus on their plans, you'll see an improvement in opportunities for managing your money. Herewith some thoughts:<p>1. Figure on investing no more than 80 percent of your entire portfolio in stocks__I don't mean stock-market mutual funds but index funds as outlined below. The rest can go into less risky, fixed-income securities, which you should hold to maturity.<p>2. In that total-stock category, squeeze out a lot of risk by putting about 80 percent of your money into a broad-stock-market izandex fund. The simplest, least expensive way to capture the broader market is to buy a fund that tracks the Wilshire 5000 Index. This strategy means that although you won't outperform the market you won't underperform it, either. And since fees for index funds are usually lower than for managed funds__there isn't as much trading and there's no churning__you won't erode the value of your money with expenses or commissions.<p>3. You can still create a frisson of derring-do and the possibility of higher returns by using the remaining 20 percent of the equity portion of your portfolio to buy funds that focus on the indexes of midsize and small companies.<p>4. And last but certainly not least__ buying your company's stock for your retirement account is definitely not cool. You should be diversified and not dependent on your company both for your employment income and your retirement nest egg and income. Yet, as David Godofsky of BPS&M says, "buying too much of the company's stock is the number-one investing mistake we see." If you're already guilty of this no-no, switch out of that stock and into another vehicle at the next opportunity. <p>The sad truth is that more and more of the responsibility for your retirement income is yours. But you can__if you will forgive the mixed metaphor__shoulder that responsibility without having to stomach excessive risk.<p>Susan Lee, a contributing editor, is an economist and the author of Hands Off!Why the Government Is a Menace to Economic Health, to be published in April by Simon & Schuster.<p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> PAGING ALL PENSIONERS <p>A federal agency gears up to find missing beneficiaries  <p> By Morey Stettner  <p> Amelia Barca's husband, John, worked as a waiter in Glenwood Landing, New York, for more than 20 years. When he retired in the early 1980s, he expected to get a pension that had been setup by the owner of the restaurant where he worked. But by the time he died in 1989, he still had not received a dime.  <p> "My husband once had a lawyer look into it, but he didn't really discuss it that much with me," says Amelia Barca. "So after he died, I just forgot about it."  <p> Four years passed. In 1993, Barca received a letter from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a federal agency that helps individuals retrieve pension benefits from employers whose plans are now underfunded. The PBGC asked Barca to submit a copy of John's birth certificate and complete some forms. Seven months later, she opened her mailbox to find a check for $12,000, which represented part of her late husband's retirement benefits. She also receives small monthly payments that will continue for the rest of her life.  <p> For an invisible group, missing pension-plan participants are the focus of much attention these days. Private industry and the feds both want to find them to deliver the good news--a pension check--and now they're teaming up to track down missing beneficiaries. Under regulations scheduled to take effect in early 1996, the PBGC will serve as a clearinghouse to find retirees and ex-employees owed pensions from fully funded plans that were offered by employers and then terminated (though it will search only for beneficiaries whose plans ended after the new rules take effect). Under the new mandate, private plan administrators who cannot locate participants after a diligent search can turn over the pension money to the PBGC, which will conduct its own search.   <p> There are three main categories of lost pensioners. The first don't realize they're entitled to benefits. Barca was in this category, as are other survivors who never apply for a deceased spouse's pension. A second group is made up of ex-employees who know they should get a pension but cannot locate their old company or plan administrator. The third consists of workers who know they should receive a pension but figure it's not worth much and don't bother to pursue it. "They're typically transient employees,"says Lynn Dudley, director of retirement policy at the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans in Washington, D.C. "They disappear and leave no forwarding address, or they suddenly quit and don't go through a normal exit-interview process, so they miss out learning about their pension benefits."  <p> Almost all companies with defined-benefit pension plans want to locate former workers to give them their money. Otherwise, federal law mandates that the employer must hold the funds and keep administrative records--which can get costly--only to turnover the unclaimed cash to the state treasury if the pensioner isn't found (usually after five to ten years of searching--the time varies by state). With an increasing number of job hoppers leaving a legacy of short stays and small pensions with a variety of employers, there will likely be more misplaced pensioners over time.  <p> That's where the PBGC steps in. The PBGC has traditionally paid pension benefits to people stuck in private plans that couldn't meet their obligations. Today it has expanded its role: It helps individuals track down benefits from companies that may no longer exist, and it hunts for missing pension holders. Case workers review records from Social Security, the IRS, and credit agencies to locate former plan participants.   <p> If you or someone you know might be due pension benefits, the first step is to gather the necessary paperwork. A plan summary benefit report or other pension documents is the best proof of owed money. If those are unavailable, employment records suchas W-2s or pay check stubs can help establish proof of benefits. <p> Once you've shown that you're due benefits, the next step is to locate your plan administrator and find out how much money is left in the pension plan. This information is available on Form 5500, which pension administrators file with the Department of Labor every year. You can get a copy of Form 5500 by writing to the Department of Labor, Pension & Welfare Benefits Administration, 200 Constitution Ave. NW, Room N-5638, Washington, D.C. 20210. <p><p>

						The Clinton administration is pushing pension funds to pursue social improvement before fiscal returns <p>By Jonathan Butler<p>Last fall the buyout and rehabilitation of a run-down housing project on Massachusetts Avenue in Boston's South End was rescued when the Massachusetts State Teachers' and Employees' Retirement Systems supplied $2.2 million to close the deal. The 11th-hour save was a godsend for the 73 low-income families living in the complex. It also generated glowing publicity for state treasurer Joseph Malone. "Through this investment people are going to own their own homes, a neighborhood is going to be revitalized, and people in the construction trades will be put to work," said a beaming Malone, who oversees the state pension funds. "That's a win-win situation."<p>Significantly absent from the winner's circle, however, were the people whose money was being loaned and whose futures depend on the success of the investment__the pension-plan members 
themselves.<p>The financing for the South End project is part of a trend toward using public pension-fund money (public funds in fact belong to the state and local workers who pay into them) to invest in areas the capital markets often avoid, such as low-income housing and small-business development. The growth of these so-called economically targeted investments, or ETIs, has provoked debate over the wisdom of spending tens of billions of pension dollars on investments that often yield lower-than-average returns or entail increased risks in order to achieve certain social goals.<p>Men and women 65 and over make up the country's fastest-growing age group. Simultaneously, the baby boomer population is entering middle age. This demographic surge occurs as the importance of pensions to retirees is also increasing. The national savings rate between 1981 and 1993 averaged only 3 percent, versus 7.7 percent from 1945 to 1980, and defined-benefit pension plans__in which an employer promises to pay a specified amount to a retiree__are the only significant savings many people have.<p>Many public funds are ill-prepared to meet this demographic and fiscal challenge. According to a report issued by the Wyatt Company, a Washington, D.C., consulting firm, contributions to funds in the early 1990s fell 15 percent from the early 1980s, as Congress, "in a triumph of the short term over the longer term ... gradually chipped away at the amount employers can set aside in tax-qualified retirement plans." The effects of this decline can be seen in a 1991 General Accounting Office study of 189 state and local plans that found 68 percent were underfunded, meaning they may not have adequate assets to meet future obligations. Washington, D.C., for example, has only $2 billion in assets to cover a $7 billion pension liability.<p>Underfunding is particularly worrisome because most state employees are over age 41 and expect to retire before age 60. "The proportion of pension plan participants receiving benefits rather than contributing to the plan could increase quickly in the near future," said the GAO.<p>Still, as the ability of pension funds to provide for their members grows more uncertain, the Clinton administration is pushing public-pension-fund investment in ETIs. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich is especially keen on ETIs, particularly as a way to pay for investments in housing and infrastructure the deficit-strapped federal government cannot afford.<p>To date, the $920 billion public-fund sector has sunk well over $20 billion into ETIs. What Reich and other ETI supporters play down, however, is that these public-spirited investment vehicles commonly return far less than traditional stocks and bonds.<p>ETI programs are similar to the "social investment" portfolios that invest only in "green" companies or in firms that do no business with egregious human-rights violators like Iran. Richard Ferlauto of the Center for Policy Alternatives, a progressive think tank in Washington, D.C., says that ETIs should not be judged purely on a fiscal basis, as "they provide greater overall social return per dollar invested." In addition, according to Reich and to Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration chief Olena Berg, ETIs, unlike social investments, can deliver a competitive rate of return without taking on extra risk. They argue that when a pension fund invests in a community, it boosts the local economy, ultimately increasing the long-term returns of the investment.<p>The experience of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, which has managed a $78.8 million real estate portfolio called the Community Mortgage Program for 16 years, suggests these assumptions are false. Between 1978 and 1991, CMP, which Equitable calls "the prototypical ETI program," underperformed all other major market indices. During this 14-year period, CMP, with roughly half its funds in multifamily homes, realized annualized returns of 10 percent, compared with the S&P 500's 16 percent and the Salomon Mortgage Index's 12.1 percent. Put another way, a $10,000 investment in 1978 would have grown to $37,975 in CMP, $79,875 in the S&P 500, and $49,485 in the Salomon Mortgage Index.<p>A 1994 study by Olivia Mitchell, executive director of the Pension Research Council at the Wharton School in Philadelphia, also found that investing in ETIs leads to lower overall returns. According to her calculations, a pension fund allocating 5 percent of its assets to ETIs, as their proponents recommend, would suffer a two-percentage-point decline in annual returns. This would create a serious problem for some funds, which rely on investment returns for more than 80 percent of their pension payments.<p>Nonetheless, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros testified before the Joint Economic Committee on June 22, 1994, that ETIs are a "profitable" way to play the "capital investment gaps" that exist in every market, even the huge, liquid home-mortgage market. <p>This view is echoed by Jon Lukomnik, deputy comptroller for pensions for New York City. He claims that ETI originators can make money finding underserved and creditworthy niche markets, using "specialized knowledge to take advantage of market inefficiencies in exactly the same way a biotech manager knows more about the biotech field." Lukomnik's $332.5 million Community Preservation Corporation program at the New York City Employee Retirement System, which makes low-income housing loans, has annualized five-year returns of 12.7 percent. However, he says, "Slapping the words ETI on a bad investment doesn't make it a good investment. It makes it a dumb investment." Data from both Mitchell and Equitable, however, suggest that more often than not, ETIs are "dumb."<p>Despite their generally poor performance and dubious grounding in market economics, ETIs have been approved by the regulatory agencies overseeing both public and private funds. For public funds, investing in ETIs meets the IRS's "prudent person" rule, which requires that investment decisions be made with the "care, skill, and diligence" of a prudent individual. The Department of Labor has also ruled that ETIs do not violate the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the 1974 law designed to protect pensioners' rights. Both these laws require managers to invest only in the interests of pension-fund members. <p>Republican Congressman Jim Saxton of New Jersey has publicly criticized the Department of Labor on this point, saying, "The DOL seems to have abandoned its designated role as watchdog for compliance with fiduciary duties."<p>Olena Berg denies this, saying her department's role is to educate pension-fund managers about new investment options. "By no means should any of this be taken as encouraging plans to take substandard returns," she says.<p>Some pension-fund officials, however, report being "encouraged" to invest in ETIs. The chief of staff of one state fund says the federal government is using the threat of revoking pension funds' tax-exempt status to increase their receptiveness to ETIs. "They can enact tax policy to change the way people invest," says another fund official. <p>Again, the Labor Department flatly rejects such charges, but Berg recognizes that ETIs carry some inherent risks. In a department bulletin published last June, she conceded that some ETIs "may require a longer time to generate significant investment returns, may be less liquid and may not have as much readily available information on their risks and returns as other asset categories." In addition, the returns on these illiquid and often unfamiliar projects are set not in a large public market, but by a small number of interested players.<p>Despite these warning signals, the Institute for Fiduciary Education in Sacramento, California, reports that in 1992 roughly 40 percent of public pension plans participated in ETI programs. Since then, the Clinton administration has stepped up its advocacy campaign, and it seems reasonable to assume that a still higher percentage of funds today invest in ETIs.<p>Over 80 percent of ETIs are mortgage- or real estate related, and this is the one area where they have been extensively analyzed. Treasury Department assistant secretary Alicia H. Munnell, formerly a vice president at the Boston Federal Reserve, studied targeted mortgage investments in 31 states in 1983 and found almost all involved either an "inadvertent or deliberate sacrifice of return." The few states that did achieve market rates of return did little to increase the aggregate supply of mortgage funds.<p>Mortgage-related ETIs are almost always safe because they are guaranteed by state or federal organizations (in the 1980s, Alaska Retirement Systems lost millions buying unguaranteed in-state mortgages). However, many of the programs that have generated competitive returns have done so at taxpayer expense. New York City's Community Preservation program's 12.7 percent returns, for example, surpassed the 8.8 percent yields of Ginnie Mae bonds, but achieved this in part through a government subsidy of roughly 3 percent. <p>Such subsidies are essentially hidden taxes, says Roger Howeiler, head of the Seattle Employee Retirement System, which has thus far steered clear of ETIs. "Somebody's paying for it," he says. And the most common reason somebody, whether the taxpayer or the pensioner, winds up paying for ETIs is politics. The record of pension funds that invested in projects for political reasons is predictably dismal.<p>In the late 1980s, for instance, the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System, at the urging of Governor John Carlin, invested in the Home Savings Association of Kansas City and the faltering Christopher Steel company in Wichita. The subsequent failure of both of these firms, together with other ETIs gone bad, ultimately cost the state fund between $138 and $236 million and led to several convictions for criminal mismanagement, according to a Prudential Foundation report. The state now prohibits ETI investments by public funds.<p>All sorts of ETI opportunities have captured the political imagination and later wound up on some fund's books. According to Thomas Donlan, author of Don't Count On It, a book on problems within the pension industry, Governor Bill Clinton himself helped convince the Arkansas Teachers Retirement System to finance a mortgage loan for the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority house at the University of Arkansas. "I know the daddies of those girls, and there is no way they would have let that loan go bad," the ATRS executive director later said in justifying the investment.<p>The same oil-and-water mix of politics and investing is invariably present with ETIs. Writing in the Columbia Law Review in 1993, pension expert Roberta Romano said that the political affiliation of many trustees makes public pensions especially vulnerable to pressure by state officials. One East Coast plan official said, "In many states, the office of treasurer is a quasi-political office. People who aspire to political office do things that aren't in the interest of the fund." A West Coast counterpart said flatly, "Any drive to do ETIs comes from politically active members of the pension board."<p>Thus far, ETIs have been largely confined to public pension funds; only a few plans in the $5 trillion private, or corporate, pension universe have invested in them, despite the Department of Labor's enthusiasm. Still, the nation's largest private fund, the $135 billion TIAA/CREF (a retirement fund for private-school and college teachers), set aside $25 million for ETIs in 1993, perhaps a sign that the vast private funding pool is also growing more receptive to these investments. Greenwich Associates, a Connecticut-based consulting firm, reports that 6 percent of all endowments and foundations invested in ETIs in 1993.<p>Pension-plan members are virtually never informed when their funds invest in ETIs, but Karen Ferguson at the Pension Rights Center in Washington, D.C., says private-plan members can find out about them by writing their plan administrator and requesting Form 5500. Most plans with more than 100 members must provide with this statement a list of investments that would include any ETIs.<p>Those invested in state or local public plans should ask the administrator to send the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, says Paul Zorn of the Government Finance Officers Association. If ETIs are not mentioned, do not assume they don't exist. Write a letter to the plan administrator asking specifically about ETIs. Also, most public plans have elected board representatives who can be contacted. Public and private plan members with suggestions or complaints should write to the chairman of the board of trustees. "They should speak up," says Ferguson. "It's their money."<p>It is ironic that Labor Secretary Reich, a self-proclaimed champion of the middle class since the days when he was a graduate student at Harvard, should have led the charge for ETIs. The likely losers, after all, will be the middle-class pensioners__whose retirement may be considerably less secure and comfortable than it might otherwise have been.<p><p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Feature  <p> PARADOX FOUND <p>They aren't rich, they didn't plan and save, but they're living the retirement of everyone's dreams. Should we all follow these older Americans? Or is life on a Third World tropical island something less than the Great Escape?  <p> By Elizabeth Royte  <p> Ray Steinbach rises early, sniffs the breeze from his screened porch, and considers the small breakers riffling over the coral reef in his backyard. It's too windy to fish today, he determines, so he gets his maid, Lee--"Don't ask me her last name," he says;"I can't even pronounce it"--to fix his breakfast, and then he's off in his launch, a short hop across a crystalline channel, to get his truck.   <p> Steinbach, 67, is a robust, tall man with the placid demeanor of a rural Midwestern veterinarian, which he was. Doc, as he's known, comes from Overton, Nebraska, a town of 665. His eyes are a clear blue, his arms muscular and tanned. Seven years ago, divorced and looking for a place to retire, he scanned the globe and settled here on Roatan, a small island off the northern coast of Honduras. "In Australia, everything was so far apart, you couldn't function," he says. "Hawaii was expensive and touristy. Arizona was a rip-off. You could do two things: golf or polish rocks. I like to hunt, to fish, to travel. In the Bahamas, the people had a negative attitude; Cozumel was too touristy. You know, every other place just looked kind of stupid to me."  <p> Doc had first visited Roatan, one of Honduras's three Bay Islands, on a diving vacation in 1986. The next year he bought a one-acre beachfront plot, in the backyard of a divers' resort, for $28,000. On his simple octagonal house--two bedrooms, two baths, two hammocks on the porch, one satellite dish, and a free-standing ice machine--he spent another $45,000. "The ice is for my fish," he says.  <p> "I chose Roatan because I liked the common folk here and the weather and the fishing," Doc says. "I honestly can't say there's a single drawback. I go to Florida once a year for three days of shopping--some food items I can't get here, mechanical parts--and that's two days too long. I can't stand the traffic, the weather, the crime. Here I can do anything I want. Here I have freedom." <p> For Doc, freedom means lighting out in his powerboat and drifting around the Little Hog Islands. It means sending his down rigger a thousand feet deep and pulling up snapper, grouper, and silks. It means doctoring the locals' animals, leaving the cooking and cleaning to Lee, catching a 30-minute nap after lunch, and scuba diving with the whales if they happen to swim by.  <p> Doc Steinbach is one of a growing number of Americans looking for sand, sun, and the other tropical elements that make up an early universal retirement dream. Where in the past only lottery winners and Marlon Brandos got to drop out of society to live on a remote island, more and more older Americans are coming to realize that retiring on foreign soil isn't just an escapist option--it may be the only way they can afford to live in comfort and style.   <p> Americans today are working longer than ever before and ending up with less to show for it. As the prospects of a high standard of living in their home communities dwindle, more and more retirees--now totaling 360,000, by the Social Security Administration's last count--are moving abroad, to countries where a fixed income goes further, where younger American expats have already made inroads, the economy and political climate are stable, and trips home to the States are routine affairs. Given that prescription, it's not surprising that tens of thousands of retirees have settled in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Belize in the last decade or so and that Roatan, just slightly more difficult to reach, is beginning to catch on.  <p> Doc parks his pickup outside a hardware store in French Harbour, a bustling, cramped town with one narrow, rutted road and several dozen pulperias--small shops that sell rice, beans, polyester T-shirts, and other essentials of Honduran life. From deep in the barrio wafts the Third World smell of burning garbage and sewage. This is the other Roatan, the side most of the island's hundred or so expatriates avoid: the barefoot children, the abscessed dogs, the pigs running in the mud.  <p> But Doc isn't like most expats. He knows what Roatan is really about because he socializes with locals and works with them; he eats their food, and they eat his fish. Mornings when the wind is up and fishing isn't an option, Doc can often be found at Mac's Meat Market poking into dogs and cows and pigs, treating them for mange and parasites. "You've got to stay busy here,"Doc says. "Otherwise you start to get a little soft in the head." <p> Doc doesn't charge for his services, but he's found that helping his neighbors pays off in other ways. "I get my lobster and shrimp for free, because I doctor the fishermen's animals," he says, puffed with pride. "A mechanic works on my car and boats, because I wormed his hogs. They invite me to their houses for dinner. The treat here is iguana. I damn near threw up the first time I ate it. Now I love it."  <p> Swinging open the door of the hardware store, Doc locates Edgar Bodden, a skinny, mocha-colored man in his early 20s. Edgar, who works in the store's business office, is an eighth-generation Roatan native. He went to college in Louisiana and is among the island's solid middle class--of builders, purveyors of durable goods, and providers of upscale services--that's benefiting from the boom in Americans.  <p> With the islander in his passenger seat, Doc drives to Edgar's white ranch house, nestled among palm trees atop a small hill. Edgar retrieves a plastic rice sack, from which Doc pulls out a frosty-looking black-and-tan puppy--Doc's mission this morningis to find out why the puppy died.   <p> "She's still a little hard," Doc says, placing the puppy on his truck tailgate, "but we should be fine." Working quickly, he separates the liver from the intestines, the kidneys from the pancreas.  <p> "Kidneys look normal," he says, "but look at these spots on the liver." He points with the tip of his postmortem knife. When he sees the blood in the intestines, he knows what he's looking at: parvo. He slides the rest of the puppy into the sack, and Edgar disposes of the carcass.  <p> In Roatan, Doc Steinbach fancies himself mayor, city council member, and Santa Claus, all rolled into one tall Midwestern guy in a blue cap. It takes him half a day to pass through town, he's got so many local people to yell hello at. "Hey there,"he shouts out the window of his little red truck to a young woman."How ya doin', buddy?" he waves to a toothless old man. The man nods in greeting. "Hi, partner. Need a lift?" he asks a teenager. He flirts with elderly women, he jokes with little boys. On the main road he loads up his truck with young men waiting for collectivos, the local jitneys, but he's wary of big women. "You get a couple of those 200-pounders in there, you're in trouble," he says, winking.  <p> "Doc adapted to our lifestyle, the slower way of doing things, "Edgar had said while Doc chatted up the young women in the store. "Other Americans come and expect to bring their lifestyle here. "Doc sums up his position like this: "The locals are the ones you want to get along with. The Americans don't matter."  <p>  <p>Harvey Meyer, an American, certainly matters--if not as a presence in Doc Steinbach's daily life, then as a pioneer. If Meyer hadn't settled in Roatan 34 years ago, there might well be no Americans on the island today.  <p> Meyer, 78, tends to describe Roatan with sunny adjectives; his anecdotes about the past are rife with high times and nutty neighbors. It's up to Virginia, his wife, to sketch the shadows around Harvey's bright memories. But on one point they do agree: Roatan has provided a most successful escape from the noise, crime, and expense of the United States. "I can't stand those eight-lane freeways, the shopping till you drop," Virginia says. "We go up there to torture ourselves so we appreciate this place when we get back." <p> This place is the gracious two-story house the Meyers built in Oak Ridge, a bustling fishing port. With its sandy beaches and surf, mangoes and marlin, the Meyers knew it was paradise the minute they saw it. "I loved the people, the pace of life, everything," Harvey says, delighted, even today, when he thinks of it. He reaches for Virginia's Imperial and takes a deep drag. <p> Now she cuts in, snatching back her cigarette with a wry smile."It was grim and rustic," she says, inhaling.  <p> The Meyers moved to Roatan from Newport Beach, California, where Harvey was a sports-car dealer. Harvey first visited Honduras in 1960. He flew to La Ceiba, on the mainland, where he met a man with a Piper Tri-Pacer prop plane. "There were no boats running to Roatan then, and the island had no airport," Meyer says. "This man said, Meet me at the plane at 6 a.m., and we'll see if we can find a place to land.' " They circled, buzzed a few cows out of a pasture, and then Harvey Meyer became the first person to step out of an airplane on Roatan. The next year he would return for good, bringing with him the means to build an iceplant. At first, ice meant only one thing on Roatan: cold beer. But soon it also meant commercial fishing, which, along with tourism based on scuba diving, has become the heart of the local economy.  <p> The Meyers don't know Doc Steinbach, and in truth there's no reason they should. Doc is the expat of our imagination--eating new foods, fumbling with a new language, embracing the values of his adopted land. Harvey and Virginia, for whom Honduras holds nothing new, no longer see the charm in such exertions.  <p> But it wasn't always this way. As recently as15 years ago, the Meyers lived without hot water. Until 1993, just a dirt track connected Oak Ridge, in the middle of the island, to Coxen's Hole, the island's capital, in the west. The road snaked around the mountainous spine of the island, winding and bending up and downhill for 24 miles. It took half a day by car. Until 1991, to make a phone call, the expats had first to get to Coxen's Hole, then find a plane to take them to the mainland. If the expats wanted pork or beef, they waited until someone killed an animal. If they wanted chicken, they'd visit a neighbor and point out their dinner in the yard.  <p> Throughout the '60s, the Meyers were more or less on their own. It wasn't until the '70s that more Americans began arriving--on yachts and on diving vacations. Attracted by the weather, the low cost of living, and the endless-summer ethos, many stayed. The younger ones opened dive shops and resorts; the older ones built their pleasure domes, hired local help, and thumbed their noses at the poor slobs back in Detroit, Denver, and Chicago.  <p> A sense of adventure fueled these pioneers, and the frustrations brought them together. Over their VHF radios, they'd arrange cocktail parties, barbecues, and card games. "Everyone knew everyone in those days," Virginia says. "People were interesting; we were snorkeling, having fun." Because Roatan had no theater, gallery, movies, bowling alley, golf course, or baseball diamond--and still doesn't--house calls became the sole pastime. And because it took so long to get anywhere, visiting couples would stay at their host's for several days. It was all very 19th century,both in spirit and in the particulars.  <p> The expatriates seem to have built their houses with entertaining in mind. Their kitchens are capacious and well-stocked. Everyone has at least one spare bedroom; dining tables seat 12. As electricity became more dependable, the Americans, long deprived, rushed headlong into the 20th century. They bought electric grills, CD players, and large-screen TVs. They installed microwave ovens, blenders, food processors, and electric knives, the better to carve their Thanksgiving turkeys.  <p>  <p>As every vacationing scuba diver on Roatan quickly learns, Columbus visited the Bay Islands in 1502, though he didn't land on Roatan. For the next century, the Spanish visited frequently to shipout the local Paya Indians as slaves and to provision their ships. In 1638, Puritan settlers from Maryland became the first Anglosto set up on the islands and gave it the English identity it still has.  <p> The British laid official claim to the Bay Islands in 1742 but granted them to Spain, after struggles both military and political, in 1748. The Paya had long ago been exiled to the mainland, and successive waves of black Caribs--descendants of Carib Indians and African slaves--and white and black Cayman Islanders settled here. In 1821, Honduras won its independence from Spain but wasn't able to control the islands, and in 1852, England officially annexed them. Under pressure from the United States, Britain finally ceded the Bay Islands to Honduras in 1859.  <p> Because of its widespread poverty, lack of infrastructure, and a perception of being politically dangerous, Honduras never attracted a lot of tourism, let alone foreign investment. American retirees in Central America have traditionally favored Costa Rica and Belize. But Honduras has never had a civil war or guerrilla army, and the Bay Islands, where the people speak mainly English, still seem more Caribbean than Central American.  <p> Roatan certainly isn't the gringo retirement mecca of the Americas: Every month  56,000 Social Security checks go to Mexico alone. But as Mexico has become more industrialized and prices have risen, Americans have followed a trail south, stopping in Costa Rica, Belize, and Guatemala. About 17,000 retired Americans make their primary homes in Central America and the Caribbean.  <p> The Honduran government makes it fairly simple for Americans to move here: There is no duty charge on the first load of household goods, the first car, and the first boat, though there is a $1,000 fee for establishing residency. The government asks only that newcomers be in good health and free of AIDS (a letter from a doctor will suffice) and that their bank accounts are sufficiently padded to preclude their seeking work (it likes to see $600 a month steady). Expats pay taxes of $50 per $100,000 of their property value per year, a poll tax of less than a dollar per year, and about $3 a year to keep a driver's license. It costs about $100 a year to license a car; insurance is not required. Most expats travel on U.S. passports and pay $25 a year to renew their residency cards.  <p> The Meyers live on about $1,000 a month, which comes out of their Social Security checks and a few investments. If they rented a smaller house and lived more like Hondurans--used less electricity and ate more native foods--they could get by on half as much. Americans typically pay $40 or $50 a month for electricity, $4 for water, $10 for propane.  <p> And for another $50 a month, they get the luxury they all seeas a necessity: a maid, or as most expats call her, a girl. The girl, on Roatan, has come to symbolize the good life, the reason these Americans have dropped out of the industrialized world and accepted the myriad frustrations of a remote Honduran island. The Meyers' girl cleans six days a week, for which she is paidless than $50 a month. Two boys come regularly to help with yardwork, bathe Mr. Pickles (the Meyers' schnauzer-shaped mutt), and do maintenance around the Meyer compound--a three-acre lot with a barn-size workshop, laundry house, dock, and boathouse."We couldn't afford to live this way in the States," Harvey says."It's just a better life here."  <p> The fly in the ointment for these retirees--all of them getting on in years, most of them uninsured--is health care. Some things they take care of on trips back to the States. Pressing problems can be addressed in San Pedro Sula, on the Honduran mainland, where the hospital is clean, efficient, and staffed largely byAmerican-trained doctors. But for the most part the expats takecare of themselves, buying pharmaceuticals over the counter at the island drugstore. Better the Merck manual, they joke, than the local doctor.  <p>  <p>The Americans on Roatan do their share of good deeds for the locals--sending kids to the States for operations, putting a roof on the library, buying uniforms for schoolchildren--but a certain animosity between the two groups festers. Locals, whose first impressions of Americans came from well-heeled divers on vacation, tend to think of them as arrogant and rich, warped by superiority complexes. Indeed, expats habitually denigrate the quality of local workmanship and services; they roll their eyes at mundane inefficiencies. Though many older expats say they love Roatan because of its friendly, open people, their behavior belies this sentiment. "Oh, sometimes when we have a party, we'll invite a local," says one retiree, "but, you know, only the more affluent ones." The expats are particularly disheartened by the influx of mainland Hondurans, who are referred to, with undisguised disdain, as "the Spaniards." "We never would have gone to the Honduran mainland to retire," says one woman. "We came for Roatan. When we moved here, there were only five Spanish-speaking people on the island. And now Honduras is taking it over."  <p> To an outsider, the Americans appear isolated--from the local culture and from each other. But no expat admits to missing more than a fragment, usually a favorite food, of life in the States. Perhaps this is how it has to be--having uprooted themselves once, at a younger, more adventurous age, they now find they have no place left to go. And then there is this eternal question:Whatever the shortcomings of Roatan, who could say if things would be any better back home, especially if finances were tight? <p> "You come down here when your kids are grown up and your friends back home are fewer and fewer," says Dorothy Reid, 67, who moved to Roatan from Michigan with her husband, Bud, 71, in 1976. "And you develop your own life. People say they'll visit at first, but they don't too much. We watch a lot of TV."  <p> Despite all this, "I never feel trapped or like leaving," Dorothy says. "I missed my family at first, but not now." She pauses a moment and sighs. As if aware that she sounds a little defensive, she takes a moment to collect more evidence. In the lifestyle's favor, she announces, "I haven't had panty hose on in 20 years." <p>  <p>"Hello, Miss Audrey." the clerk in the post office looks up from her magazine and smiles.  <p> "Hello," Audrey Buderus answers breezily, not stopping but heading straight for a shelf in the back of the dark, cement-floored room. She takes a single letter from a plastic bag. "The post office once got metal boxes," Audrey says, "but they lost the keys almost immediately." When Audrey, 64, and her husband, Brooks,76, moved here 24 years ago, mail could take several weeks to get from the States to the Honduran mainland, and then on to Coxen's Hole, where it could sit another two weeks before it went to Oak Ridge and Port Royal.   <p> Twice a week, the Buderuses drive to Coxen's Hole from their house in Sandy Bay, near the island's west end, to collect their mail and shop. Today, they pass a young man with an assault rifle standing guard outside the bank and head for the municipal building to unravel some red tape concerning their yearly poll tax. Brooks waits outside.  <p> He is a good-looking man with wavy silver hair that he wears a little long. In general, he has a distracted manner, but when he talks about the past, the good old days on Roatan, he becomes animated. Today, wearing black espadrilles and dark sunglasses, he looks like Cary Grant playing an expat in some seedy foreign port. Audrey is bright-eyed and sophisticated, with smooth skin, white-yellow hair, and terrific legs. For her errands today, she's put on a turquoise batik top and pants, white sandals,three heavy bracelets, blue eyeshadow, and eyeliner. She looks like a Miami hostess.  <p> Brooks, a Chicago architect, was hired to design Anthony's Key Resort, Roatan's first hotel devoted to divers, in 1967. After Anthony's opened, its owner fed the Buderuses several martinis and asked them if they'd like to manage the place. They accepted and moved to Roatan in 1970. "We were looking forward to being culturally deprived," Brooks says. "It was a challenge."  <p> Brooks managed the resort for a time; Audrey ran a gift shop. By 1991, they were both officially retired, with no interest in returning to the States. "Chicago's Loop would kill me in a weekend," Brooks says. Now they spend their evenings watching videos; they have a library of 300 tapes. "It's our sole entertainment, "Brooks says, somewhat sourly. But he's kidding. Hundreds of audiotapes and CDs fill the built-in wall cabinets in the Buderuses' airy house.  <p> Audrey emerges from the municipalidad, and Brooks follows her to H.B. Warren, a store that, with its aisles of housewares, its dry goods, and its lunch counter, resembles a Woolworth's from the early '60s. Pat Wagner, a younger American recently arrived, turns the corner with her cart and spies Dorothy Reid. Dorothy has been in the States for a month and just got back two days ago. "Dotty!" "Pat!" They hug in front of the liquor display. Audrey smiles and picks up two ears of corn and some rusty iceberg lettuce--the boat that brings romaine from Tampa won't be here for two weeks. Brooks reaches for a gallon of rum, but Audrey says, "No, put it back."  <p> The Buderuses head next for Mac's Meat Market, then Julie's, and then Eldon's. Julie's specializes in American goods, at prices two or three times higher than in the States. A half gallon of Tropicana orange juice, for example, goes for $5. Eldon's is the place for dog food and, finally, that gallon of rum. After a brief stop at the chicken farm, Audrey is finished. She's spent four hours collecting food over half the island.  <p> Audrey and Brooks have outlived a lot of the difficulties they first encountered on Roatan. They've also outlived a number of friends and are now seriously considering moving to Antigua, Guatemala, where they started leasing a house several years ago. <p> They hope life will be a little cheaper there. More important, they know it will be familiar. "We have more friends there, other Americans we've met over the years," Brooks says. For the Buderuses, the mystique of living on a tropical island no longer obtains. They don't like the Spaniards. They aren't comfortable with the newest crop of Americans, who seem obsessed with money and are hard to get to know. The outside world, they say, is catching up with Roatan.  <p>  <p>In the last three years, real-estate agents on Roatan have seen property values triple as Americans buy vacation homes and retirees settle down for good. Ten years ago, an acre of beachfront on the island's densely populated west end cost about $4,000. Now, one developer is getting $100,000 for his half-acre sites--an unholy amount of money in a place where a typical yard workerearns about 50 lempiras, or $6, a day.  <p> Besides the social unrest such rapid change has wrought, long-time residents--locals as well as outsiders--also have environmental concerns. The swamps are disappearing, and with them fresh water. At the west end, a water shortage is keeping new lots from selling. And yet new resorts continue to rise.   <p> The paved road was begun just five years ago, electricity became reliable four years ago, and jet airplanes landed only some three years ago. Progress has become inexorable. The condos are on their way, satellite dishes and crack cocaine are here, and more and more Nissan Pathfinders are careening around the island's hills at breakneck speed, blowing past stray cattle and old men hauling palm fronds on horseback, machetes slung over their shoulders. <p> "When I first came here, there was no tourism, no crime, no pollution or drugs," says Mike Muller, sitting on the deck of his house in Oak Ridge, watching the moon rise over the sea. Muller, 42, has been traveling back and forth between Roatan and Memphis, where his family's business is located, for 20 years."I used to dream of a satellite dish, but now that I have one, I find it's not nearly so much fun. It's too much of the rest of the world."  <p> In the next breath, Muller says he is looking forward to the day he can buy his fat-free mayonnaise here. But then, he suddenly realizes, Roatan will be just like home, and he wouldn't want to live here, either. It's just one more paradox in the life of Roatan's expats, people who had the imagination and temerity to leave behind all that was familiar but ended up simply duplicating their old lives in a warmer, cheaper venue.  <p>  <p>After returning edgar to the hardware store, Doc Steinbach heads home for a nap. Maybe the wind will settle down later and he'll get some fishing in. Whatever, he's content. Doc seems the happiest of Roatan's retirees. After seven years in his octagonal house, he's sufficiently steeped in island culture to appreciate its ordinariness. Save for his outsize Midwestern personality, he brought little of his former life here. His expectations are modest, so he has yet to be disappointed with either the locals or himself. He is, after all, a man with eight fishing rods. <p> And a man with a real place in his community. It was locals, not Americans, who missed Doc when he'd been absent for two days, mounted a search, then located him adrift on a stalled boat 57 miles west of Roatan. A local pulled up to Doc on the open sea and told him to hurry up and get aboard. "We can't afford to lose you," the man said. "I might need surgery on my horse again."  <p> <p>

Simplicity is the upside, maintenance the downside<p>By Kathy Murray <p>Many employers are redesigning pensions to make them easier for employees to understand and take along with them when they change jobs. "The drive for simplicity has become a touchstone for many companies," says Jason Jeffay, benefits consultant at Hewitt Associates. "They want to attract younger workers, and these workers prefer savings plans." <p>In addition to the popular 401(k) plans, new pension hybrids with fancy names and promises of more substantial benefits are being created. These plans are usually set up so employees can easily calculate their benefits and take the balance with them if they leave the company. But how good the newfangled pensions are depends on two factors: how the employer decides to fund them, and how much time the employee wants to devote to managing the funds if he or she changes jobs.<p>Consider Duracell International, the Bethel, Connecticut, battery manufacturer. It revamped its pension in 1991, in part to eliminate inequities between salaried and hourly workers. Out went its traditional defined-benefits plan, which relied on a complex series of formulas to arrive at a final annual payout after retirement. In its place the company introduced a cash-balance plan that works this way: Every year a participant's account is credited with a percentage of his pay based on his years with the company. A five-year veteran earning $90,000 a year would receive a credit of $4,500 in his account during 1993; interest earned would be roughly 3 percent. <p>In this case, simplicity came with a catch. Salaried employees are getting less with the cash-balance account than they did under the old pension. Nevertheless, "they perceive it is worth more because they can see the account balances," says benefits director David Lutterbach.<p>Cash-balance plans can have another drawback. Measured against total annual income, they tend to reward slow-trackers more than corporate superstars, because interest compounds at a higher rate than the slow-trackers' salary increases. Of course, the superstar will wind up with a larger pot of cash, but it will be a smaller multiple of his total income than the slowpoke's. For example, if employee A has 3 percent annual salary growth, he will end up with 30 percent of his income replaced at 65, while someone whose salary rose 7 percent a year would have only 22 percent of his income replaced at age 65. <p>RJR Nabisco got around this inequity by instituting a plan that considers employees' ages and length of service. But, when the worker leaves the company, credits are multiplied by the final average salary earned. Example: If an employee was 38 when hired and left 11 years later at a salary of $100,000, he would receive $110,600. The payout is calculated this way: $20,000 times 97 percent, plus $80,000 times 114 percent.<p>This pension also benefits the midcareer hire, who may not have long years with a company but who begins his career with a higher salary and therefore a larger credit.<p>RJR pays nothing to employees who leave before five years go by. But other companies, such as Wendy's International in Dublin, Ohio, have instituted pension arrangements that allow employees to take portions of pensions after as little as one year.<p>But portable pensions mean more work for the employee. Departing employees may wind up with two lump sums to contend with, one from the pension and one from the company 401(k). They have to manage both, either by rolling the funds over altogether into a new employers' plan or an IRA. They could also buy an annuity or, in some cases, keep it at the company. To some people, this is too many choices. <p>If you're one of the fortunate few allowed to roll your funds into your new employer's plan, by all means do so. Some companies allow you to shift funds into a 401(k) or profit-sharing plan. If the choice is between this and putting it in an IRA, financial planner Terry J. Siman in Spring House, Pennsylvania, opts for the 401(k) every time. Why? The money is more accessible. "What you lose in investment flexibility you make up for in rules flexibility," he says. Glen Buco, a pension analyst in Annandale, Virginia, has another reason for choosing the 401(k). "On the whole people do not invest as aggressively as the company would," he said.<p>Most pension professionals acknowledge that employee education about portable pensions must be improved. More employers should accept rollovers--just 7 percent do now. Representative Sam Gibbons of Florida is currently sponsoring a bill that would require improvements in pensions' portability, specifically to allow departing employees to transfer the amount in their defined-contribution plan or the present value in their defined-benefit plan to another qualified plan or IRA. Some organizations are discussing setting up regional funds to manage personal pension accounts. But for now, portable pensions require more work on an employee's part. Still, it's better to be able to take 'em than be forced to leave 'em.<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Features<p>$26 MILLION IN THE HOLE
Can you build a second life after being a fraud, a thief, and a convict in your first one? Sure! says Barry Minkow.<p>By Christopher Byron<p>In March of 1989, 23-year-old Barry Minkow, founder, chief stockholder, and chief executive officer of the ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning company, stood in a Los Angeles courtroom and expressed deep remorse for having defrauded investors in his company out of $100 million. In response, an angry Judge Dickran Tevrizian of the U.S. district court called this show of contrition "el toro poo-poo" and sentenced Minkow to 25 years in jail, plus the burden of making restitution of $26 million. "You're dangerous," he said. "You don't have a conscience."<p>Last November, an earnest, conservatively dressed young man stood before an audience of former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement officials who had convened at the Bellevue Hotel in downtown Philadelphia to hear him lecture on financial crime. The young man was Barry Minkow.<p>"Look at the big picture," Minkow said, warming to his subject and speaking with easy self-confidence. "Get too hung up in the minutiae and you might never see that the entire operation is a fraud."<p>This is how Barry Minkow makes a living these days. A decade ago, when he was worth around $100 million, life was very different and so were his ambitions. Minkow, who was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" and "Class Clown" in his senior year in high school, managed in short order to confirm his classmates' acumen on both scores. He started his carpet-cleaning operation with $1,000 from a local loan shark, then he stole Western Union money orders from neighborhood stores, after which he stole and hocked his grandmother's jewelry. Later, he staged burglaries to defraud his insurance company, forged $45 million worth of bank checks, and enthusiastically helped sell millions of dollars of worthless ZZZZ Best stock to investors across America. Along the way, he also managed to get caught up with organized crime by borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars from mobsters__at up to 5 percent a week. <p>There was money all over the place, and a good part of it went into making Barry famous. "I'm going to expand like crazy. And I'm shameless," he boasted. The pictures from those days are still around: Barry, just out of high school, motoring down Sunset Boulevard in his Ferrari; Barry at his neo-colonial manse in Woodland Hills (replete with butler and bodyguard); Barry on OPRAH in the LOS ANGELES TIMES in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and in ENTREPRENEUR MAGAZINE.<p>In 1985, Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley honored Minkow for setting "a fine entrepreneurial Example of obtaining the status of a millionaire at the age of eighteen years old" and gave him the city's official Certificate of Commendation. The first person Minkow showed it to was his accountant. "That certificate somehow seemed to authenticate ZZZZ Best and give us legitimacy," he says. "Presumably, the mayor of Los Angeles had done his due diligence on what we were all about, or he wouldn't have given us the certificate in the first place. And if that were so, why should our accountants do what the mayor of Los Angeles had already done? That at least was the message we hoped to convey to them by showing them the mayor's certificate__just like we pointed out to them that Oprah Winfrey had had us on her show and that we'd been written up in ENTREPRENEUR MAGAZINE and elsewhere. These were all meaningless credentials, but we collected them eagerly because they seemed to be far more than they really were."<p>Of course, everything about Minkow__nicknamed the Rocky of Rugs__and his company seemed to be far more than they really were. His rise and fall took five years, beginning with his junior year in high school in 1983 and ending in December of 1987, when the court accepted his guilty plea on 57 counts of mail, wire, and stock fraud. In retrospect, the only surprising thing is that this inept crook's amazing adventure lasted as long as it did. <p>Last April, Barry Minkow was released from a Los Angeles halfway house after having served more than seven years in jail, most of it at the Englewood medium-security prison in Littleton, Colorado. He had been a model prisoner from the moment he was sentenced, when he praised the FBI, the SEC, and his prosecutors for nailing him. "This is a great day for this country," said Minkow. "This is a great day for justice. This is how America works." <p>In jail he earned two degrees in theology from Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, and wrote CLEAN SWEEP(Thomas Nelson Publishers), in which he recounted his crimes in detail__as well as his conversion to Christianity__and pledged to use his future earnings to pay off his debts. In fact, Minkow's behavior was so exemplary that even his most skeptical critic, Judge Tevrizian, changed his opinion and wrote a letter urging his parole. <p>After his release, Minkow married an Arizona woman with whom he had been corresponding while in prison. <p>There were a number of famous white-collar convicts in the 1980s--Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky among them. But while Milken is again advising companies on mergers and Boesky is said to be trading stocks abroad, Minkow is making a new life out of public repentance, lecturing accountants, lawyers, SEC officials, and FBI agents on how to spot and prevent corporate fraud.<p>In fact, Minkow's life, once an enormous con job, has been reconstructed as an equally encompassing attempt at restitution. He lives modestly, in a two-room apartment in Tarzana, California, a mile from Reseda, where he grew up and started ZZZZ Best. Nearby is the gated community Westchester County Estates, where Minkow lived at the zenith of his fame, with movie stars for neighbors. He doesn't seem to miss it. "The first decent night's sleep I got after I started ZZZZ Best was the first night I spent in federal prison," he says. <p>The born-again parolee voluntarily relinquishes his speaking fees__close to $100,000 at latest counting__to a victims' restitution fund set up and administered by his lawyer. From this, Minkow draws $4,100 a month, an amount agreed upon with his parole officer. Royalties from CLEAN SWEEP will also go to the victims' fund, as will his earnings, if any, from a projected movie about ZZZZ Best and proceeds from a new video series called FRAUDO DYNAMICS. To pay off his legal fees, he works without salary as a clerk in the office of his former trial lawyer, and he spends a great deal of his time caring for his elderly mother, who lives in the same apartment complex, and his father, who suffered a stroke while Barry was in prison and is confined to a wheelchair in a nursing home. <p>As a speaker, Minkow is relaxed, personable, and funny. Using an overhead projector, he shows examples of the doctored canceled checks he used to make his auditors think the company was doing 50 times more business than it was. As the checks flash by, he says, to unforced laughter, "As a condition of my release, I had to agree that I would never come within 50 feet of a bottle of Wite-Out again in my life."<p>Minkow also teaches a Bible class at a church north of Los Angeles. He sprinkles his classes with references to Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and Plato, and ranges across the Old and New Testaments. He tells his classes that Jesus will forgive even the worst sinner, and he certainly has credentials to make the claim. Minkow stole from his friends, from his family, from anyone who came near him, but he tells his students that from darkness can come light and from evil can come good. <p>Such unrelenting goodness can be hard to credit, or even tolerate. It's impossible to listen to Minkow say "All I really want to do is help rid the world of the crimes I know best" without feeling a rising wall of skepticism--particularly if one speaks with some of the investors whom Minkow defrauded. Elaine Orlando, for example, lost $350,000, most of it in unsecured personal loans. She lost her house and her savings, and speaks sadly of others--an 80-year-old Los Angeles woman in ill health who was bilked out of $350,000, a Florida widow who lost $75,000. Orlando says Minkow also stole things harder to quantify. "I'm more reclusive," she says. "My circle of friends is smaller. I was trusting and believed in life's possibilities. I've lost that."<p>So is Minkow's rehabilitation genuine, or just convenient? Minkow himself may not know. He has never been a reflective or moderate person. Excess seems to be his natural element. <p>Then, too, he arrived in the 1980s, the Age of the Entrepreneur, when the media were hungry for individuals through whom they could personify the heroic story 
of getting rich. In Barry Minkow they found the right image, a working-class boy who spoke with the aggressive enthusiasm of an aluminum-siding salesman and who openly, brazenly wanted to be rich. And after that, he told anyone who would listen, politics. Barry Minkow wanted to be our president one day.<p>The press loved it and heedlessly publicized the boy and his company, despite the fact that anyone who looked could see that the story of the 16-year-old CEO of one of the fastest-growing companies on Wall Street was patently ridiculous. <p>But the investor lesson of ZZZZ Best is still unlearned--and may never be learned. In the summer of 1995, software companies that basically consisted of 20 postpubescent computer nerds with a bright idea and an answering machine were selling on Wall Street for multiples that, in some cases, reached 400 times earnings. Those who bought at those prices believed that shares in companies such as Spyglass and Secure Computing were in fact cheap. It's as if investors looked at the young techies behind these companies, heard the voice of Peter Pan exulting "I am youth," and bet on the invincibility of these new changelings of industry. The collapse in technology stocks that began last autumn will presumably shake the fairy dust from investors' eyes. <p>Minkow stresses in his lectures that you cannot audit--or safely invest in--a business you don't understand. In the case of ZZZZ Best, when Minkow showed his auditors canceled checks totaling $40 million for "restoration" jobs on damaged buildings, they were unaware that one of the biggest restoration jobs in history--that of the fire-and-water-damaged MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas in 1981--was worth at most $7 million in fees. <p>In the case of ZZZZ Best, ignorance proved expensive. In November 1995, a class-action suit brought by ZZZZ Best shareholders was settled, with the accounting firm Ernst & Young, a number of small investment banks, and the law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed agreeing to pay a total of $35 million, or 95 cents on the dollar, in damages. <p>Minkow's past exploits, his lectures, and his apparent good-faith effort to repay tens of millions of dollars stolen from investors are a vivid reminder that, as Congress increasingly exempts our financial markets and institutions from regulatory oversight, "caveat emptor" should be the first and last words of every 
investor's credo. After all, Minkow was only a teenager when he began breaking the law, an undersized boy for whom business was a way to impress the prettiest girl in his class. Wall Street, on the other hand, is run by well-heeled adults who should know what it is to steal a person's life savings. Nonetheless, the Street held its nose while shoveling ZZZZ Best's garbage shares into the portfolios of gullible clients and pocketing the fees.<p>But Minkow appears to have changed with the zeitgeist. Like a great many 1980s believers in the gospel of wealth, he now looks for meaning and happiness outside the marketplace and beyond the material. We may look happily or cynically on such a personal metamorphosis and on the long-term prospects of his personal reformation. Perhaps the effort at restitution will help reconstitute his being. Perhaps not. <p>In any case, Barry Minkow now appears as determined to be honest as he once was to be successful. Today, he would probably be a safer person with whom to invest your money than a good many brokers and advisers on Wall Street. Ironically, Minkow, who claims he's had many offers to return to the business world, says he would do so only if he was forbidden from handling the stuff that was once at the core of his being. "I'm not afraid I would steal it," he says. "It's just that I'm really no good with money."<p><p>

						Leon Greenblatt found a clever way to make millions off the LTV bankruptcy. Too clever for officials at the Chicago Stock Exchange. Greenblatt, they thought, might destroy them all.<p>By Ted C. Fishman<p>Who is the Boy Plunger? Ask a couple of the traders who hang out at Jesse Livermore's, the most popular bar in Chicago's financial district, and they might answer in one of two ways. They might say Jesse Livermore himself, the famous short seller who schemed his way to several fortunes--some say he caused the crash of '29--but ultimately went spectacularly broke and killed himself. Livermore's nicknames reflected his passion for short selling: He was the Great Bear and the Boy Plunger.<p>But they also might reply "Leon Greenblatt."<p>Greenblatt, 36 years old, has schemed his way to several fortunes, too, but what brought him squarely into Livermore's league was his spectacular selling of stock in LTV Corp. <p>As that company came out of bankruptcy in 1993, Greenblatt, through his firm, Scattered Corp., went on one of the biggest selling sprees in the history of U.S. securities markets. He sold about 180 million shares of LTV, 58 million more than actually existed. As the price fell lower and lower, Greenblatt sold again and again. When it finally hit bottom, Scattered picked up $27 million in profits.<p>But few cheered him on at the Chicago Stock Exchange, where he was a member. As officials there watched his short sales mount, they tried to move against him. Some didn't seem to grasp his complicated arbitrage play. Apparently they didn't like Leon much, either. And they refused to sit by while an arrogant upstart seemed poised to bring down not only himself but the exchange and all its members.<p>Greenblatt likes the word "stupid," and it's one he uses freely when talking about the exchange. Ask him who almost caused a financial meltdown, and his finger points squarely at the exchange. He may be right.<p>
Scattered's offices, high on top of a venerable LaSalle Street building, have the kind of defiant atmosphere officialdom hates. They're way too big for a firm with three principals and no employees. Battered office furniture and cardboard cartons sprawl helter-skelter throughout: A copy of Sun Tzu's The Art of War sits atop a pile of prospectuses and stamp catalogs; a stack of annual reports teeters on a giant pretzel tin. Buried somewhere in the clutter is the dart gun and the Jack Daniel's bottle Greenblatt brandished when exchange auditors came to look over the firm's books early in 1995. The gun might be in the office kitchen, but looking there means braving the debris of yesterday's lunch. Or is it last week's?<p>The tallest, most commanding piles in the rambling office contain more than a million pages in documents generated by all the legal proceedings surrounding Scattered's LTV play. There are papers from the class-action suit filed in U.S. Federal District Court in Chicago, charging that Scattered manipulated LTV stock. There are piles of papers from the disciplinary hearings held by the Chicago Stock Exchange, charging Scattered with fraud (among other offenses) and hoping to extract penalties of $44 million and expel the firm from the exchange. There are also documents galore from the various suits Scattered has filed against the exchange. <p>Greenblatt can place almost any document immediately. But reaching into a pile, he happens to pick up a brokerage statement. "Look here," he says with glee. "Here's one of my accounts. It's got $15 million in it."<p>Ask anyone who's ever worked for or against Greenblatt: Leon is smart. One friend describes him as "the last person in the world I'd want to be on the wrong side of. He's someone who's willing to go entirely to the mat." The son of a New Orleans dry cleaner, Greenblatt graduated in 1981 from the honors math program at Northwestern University and continued into a doctoral program, where he applied game theory and statistical methods to economics. He thought graduate school "just stupid" and left. <p>He's no less formidable physically: Greenblatt has a short fullback's build, and it might take half a team to tackle him. Yet his smile--like a dolphin's, sheepish and naughty--is disarming when he reveals something clever he's done, whether it's starting a business, buying a building, making $2 million a day in LTV, or calling his firm Scattered.<p>"Scattered" is a word that comes up often when traders quote the best prices on a stock. They ask: "Who's the market?" If a smattering of firms is vying to sell (or buy) at the same price, as is common, the answer goes something like, "Merrill on the bid, scattered on the offer." Now traders must think twice: Does "scattered" mean many firms or that gadfly shop in Chicago? Greenblatt finds the confusion delicious. <p>Greenblatt and his two partners, Andrew Jahelka and Richard Nichols, stay glued to the half-dozen computers that crowd a dim corner of their office, checking data and placing trades to their floor broker. They prefer arbitrage trading, Greenblatt says, because "anything but arbitrage is too much work." They don't try to call the direction of stocks but look for sure things, particularly in bankrupt companies. In theory, arbitrage poses little risk. The securities bought and sold are essentially the same; a trade is profitable when, for some reason, one of the securities is priced out of line with the other. "It's just like you're buying dollar bills and selling dollar penny rolls," says Greenblatt, "and for whatever stupid reason, people are paying $5 for a dollar penny roll." <p>Deep in another corner sits a computer no one bothers with until it chimes the first bar of "We're in the Money," the song it's programmed to play every time a bankruptcy appears in the news. Of the hundreds of public companies that file for bankruptcy every year, only a few really warrant music. Every couple of years, one like LTV calls for a brass band.<p>
On January 20, 1993, the Scattered computer announced that LTV Corp. had at last filed a reorganization plan with the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The filing capped one of the biggest and most complicated bankruptcies in U.S. history. In its heyday, the company was one of the nation's largest diversified conglomerates, with tens of thousands of employees and interests in, among other things, steel, energy, and aerospace. LTV sought bankruptcy protection in 1986 after collapsing under enormous pension obligations and competition from foreign steel. <p>In 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down LTV's first reorganization plan. When in January 1993 a viable plan was finally completed, Wall Street cheered, predicting a solid future for the restructured company. Within two days, the long-withering stock had become the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange, peaking at $2.00 a share and closing on Friday, January 22, at $1.125, double its price at the time of the announcement.<p>In bankruptcies, unsophisticated investors often rush in, thinking they can buy shares in a newly reorganized company cheaply. What they don't realize is that the stock they're buying is actually "old stock" that will often be nearly worthless in the reorganized company. Their buying drives up the price of an all-but-dead issue. "That's stupid," says Greenblatt.<p>Greenblatt's strategy in LTV hinged partly on what he figured were the public's blind hopes for LTV stock, and from his careful reading of the reorganization plan. It mandated that the shares of LTV eventually would be worth no more than 3.2 cents, a long way down from where the investing public was pushing it. "Now this doesn't happen very often, but it happens once every two years or so," Greenblatt says. He jumped on it.<p>The public's enthusiastic buying did elicit loud and frequent warnings. At 2 p.m. on that tumultuous Friday, LTV issued a news release explaining that the markets had misinterpreted the plan. The following Monday, January 25, Greenblatt was quoted in The Wall Street Journal warning investors to read the LTV documents carefully. A day later, a dumbfounded spokesman for LTV sounded an unambiguous alarm for broadcast on the nation's business wires: "I see a lot of people will get hurt. Whoever owns this stock when we come out of Chapter 11 will get 3 cents a share for it. That's not going to change for the better."<p>At first, Scattered bet small on LTV's decline, over the next five months selling a hundred thousand shares now and then. Other traders at the Chicago exchange sold, too, acting as typical short sellers, dumping stock they didn't own, hoping (and succeeding) to buy it back cheaper. Selling the bejesus out of companies in bankruptcy is a house sport at the Chicago exchange.<p>One of the short sellers and assigned market makers in LTV was David Sullivan. Sullivan, five years Greenblatt's senior, had traded on the Boston exchange--he still has a bean-thick Boston accent--before coming to Chicago. For 14 years, he worked his way up the political ladder, becoming well-enough liked to get elected to the Chicago Stock Exchange's board of governors. He eventually assumed a 2 million-share short position in LTV.<p>Sullivan would later head the class-action suit against Scattered and become one of the firm's chief adversaries on the floor. In 1992, however, short selling had been the stuff of friendly talk between the two men over drinks at Jesse Livermore's. Sullivan was intrigued by the mysteries of Greenblatt's methods. Greenblatt turned to the veteran stock trader for tips on the brute buying and selling that rule the exchange--particularly selling.<p>Scattered held off making any big moves until after May 26, when the proposed reorganization plan was ratified by the bankruptcy court--a milestone that all but guaranteed the plan would go into effect. Now, Scattered could launch the nearly risk-free arbitrage that would net it millions and eventually provoke the wrath of both Sullivan and the exchange.<p>LTV's reorganization plan called for extinguishing all the old stock in the company, and although the reformed company would issue new shares, the new would not go to owners of the old. (Only the company's creditors received new stock.) Old shares would be converted into warrants, which could be used to buy new shares at a set price.<p>In late May, old stock was still trading for 25 cents a share. According to the plan, several weeks remained before the company would wipe the stock out, but the exact date wasn't set. It also would be some time before the company issued the warrants. In the parlance of the markets, then, the warrants became "when issued" securities. And since traders will trade anything that's tradable, the mere fact that a planned security doesn't yet exist rarely gets in the way of Wall Street's willingness to price it, buy it, and sell it. The phantom LTV warrants proved hot, and a market grew almost instantly. Greenblatt helped see to it. He knew the sooner the warrant market developed, the better his chance of arbitraging it against the market in the stock. <p>The eventual price of the new stock, however, meant nothing to Scattered. The key characteristic of the warrants was that owners of the old stock would receive only 3.2 cents' worth of warrants per share, and no more. It was a lock. (According to the plan, shares would be swapped for warrants at a ratio of 92 to 1: Old common stock could never be worth more than 3.2 cents.) As long as the stock traded above its mandated worth of about 3 cents, arbitrage could be profitable.<p>Scattered's strategy was to buy the warrants at prices close to their mandated value and to sell the equivalent stock at a premium. Scattered would then wait for the LTV bankruptcy plan to wind up, deliver the warrants, and keep the difference in price. To do that, Greenblatt and his broker, Laura Bryant, got on the phone to every trading firm they could. They explained the plan to the brokers and announced they were looking to buy the warrants. While his counterparts jumped to collect a small premium for selling Greenblatt warrants, he was busy short-selling LTV stock for up to 25 cents a share, or eight times its worth. <p>From the end of May until June 28, the markets in both warrants and stock grew increasingly deep, with Scattered on one side or another of the bulk of the trades. Yet, throughout the entire period, the highest price of the warrants never exceeded the lowest price of 92 LTV shares, meaning that Scattered made money every time it traded the two securities against each other. Scattered's massive selling never really pummeled the stock; no matter how much stock Scattered sold, the public still demanded about 10 million shares a day. Prices eroded gradually over the month, yet even on June 28, 1993, the last day of the old stock's life, shares still sold for twice their true value. <p>
It was the chance to do bankruptcy arbitrage that brought Scattered to the exchange in 1991. There the partners hoped to put into play the strategies they had developed during their years at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. For Greenblatt, the move capped an eight-year odyssey through Chicago's financial markets, where he picked up both the expertise and the partners capable enough to put his plans to work. <p>At the CBOE, where he traded a variety of options and stocks, Greenblatt was known as a boat person, someone who moves into the most active pits. The worst names traders call each other--boat people, floaters, weasels--refer to ways of horning in on someone's business. In theory, markets exist to bring competitors together, but if you compete too doggedly, you're disdained. People like Greenblatt "are considered somewhat contemptible because they ruin it for the group," says Eugene Finerman, a former trader who describes Greenblatt as "reptilian, bright, and clever, though with no sense of humor." Finerman eventually left the exchange to become a writer and won more than $80,000 on Jeopardy!<p>Jahelka, Greenblatt's first partner, also went to Northwestern, and the two lived together for a time in the same fraternity. Four years Greenblatt's junior, Jahelka started in the university's accelerated medical program but he says he "didn't like blood and guts that much ... and the money wasn't that great." He switched to math and chemistry and graduated as a chemical engineer. His friendship with Greenblatt, he says, developed over 10,000 games of backgammon: "I think I won 4,999 and Leon won 5,001." In 1986, after a year of formulating specialty enamels in the lab of a paint company, Jahelka was hired as a clerk by Greenblatt, in time becoming a Scattered partner with a 30 percent stake. Jahelka, a crew-cut, lanky native of Steamboat Springs, Colorado, learned Greenblatt's approach to risk thoroughly enough to make money in the 1987 market crash that hit soon after he began. <p>Richard Nichols, Greenblatt's second partner, with a 20 percent stake, took the longest route to the firm. Nichols, a British subject with a Nepalese grandmother, was born several hundred miles north of Calcutta to a household staffed by servants, and he attended public school in England. When his best friend's brother turned down Oxford for the Wharton School, Nichols, too, applied to U.S. business schools. He chose Indiana University, where he studied finance and played rugby. After a stint with Andersen Consulting, Nichols resolved to return to England--that is, until a trader friend of his offered him a tour of the CBOE. "My eyes lit up when I saw the floor," Nichols recalls. "The place was heaving ... something exciting was going on." He worked for that friend for two years and then signed on with Greenblatt, agreeing to work for free. "He didn't have anything worth paying for," Greenblatt says. Nichols concurs. "I enrolled in the Leon School of Options Trading," he says. <p>In 1991, while playing bridge, the partners decided to move to the Chicago Stock Exchange, where they could work their bankruptcy arbitrage plays. "We'd been toying with the idea for months," Jahelka says. The move took some imagination, because few in Chicago's financial circles take the exchange seriously. Some due diligence might also have been in order. Scattered was joining a declining exchange wanting for money.<p>
Though the Chicago Stock Exchange officially bills itself as the nation's second largest in terms of the value of shares traded, by that measure it is only 1/27th the size of the New York Stock Exchange. (With the exception of ex-governor Sullivan, no one in the administration of the Chicago exchange would talk on the record regarding any aspect of this story, and all inquiries were referred to the exchange's outside attorney. Statements by exchange officials in this story have been drawn largely from sworn testimony offered in connection with the legal proceedings surrounding Scattered's stock play.)<p>In clout, the Chicago exchange hardly matters; in terms of business measured in revenue, it's puny, with only $28 million coming in last year, roughly equal to that of a sleepy Wal-Mart. In 1993, the exchange spent half a million dollars to change its name from the Midwest Stock Exchange to the Chicago Stock Exchange. With the new handle, the exchange hoped to piggyback on the prestige of the city's three financial behemoths: the CBOE, the Chicago Board of Trade, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Homer Livingston, the new president of the stock exchange at the time, acknowledged its also-ran status in his remarks heralding the name change: "When people overseas talk about Chicago, they talk in awe of its highly innovative, technology-driven crowd.... [B]ut frequently we are not included in those conversations."<p>The Chicago Stock Exchange had been having problems for a number of years. Since 1990 it had witnessed declines in revenue from its biggest money maker, the consolidated, or broad, tape (the price reporting service that relays real-time trade data on stocks). The lost revenue has hurt. According to Crain's Chicago Business, the exchange's cash reserves now stand at only $2.5 million, down from $14.6 million just two years ago.<p>Federal regulators had also struck a blow against the exchange. In 1991, Chicago Stock Exchange officials announced they had "discovered" a 13-year practice that basically allowed a subsidiary of the exchange to wrongfully receive millions of dollars yearly in interest payments that should have gone to broker-dealers. The SEC ordered the exchange to stop keeping false records and fined it $2 million.<p>Not even the plush comforts of the exchange's home, One Financial Place, offer much consolation. Its granite tower stands on LaSalle Street, behind the CBT, and its state-of-the-art trading room spans the expressway, advertising the institution to the endless parade of cars heading downtown. But its rent, negotiated in the early 1980s, is high, at $45 per square foot, and its lease, for 20 years, is nonnegotiable. By 1990, the exchange's rent  grew so burdensome it considered bankruptcy. In 1987, membership at the exchange cost $105,000. By September 1995, a seat sold for $34,000.<p>The financial struggles of the exchange were of no concern to Scattered when it applied for membership. Its move was motivated by its desire to make money. By joining and establishing itself as a clearing member, it acquired the privileges necessary to conduct bankruptcy arbitrage. It could reduce trading costs to a fraction of a cent per share. It could also enroll as a market maker, a category of professional trader entitled to lower margins and special allowances under SEC rules.<p>One allowance is that market-maker firms can sell stock without making any attempt to borrow or deliver it. Greenblatt interpreted the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as meaning that Scattered could legally skirt delivery requirements and keep its LTV position intact until the reorganization plan was completed. Without that special accommodation, Scattered's LTV arbitrage would have been severely impeded.<p>Scattered's bankruptcy arbitrage also relied on the its interpretation of another allowance accorded to market makers by SEC rules: the ability to sell stock on minus ticks and zero ticks. Usually, traders can sell short only if the last price change in a stock moved the shares up. If the last price change reflected a decline in price, short sellers must hold off--except, that is, if they are either market makers, arbitrageurs, or both. SEC rules allow them to sell on minus ticks, on the theory that market making and arbitrage foster efficient and liquid markets. In the rules, such trades are considered neither long nor short, but "short exempt." Scattered claimed its trades were short exempt. The exchange would later disagree.<p>
In its first two years as a Chicago Stock Exchange member, Scattered conducted arbitrage in Orion Pictures, <a name="NYSE:USG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11529"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>USG Corp.</b></a>, <a name="AMEX:TWA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16885"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Trans World Airlines</b></a>, and the stocks of other companies in bankruptcy. The firm had no problems with the exchange's in-house regulators. But in early June 1993, those same regulators began puzzling over Scattered's huge sales in LTV stock. Something obviously had changed in Scattered's strategy. The regulators had never seen anything close to Scattered's massive trading volume, and they were worried.<p>Traders on the floor also were alarmed. Laura Bryant, the independent broker who was acting as Scattered's agent on the trading floor, recalls that on June 2, 1993, another broker in LTV approached her and asked, "When are you going to stop selling so we can let this pig pop?"--meaning he wanted the price to go up so he could sell his long shares at a profit. Later, the broker's boss approached Bryant, again pleading for her to stop selling for Scattered. Bryant says the boss then showed her a full account of Scattered's trading activity--normally detailed only in the exchange's confidential records. Bryant, a no-nonsense redhead, well-known and respected on the floor, alerted her clients at Scattered. From then on, Greenblatt expected trouble. <p>If the other traders on the floor didn't know Scattered was matching stock against warrants, they were understandably fearful. Scattered could have been selling massively in an attempt to clobber the stock and shake the longs out of the market. Those fears, however, stemmed from a backward understanding of Scattered's strategy. Scattered gained nothing from drops in the stock, because Scattered's short stock position was continually balanced against a long warrant position. <p>Old-line traders at the exchange viewed Scattered's activity through an archaic lens, one that could see a Jesse Livermore clearly but fogged when it came to the intricate strategies of modern markets. Even now, when David Sullivan talks about Scattered's strategy, he likens it to the panic caused when Edward Henry Harriman fought James Jerome Hill for the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy railroad--Livermore's first plunge into the market, at the turn of the century.<p>
Concern at the exchange came from several quarters, and in the first week of June, Scattered received a visit from two officials, Michael Cardin and Paul Smith, who work under chief regulator Allan Bretzer, and Susan Hertel, then manager of operations at the exchange's trust subsidiary. Cardin and Smith enforce exchange rules and financial requirements; Hertel was charged with monitoring risk. <p>The officials may have been worried that if buyers demanded stock, Scattered, now short about 60 million shares, wouldn't be able to deliver it without causing a big run-up in price. A run-up would cause losses not just to Scattered but to the other member firms, such as Sullivan's, that would be caught in an upward squeeze. In the worst-case scenario for the exchange, it would become Scattered's unwilling partner in a financial meltdown that could first ruin Scattered and then, possibly, wipe out the exchange. (The exchange acts as a kind of insurer, guaranteeing that members make good on trades, or if they can't, the exchange absorbs the losses itself.) Hertel, a 23-year veteran of the exchange, demanded that Scattered post $14 million to ensure the solvency of the exchange.<p>It was clear to the Scattered partners that they had some teaching to do. They say they showed the regulators the LTV plan, explained the terms of the reorganization, and, with a spreadsheet showing Scattered's exact holdings, walked the officials through their arbitrage trades. Don Hayden, a trader at the options exchange, happened to stop by Scattered that day to pick up his bicycle. In his account, the exchange visitors nodded their comprehension and laughed at the simplicity of it all. Cardin apparently said to Greenblatt, "It can't be that easy." <p>It's a moment Hayden remembers with clarity, because Greenblatt took Cardin's remark as a challenge. "Watch me," Greenblatt reportedly said. "I'll show you how easy it is." He walked over to the phone, dialed another firm's arbitrage desk and said, "I want to buy 10,000 warrants." Then Greenblatt called Bryant on the floor. Bryant, too, remembers the call, because Greenblatt told her he wanted to show Cardin, Hertel, and Smith how easy the trade was. "Say hi to Mike," she told him.<p>"Now sell 920,000 LTV," Greenblatt said. Bryant did so. Turning to his examiners, Greenblatt said: "There, you see how easy it is? And by the way, that was a quick 140 grand."<p>At the Scattered disciplinary hearing, the officials remembered little from the meeting. Smith said he and his colleagues asked for an explanation of Scattered's strategy, got one, and still couldn't understand it. "Everyone was talking very freely," said Smith. "[I]t was the middle of the day ... The Scattered people were ... conducting their business. If they had a phone call, they took the phone call.... If someone walked in, they would talk to them. Everyone took turns talking.... It's so very hard to say who said what." When Hertel was asked at the hearing if she knew what hedging and arbitrage were, she answered, "I really don't have an understanding of either one, just that they are two different things.... Give me a dictionary." <p>The following day the exchange began its effort to rein in Scattered when the clearing corporation withheld $2.6 million of Scattered's money, profits it normally would have released to the firm. <p>The following Monday the exchange demanded about $5 million from Scattered. Greenblatt asked the exchange what formula it used to arrive at that amount. Cardin told him the exchange needed Scattered to post 100 percent of the value of the stock and 100 percent of the value of the warrants. (These types of margins, which the exchange calls participant funds, typically add up to under 10 percent of the value of traders' securities. In hedged and arbitraged positions, the margin often is zero.)<p>The exchange questioned the argument that Scattered's play was risk free. It worried that the reorganization plan would not go through, meaning the phantom warrants would never become real and Scattered would have nothing to deliver against its short position. But Scattered, with its money machine running full steam, was not about to abandon its sure thing. Later, Greenblatt and his partners saw the exchange's request as a move to shut them down.<p>Instead of meeting the new margins, Scattered transferred its warrant trading to two brokerage houses. The exchange, nervous that it could no longer monitor Scattered's warrant position, agreed a week later to let the firm keep the warrants in clearing on less drastic terms. On June 16, after three weeks of selling roughly 10 million shares a day, Scattered's sales finally exceeded all the outstanding stock in LTV. <p>Scattered's selling of nonexistent shares rested on Greenblatt's understanding of the privileges the Securities and Exchange Act granted member firms. But the very idea that Scattered could sell more than LTV's outstanding stock nagged at the Chicago regulators. A note Hertel wrote to herself reflects the exchange's frustration: "[Exchange regulators] continued to feel [the] firm was not breaking any rules and no action could be taken against [the] firm." <p>
A troubled Michael Cardin returned to Scattered's office on June 21. The details of the LTV reorganization and Scattered's trading were again explained to him, and this time Cardin asked for a few minutes by himself to puzzle through the arbitrage on paper. When Cardin finished, Greenblatt remembers, Cardin asked him and Nichols to check the numbers. Greenblatt says he noted a minor rounding error and told Cardin his math was "good enough for government work." Cardin left. <p>The following day, Greenblatt says, he turned to Nichols and said, "The only way this could get fouled up now is if the [exchange] tells us to stop selling stock." Within an hour, Cardin called to order just that.<p>Whatever dangers Cardin may have discussed with his boss, Allan Bretzer, they could not have been any worse than the disaster their rescue attempt nearly wrought. When Cardin called Scattered, he demanded that the firm stop selling unless it could deliver the shares it sold. But in seeking to remove Scattered as a seller, the exchange risked a run-up in the stock. Not only were there still investors willing to bid up the stock, but Scattered was helping to provide the liquidity needed to keep the trading orderly. The exchange's records show that Scattered participated in trades accounting for 80 percent of all the volume in LTV that June. If the exchange removed Scattered from the market, it would disconnect the stock from the warrants, the anchor pulling the stock toward its true value.<p>Nichols and Jahelka rushed to Cardin's office. Nichols, whose English public-school manner perhaps offered the best chance for a diplomatic solution, spoke. "I asked him whose decision this was, and he points to the room next door, and I asked who, and he says Al Bretzer." Until then no one at Scattered had ever met Bretzer. Nichols continued: "I asked if we could see him, since he was making the decisions. So [Cardin] goes next door, and motions us to come and see him. The first thing, Bretzer is sitting behind his desk ranting and raving and says, I've been looking for a way to stop you boys from selling any more shares of LTV. I haven't been able to find a way of stopping you until now, because it looks like there is no [SEC] rule that prevents you from selling more shares than the outstanding number of the issue. But now you've got to stop.' And he points to a book, the [exchange's] rule book, and says, It says so in there, it says so in black and white.' I said, Where?' And he refused to open the rule book to show us what he was talking about." The exchange rule was cited in a letter rushed to Scattered from the exchange, demanding that the firm stop selling unless it could prove it had deliverable stock. <p>Cardin's mandate came late--when no one could deliver stock. Most of the shares were now in the hands of the official transfer agent in preparation for the stock's extinction and replacement by warrants. <p>Greenblatt called his attorney, asking him to write a letter to the exchange. "Say anything at all," he said. "Just get them to talk to us." The letter, predicting disaster, went out to the board of governors. On his own, Greenblatt phoned around, trying to rustle up governors to hear his case. He found David Sullivan. Again, the two met at Jesse Livermore's. Sullivan, who was 2 million shares short in LTV, listened carefully. "[Greenblatt] showed me the letter he sent to the exchange," Sullivan remembers, "that meant he had no intention of delivering the stock. I said that [also] meant he had no intention of delivering to me."<p>Sullivan said he regarded Greenblatt's action as a refusal to fulfill a contract, and he moved to minimize his losses. He says he also feared for the exchange, which he estimated could have lost $75 million. At the beginning of the next trading day, Sullivan bought 2 million shares, covering his short position. Later, Judge Richard Posner, ruling on Sullivan's suit, noted allegations that Sullivan based his trade on knowledge he gleaned as a governor of the exchange. Sullivan says, "My goal was to get out of the game." <p>Greenblatt decided to circumvent the Chicago Stock Exchange. He canceled all his orders at the exchange and sold only in New York. Once Scattered made the switch, however, it began to have some of the same problems with its brokerage houses as it had with the exchange. Scattered sold 920,000 shares through Rodman & Renshaw, and the brokerage house demanded immediate delivery. Greenblatt says he explained that Scattered had deliverable securities, referring to the warrants, but the broker, Michael Comerford, insisted on knowing where the shares were. The warrants weren't yet active, so to keep the trade alive, someone at Scattered lied. Greenblatt says it was he, Comerford says it was Nichols. "[Nichols] said he'd notify the bank to deliver the stock," Comerford recalled at the exchange hearings. When delivery didn't occur, Comerford called again. He was told the stock was tied up. He called again. This time, Comerford testified, he was told the stock was at the First National Bank of New Orleans and the contact was Leon Greenblatt. Rodman & Renshaw's researchers soon discovered that there was no First National Bank of New Orleans. Scattered tried once more to explain that the firm would deliver warrants, not stock. When Comerford pressed again, a week later, Comerford testified, Greenblatt grabbed the phone, and screamed, "You'll get the stock when you get it, you fucking idiot," and slammed it down. After that Rodman's CEO, Kurt Carmen, called Scattered, and Rodman & Renshaw agreed to take warrants.<p>Scattered filed for a temporary restraining order against the exchange to stop the demand that the firm have deliverable stock. Its emergency court date fell on June 28, the last day of trading in LTV. Greenblatt thought that even a last-minute disconnect in Scattered's arbitrage would cause a run-up in the stock and bring disaster. He says he instructed his partners to tell Scattered's attorney to do whatever he could to keep everyone in court until the end of the day. At 2:30, a half hour before the close of the market, the judge ruled against Scattered. But the exchange lawyers took no action that afternoon, and the market closed, after which the exchange's demand was irrelevant. LTV stock settled at just over seven cents a share. <p>In the days following, LTV extinguished the old stock, and in August, Scattered delivered the warrants. Without exception, all the stockholders accepted them. Despite the exchange's worst fears, never throughout the five-week period of Scattered's LTV play, nor in the weeks afterward, did Scattered face a demand for delivery it couldn't handle.<p>
The legal battle began. An attorney for the exchange told Scattered that the exchange was keeping $3 million of its LTV profits, because Scattered illegally sold at the close on the last day of trading to further  drive down the price. <p>Exchange regulators also decided to look deeper into Scattered's past. Greenblatt's boat-person days, it seemed, had caught up with him. Regulators discovered that Greenblatt had also crossed officials at the CBOE; the CBOE fined Greenblatt for trading too much in stocks in which he wasn't a market maker. In the trading world it's a small sin, but on one of the official forms Scattered filed with its application to the stock exchange, Greenblatt neglected to mention the CBOE action. The exchange maintains that he was legally bound to do so. Greenblatt says he later filed an amendment.<p>It was then that Greenblatt took the only action he says he regrets: He changed an old form in his files to look like a copy of the one he supposedly had amended. The ruse failed when a forensic expert hired by the exchange noticed that the signature on the form exactly matched that on another document. In late 1993, Bretzer issued a 32-page complaint against Scattered, listing fraud along with dozens of other alleged violations of securities laws and exchange rules.<p>Adding to Scattered's troubles was the federal class-action suit filed in July 1993 by David Sullivan, charging that Scattered manipulated LTV stock. Sullivan says he sued to protect the Chicago Stock Exchange, the securities markets, and the little guy: "Some [of the investors] bought $1,000 worth for their IRAs, thinking of security in old age." Sullivan alleges that Scattered used its market-maker status to mask the size of its short position, thus keeping vital economic information out of the hands of public investors. Sullivan's suit also claims that Greenblatt artificially depressed the price of the stock with Scattered's giant sell orders. "Any uptick would have taken away all his equity," Sullivan says.<p>Sullivan's suit failed in federal district court before making it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.<p>If Scattered had been able to choose a judge, it could have done no better than Richard Posner, an ardent free marketer, considered by many to be one of the federal judiciary's most brilliant judges. In a strident ruling, Posner wrote: "Scattered principals may be reckless gamblers, sharpies, wise guys, exploiters of loopholes, even violators of the letter or spirit of the rules of the Chicago Stock Exchange. We take no position on these questions." But, he continued, "The name for what Scattered did is not market manipulation, but arbitrage." Posner dismissed the case, reasoning that Scattered did the investing public a service. "By doing this, arbitrageurs [like Scattered] promote the convergence of market and economic values that we suggested was the central objective of securities regulation." <p>He went further, saying arbitrageurs such as Scattered help keep securities markets efficient by providing both liquidity and price information to less informed investors. Posner concluded his opinion by noting that "since the conduct in which Scattered engaged appears to have served rather than disserved the fundamental objectives of the securities laws, we are not inclined to strain to find a violation of a specific provision." <p>Posner's logic bewilders Sullivan. "It was an academician's analysis," he complains. "Posner says [Greenblatt] did a service to humanity. Well, Dr. Livingston he's not." Sullivan has appealed Posner's decision to the Supreme Court, though even his lawyer deems the chances of the court hearing the case slim.<p>While the U.S. courts refuse to strain to penalize Scattered's trading, the Chicago Stock Exchange has been less restrained. Since it filed charges in 1993, the exchange has effectively shut Scattered out of floor trading and at different times withheld varying amounts of the firm's money, ranging from $150,000 to $3 million.<p>At the exchange's hearings, held last winter and lasting two months, the regulators demanded a $17 million fine and full disgorgement of Scattered's profits. Tensions were high during that period. At one point, when exchange president Homer Livingston made his rounds on the floor, Greenblatt walked up to him and barked, "I want my fucking money." Greenblatt was ordered off the trading floor.<p>In mid-September 1995 the exchange's hearing officer, Gordon Nash, a former regulator at the American Stock Exchange, issued his judgment. The exchange was not bound by Posner's ruling, Nash reasoned,  since Posner defined "arbitrage in the general sense.... [He] was not offering a legal definition of the term as used in ... SEC rules." In Nash's reading of the rules, Scattered did not conduct arbitrage. He found the firm guilty of every major charge against it, finding that Scattered manipulated LTV stock to drive down its price, misrepresented itself to regulators and other investors, abused its status as a market maker, and recklessly imperiled the exchange. Nash also found the firm guilty of the charges relating to its application to the exchange. <p>Posner also found that "though their trading may have had an overall beneficial impact upon the market by contributing to a convergence between price and value' ...[as Posner had found in the Sullivan case], the seriousness of their illegal trading tactics cannot be ignored."<p>Nash fined Scattered and its partners about $6.4 million. He fined Laura Bryant $350,000. Scattered and Greenblatt were expelled from the exchange. Nichols and Jahelka were suspended from associating with any member of the exchange--Jahelka for two years, Nichols for one. Bryant, who says the judgment "was complete fantasy and showed a total disregard for the facts," was also suspended for a year. None of the judgments, however, take force until Scattered and Bryant have exhausted their appeals. The exchange's ruling can be appealed, first to the exchange, then to the SEC, and finally through the court system--perhaps even to Judge Posner.<p>Greenblatt says that even if the fine is upheld, "it will have no effect on us. Commercially, we're fully reserved." Scattered will continue to trade through brokerage houses, but without an exchange membership it may never again fully enjoy the riches offered by bankruptcy reorganizations.<p>The other suits around the issue are still pending in federal courts, in the Delaware Court of Chancery, and before judges in Cook County, Illinois. Scattered has already spent about $2 million in legal bills.<p>
Most of the participants expect the aftermath of Scattered's LTV bankruptcy play to go on for years. Greenblatt thinks it may outlast the exchange itself. Looking at the balance sheet in the exchange's annual report, he says, "It's going broke, and believe me, I know a little about bankrupt companies." In late September, the exchange announced plans to sell off its clearing and trust divisions, which will help ease its real estate burdens, among other things. <p>Scattered has moved onto other ventures, including setting up a company that builds plants to capture methane from garbage dumps--another way of turning trash into money. Scattered's jewel, though, is its LaSalle Street building, which was in bankruptcy when the firm bought it last year for $4 million drawn from its LTV proceeds. Greenblatt loves the place. "One and a half times [a year's] rent," he says, quoting the price, "$24 a square foot." Jesse Livermore's is now Scattered's tenant. Traders crowd the bar as much as ever, and now when talk turns to short selling, Greenblatt's name is as likely to come up as that of the original Boy Plunger. <p>
IT'S SIMPLE, WHEN YOU KNOW HOW<p>Scattered based its trading on these facts:
1. Upon retirement, the old LTV stock would be swapped for warrants at a ratio of 92 to 1 (92 shares would equal 1 warrant).
2. The price of the old stock would be valued at $0.0322 a share upon retirement.
3. As long as warrants could be acquired at a price cheaper than 92 shares of the stock, Scattered would make money.
4. Scattered would make money because it would sell stock (go short) at a high price, and buy warrants (which would replace the stock) for a low price. 
5. Scattered balanced its sales of LTV stock with its purchases of warrants. These trades negate each other upon the retirement of the LTV stock.<p>
Here is a fairly typical trade Scattered made in early June: 
It bought 10,000 warrants (representing 920,000 shares) at $3.875 for a total of $38,750.<p>It sold 920,000 shares at $0.1875 for $172,500.
Scattered sold something worth $38,750 for $172,500.
The profit: $133,750. <p>(Throughout Scattered's trading, the price of the warrants never exceeded the price of the stock times 92, making the play profitable for the whole period.)<p>

Worth magazine/Departments<p>FOLLOW-UPS<p>* A federal grand jury in Newark, New Jersey, indicted talk show host Sonny Bloch in May on charges that he used his broadcasts to promote fraudulent investment schemes ("Sonny Bloch Faces the Music," June). In July, a grand jury in New York City handed down a second set of indictments__this time for eight counts of tax fraud, perjury, and obstruction of justice. Bloch also faces civil charges brought in Federal District Court in Manhattan by the Securities and Exchange Commission.<p>* Dr. Bernardo Nadal-Ginard, the cardiologist accused of defrauding the charitable foundation he ran at Children's Hospital in Boston ("Irreversible Damage," April), was sentenced on June 6 to one year in prison by a Suffolk Superior Court judge in Massachusetts. The sentencing followed Nadal-Ginard's conviction on 12 counts of larceny. He is currently free on appeal.<p><p>

						Few investors know how much money some fund marketers pay banks to "help" sell their shares <p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>Commercial banks and thrifts have been selling mutual funds in their branches for more than ten years now. And their fund sales are large. According to the most recent figures available from Cerulli Associates in Boston, banks collected 11 percent of the roughly $510 billion in new money that investors put into equity and bond mutual funds in 1994.<p>Some 3,000 banks sell funds across the U.S. Many of them do a good job either by managing funds in-house through an investment subsidiary or by selecting from the 4,500 or so outside stock and bond funds to recommend to their customers. At some banks, however, the choice of which funds make it onto so-called preferred lists isn't always based on what's best for the customer. Rather, it is based on which funds most benefit the bank. In these cases, selection becomes not so much Darwinian__only the best-performing funds get offered__as Shylockian, with a pound of flesh exacted by the bank.<p>With so much competition, it isn't surprising that some fund companies pay to get their products on a bank's shelf, over and above commissions given to bank salespeople. These incentives include sending productive bank salespeople and managers who push their funds on all-expenses-paid trips to vacation spots, such as ski trips to Colorado and Switzerland, and giving away incentives like VCRs, TVs, exercise equipment, and golf clubs. Some fund companies fork over millions, ostensibly to cover a bank's advertising and promotion costs. And some banks go even further, demanding that the fund company pay the bank 2.5 cents of every dollar of the fund sold by that bank. When you're into billions of dollars of funds sold, these pennies have a way of adding up. And, as usual with marketing costs, they are ultimately paid by the consumer in the form of lower returns.<p>Hidden incentives and payments aren't new to the investment business. Brokerage firms have been rewarding top-producing salesmen for years with lavish trips and generous gifts. But the bank-fund schemes look bad on two counts. First, customers are unlikely to know how much a fund company is paying to the bank to sell its shares. Second, with gifts and money changing hands, a fund's merit may no longer be the prevailing consideration.How do fund buyers know they're getting the best fund for their money? A source at a major fund company that is unwilling to pay the levies required by some banks says, "The selection should be based on which organization and its products are most appropriate to the customer's needs. Instead, it's 'Who's willing to pay up?' "<p>According to this source, Chemical Bank, a major player in funds, has demanded that his fund company pay extra to have its shares sold through the bank. Although Chemical, the nation's fourth-largest bank, will not disclose how much business it does in annual fund sales, it's among the nation's biggest in the business. Say Chemical does $1 billion in mutual fund sales a year, a fair guess according to an industry expert. If just half of those sales were done with fund companies who agreed to pay the 25 basis points in freight, the bank rakes in an additional $1 million a year, no-risk. Nice work if you can get it. <p>As of mid-February, Chemical's short list included nine fund families, half the number offered a year ago. All carry loads, most of them hefty__between 4.50 percent and 5.75 percent. Leonard Malkin, president of Chemical Investment Services, says the bank selects its funds after an in-depth screening process that considers, among other things, fund performance over long periods and in both up and down markets, risk profile, and the quality of the fund manager. When asked about the extra pay arrangements from fund companies, Malkin first answers, "I am not aware of that." Then he changes his mind, stating, "That's not true." Five of the fund families that deal with Chemical would not comment on specifics about their relationships with the bank. But other fund-industry sources confirm that Chemical does demand such fees.<p>Last year, San Franciscobased Prophet Market Research & Consulting surveyed 50 of the largest bank securities programs in the country, conducting 400 "mystery" shopping audits in 23 states to gauge the clarity of sales pitches in bank branches and compliance with sales regulations. Chemical's performance was woeful; it ranked third from the bottom.<p>Insisting on extra money from funds or allowing salespeople to accept resort trips is not the way of all banks, but it is nonetheless prevalent. Says another fund-company executive: "There are a lot of beauty contests going on." This, in spite of the guidelines for banks selling investments, published by the American Bankers Association and five other industry groups, stating that salespeople "should not favor or disfavor the sale of a particular investment company, group of investment companies or insurance company product based solely on the receipt of brokerage commissions or other incentives." <p>Old habits die hard. How many banks strictly follow the ABA guidelines today? Hard to tell, since financial relationships between fund companies and the banks that sell their products are kept under wraps. Until all remunerations are detailed clearly and upfront, investors will never know how much a fund company has given to a bank to "help" sell its funds.<p>According to industry sources, among the group of banks that run their fund operations on merit and appropriateness for customers are Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank Corp., Columbus, Ohio based Banc One, and Cleveland-based KeyCorp.<p>PNC offers 200 outside funds, all with loads. George Bernard, head of the bank's mutual fund group, describes PNC's selection process: First it looks at the fund company's financial strength and reputation, operations, and technological abilities. Then it considers the diversity of the company's offerings and fund fees. The bank has six fund families on its list. "We will not take money to be on our list, and we do not allow fund families to give our salespeople trips or other recognition programs," he says. "We want to be held to a higher standard." <p>Jack Kopnisky, president of KeyCorp.'s investment subsidiary, agrees that banks have to be extremely cautious in their relationships with outside fund companies. KeyCorp., a veteran in the mutual fund business, is narrowing its offerings from 50 fund families to 10. "We're trying to level the playing field so one company doesn't pay more than others," Kopnisky says. "And we are going to manage incentive trips more closely in the future. You don't want to [encourage] brokers to sell one product over another."<p>Banks should be required to divulge to customers any and all "extras" fund companies pay them to help sell their wares. This information should not be buried in the fine print of a prospectus and should be clearly stated to investors. Only then can customers make fully informed investment decisions about which fund is best for them.<p>One fund executive says that the Securities & Exchange Commission is becoming more concerned about the types of incentives handed out to bank brokers selling funds these days. But this doesn't stop banks from doing business this way. Says Cerulli Associates' Mary McAvity: "They're just more careful about how they demand incentives."  <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>THE FRAUD DU JOUR IS WIRELESS CABLE
Scams rise as investors look for a high-tech bonanza.<p>By Kathleen Murray<p>Two years ago, george salmon, a retiree from Hanford, California, saw an advertisement in a local newspaper touting a hot new high-tech investment. After reviewing the offering documents and talking to a salesman about promised returns of 300  percent, he put $10,000 in Broadcast Holdings, a Costa Mesa, California, company looking to develop wireless cable systems in Missouri, Tennessee, and Oregon.<p>Last May, Broadcast Holdings shut its doors after state authorities, suspecting the company of selling unregistered securities, raided its offices. Salmon remains optimistic. "I'm hopeful that this will all be cleared up soon," he said. "I still  think it's a good investment."<p>State and federal regulators, however, fear Salmon is one of thousands of investors nationwide to be taken by what they say is the "fraud du jour" -- wireless cable systems. Since 1992, unscrupulous promoters have raised over $300 million in  questionable deals to set up wireless systems, a viable technology that transmits television programming via microwave to some 500,000 U.S. homes. <p>State officials already have shuttered more than 70 illicit wireless operations. In the past year the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have brought more than a dozen lawsuits. But the scams continue. In Southern  California alone, regulators estimate 30 boiler rooms are still bringing in $1 million a month. "People fall for it because they think you can't lose with high tech, that the information highway is paved with gold," says G.W. "Bill" McDonald, chief  of enforcement for the California Department of Corporations.<p>The pitch, according to McDonald and other regulators, seldom varies. Companies say they have a license to provide wireless cable for a region, and if you invest now, you can help build a system that might be bought out by a large company. Their  claims are bolstered by the fact that there is a legitimate wireless-cable industry. Buoyed by regulatory changes, wireless companies have raised more than $500 million on Wall Street, according to the Wireless Cable Association International.<p>There's a difference, though, between the deals investment banks are willing to put money into and those being peddled to unsophisticated investors, regulators say. Scammers typically sell unregistered shares in a general partnership or in  limited-liability companies, whereas legit companies are listed on an exchange. With that arrangement, fraudsters often sidestep regulations requiring financial disclosure. They then try to get away with charging fees and promising returns well  above those of any publicly traded company.<p>Take Continental Wireless Cable Television in La Jolla, California. An SEC lawsuit alleges that company operators lured victims with television and radio infomercials touting the wonders of wireless technology. People who called an 800 number were  later contacted by members of a 250-man sales force. If they invested immediately in systems in Nashville or New Orleans, they were told they could earn returns of as much as 500 percent in as little as three years. <p>In 16 months, Continental raised $36 million from more than 2,000 investors in 46 states. Regulators charge that only $7.1 million actually went into building the system. More than $11 million went to pay sales commissions and other promotional  expenses, and at least $1.2 million was "loaned" to officers Robin McPherson, Jay Bishop, and Gene Cardenaz. The company also used $233,000 to settle an enforcement action against it in Tennessee. Roughly $16.5 million remains unaccounted for.<p>On July 12, a California court approved a preliminary injunction against Continental. Company officials deny wrongdoing and point to a working system in Nashville with 2,200 subscribers. SEC attorney Karen Matteson, however, suggests that even if  investors try to run the systems, it is unlikely they could make a profit without putting in thousands of dollars. "You're talking about people who invested their IRA money," she says.<p>Law-enforcement officials say retirement money is particularly attractive to wireless con artists. To push $10,000 minimum investments in Wireless Limited Liability of Parkersburg, West Virginia, salesmen in one Denver boiler room told potential  investors that the IRS had suggested they call because the person had an IRA and this was a government-approved investment. Wrong, said the SEC, which closed the company down in May, but not before it had raised $11 million. <p>Not all wireless companies are fraudulent, of course. If you think you've found a good one, beware of promises of big profits, said Tom Hamill, the SEC's senior special counsel on wireless fraud. "There's no basis for these projections of 300  percent returns," he says. "Even wireless companies that are up and running go years without showing a profit."<p>If you're considering investing in wireless cable, consult an attorney or accountant before you do. Andrew Kreig of Wireless Cable Association International recommends investors specifically ask how the investment money will be spent. If the lion's  share is for promotion, not plant and equipment, pass. Be advised that the operator needs to own or lease a minimum of 20 of the 32 FCC-approved channels for a viable operation. <p>You should also check out the company, its principals, and its sales organizations with your local Better Business Bureau and securities regulator. In a recent nationwide survey, state regulators identified 267 companies and 520 individuals in  wireless and other high-tech scams that warranted looking into. Of those, 100 of the companies and 110 of the individuals had been disciplined in the past for securities violations. <p>With regulators turning up the heat on wireless fraud, some say it's only a matter of time before the fast-buck artists move on. The SEC has already filed two cases involving specialized mobile radio, and regulators predict fraudulent offerings for  personal-communications systems and interactive video may not be far behind. "The product changes," says McDonald, "but it's just the same scam over and over again."<p><p>

						The untold story of Scott Cone is one of regulators run amok. But it is also just one piece of a broader nightmare. Although the so-called cleanup of the savings and loan industry may have begun as a well-intentioned crackdown on abuse, it has become a witch-hunt, destroying the lives of honest operators.  The toll, in human and financial terms, is staggering. Congress should put a stop to it.<p>By Mollie Dickenson<p>In his last days, just before Thanksgiving 1992, Scott Cone had become sad, even tearful. He was also frightened, sure that the FBI was following him and tapping his phone. Cone had been chief financial officer for Landmark Land Co., a real estate  developer based in New Orleans that also owned a number of savings and loans. But Landmark had been taken over by federal regulators from the Office of Thrift Supervision. Cone, 39 years old, was jobless in a deepening recession and banned for life  from banking. He owed his defense lawyers an overwhelming sum, and he was also alone, having divorced his wife of 18 years, Debby, to distance his family from his mounting personal and professional problems.<p>"I don't think I ever thought he wasn't going to be okay," Debby says. "I thought he'd regroup. Later, I realized he'd told me good-bye and I didn't even know it. He said, 'You've always been a good mother, Deb. I love you and the girls more than anything else in the world.'" <p>For more than two years, Cone had been the point man in Landmark's battle to keep its huge real estate empire operating profitably while also keeping the company out of the hands of newly hostile thrift regulators. This enormous task had fallen to  Cone, never a major decision maker in the company, because the regulators had fired his boss and Cone knew Landmark's finances inside and out. "Scott was the sweetest, most sensitive person I've ever known," says former Landmark chairman Gerald  Barton. "But to the regulators he became a symbol of an institution that dared to question government actions." <p>Gregory Goggans, as the Office of Thrift Supervision's resident examiner, was the bank's permanent regulator. Three Landmark employees say they saw a letter Goggans had written to his superiors in 1990; in it he stated that his goal for the year was  to "bring the bank down."<p>In 1990 and 1991, while demanding that Landmark sell its properties, the government scuttled, with little explanation, two bona fide offers Landmark received for its luxury resort properties -- among them Kiawah Island, a South Carolina golf resort,  and the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club in Florida. Had regulators allowed Landmark to accept either offer, the company might have survived. Taxpayers could have saved more than $1 billion. <p>Instead, Landmark's subsidiaries declared bankruptcy in October 1991. The filing was intended to help the company liquidate properties free of government interference. Two court rulings upheld this strategy, but in August 1992 an appeals court ruled  that new S&L regulations essentially put the government beyond the law. Landmark fell into receivership under the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency created to handle bankrupt thrifts. <p>"Scott was consumed with getting the government out of the bank and out of our affairs," says William Thompson, Landmark's chief tax accountant and the man who hired Cone. "He was obsessed to the point that he even began to disregard his children,  whom he had always put first." <p>The OTS accused Cone of withholding company records, a bizarre charge since the government itself had confiscated the documents it was demanding. Then the government sued Cone and the thrift's comptroller for conspiring to file false reports and  fraudulently reporting more capital than Landmark had. <p>Cone's legal bills were now his, not his company's responsibility. With no money to defend himself, he signed a consent decree in return for getting the government to drop charges. His banking career was over.<p>"Scott was a sincere, honest boy from the country," says Debby Cone, who began dating Scott when he was 19. "He believed the government was looking for bad guys, and they were trying to make him and the others at Landmark into those bad guys. He  believed they could look forever, for there was nothing to find."<p>Debby wanted Scott to quit Landmark and become a country veterinarian, a dream he'd had. But he felt if he left he would let people down. "He believed in our justice system and wanted his day in court," says Debby. "Landmark's survival had become  more important to him than anything else, and he took its breakup like a death. I kept telling him, 'I love you. I'll stick by you.' But I couldn't seem to reach him."<p>The Sunday night before Thanksgiving, Scott Cone took the family's shotgun, put it to his head, and pulled the trigger. He left no note for his wife and two children, but the source of his despair was clear. He was wearing a T-shirt some Landmark  employees had made up in a moment of defiance against the government. It had RTC printed on it, circled and slashed through in red.<p>At the funeral three days later, Debby was summoned to the sheriff's office after the burial. She was shown into a back room where two FBI agents waited. "They began asking me a lot of questions. Then they told me that there was a chance that Scott  had been murdered and that they wanted to look through his apartment. That frightened me. I knew it was suicide." <p>She told them they could not search the apartment until she talked to her lawyer, but as it was Thanksgiving, the lawyer was unreachable. The session with the FBI ended, but Debby remained afraid. "I knew it would be hard to get good legal advice  given the bizarre, almost unbelievable things we'd been through," she said. <p>Debby began getting calls from lawyers and government officials asking about papers Scott might have had. And on her second visit to his apartment, she noticed that the garbage had been taken out. A month later she came home to find her door  standing open. She was subpoenaed for personal notes Scott had kept after the ordeal began.<p>
When most people think of the savings and loan crisis, they picture shady businessmen who enriched themselves at the expense of taxpayers while the government looked the other way. This view not only is consistent with popular opinion, but also  apparently jibes with the sentiments of regulators at the OTS and the RTC. OTS spokesman William Fulwider, for instance, asserts that 50 percent of all U.S. thrifts engaged in fraudulent practices.<p>There's a problem with this image, however: It's false. <p>Last fall, the National Commission on Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement, authorized by Congress, concluded that only 10 percent to 15 percent of monetary losses sustained by taxpayers in the S&L crisis were the result of fraud.  Of the 4,000 S&Ls extant in 1980, banking experts say no more than 100 were outlaw operations. "I stand by my consistent judgment that only 3 percent of losses were due to fraud," says banking consultant Bert Ely of Ely & Co. in Alexandria, Virginia.<p>To come to an understanding of what truly happened in the S&L crisis, Worth spent a year and a half examining ten different thrift cases in litigation. The government was of little help in the process; the OTS and RTC are two of the most secretive  agencies in Washington. Although the spokespeople for these organizations say that they are simply doing what Congress instructed them to do and doing a fine job fixing an "unprecedented problem," it is their policy not to discuss specific cases  that are in litigation.<p>Government regulators have approached the so-called S&L crisis as if widespread criminality applied to anyone with a pocket calculator. In the process, it has seized hundreds of failing thrifts whose assets might have been preserved through sales  and mergers. It has deemed "insolvent" some 500 salvageable S&Ls, seizing them under interpretations of a law Congress passed to resolve the thrift crisis.<p>"The large majority of S&Ls have always been ethical operations," says Vic Simon, editor of Bank Bailout Litigation News. "All the really rogue operations were closed down by 1990. Many of the government's cases are against people who did nothing  wrong."<p>In its quest to catch crooks, the RTC became the nation's largest employer of law firms. Between 1989 and 1991, it paid $1 billion to 3,350 firms, according to informed sources. The agency also has paid $6.5 billion to more than 100,000 outside  contractors, such as appraisers and brokers of thrift assets. <p>Salaries at the OTS and RTC top out  at $158,000, according to documents supplied under a Freedom of Information Act request. Only the president, vice president, and chief justice make more among all federal workers. Congress recently sent the RTC $18 billion in new money, even though  the agency is scheduled to shut its doors at the end of 1995.<p>All told, the RTC has spent $130 billion of taxpayers' money and sold $400 billion worth of seized assets. Many of these assets, sold at discounts of 30 to 40 percent (taxpayers make up the difference so thrift depositors can be reimbursed in full),  have ended up in the hands of wealthy individuals (Texas investor Robert Bass, Revlon chief executive Ron Perelman), corporations (GE Capital Corp., Ford Motor Credit Co.), and partnerships managed by Wall Street firms (Merrill Lynch, Goldman  Sachs). Together, these asset sales constitute one of the largest transfers of wealth in U.S. history.<p>Just last March, the RTC said it would reopen "several hundred" thrift investigations that had been closed. Washington defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Douglas Lobel says, "More and more aggressive prosecutors are converting regulatory  and administrative violations into criminal convictions, using elastic statutes that know virtually no limits."<p>Perhaps the most damning view of the RTC and its litigation practices comes from a man who until 1992 was the agency's associate general counsel. Now a lawyer in Washington, Ira Parker says, "The fear of being called before Senate and House banking  committees caused the RTC to file many questionable suits against former directors and officers." Parker says he usually got cases two days before the statute of limitations ran out. "Twenty percent of them are easy, they're black and white. The  other 80 percent are in a gray area, but.. . . If you make a decision not to bring action, you know you're going to be up on the Hill being asked to explain, but if you go ahead and authorize litigation, nobody's going to criticize you." <p><p>For the sake of perspective, it's important to keep in mind that the thrift industry was plunged into crisis not because of thievery, but because of high interest rates in the late '70s and early '80s. At the time, thrifts were locked into receiving  low-yielding, long-term mortgage payments from their customers. Meanwhile, these institutions could pay no more than 5.5 percent interest to depositors, a limit set by regulators. Naturally, as uninsured money market accounts began paying interest  of up to 15 percent, the thrifts began losing depositors in droves. <p>In 1982, in a bid to help the industry, Congress changed some of the rules. It allowed thrifts to pay rates competitive with money market accounts. It also allowed them to begin making riskier investments than simple home mortgages. The amount  covered by federal insurance was raised from $40,000 to $100,000. <p>Later, the Reagan administration, under Vice President George Bush's Deregulatory Task Group, took further action. It began lifting restrictions on the kinds of investments that thrifts could make, as well as on the percentage of assets they could  put into those investments. Rather than increase the number of regulators to oversee newly freed thrifts, however, Bush's group targeted the regulatory budget for cuts. "They told 'em, 'Go do anything you want,'" says banking consultant Richard  Hohlt. "But then they forgot to hire the cops."<p>These policy changes certainly did attract some unscrupulous operators to the S&L industry. They also encouraged some inexperienced thrift managers to invest badly in unfamiliar territory. But the industry was hardly as riddled with crooks as the  public was later led to believe.<p>In 1986, Congress rescinded generous tax breaks given in 1982 to commercial real estate investors. As a result, property values plunged. Previously encouraged to invest more heavily in real estate, thrifts watched in horror as the value of their new  holdings plunged. Problems in the thrift industry had become a full-blown crisis. Commercial banking found itself in turmoil as well.<p>Amidst all the financial chaos, some abuses surfaced and Washington launched into its usual round of finger-pointing. William Seidman, former head of the FDIC and the RTC, writes in his recent memoir that Bush planned during his 1988 presidential  campaign "to attack the Democratic Congress" for easing S&L restrictions. <p>Once elected, Bush promised to put the crooks who looted the S&Ls behind bars. The law intended to help accomplish this was the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) of 1989. The Democratic Congress, cowering under  charges that it had intervened on behalf of S&L crooks, stiffened the law and authorized $50 billion as the first installment of the cleanup. For thrifts, their lawyers, and their accountants, it was the beginning of a witch-hunt that would destroy  hundreds of ethical companies and ruin thousands of lives.<p>"FIRREA, as written, wasn't all bad," says Robert O'Brien, former chief executive of a New Jersey thrift and a onetime federal banking official. "It was the way it was applied that ended the thrift industry as we know it." To hide their past errors  and protect their careers, Bush appointees and regulators ruthlessly shut down solvent and/or law-abiding thrifts, then ineptly sold their assets. <p>The law established two new agencies within the executive branch: the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates and determines the solvency of thrifts, and the Resolution Trust Corp., which manages seized thrifts and sells off their assets.  Their victims call them the Executioner and the Undertaker. <p>"Having to spend $150 billion allowed the administration to create an enormous political fiefdom," says O'Brien. FIRREA also turned the tables on the thrift business, redefining previously allowed investments, such as real estate, as  "impermissible." S&Ls effectively had up to five years to sell all real estate included in their capital; during that time they had to discount the value of these properties by ever-increasing percentages. Junk bonds were also written down and had  to be sold. Also, uninsured capital notes, commonly sold to bolster S&Ls' financial positions, were now disallowed. <p>FIRREA also reneged on the contracts that many S&Ls had struck with the government when they agreed to take over failed thrifts, contracts that had allowed thrifts to count as assets the money owed to depositors of the failed institution, their  negative net worth. This accounting mechanism, known as regulatory goodwill, had saved millions in taxpayer money throughout the '80s. "It was an enormous benefit to the government," says Bank Bailout Litigation News's Simon. But FIRREA took it  away. As a result, many thrifts instantly found themselves out of capital compliance. <p>As if FIRREA weren't enough, many thrifts weren't even given a chance to sell their real estate or junk bonds. The OTS marched in and arbitrarily wrote down the assets, making the S&Ls "undercapitalized" and subject to seizure. Often, OTS employees  refused to let S&Ls sell assets.<p><p>FIRREA also gave the OTS and RTC extraordinary powers to criminalize behavior that once represented standard procedure in the S&L industry. Thrift employees suddenly could be held criminally liable in S&L cases even when the financial institution  lost no money and the individual obtained no personal benefit. Edward Morris, a 51-year-old investment banker and former CEO of Germania Savings and Loan in St. Louis, discovered this the hard way. Last July 11, he was sentenced to 46 months in a  federal prison. His putative crime: Mail and wire fraud. <p>In 1987 and 1988, Germania attempted to increase its capital position by selling $16 million of its own uninsured notes to depositors and other investors. The government claimed that Morris peddled these notes to unsophisticated investors (among  them, his son) at a time when he supposedly knew the bank was in bad shape -- this even though Germania capital positions exceeded requirements by nearly $19 million.<p>At the time, issuing capital notes was a common practice. It was also permitted by regulators. FIRREA, however, outlawed the practice. The rule change put Germania out of capital compliance, inviting an RTC takeover. The notes Morris had sold his investors became worthless, and the bank couldn't pay off depositors. <p>Morris says the RTC was unable to pay depositors because its takeover of Germania caused a run on the bank. He also says the government sold the thrift's assets below their market value. Morris says he was in a catch-22: "Regulators arbitrarily  define your capital away, take over your bank, sell your assets for pennies on the dollar, then, coming up way short of money to pay off depositors and investors, say, 'See, we said this was a worthless thrift!'" <p>Before the government took over the thrift, Morris received an offer for Germania from a large St. Louis bank. The proposed acquisition would have saved taxpayers $50 million later spent on cleaning up Germania's operations. The government, however,  nixed the sale. <p>In December 1991, the RTC sued Morris for mismanagement of Germania's assets, negligence, and something called "unjust enrichment." This last charge was a strange one. To demonstrate unjust enrichment, regulators must prove a defendant stole assets  from an institution. Yet Morris had lost $50,000 of his own money in the Germania debacle. So the RTC focused on Morris's $130,000 annual salary. The RTC decided that Morris should have been making only $115,000. In his two years on the job,  therefore, the government alleged that Morris had "stolen" $30,000. Ironically, Morris's salary was less than those of many of the regulators who later hounded him. "That's when I really cracked," says Morris. The government froze Morris's assets, a  move later overturned by a district-court judge. <p>Morris's ordeal pushed him to start a newsletter, Regulatory Watchdog, which tracks thrift-regulatory actions. "My anger got focused pretty well," he says. <p><p>Regulators, in taking on what they perceive as a thoroughly corrupt industry, also have stumbled as a result of their own inexperience or ignorance. A case in point is the saga of Jess Rodrigues, president of Saratoga Savings & Loan in San Jose,  California.<p>In 1982, Rodrigues bought the charter on Saratoga Savings & Loan for $25,000 and capitalized the company with $2 million from his mortgage company. "There was no one more qualified to run an S&L than me," says Rodrigues, who had great success as a  mortgage banker. "I'd dealt with the Federal Housing Administration, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac for years with never a problem." Things went well at Saratoga; he opened two branches in Silicon Valley. In 1985, the thrift had $165  million in assets and was returning 40 percent on equity. <p>Saratoga's troubles began in 1986, when the government placed the thrift under a cease-and-desist order for alleged unsafe lending practices. Feeling that he had done nothing wrong, Rodrigues fought back. Initially, he was vindicated. An  administrative law judge declared that the government's entire argument had been based on erroneous assumptions of fact, arbitrary conclusions of regulatory requirements, and a total lack of rationale.<p>The government, however, pressed on, and in 1987 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in its favor: Saratoga had to follow the cease-and-desist order. The government then referred the case to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. For  the next year and a half Rodrigues and his wife, Donna, found themselves under constant surveillance. Their phones were tapped on six different occasions. But the criminal investigation went nowhere. In February 1989, U.S. Attorney Joseph P.  Russoniello of San Francisco closed the case, saying, "Further investigation is not warranted."<p>The Justice Department had given up, but not the OTS. It still wanted to get Saratoga. On November 9, 1989, at 4:30 p.m., OTS officials stormed Saratoga's branches with FBI agents and security guards in tow. Bank executives were herded into a  boardroom, their briefcases searched. "They frisked everybody on the way out," says Rodrigues. "The young examiners were doing high fives in the parking lot."<p>Charging Saratoga with "unsafe and unsound banking practices," the regulators placed the thrift into receivership. Rodrigues and his lawyers fought the charges, using a spring 1989 assessment by Merrill Lynch of Saratoga's $19.7 million value to  prove the thrift was nowhere near insolvent. But this line of defense came to naught.<p>Rodrigues could do nothing as he watched the government drive his bank into the ground -- all at taxpayer expense. Before the takeover, Saratoga S&L paid its controller $48,000 a year. That person was fired; the government's controller earned  $80,000 a year. <p>Saratoga held a $1 million loan on 200 acres of land adjacent to an IBM plant in San Jose. Before the government seized the thrift, the borrower had struck a deal to sell the land for $1.6 million. But before the sale went through, the RTC grabbed  the $1 million deed and sold it to Pacific Western Bank for $100,000, or 10 cents on the dollar. The borrower then renegotiated the $1 million loan down to $600,000, only to sell the land for $1.6 million. Pacific Western made a fast $500,000, the  borrower saved $400,000, and taxpayers lost $900,000. Rodrigues was stunned: "There had to be something more at work here than stupidity."<p>The $20 million business Rodrigues had built was being destroyed. On the advice of his accountant, Rodrigues's holding company took a $2.6 million tax-loss carryback on Saratoga's books that regulators wanted to carry forward instead and put into  the thrift. After 18 months, the IRS and Congress approved the refund, with interest, to Rodrigues's holding company. <p>But a blistering regulatory response followed right on the heels of the check. In June 1992, the Justice Department used new forfeiture laws to seize Rodrigues's assets, putting liens on his house, his bank accounts, and two pieces of property he  owned. In April 1994, Rodrigues was indicted for embezzlement. He awaits his trial.<p>Banned for life from the banking industry, Rodrigues now owns and operates a nursery in northern California. "The last person in my life that I thought I'd get screwed by is my government," he says. <p><p>Franklin Savings Association of Ottawa, Kansas, the state's largest thrift, appears to have been another victim of regulatory incompetence. Throughout the 1980s, it employed a very successful hedging operation -- one that former Franklin executives  believe government agents never understood. Instead, they say, Franklin's hedging techniques were used as an excuse to seize the thrift February 16, 1990.<p>The seizure "came without warning," says Ernest Fleischer, 61, Franklin's former CEO. Fleischer requested a meeting in Washington to discuss the seizure; he says OTS general counsel Harris Weinstein told him that any settlement of his case would  require him to agree never to bring legal action against the OTS, its officers, or independent contractors it hired. Says Fleischer: "I responded that my purpose was to resolve any factual difference and to reach a settlement with the regulators,  and then, that they and I should be free to achieve any legal redress available."<p>No way, said Weinstein. "There was never a discussion of the merits of the case," says Fleischer.<p>"It was an ugly meeting," says Franklin's attorney, Charles German. "Weinstein and his people were so arrogant, condescending, and rude to all of us, including Fleischer's wife, who was there as an owner of Franklin." OTS filed a motion against  German saying that because he had represented Franklin on other unrelated matters, the lawyer was acting improperly. Says German, "Weinstein told me I was not to speak during this meeting." The motion against German was denied; government lawyers  were later sanctioned by Magistrate Judge Ronald Newman in the U.S. District Court of Topeka, Kansas, for having filed it.<p>Months ago, Judge Newman charged the RTC with litigation abuse in the Franklin case, saying it "engaged in a type of gamesmanship which will not be tolerated by the court. Due to the conduct of the RTC in this matter, the expense of litigation has  been increased, counsel's time has been wasted, and the court's resources usurped. Therefore, the court finds that sanctions are warranted."<p>The OTS's case against Franklin claimed that the thrift would be undercapitalized if it properly recognized losses such as those "resulting from hedging operations." The thrift sued to prevent seizure and was upheld by U.S. District Judge Dale  Saffels. He wrote that OTS's conclusions were "arbitrary and capricious and without reasonable basis" and that OTS "staff appeared to lack adequate training and understanding to evaluate the nature of Franklin's operations." Saffels further ruled  that the key fact used to justify the takeover was erroneous. What's more, Saffels said, OTS orders to continue writing down Franklin's assets lacked "any reasonable basis."<p>Saffels concluded that Franklin's hedging plan was "safe and sound," that regulators "acted wrongly in imposing the conservatorship." But Franklin lost its case in May 1991, when the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that, as established by  FIRREA, only the government's side of the case could be considered. The Supreme Court denied Franklin's petition without comment.<p><p>One of the many ironies about the S&L story is how the government turned on the very people it had sought out to help solve the problem of America's failing thrifts. Landmark was such a company. <p>In 1982, banking regulators traveled to Landmark's offices and asked the company to absorb the failed Dixie Savings & Loan in New Orleans, a move that would prevent a federal bailout and save taxpayers some $150 million. Landmark's Gerald Barton  agreed to the transaction only when the government said Landmark could count Dixie's $150 million negative net worth as an asset and write it off over 40 years. <p>Though Landmark would have to earn an extra 2.5 percent profit a year to cover the declining value of the regulatory goodwill, Barton accepted the deal because his company would be able to fund its real estate development through the thrift at  slightly less than market rates. Still, says Barton, the decision "was a close call." <p>A year later, regulators asked Landmark to contribute all of its real estate holdings -- some $270 million worth -- to the thrift subsidiary, which had been renamed Oak Tree Savings. This was done to avoid what could have been a conflict of interest  -- a holding company that owned real estate and a subsidiary that did as well. Still, the Oak Tree deal worked so well for both sides that in 1986, the government asked Landmark to take over another bankrupt Louisiana thrift, St. Bernard Savings and  Loan. By 1989, Landmark was managing and selling $1 billion in real estate properties from 21 other failed thrifts, more than any other company in the nation. <p>But that year was also the beginning of the end for Landmark. "We went from being part of the solution [to the S&L crisis] to being part of the problem," says Barton. <p>At the time, Oak Tree was one of the best-capitalized thrifts in the nation; it possessed roughly $600 million in capital against $2.5 billion in assets. This healthy 24 percent capital ratio was way above the 3 percent required then by regulators. <p>But in 1989, to adhere to FIRREA's onerous new capital requirements, Landmark officials prepared to sell their choicest property holdings. The first offer for Landmark's luxury resorts came in April 1990 from Barry Hon, a California developer. Hon  offered $965 million: $200 million in cash and a mortgage to be held by Oak Tree for the remainder, secured by the properties underlying it. Landmark's board approved the sale. <p>Nevertheless, on May 7, 1990, Neil Twomey, Oak Tree's OTS supervisor in Dallas, rejected the Hon transaction, saying it was "unsafe and unsound." Barton asked him for further clarification but says Twomey didn't seem to have anything substantive to  add in the way of an explanation.<p>On June 6, a second offer for the Landmark properties arrived. This one was from Texas billionaire investor Robert Bass, who had previously tried to get in on the Hon transaction. This time, he offered $904 million -- $61 million less than the  initial bid. <p>A day later, Barton says Twomey advised him to sell Landmark's real estate holdings quickly, no later than the end of June. The reason, according to Twomey, was that tough new examiners were coming to town on July 1, and they'd have instructions to  write down Landmark's real estate. If that happened, Oak Tree no longer would have enough capital. <p>On June 8, Barton got a surprise. He found out that Neil Twomey was about to leave his OTS job and sign on with the Bass organization. Twomey would be working for the chief negotiator trying to buy the Landmark properties. Barton was stunned. He  recalls that this was "the man with no real estate expertise, who was solely responsible for turning down the Hon bid, and who then demanded that I have a contract for sale within 30 days."<p>Contrary to Twomey's warnings, however, the new regulators did not immediately force Barton's hand. So Landmark looked elsewhere for a buyer. A third offer came in January 1991 from Dai-Ichi, a large Japanese real estate company: $785 million, with  a down payment of $322 million in cash. For ten months, the government sat on the proposal, neither approving nor rejecting the Dai-Ichi offer. The long delay effectively scuttled the deal. <p>Finally, Barton decided his only recourse was to take Landmark into bankruptcy. The date he filed was October 11, 1991. <p>Two days later, OTS seized Landmark. At around midnight on October 13, Gerald Barton's wife was awakened by a telephone call from the OTS. The caller informed her that the government had put a lien on the Barton home and had frozen all of the  family's bank accounts, including those of Barton's mother, brother, sister, and children.<p>Later, OTS chief counsel Harris Weinstein, enraged by Landmark's attempt at self-preservation, imposed penalties of $1 million each on four Landmark officers and civil fines of $500,000 a day on the company.<p><p>In June of this year, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruled that FIRREA constituted a breach of contract between thrifts and the government. The court said this breach had occurred when the law removed the benefits of regulatory  goodwill from thrifts' balance sheets. If this ruling stands upon further appeal, the government could be forced to pay billions of dollars back to the 250 thrifts that were subjected to this tactic.<p>Also, Scott Cone, Gerald Barton, and other Landmark officials were exonerated in June when a federal judge ruled that the company had acted in good faith by filing for bankruptcy protection in 1991. The judge further required that the RTC pay all of  Landmark's and its managers' legal bills. Total litigation costs now shouldered by the taxpayers consist of more than $1 million spent by Landmark and upwards of $10 million spent by the RTC. Neither Neil Twomey nor Gregory Goggans could be  contacted to discuss the Landmark case.<p>Eight hundred days after the OTS imposed its $500,000-a-day penalty on Landmark, the government dropped the fines. It did so without comment. The fines had accumulated to $400 million.<p>What happened to Landmark's premier properties? Although some have yet to be bid on, estimates of what the RTC will fetch from Landmark asset sales total $600 million. The book value of those assets is $1.2 billion. Loss to the taxpayer: More than  half a billion dollars. If the government had let Landmark sell to Barry Hon, the company would have made $450 million and taxpayers would have lost nothing, Landmark would be solvent, 5,000 employees would have jobs, and 5,000 shareholders would  not have been saddled with worthless stock.<p>Undaunted, Gerald Barton has returned to real estate development, this time in Columbus, Ohio. He set himself up in business on borrowed money. <p>After Debby Cone found out that her husband had been cleared, she said, "They thought I'd be happy to hear the news, but I cried. It came too late to help Scott."<p><p>Former thrift officers and directors hoped that the election of Bill Clinton might bring a reexamination of FIRREA and a reining in of the inept and abusive implementation of the law. Last year, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen outlined an eight-step program to address "waste, fraud, and abuse" in the RTC. He nominated Republican RTC critic Stanley Tate to head the agency. Damaging leaks, however,  torpedoed Bentsen's effort, and Tate withdrew his name. Meanwhile President Clinton himself appears boxed in by the Madison Guaranty/Whitewater imbroglio and is hardly in a safe position to initiate a major investigation of the bailout bureaucracies  -- at least not without substantial political risk. <p>Some observers believe this is no accident: Lamar Kelly -- the Bush appointee in charge of liquidating thrift assets at the RTC -- reopened the Madison case on his way out of the agency. Jay Stephens, an avowed Clinton political enemy, is handling  the case. <p>At present, only one Clinton appointee heads up any of the banking bureaucracies -- Eugene Ludwig at the Comptroller of the Currency. The bureaucrats running the other agencies -- RTC, OTS, and FDIC -- continue to answer to no one.<p><p>

						How to broaden your portfolio's horizons. Plus, a map of the investing world's hot spots.<p>By Gregory J. Millman<p>In recent years, U.S. investors have turned into financial Marco Polos, setting out across the globe in search of stratospheric returns. In the process, they've created the biggest foreign-stock-buying binge in history. During the first nine months of 1993 alone, American individuals and institutions snapped up $99 billion more in foreign securities than they sold--a buying spree that nearly doubled 1992's record $52 billion. People who have never folded a baht or a ringgit are now counting on securities traded in those currencies to help finance retirements and tuition bills. <p>Will the global treasure hunt pay off? <p>It certainly has been a bonanza for mutual funds that specialize in foreign markets; they've been the fastest-growing segment of the fund industry. A year ago, Twentieth Century International had $223 million in net assets. Today it manages $950 million. In the same time period, Templeton Developing Markets shot from $180 million under management to $1.4 billion. Morningstar, the Chicago-based <p>fund-research firm, now lists 185 international equities funds, up from 100 three years ago.<p>This represents a major change in the way Americans invest. "Ten years ago international investing didn't even show up in statistics on asset allocation by Americans; there wasn't even enough to round it to 1 percent," says Mark Riepe, a vice president with Ibbotson Associates, an investment-research firm in Chicago. "Now, almost 10 percent of American institutional portfolios are invested internationally."<p>Investors quick to jump on the bandwagon have done well. The U.S. markets didn't exactly have a bad year--the Dow Jones Industrials were up 13.7 percent in 1993 and the Nasdaq Composite 14.8 percent--but only three of the international market indices tracked by Morgan Stanley Capital International failed to leave the domestic stock exchanges in the dust. In local currencies, the Hong Kong market was up 110 percent in 1993, the Jakarta exchange up 107 percent, Chile up 48 percent, and Taiwan up 91 percent. The stock markets in Paris, Brussels, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Manila all set records as the year came to an end.<p>For many investors, the game for 1994 involves guessing which foreign markets will soar and which will tank. Is it time to take those profits out of Hong Kong and invest them in Mexico City?<p>Some of the best investment minds of Wall Street have applied themselves to this question. Optimists like Nimrod Fachler of Paine Webber still point to Mexico, Chile, and Argentina, where deregulation and privatization have unchained the economies, he believes. He also expects continued strength in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines. He's not as excited about Europe, and he'd avoid Japan: "Japan's prices came down, but earnings came down, too."<p>More pessimistic pundits such as <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a>'s Barton Biggs find recommendations like those dangerous. In November, Malaysia's market was trading at nearly four times the book value of the assets of the companies on the exchange, and Hong Kong's was at nearly three times book value. "By contrast, the average for Europe is 2.03 and the U.S. is at 2.64," Biggs told his clients. "I want to be in Asia for the long run, but things have gone too far too fast and are too frothy. If the markets keep rising vertically, I will sell some more. If they correct and calm down, I will go back in. Buy low, sell high." <p>In early January, the hot Asian markets took exactly the kind of dive Biggs had looked for. By January 10, Hong Kong had fallen 9.8 percent from its record high. Thailand was off 10.2 percent; Malaysia 9.3 percent, the Philippines 4.5 percent, and Singapore 4.3 percent. Of course, by Friday, January 14, these markets had rebounded. Hong Kong's market index was up 5.9 percent on that day alone.<p>Boil down all of this advice, either bull or bear, and it sounds suspiciously like a recipe for international market timing--speculating on short-term price movements. Many people who would never try to time the U.S. markets and who would describe themselves as long-term, patient investors are now engaged in frantic attempts to discover the next hot international market (what about China's Shenzhen exchange?) and then to sell before the peak (is it time to dump that Peruvian portfolio?).<p>William McBride, international editor at Lipper Analytical Services, notes that 6 of the 20 best-performing international funds in 1993 invested chiefly in Asia and in Latin America. This is dangerous territory--history shows that these markets are incredibly volatile and the politics of the regions hardly qualify as stable.  Yet investors are venturing in anyway because of the lure of sky-high returns. So what if some countries in these areas ordinarily make the evening news only because of a military coup or a debt default? At least that's what they seem to be saying. In Latin America, the hot investment is Brady Bonds: bank paper secured by Mexican debt that no one used to want, now repackaged and securitized to finance golden years of U.S. retirees. Investors who wouldn't dream of buying property in a fringe neighborhood are investing through mutual funds in Hong Kong real estate that will shortly become part of the People's Republic.<p>Some of the most aggressive investors are so desperate to be in the right market that they have helped bid single-country funds up to astounding prices. On January 3, the India Growth Fund sold at a 49 percent premium above the value of the stocks held by the fund. Likewise, the China Fund sold at a 40 percent premium and the Singapore Fund at a 32 percent premium, just to mention a few. Investors, it seems, were willing to pay that much extra just to get into these hot markets.<p>There are sound reasons to invest on the international stage, but this kind of speculative frenzy isn't one of them. This is especially true right now. Why? Because many of these markets have shot upwards simply in reaction to the incoming flood of dollars from U.S. investors--and not as a result of underlying economic factors. During the past year U.S. investors shoveled more than $1 billion a week into markets in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and other parts of what used to be called the third world, according to Morgan Stanley. With that kind of money pouring in so fast, it would be difficult for any market not to move up. Stock pickers on Mexico's Bolsa de Valores have a mere 200 listed issues to choose from. Hong Kong only lists 479 stocks; the Hang Seng index tracks 33 of them, a third of which are real estate firms, which tend to be highly speculative.<p>All this overexcitement is obscuring the soundest and most compelling reason to invest outside the United States: to increase diversification, reducing risk and thus earning a superior long-term return. This has nothing to do with speculation or greed or global stock fever but is instead a prudent and effective strategy for building a solid portfolio.<p>It's the same principle taught in Investing 101: Purchase a basket of stocks just in case one of your Snapples or Boston Chickens turns out to be a Crazy Eddie or a Leslie Fay. Sensible international investing takes this strategy a step further, providing a hedge against the price volatility of the entire U.S. marketplace. In this way, global investment can improve a portfolio's return with no increase--or even a reduction--in market risk. The shrinkage in market risk comes from the tendency of national markets to move in different directions; when the U.S.'s Dow Jones Industrial Average soars, Japan's Nikkei may sink, as the experience of the past few years demonstrates. <p>In fact, academics and others have shown that, over time, portfolios with a proper mix of overseas investments invariably outperform those with no foreign exposure. The curve shown in "The International Premium" shows how international diversification would have improved returns during the ten years ended on December 31, 1992. During that decade, according to research by the Frank Russell Co., a global-assets consultant to institutional investors, a portfolio of 100 percent U.S. equities would have earned a little more than 16 percent annually. Moving to a portfolio with 80 percent U.S. equities and 20 percent foreign stocks (following  Morgan Stanley's Europe, Australia, and Far East index) would have increased the return by about 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage points a year. That move would also have lowered the risk  in the portfolio. Currently, the Investment Company Institute reports that just 9.5 percent of all the money that U.S. investors have poured into mutual funds is in either international or global equity, or global bond funds. With that in mind, the actions of American portfolio managers and the investors who hire them look less like bold moves than frantic compensation for past sins of omission.<p>The secret to global investing is to incorporate it into a broader, long-term strategy--and to move cautiously. "You have to be skeptical," says Roger G. Ibbotson, a Yale finance professor and coauthor of Global Investing: The Professional's Guide to World Capital Markets. Ibbotson urges investors to read marketing pitches for foreign funds with a skeptical eye, especially if they stress performance. "International isn't going to add performance to a portfolio every year," says Ibbotson. "Some years it will detract from performance." <p>Because diversification should be the primary goal, the precise method for constructing an international portfolio isn't especially important. To determine how large a role international investments should play, an investor can follow one of several rules of thumb. For example, someone who wanted true global diversification could structure a portfolio so that it accumulates foreign securities in proportion to the home countries' shares of global market capitalization. As the world-market-capitalization model in "Leaving Most of the World on the Table" shows, the U.S. represented 43 percent of the global equity market in 1992 and Japan 25 percent, so a portfolio could mirror that breakdown.<p>Most people, however--and certainly most Americans--feel more comfortable keeping a disproportionate share of their investments closer to home. Professor Albert Fredman of California State University at Fullerton recommends allocating 10 percent to 40 percent of a portfolio to foreign holdings. He also suggests balancing the debt and equity portions of foreign investments just as an investor would in the domestic markets: more equity for the young, more fixed-income debt for the old.<p>There are numerous strategies for constructing a balanced portfolio. A passive investor can simply buy a global mutual fund, a type of fund that invests in all the world's markets, and leave the asset allocation to a professional manager. A more adventurous investor can mix an international with a domestic fund or combine index funds for the U.S., Europe, and the Pacific. Blending single-country funds is yet another option. Of all the methods available, the only one that may be beyond the research capabilities of the average investor is constructing a sound portfolio of international stocks. Yet even here, American depositary receipts make  stock picking accessible. ADRs are certificates that trade on U.S. exchanges and represent the shares of foreign companies. <p>The route an investor ultimately chooses isn't especially important. But it is crucial to know that each technique requires a slightly different balancing act to achieve the proper mixture of risk and reward. Each strategy also comes with potential pitfalls for the uninformed.<p>Take index funds, for example, a quick and inexpensive way to achieve global diversification. Index managers assemble a portfolio designed to match the performance of a selected market index. Portfolio turnover, brokerage commissions, and management fees are minimal. Vanguard and a few other portfolio managers offer a variety of no-load international index funds.<p>Over a long period, index funds should outperform most actively managed funds. They trade less and therefore incur fewer transaction costs as managers buy and sell--costs that investors don't have to pay. With an index fund, says Ibbotson, "you'll beat half the money managers or more after some costs, even if the markets are not efficient, as long as the index is appropriately defined." <p>But that's easier said than done. Indexing in the international market produces wide anomalies. In the U.S., investors basically only have to figure out what size company they want to track. They can choose among indexes that move with the big stocks of the S&P 500, the small-capitalization stocks of the Russell 2000, and almost anything in between. The international situation is more complex. The first question an international indexer must ask is: What mix of national markets do I want to track?<p>For most U.S. investors, the foreign benchmark remains Morgan Stanley's Europe, Australia and Far East (EAFE) index. EAFE uses a weighted index to try to accurately mirror the entire universe of public companies in those regions, based on their size. Because Japan is so dominant in Asia, however, this means the Asia portion of the index pretty much does whatever the Japanese stock market does. Three years ago, in fact, Japanese stocks accounted for 90 percent of Far East market capitalization. The EAFE index was correspondingly heavy in Japanese stocks just prior to the big collapse in the Tokyo market.<p>EAFE indexers, locked into Japan, learned the downside of their strategy as the Nikkei plunged from close to Y30,000 to below Y16,000. Active fund managers, meanwhile, sensed that the Japanese market was headed for a major correction, and they pulled out. But it wasn't only the actively managed funds that beat EAFE. Other indexes that either underweight or eliminate Japan also outperformed it--at least until 1993, when a rally in the Japanese market pushed index funds that follow the EAFE weighting toward the front of the pack again. <p>To smooth out the roller-coaster rides, investors can combine several indexes in their portfolio or even use a dual strategy that mixes indexed funds with funds that are actively managed by professionals. That's what many institutional investors do. They index the core of their portfolio and actively manage the rest in an attempt to get the best of both worlds. An individual investor can do the same thing or even improve on the strategy by using index funds in efficient markets (the U.S. and Europe) and actively managed funds in less efficient markets (Asia and Latin America.)<p>Another option: Leave these kind of regional-asset-allocation decisions to the pros by investing in a broadly defined global or international fund. Global funds put money anywhere in the world--in both U.S. and foreign markets. International funds invest everywhere but the U.S. (For a list of top performers in each category, see "The Best Picks for Building an International Portfolio.")<p>Country and regional mutual funds that stick to single national or multinational markets provide another strategic option for investors. Wall Street was busy pumping out new single-country funds in 1993. Late December brought the Pakistan Investment Fund from Morgan Stanley Asset Management, for example. The pattern seems likely to continue this year.<p>Most investors should use single-country funds only as the capstone of a well-rounded international portfolio, if at all. And remember two rules: Don't buy at the initial public offering (IPO), and don't pay a historically unreasonable premium. Most single-country funds are set up as closed-end funds that trade like stock on one of the U.S. exchanges. Like a stock, when the issue first comes out, the underwriters take a commission--deducted from the proceeds of the offering. That means an investor who buys at the IPO for $20 actually gets less than $20 in investable assets. Also, because closed-end funds issue only a limited number of shares, the price is subject to swings in investor demand--not just the value of the underlying stocks in the portfolio. A hot single-country fund can trade at a price far above its net asset value. That premium to the net asset value of the fund rises and falls. Savvy investors know that over time it fluctuates within a fairly well-established range. They buy when the premium is near the low end of the range (or when the fund actually trades at a discount to net asset value) and sell when the premium is near a peak. <p>For people who like to pick individual stocks, American depositary receipts provide a crack at global citizenship. ADRs represent ownership of corporate securities held in American banks under agreements with foreign securities issuers or with U.S. securities firms. While many ADRs of larger companies are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and exchange-listed, others are exempt from registration and traded only in the over-the-counter "pink sheet" market. Thorough research is a must--some companies have more than one class of ADR, and the different classes may represent different numbers of foreign shares.<p>In either case, for individual investors it's easier and less expensive to acquire ADRs in the United States than the underlying shares in a foreign market. ADRs trade at a dollar price that closely reflects the home-market price of the underlying securities at prevailing exchange rates. Most brokers won't accept orders under $25,000 for transactions on a foreign exchange. Foreign clearing and custodial arrangements are generally slower and more cumbersome than this country's.<p>Theoretically, at least, investing in an actively managed fund ought to provide some protection against a risk that even experienced domestic investors don't think about: currency fluctuation. But things don't always work out that way. <p>In 1992, the managers of short-term global-income funds sought above-market returns by buying high-coupon Italian and Spanish bonds. At the same time, they shorted the French franc and the German mark. These funds took a bath when European governments revalued their currencies en masse after the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, the continent-wide effort to fix rates of exchange between Europe's currencies, collapsed.<p>In 1993, investors saw the happier side of currency risk when the Japanese yen strengthened against the dollar and more than doubled the return for U.S. investors who had their money in Japan--from a 12 percent gain to a currency-adjusted increase of 26 percent. <p>Unfortunately, economists don't agree on why and how currency rates change. There's general consensus that long-term currency rates reflect fundamental economic realities like competitiveness. That has probably been the force that has driven the yen upward against the dollar for over a decade.<p>But over shorter periods, the currency market is full of unexplained anomalies and inefficiencies--both opportunities for profit and loss. For some big institutional investors, currency trading that seeks to capture these profits has become an investment activity all its own. About $650 billion changes hands every day in the currency markets. Currency is the biggest single investment in the world.<p>This, however, is an arena for big players with big computers and lots of information. Although individual investors can take positions in currencies through options traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, doing so would be a lot like using a Yugo to play chicken with a Freightliner.<p>Individuals should look at currency closely, though, when picking a mutual fund. Know that, especially for regional or single country funds, great performance from currency gains isn't likely to be repeated over time. In the long run most academic studies show that currency differences will wash out--what an investor, rather than a trader, makes one year will be lost in another. Long-term investors should look for appreciation in the value of underlying securities that a fund holds.<p>It's also wise to read a fund's prospectus to find out about its strategy for currency hedging. The ideal fund manager knows how to use all the tools of Wall Street to lock in currency gains--or at least to avoid really big losses. Be as wary of funds that hedge against all currency risks as of those that don't take any precautions for currency gyrations. U.S. investors in Japan have no reason to praise fund managers who hedged away half their gain in 1993.<p>Before revamping a portfolio to add more of a global punch, investors also need to know something else: How much international exposure do they already have? Some people are getting foreign risk without even knowing it. The Fidelity Capital Appreciation Fund, for instance, has about 49 percent of its portfolio in international securities, and it's hardly the only fund with a next-door name and large overseas holdings. "An increasing number of funds you think of as domestic have significant exposure to foreign stocks," says Amy Arnott, an analyst at Morningstar, which recently began publishing the foreign portfolio exposure of each fund it rates. (See "International Funds in Disguise" for ten big domestic funds with high foreign exposure.)<p>At the moment, with many foreign markets already scrambling to digest an influx of Yankee capital, it makes sense to move cautiously, regardless of the strategy an investor chooses. Remember, international investing is a practice that works best over the long term. There's no reason to rush in right now if the price isn't right. And there's even less reason to buy a market near its top. Smart investors worry as much about getting out as they do about buying in.<p>Says Eileen Sanders, a Morningstar analyst who covers emerging-market funds: "Fund managers are all convinced that they can get out, but I am a bit concerned. If a problem in any of these countries causes people to rush in and sell, there would be an avalanche effect." The entire Indian stock market has a capitalization of just $72 billion, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International. How many buyers would throng the Indian market in a downdraft? In comparison, <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> alone has a market capitalization of approximately $20 billion.<p>A correction in the gassiest foreign markets is bound to occur. It always does. That will burn the speculators and make the Johnny-come-latelies counting on 50 percent annual returns sour on the international markets. Long-term investors will have a very different reaction. They understand that international diversification is a sound and attractive strategy that provides solid gains over time. And they also understand that there's no reward for acting in haste.<p>Gregory Millman is writing a book on the international financial markets for the Free Press.<p>
Portfolios perform better if they include international investments. Here's how to join in the action--without getting burned.<p>
Canvassing The Globe For Attractive Bonds<p>
 Investors who want to make serious money in bonds are looking overseas. A big reason for this is that prospects for hefty returns have dwindled in U.S. markets. "It's going to be hard to make more than the coupon" domestically in 1994, says Barbara Kenworthy, portfolio manager for the fixed-income funds at Dreyfus Corp. The outlook for the U.S. market, in fact, isn't especially bright in either of the two ways that bond investors can profit.<p>In 1993, U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds offered total returns--interest plus capital gains from rising bond prices--of 12.4 percent. Investors in intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds took home 8.4 percent. This year, however, Wall Street's bond mavens are predicting much lower returns. And if the Federal Reserve raises rates, bond prices could even tumble.<p>Foreign bonds, though, still give investors a shot at reaping capital gains as well as higher yields. In Europe, rates are still coming down, although not as rapidly as institutional money managers thought they would. The German Bundesbank has been hesitant to cut rates quickly for fear of igniting runaway inflation. Nevertheless, the continued stagnation of the German economy has left it with little choice but to continue pruning. When this happens, the central banks of France and England are able to join in and lower rates as well. Most international bond fund managers believe that the Bundesbank will cut rates further in 1994. "Assuming European interest rates continue to decline, this could be a very attractive area," says Amy Arnott, a mutual fund analyst with Morningstar.<p>Still, Europe has been a bit of a disappointment. "Nine of ten portfolio managers expected Germany to cut rates faster," says Kenworthy. She expects that investors will get some capital appreciation in Europe in 1994, but "you'll be lucky to earn 100 to 300 basis points above the coupon." And that 8 percent to 10 percent total return will only materialize for investors who have hedged against a strengthening dollar, she adds.<p>Investors are likely to find the prospects for higher returns better in Latin America, though the risks are larger, too. Here falling interest rates are less important as a driving force than improving credit ratings for countries such as Mexico and Argentina. Better credit increases investor confidence and raises demand for bonds. The word on Wall Street is that the two big U.S. bond-rating houses will upgrade Mexican government debt to investment grade this year. At least that's the expectation. If it proves true, then big institutional investors will move in--especially the ones precluded from buying debt rated below investment grade. That, in turn, should expand the market, drive down interest rates, and drive up bond prices. If it all works out, investors could see 15 percent to 17 percent total returns from Mexican bonds in 1994. On the other hand, another uprising like the one in Chiapas, a decline in the peso, or an acceleration of inflation could demolish the fairy tale.<p>But why end the hunt with Mexico? "The search for yield has gone in successive stages to ever more exotic investments," says Paul Darosa, president of Eastbridge Capital Management in New York. Forget about Brazil, however, even with its promise of juicy 20 percent yields. The country just impeached its president, its national deficit is out of control, and the political situation is both unstable and unpredictable. Also steer clear of Nigeria. This nation is to corruption what France is to cooking. <p>What about Poland? It's obviously on its way to reform. Yet it remains risky enough to offer attractive returns. John Purcell, a managing director at Salomon Brothers in New York, notes that Poland is now putting the finishing touches on a plan to repackage its dollar-denominated bank debts as bonds with a U.S. guarantee. "Poland has a good credit trajectory, moving solidly to investment grade within a couple of years," says Purcell. <p>For the squeamish, it probably makes the most sense to sit back and accept less bang for the buck in the U.S. Those a little more daring can try Europe or Mexico. Just know that the truly intrepid are already hard at work trying to figure out how to hedge Polish zlotys.     --G.M.<p><p>U.S. investors ignore most of the world when they construct domestic-only portfolios. The U.S. equity market makes up roughly only 40 percent of the total. That other 60 percent includes the big story for the next decade: Growth in the emerging world is projected to far outstrip that in even the healthiest first-world countries.<p> <p><p>

Asians aren't becoming U.S.-style consumers as they get richer - and that spells trouble for the region's economic miracle.<p>By Walter Mead<p>Can Asia keep growing? To anyone who has walked through Tokyo's fashionable Roppongi district late at night, the question seems almost perverse. Wealth glitters everywhere: draped on the frames of club-goers dressed in clothes that yesterday graced the runways of Paris and Milan, conspicuously displayed in the limos and status cars stacked at the curb, flaunted in the prices on the menus. This seems the future of Asia--a prosperity that has already spread to the streets of the Four Tigers of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore and is now promised by the televisions of the rural villages of China and the frantic rush-hour traffic that chokes Bangkok. <p>But economics isn't known as the dismal science for nothing. All good things come to an end, and the Asian miracle may be running into trouble with consequences both for those U.S. investors who have joined the rush to invest overseas and for everyone whose daily bread depends on the continued health of the world's economy. The next great economic slowdown may result not from some unpredictable crash or some modern Smoots and Hawleys erecting tariff barriers that send the world into another Great Depression. No, the greatest threat to continued economic growth, in Asia especially, is an impending global shortage of lazy consumers.<p>This isn't the conventional wisdom, of course. East Asia today is the most dynamic economic success story in the world--and perhaps in world history. The eight Asian economies labeled "dynamic" by the World Bank (Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Malaysia, and Thailand) have seen their collective gross domestic product rise from $922 billion in 1971 to $3.43 trillion 20 years later (in constant dollars). To put it another way, in 1971 the combined size of these eight economies was just 33 percent of the U.S. economy. Twenty years later they had reached 76 percent. At this rate, the eight will equal the size of the U.S. economy in 2002.<p>The few naysayers willing to cast doubt on the East Asian economic miracle almost all focus on the possibility that such rapid growth will cause the region's economies to overheat. Construction companies won't be able to build new roads, airports, and harbor facilities fast enough to handle new demand, for example. Today, telephone companies can't keep up with the desire for new lines; governments can't install new sewer and power lines fast enough to meet the needs of booming cities. Anyone who has experienced the traffic and air pollution of Taiwan's capital city, Taipei, knows that these worries are grounded in fact, but most of the governments in the region are moving vigorously to improve their infrastructures. <p>The other standard worry about Asia concentrates on its politics. Asia's economies may be dynamic, but its politics are a mess, to put it charitably. North Korea is an unstable, paranoid Communist holdout trying to build an atomic bomb amid the ruins of its collapsing economy. China's central government risks losing its grip on its restive provinces, and the ruling Communist party depends for its legitimacy on a worn-out ideology in which nobody believes. South Korea has a chip on its shoulder as the result of Japanese racism and imperialism. Japan is an economic giant but a political dwarf; the country has never faced up to its crimes against its neighbors during World War II, and it has no idea how to act in the post-cold-war world. Taiwan is legally a rebellious Chinese province; Hong Kong is a colony soon to revert to Chinese control under terrifyingly murky circumstances.<p>But neither explosive politics nor overburdened infrastructures are the true reasons to doubt that Asia will tread the straight line marked by current trends into the indefinite future. No, the real fly in the Orient is exactly the export-led strategy that has brought unprecedented growth to this region.<p>This model has succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of the Japanese, Taiwanese, and Korean bureaucrats who launched it a generation ago. The efficient, low-cost production of increasingly sophisticated manufactured goods for international markets has made much of East Asia rich. The thrifty habits of East Asian workers and businessmen--often reinforced by government policies--have generated the funds needed for new investments, and consistently low government spending keeps taxes down. <p>Asia's growth has been built upon rapid increases in trade with foreigners--and even more rapid growth in trade surpluses with those commercial partners. The $343 billion of U.S.-Asian trade in 1992 included $128 billion in U.S. exports to Asia--and $215 billion in exports from Asia to the United States, a trade surplus for Asia of $87 billion. The trade balance between Asia and the European Community was similar: exports of $96 billion to Asia and imports of $153 billion. <p>Twenty years ago trade surpluses weren't much of a problem. At that time, only a handful of Asian countries had embraced export-oriented development strategies, and with the exception of Japan, most of them were small. Their economic success had little effect beyond their own borders, and the handful of "early exporters" could enjoy a free ride in a healthy global economy. <p>Free rides are getting harder to find. As more and larger countries embraced an export-oriented development strategy, Asia's success began to change the domestic economies of its North American and European markets. Manufacturing employment in Western Europe and North America peaked in the early 1970s and began to sink; so did real wages in the United States.<p>The rise of protectionist sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic has been one response. But the current rhetorical war between the trade Neanderthals in the West--who want to return the world to an era of trade wars and costly protectionism--and the legions of free trade has failed to address the economic facts at the root of the current situation. Simply put, the Asian economies as they grow richer are showing few signs of becoming like the high-consumption, low-savings consumer economies that characterize the Atlantic countries. The Asians' massive trade surpluses are not disappearing as these economies "mature." <p>Everyone agrees that the export-led economic success of East Asia is ultimately unsustainable. It comes down to math. In 1992, Taiwan had a trade surplus with the United States of roughly $9.4 billion. With 20.7 million people, this works out to a per capita trade surplus of $454. Fair enough. But what worked for Taiwan won't work for the rest of Asia. If the other Asian tigers and wanna-be tigers--Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, for example--achieved the same success, our trade deficit with Asia would be more than $1.1 trillion. <p>This can't happen. The U.S. and the rest of the developed West aren't rich enough to buy all these products while selling Asian economies so much less. In the long run, the world's exporters cannot grow faster than the world's importers. Some of Asia's exporters are already well aware of this fact. Japan, the lead case, can lay its current economic problems at the feet of its own export success. Its persistent trade surpluses have driven up the value of the yen, and its companies face a slowly growing world already awash in Walkmans and CD players. <p>The way out of this box was supposed to be apparent by now. Economists in Japan, Singapore, and Korea have been talking about it for years. If Asia is to continue to grow, they said, it will have to shift to growth led by domestic demand. Increasingly affluent Asian consumers will provide the huge markets that Asia's economic growth needs. Asian wages will rise, and its tightfisted governments will shell out more money for basic services like social security. Industrious, thrifty Asia, in other words, will become more like slothful, consumption-mad America. <p>But this transition is nowhere to be seen. Japan is worried about the hollowing out of its industrial base and is afraid to adopt policy changes that would lower the savings rate and increase consumer purchasing. The Japanese savings rate (gross national savings as a percentage of gross national product) was 32.8 percent in 1975; in 1991 it was 34 percent. Meanwhile, in the U.S. the rate was 18.2 percent in 1975 and 14.7 percent in 1991. Find any convergence there?<p>None of the efficient bureaucracies that have guided economic growth in East Asia wants to be the first to step off the merry-go-round. Korea and Singapore, for example, had bad experiences when they tried to raise wages and shift development strategies. Industry reacted by moving from these countries to cheaper, more "Asian" economies where wages and regulations were still comfortably low. <p>Since the citizens of the Asian economies show no signs of becoming Western-style consumers, the governments of the West have begun to adopt policies designed to cut back on consumption and raise the savings rate in their own countries. The United States is trying to reduce its budget deficit and raise the national savings rate; in Europe most policy makers now believe that the key to industrial competitiveness lies in lower wages and decreased social spending. These policies may or may not make good short-term sense in the countries where they are adopted, but they certainly exacerbate the problem facing the world's export-oriented economies. <p>Two hundred and fifty years ago, British nobleman Bernard de Mandeville wrote a shocking poem called "The Fable of the Bees." This poem, which greatly influenced Adam Smith, told the story of a hive of bees that decided to get rid of the lazy drones--bees that didn't work but lived in luxury. Like their human counterparts, they rode in carriages, dressed in silk, and spent their time at banquets and balls. One day the worker bees drove the drones out--only to face a ruinous depression. Without drones, all the carriage makers, horse breeders, silk spinners, caterers, wine makers, and musicians were ruined. The depression spread and the bees starved. <p>"Virtuous" economic policies like thrift and hard work require "vicious" policies of consumption. If Asia's tigers are to continue to grow, they must learn the lesson of the bees. Until they do, Asia's political and economic prospects will remain under a cloud, and the world's economy faces an uncertain future. <p>Walter Mead is a senior counselor at the World Policy Institute at the New School in New York City.<p> <p><p>

Without cold war paranoia to fuel the drive for innovation, now is the time to look for low-tech opportunities.<p>By Leo Dworsky<p>In 1956, soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev looked the American people in the eye and declared: "Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you." It is easy enough to say now that this was a lot of hot air, but at the height of the cold war, this kind of bravado made a lot of people nervous, especially when, the next year, the Soviets launched the satellite Sputnik and began the space race in earnest.<p>Sputnik caught the United States off guard, but a combination of surprise, fear, and good old American ingenuity soon galvanized the country. The scientists and entrepreneurs of Route 128 in Massachusetts took wing, as did their counterparts in California's Silicon Valley, and elsewhere around the nation. Semiconductors, particle accelerators, rockets, and electronic gadgets of all kinds began to take shape, aided by a sharp increase in government research spending for defense and space.<p>Moreover, Wall Street soon took notice, and the great bull market in American high technology was on, continuing with appropriate ebbs and flows ever since. Perhaps not surprisingly, some of the first technology companies out of the gate--notably <a name="NYSE:TXN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11462"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Texas Instruments</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a>--have remained market leaders to the present day, leading the first stage of the bull market in 1957-1962 and its most recent phase, 1991-1993. <p>But an interesting thing has happened on the way to the future. The game has changed, with more than a hint that, broadly speaking, investment in technology has had its best innings for a while. The first hints of a technology slowdown came late last year just as speculation on the future of technology was reaching its zenith. <p>Ironically, one hint of a slowdown in American technology may have come from the former Soviet Union. Last October, an outfit called MIGS etc. placed an advertisement in the Wall Street Journal and other leading newspapers. It read, "Fly a MiG-29 at Mach 2.5 in Moscow." The company offers military flight packages and even a two-day "Military Adventure Program" with tanks and planes in St. Petersburg. For $15,000, American tourists can "experience the very best in Russian armaments," even a staged dogfight for $90,000.<p>What is going on here? Tourism and entrepreneurship aside, I read this new business as the final capitulation of the former Soviet Union, the technological shoe dropping four years after the political shoe (the fall of the Berlin Wall). If the great bull market in American technology began in 1957 in response to the launching of Sputnik, isn't it possible that the bull market in technology ended with the final surrender of Soviet military technology for the pleasure of American tourists? After all, a major impetus to government spending on technology--the Soviet threat--is mostly gone; and with it much of the potential for commercial spinoff from that spending. Note that, already, the superconducting Supercollider has been canceled and that spending for the Space Station has been reduced. Thus, a major force in the technology bull market is waning at the very moment rhetoric and expectations for the future of technology have been at their peak. <p>What about the private sector? In the very week the MIGS ads ran, we heard an important voice on the subject of consumer technology in the person of Richard L. Sharp, CEO of <a name="NYSE:CC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10343"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Circuit City Stores</b></a>, the country's leading retailer of consumer electronics. Late last October, Sharp gave an interview to the New York Times, headlined, circuit city pins growth on sales of used cars. The gist of the interview was that Circuit City had recently created Carmax, a sprawling used-car dealership in Richmond, Virginia, designed as the prototype for a foray into the used-car market. Sharp told the Times that Carmax was only created as a hedge against an aging consumer electronics and appliance market until a new wave of technology comes along. He added that high-resolution television is in the future, but that could take years. <p>Circuit City has been a brilliantly managed company for many years, closely attuned to the consumer-electronics marketplace. When Circuit City speaks (and acts), the rest of us should probably listen. Used cars may or may not turn out to be a good business for the company. But whatever the future of used cars, they are a long way from high tech. If Circuit City is preparing for a slowdown in consumer technology, perhaps investors would do well to follow their cue.<p>I am not suggesting that all growth in technology is over. After all, we still have the "information highway" and the "wireless revolution" and, if nothing else, the fertile mind and great energy of Bill Gates, et al. But I do mean to suggest that the broad-based boom--civilian and governmental--is waning, and with it the investment bull market that has been with us for many years. If this is true, investment money will move on. What is bad for technology may be good for other, more prosaic corners of the marketplace. The trend toward leading cyclicals that began two years ago will continue. Autos, rails, construction equipment, and building materials have already done well, but what about forest products, aluminum, or truckers, among others?<p>Whatever the complexion of this year's stock market, technology is probably out, overbought in last year's speculative binge and due for a long cooling-off period. We will see a few winners for sure, but they will be balanced by many disappointments--too little earnings at too high a price. If investors can adjust to this new reality, they are probably one major step toward investment success in the mid-1990s. <a name="NYSE:BEL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10197"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bell Atlantic</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, in offering tens of billions of dollars last year for Tele-Communications, Inc. and McCaw Cellular Communications, probably capped the boom in technology. The contrary opinion may be to go low tech for awhile, like Circuit City Stores.<p>Leo Dworsky is an editor-at-large for Worth.

						By Pamela J. Black<p>Seeking income or a way to diversify a portfolio? Consider mutual funds that invest in real-estate investment trusts, or REITs. While stocks are fully valued, REITs, which are bundles of managed properties such as shopping malls, are cheap on a relative and absolute basis. Their average yield is now 7.4 percent. Just as important, the total returns on REITs show little correlation with stocks or bonds -- a plus for people seeking investments that zig when the market zags.  <p><p><p>

						For investment newsletters, the annual performance rankings from Hulbert Financial Digest are the Grammys, Oscars, and Emmys all rolled into one. Editor Mark Hulbert takes pains to point out that one-year performance is an unreliable predictor of long-term results. For example, this year's top newsletter, Medical Technology Stock Letter, was a big loser in 1994. But the winners of 1995 also include a number of long-term top performers. Among the more venerable are California Technology Stock Letter, which owns a spot among the top-five-performing newsletters for the past ten years, according to Hulbert, and The Prudent Speculator, The Oberweis Report, and OTC Insight, which have beaten the herd over the past eight years.  <p>  <p>

						Is your computer a smarter investor than Warren Buffett or Paul Tudor Jones? Not yet.  <p> By Simson Garfinkel  <p> Warren Buffett is, as everyone knows, an avuncular, rumpled, unpretentious man who is also, in the world of investing, the nearest equivalent to God. Forty years ago he started an investment partnership with $100,000, then bought a small textile firm called <a name="NYSE:BRK.A"></a><b>Berkshire Hathaway</b>. Diligently ferreting out and buying the stocks of companies he judged undervalued, Buffett eventually turned Berkshire Hathaway into a $21 billion company, shares of which trade, as of October 16, 1995, at $29,650. Along the way, he amassed a personal fortune of about $12 billion.   <p> Now meet Warren Buffett's brain. It, too, is modest and unprepossessing--a Digital 486 personal computer that sits on the desk of one David Braverman, an investment officer with Standard & Poor's in New York City. One year ago, Braverman read Robert G. Hagstrom Jr.'s best-seller, The Warren Buffett Way: Investment Strategies ofthe World's Greatest Investor. Hagstrom never met Buffett while writing the book. Instead, he read Berkshire Hathaway's annual reports--with Buffett's famously informal chairman's letters--along with Buffett's speeches and interview transcripts to uncover what had made him so spectacularly successful.   <p> Of course, many have tried to emulate Buffett. "The traditional approach is to buy stocks that Warren has already bought," says Braverman. "My complaint with that strategy is that you are buying things that have already moved up due to his actions." Similarly, Hagstrom's book purported to divulge Buffett's secrets, but "it didn't give me any information on what stocks to buy next."  <p> To get what he wanted, Braverman did what any intrepid programmer would do: He started writing code, turning the investing axiomsin the book into a series of equations that instructed his computer to screen for stocks meeting Buffett's criteria.   <p> "What this does," he says of his creation, "is find stocks that he has not bought but that meet criteria similar to those he buys or that he may even buy in the future.... There is obviously an advantage to this over buying what he has already bought and made money in."  <p> Thirty companies made the grade. Then Braverman tried to out-Buffett Buffett by screening for strong consensus earnings estimates as well. Sixteen firms remained, which Braverman felt were truly undervalued.   <p> "It looks like we are really on to something," says Braverman. He updated the list in July (see "Be Like Buffett"), replacing six stocks with new ones chosen by the computerized screen. Overall, the stocks were up an average of 42 percent through September 30, 1995. The S&P 500 rose by a little more than 21 percent over the same period.   <p> Braverman also tested his model against markets over the past ten years. On July 1 of each year, the computer would buy the stocks that made it through the screen and sell the ones that didn't. Once again, the computer outperformed the S&P 500, though it under performed Buffett over that period. "Over the last six months, we've done better [than Buffett]," Braverman says.  <p> All this, he says, is less a tribute to his software than to Buffett's value style of investing. What's "amazing," he says, is "you can get returns like this just by going back to basics."Or, as the man himself wrote in the 1994 Berkshire Hathaway annual report, "In investing it is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results."   <p> Of course, as Braverman is the first to admit, Buffett does a lot more than apply a formula to determine whether a stockis undervalued. "Buffett has bought and made a substantial amount of money in Capital Cities/ABC," says Braverman. "Capital Cities/ABC has lower margins [net income divided by sales] than most of the stocks that were picked in our screen, yet he bought Capital Cities/ABC. Why? Because he is extremely impressed with the management, and no computer, whether a neural network or a simple stock-picking screen, can necessarily quantify being impressed with [Capital Cities/ABC chairman and CEO] Thomas Murphy."  <p> Or can it? Imagine a computer that would start out each day at midnight, scanning the Tokyo stock market. The system would also scan newspapers and analysts' reports and market data from throughout the industrialized countries, looking for companies that seemed to be performing unusually well. The program--call it E-Buffett--would also read interviews with top corporate management and, through high-quality speech synthesis and a speech-recognition device connected to a telephone, even arrange for its own interviewswith Thomas Murphy about Capital Cities/ABC's merger with Disney. Murphy, incidentally, would never realize that he was schmoozing with a silicon chip, not flesh and blood.  <p> A computer that can understand a language and converse in it is one of the great, elusive goals of the computer discipline called artificial intelligence. It could even be considered the goal of computer science itself. More than 150 years ago, when Charles Babbage, an English mathematician, embarked on his project to build a steam-powered computing machine, his dream was to build a machine that could think. In a letter dated June 21,1833, Lady Augusta Ada Byron, daughter of the poet and, as Babbage's collaborator, the world's first computer programmer, described Babbage's invention as a "thinking machine (for such it seems)."  <p> Alan Turing, the British mathematician who aided the effort to crack the Germans' top-secret Enigma code during World War II and later helped create some of the earliest electronic computers, also said that his ultimate goal was to construct a thinking machine. Indeed, Turing devised a test that scientists still use to determine if a machine is sentient. The Turing test is simple: If you are sitting at a terminal and you cannot tell if the respondent at the other end of the wire is a human or a computer, then the computer program is intelligent.  <p> These are matters that long ago ceased to be solely of academic or philosophical import. Businesses and venture-capital firms have invested many millions of dollars in artificial intelligence. The 1980s, in fact, began a positive AI boom, fueled by advances in three areas of research: knowledge-based systems (formerly called expert systems), neural networks, and genetic algorithms. Each offers ways of systemizing human or human-like intelligence, putting those smarts into a computer, and applying it to real-world problems.  <p> One company that has successfully employed AI technology is Neuron Data, a small software firm in Mountain View, California. Neuron Data makes a program that companies can use to create their own knowledge-based systems.   <p> The company's $5,000 NEXPERT Object package is widely used in the financial world, says Alan Lundberg, the program's product manager. It is also being employed by banks to detect fraud and in emergency medicine to set up effective triage protocols. <p> Such systems are composed of elaborate sets of "if, then" statements, with  special computer programs that make sure the proper onesget executed at the proper time. For example, a knowledge-based system for driving a car might have rules like "if the car needs gas, then look for a gas station" and "if there is a child directly in front of the car, then step on the brake." By repeatedly interviewing people who are familiar with a particular domain of knowledge and collecting a large set of these rules of thumb, a programmer can endow an expert system with almost human-like decision-making capability.  <p> However, knowledge-based systems encounter a problem when applied to trading: In order to build such programs, it's necessary for a "knowledge engineer"--the person who actually writes the expert system--to sit down with a "domain expert"--someone who understands the task that is to be computerized--and come up with each of the hundreds or thousands of "if, then" statements that makeup the rule-based system. This is tedious and time-consuming, but more to the point, in the fast-paced, high-pressure world of financial trading, few of the domain experts--that is, the traders--understand what they are doing well enough to come up with a formal set of rules.   <p> Christine Downton, a partner with London-based Pareto Partners and a former central banker and money manager, went through the process in 1992 when her firm formed a partnership with Hughes Aircraft Co. Hughes AI researchers painstakingly worked their way through Downton's expertise in a number of different markets, creating a global-investment knowledge-based system that can track up to 18 different variables in the currency and fixed-income markets of 12 separate economies. Each of the thousands of rules that constitute the program required a precise and quantifiable definition, even for terms like "high growth," "medium term," and "normal."  <p> Today, Downton's disembodied brain manages $110 million, and Pareto hopes to raise that to $250 million by the end of the year. The program has "outperformed the relevant benchmarks," she says.  <p> So knowledge-based systems have some utility. Unfortunately, like many human experts, they don't learn. They can't respond to changing conditions. And they don't know when they are making a mistake. Finally, says Andrew Lo, a professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management, "Expert systems are only as expert as the [person creating the rules]." And that can be very difficult to assess.   <p> Michael Prietula has spent years studying stock traders and investment bankers. Both a psychologist and a computer scientist, Prietula is a professor at the Center for Accounting Research and Professional Education at the University of Florida at Gainesville. <p> According to Prietula, even big trading firms can't predict who will be a good trader. "I went into a trading house and had about 50 people on the floor. Then I said, 'Where are your superstars? 'There were maybe 3 out of all those 50. And I said, 'Well, how do you trade?' And they said, 'You got to be real careful.' <p> "There is a type of cognition called situated cognition," Prietula says. "A lot of things in the environment contribute to your performance. We just aren't exactly sure about that environment, except that it changes a lot. Somehow the good traders are good at perceiving and adapting to the change."  <p> Of course, learning unwritten rules is fundamental to many human endeavors. It's what learning and thinking are all about. It follows, then, that creating computers that can learn is another element of AI's overarching ambition of replicating human intelligence. <p> Over the past ten years, a relatively simple AI technique for finding rules of thumb and unseen correlations has gained many adherents. Called neural networking, this technique bears little resemblance to the way a human brain works. Indeed, the only networks in most neural systems are complex networks of nonlinear mathematical equations.  <p> Linear relationships are the kind of mathematical rules that most people learn in grade school. Nonlinear relationships, on the other hand, describe things like S curves, normal distributions, and exponential growth. "Warren starts with $100,000, works for ten years, and earns $100 million. Thirty years from now, how much is Warren worth?" If the answer is $400 million, then Warren's work-to-earnings relationship is linear. But if Warren is worth $12 billion, the relationship is definitely nonlinear.   <p> Neural networks do an excellent job of representing complex combinations of nonlinear equations. Even better, thanks to a mathematical technique discovered in the 1980s called back propagation, it's possible to teach a neural network to "learn" a complex relationship between a set of variables--even find relationships humans can't see on their own.  <p> To make a basic neural network, a programmer constructs a series of equations with a few dozen input variables, some nonlinear functions, a few dozen more tuning parameters, and a very small number of outputs. This sounds more abstruse than it is. For instance, a bank might use a neural network to determine the credit-worthiness of a loan applicant. "Inputs" would be values such as the applicant's household income, age, gender, and financial makeup. The "output" might be a single number--the predicted likelihood of the applicant defaulting on the loan. To trainthe network, the bank might subject the system to all of its loan records, hoping that the neural network could learn itsown tuning parameters--its way of figuring the odds--more accurately than a domain expert.  <p> That, at least, is the ideal. Casey Klimasauskas, product manager at Neural Ware, a Pittsburgh firm that makes a neural-network construction kit for personal computers, says it's still   "more an art than a science" to make these programs work effectively. You can't just plug them in.  <p> Neural Ware's product, called Neural Works Predict, is being used to forecast the rate of return on individual stocks and to calculate the amount of risk in a portfolio of stocks and bonds. Klimasauskas estimates that there are perhaps 50 people around the world who are using trainable neural networks for portfolio management.  <p> Another AI technique for picking stocks is being pioneered by Michael de la Maza and Deniz Yuret, two graduate students at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. A couple of years ago, de la Maza and Yuret were sitting around bemoaning the state of artificial-intelligence research. "So we made a list of problems that we could work on to apply AI techniques to the real world," says de la Maza. The two settled on the idea of an autonomous computer program that would learn to make money investing in the market. They code-named their project Redfire.  <p> For the first six months of 1993, de la Maza and Yuret developed a program using the most "gee-whiz" AI technology they could find: genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms create hundreds or thousands of randomly generated computer programs, then tryout each one. Some programs work; most don't. The computer then takes pieces from the successful programs to make new programs, sort of interbreeding them. At the end of a few thousand generations, the resulting programs can work quite well. Frequently it's hard to figure out why.  <p> The beauty of genetic algorithms is that de la Maza and Yuret didn't have to know why. All they had to do was feed their program with the prices at the close of the market. When the program wanted to make a trade, it printed a message on the screen. <p> Once the system was operational, de la Maza and Yuret did a six-month dry run, then put up $10,000 of their own money at the end of 1993. In November 1994 they got a two-paragraph mention in Upside magazine that said Redfire was generating 8 percent monthly returns. This was followed by a brief story in Worth (February 1995), and the calls started coming in. This March, with 14 investors, the two MIT students turned Redfire into a hedge fund in order to avoid SEC reporting regulations. The fund is brokered by Furman Selz of New York.  <p> The two founders are keeping their returns confidential. Dela Maza will only say they are "positive."  <p> Another trader using this sort of AI technology is Brad Lewis, a fund manager at Fidelity Investments with $4.3 billion under management. "I'm running five funds controlled by something that is a form of AI," says Lewis. Until February, the funds were controlled by a neural-network system, but he recently changed over to a new technology that he won't reveal. "It is a pretty heavy-duty form of AI," Lewis says. "The fact that it is still very nonlinear, that's the claim to fame of all of these neuralnets: nonlinearity."  <p> Lewis says that he spends most of his time now looking for new variables to feed into his computer, which clocks in every night at 2 a.m. and finishes by 6 a.m. Occasionally he reviews what the program wants to buy or sell--just to make sure "that nothing strange is coming through." Sometimes he will even overrule the computer. "Usually when I do, it is a mistake," Lewis says. "It seems that way. I am overriding the box a lot less than I used to seven years ago."  <p> One problem with this sort of investing, says Lo at MIT, is that it ignores the factors that drive financial prices. All too often, says Lo, people attempting to do computer-based investing get caught up with their numbers and forget the realities for which those numbers stand.   <p> "Ultimately," says Lo, "the problem of making sound financial investment decisions is not a statistical problem but an economic problem, and although statistical inference and AI technology can add tremendous value, they alone will never provide a complete solution for financial-market participants--at least not until software becomes self-aware."  <p> Of course, there's no mention of nonlinearities or neural nets in Berkshire Hathaway's annual reports. Nor will you find them in the work published by Louis Navellier, editor of MPT Reviewand president of Navellier & Associates. Navellier manages $1.2 billion.  <p> Neural-network technology is "totally worthless," says Navellier. "We've been testing it." The problem, he says, is the time frame." Neural nets might be good for short-term trend followers," but they can't pick up long-term trends.   <p> Navellier is also suspicious about groups like Redfire that are claiming outrageously high earnings. He wants to know the liquidity limit of such technology. While it might be possible to get a 100 percent or 200 percent yearly return on a million dollars, try to run the same strategies with a billion dollars and you'll start to affect the market, rather than making money from it.   <p> There is another big difference between the AI-based trading systems in use today and our hypothetical E-Buffett program. A truly intelligent artificial trader would probably watch TV, listen to the radio, and read the newspaper, like Alexander, the trader in Michael Lewis's book Liar's Poker. When the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, Alexander immediately bought oil and potato futures, correctly surmising that demand for oil would rise with a nuclear power plant suddenly down and that so many potato fields would be contaminated that potato futures would climb.  <p> Indeed, it is possible that in order to mimic Warren Buffett's investment skills, it would be necessary for a computer program to share the man's interest in the Omaha Royals minor-league baseball team. But for most people working on AI investing, things like knowledge, news events, and even institutional memory are just noise--something to be shut out.  <p> Katia Sycara, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, is trying to keep the noise. "Most of the computerized investment strategies are sophisticated analytical techniques for prediction," says Sycara. "What we would like to do is have some more content-based ways, rather than just statistical manipulation." <p> To build that system, Sycara and her students are working with a new kind of AI technology: intelligent, autonomous agents. An agent is a computer program that specializes in a small set of tasks and is linked to a bunch of other agents. The agents can ask questions of one another, send answers, and work with one another toward a common goal. The initial system developed by Sycara will have five main agents: a portfolio-management agent; fundamental-analysis agent; a technical-analysis agent; a financial-news agent; and an analysts'-estimate tracking agent. Eventually there may be dozens of agents, each one running on its own separate computer.  <p> But where do the knowledge and heuristics given to the agents come from? From successful investors--both human and computer. The advantage of using an agent-based approach is that different agents can be built with different kinds of AI technologies--one agent can be built with a neural network, another with genetical gorithms, another using expert systems, and perhaps others using case-based reasoning. The system can then look at new situations as they arise and use the agents that have done well in the past with similar situations.  <p> Sycara's research, incidentally, is funded by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency, the folks who created the ARPANET, precursor to the Internet. The reason: The techniques that she is developing for rapidly evaluating and acting upon incomplete and sometimes contradictory information that arrives in real time are equally applicable to the stockmarket and the battlefield, both of which are forever shrouded in what Clausewitz called "the fog of war."  <p> Whether or not the technical wizards ever reach the Holy Grail of a thinking computer, there is irony in the attempt to clone the minds of old-fashioned investors like Warren Buffett. The awesome calculating power of computers--and the ingenuity of the software creators--is directed at ceaselessly shuffling adeck of investments, acquiring and discarding, looking to maximize returns. Even Standard and Poor's David Braverman each year sells those stocks that no longer meet his program's Buffett criteria.  <p> But that is precisely what Buffett himself warns against in his annual chairman's letter. Speaking for him-self and Berkshire's vice chairman, Charles T. Munger, Buffett writes, "Gin rummymanagerial behavior (discard your least promising business a teach turn) is not our style."   <p>  <p>BE LIKE BUFFETT <p>David Braverman's "Warren Buffett" stock picks  <p> Name Recent Price <p><a name="NYSE:OAK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11108"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oak Industries</b></a> (OAK) $22 <p><a name="NYSE:CA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10383"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>COMPUTER ASSOCIATES</b></a>(CA) 49 <p><a name="NYSE:RGR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14818"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>STURM, RUGER & CO.</b></a>(RGR) 27 <p><a name="NYSE:UST"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11533"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>UST INC.</b></a>  (UST) 30 <p><a name="NYSE:BEN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41922"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Franklin Resources</b></a>  (BEN) 54 <p><a name="NYSE:IGT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13812"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>INTERNATIONAL GAME TECH</b></a>  (IGT) 13 <p><a name="NYSE:PFE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11175"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pfizer</b></a>  (PFE) 61 <p> <a name="NYSE:AMGN"></a><b>AMGEN </b>  (AMGN) 46 <p> <a name="NYSE:GNT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10679"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Green Tree Financial</b></a>  (GNT) 30 <p><a name="NYSE:MU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14116"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MICRON TECHNOLOGY</b></a> (MU) 70 <p><a name="NASD:MEG/A"></a><b>MEDIA GENERAL</b>  (MEG/A) 31 <p><a name="NYSE:LAW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10884"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>LAWTER INTERNATIONAL</b></a> (LAW) 11 <p> <a name="NYSE:AHP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10093"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Home Products</b></a>  (AHP) 88 <p> <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>(INTC)  67 <p> <a name="NYSE:SGP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11326"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Schering-Plough</b></a>  (SGP) 54 <p> <a name="NASD:SKEY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42062"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Softkey Int'l</b></a>  (SKEY) 39  <p> Price as of October 20, 1995.

These stirring tales may amuse traders having a beer after work, but they're positively depressing for college professors. After all, if there's no benefit to a college education (at least on Wall Street), then why pay for one?   <p> That question is driving John O'Brien, an associate professor of accounting and finance at Carnegie Mellon University's Graduate School of Industrial Administration. O'Brien is director of technology at CMU's Center for Financial Analysis and Securities Trading. FAST, in effect, is a cyber-classroom whose purpose "is designed around integrating theory with practice," says O'Brien. "If we teach a concept, then it is immediately applied."   <p> The program gives would-be traders an intimate knowledge of networked computer systems, program trading, and derivatives, and makes them feel at home with the mathematical foundations of market dynamics. O'Brien calls his fledgling market masters "the Cyber Warriors."   <p> The program teaches students to be traders the same way Wall Street does: putting them in front of a terminal and telling them to make money. Of course, since O'Brien is at CMU, the money isn't cash--it's grades. "You earn grade cash," says O'Brien. "Grade cash accumulated over the duration of a course translates into a percentage of their grade. That makes it very real and competitive."  <p> The trading is grouped into a series of projects, some running for a few hours, others running for weeks or an entire semester. Students trade against each other, against traders built with artificial-intelligence technology, and against students at other schools: Copies of the trading room are now running in Japan, England, Hong Kong, Russia, Ukraine, Mexico, Australia, Singapore, and South Korea.  <p> Each project is designed to reveal an important facet of the market. In one project, says O'Brien, students start out with "a very undiversified position, and through trading they can hedge their risks." As the project continues, students get to see how their actions determine the prices of securities in the virtual market. "You can diversify at stupid prices and make yourself worse off, or you can diversify at reasonable prices and make yourself better off," O'Brien says.   <p> Those with access to the Internet can learn more about the FAST program on the World Wide Web. Just point your web browser tohttp://fastweb.gsia.cmu.edu.   <p> --S.G.  <p>  <p>WALL STREET'S HOTTEST HOT ROD  <p> "Now we enter the Boolean time-series con-ditions here," says Dave Hirschfeld, tapping at his keyboard. A three-dimensional shape appears on the screen, blue foothills and valleys mappedagainst a black-and-white grid, with a sizable crater in the middle. "That's the '87 crash," says Hirschfeld, who is head of research for Tudor Investments and president of Tudor Software for the legendary futures trader Paul Tudor Jones. "We can zoom in on that tick by tick if you want," Hirschfeld says as another shape appears. "Here's London"--click--"Tokyo"--click--"Frankfurt."  <p> This is Wall Street's hottest piece of technology. Rivals refer to it as "Tudor in a box"--the brain of Paul Tudor Jones shooting off sparks in a vat. In fact, the system, in development since February 1990, is a highly sophisticated analytical tool that combines approximately 50 data streams, embracing markets from currency to cotton, every 15 minutes, every trading day, back to 1982 and before. "In 20 seconds you can use this to dismiss statements that have a lot of logic to them but no reality,"says Rich Jaycobs, former head of technology for Tudor Investments, as he presses a button and instantly disproves the conventional wisdom that the currency market is unusually volatile this year. <p> Even more dazzling are the analytics that can say in second show to pursue a given strategy with the least risk and the greatest chance of profit. "We all have our views of the world," Jaycobs says. "This tells you what is the cost of your view."   <p> One Tudor employee--who declined to be named--describes the system. "The idea was to model an expert system based on Paul's knowledge and his trades in the market," he says. "The genesis came from the chess program developed at Carnegie Mellon, Deep Thought, which beat chess champion Gary Kasparov. We recruited several Carnegie people. We went to Paul: We reviewed his past trades. And then we'd say, "Okay, here's a market, what would you do?' We'd then take what he did and see if it applied to other markets, and so on."  <p> All futures trading is based on the belief that past performance is predictive--that if 20 times over the past 20 years a Fedrate increase coupled with a rising dollar pushed up the price of coal in Germany, which in turn pushed down the price of German utility stocks, then the same variables, behaving in the sameway, will produce the same result. One might, then, short German utilities.  <p> This illustrates the potential advantage of computerized trading systems over their human counterparts: the ability to instantaneously calculate the effect, on a historical basis, of the innumerable variables--political, environmental, economic, psychological, etc.--that affect the odds of a given trade or investment paying off.   <p> Not everyone agrees with this. As the late Fischer Black, a partner at Goldman, Sachs and one of the fathers of modern optionstrading, told The Economist, "There are things that machines are good at, but trading does not appear to be one of them....The list of factors that matter are changing all the time."  <p> To a limited extent, Peter Borish, who developed the system at Tudor before leaving to found Computer Trading Corp., would agree. "Paul Tudor Jones, Louis Bacon, and the other hedge-fund heads take a big speculative position, but they're actually not risking very much," he says, because they have an extraordinary ability instantly to intuit the likely impact of a given piece of news, or a market move, on the minds of several thousands of their trading peers. This is something that may never be matched by a machine.  <p> Risk and leverage, on the other hand, can be usefully modeled, and applied by the push of a button. "Someone like Paul doesn't make one trade always based on the same things," Borish says."So we tried to break it into subsets, to model different ideas. And if that was successful, you could put different ideas into a portfolio and devise an allocating scheme to weight which ideais a little bit better at which time."  <p>  After that, you have to trust your program's calculations."If someone told me--and believe me, I've heard everything--that the phases of the moon affected the soybean market, I can run a historical data series of new-moon and full-moon soybean prices," says Borish. "If there's any statistical significance to that, and if the risk-reward is there, I'd probably trade off it." <p> --David Samuels  <p><p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> MONEY WANTS TO BE ANONYMOUS <p>And that's just the first rule of a brave new electronic society, says David Chaum, the guru of digital cash. If he has his way, checks and coins will be obsolete and you'll e-mail your kids their allowance.  <p> By Alan Deutschman  <p> I hand the taxi driver the address: the Science Park at Kruislaan 419. She claims to know the street, but as she whisks me away from the historic center of Amsterdam and toward the city's outskirts, I grow suspicious. The dense urban landscape soon gives way to open stretches of high, unruly grass. Here the astonishingly green pasture is like a Dutch postcard: White horses canter through marigolds; water lilies float lazily in a long waterway.  <p> For a while I'm calmed until I realize the waterway isn't a canal, as I had believed. It's a moat. And the driveways across it are guarded by high steel gates.  <p> This forbidding site, I later learn, is where the Dutch conducted atomic research after World War II. Now it is a curious sort of enclave for high tech, where lush foliage obscures various computer centers and a prestigious research institute. Given the heritage of secrecy, it's fitting that this is also home to DigiCash, a company that proposes to make electronic commerce invulnerable to snooping. I am here to meet the company's American founder, a privacy guru named David Chaum.  <p> The taxi passes through an unsightly security gate and pulls up to a cheap-looking building of white brick and glass the science park in its entirety, it seems. I check in and wait, watching a procession of 11 Korean businessmen in narrow ties. Before long a heavyset, fortyish man emerges from the elevator. His straight brown hair is tied in a ponytail, his beard is piebald with patches of white and gray. He wears a button-down shirt and a softly colored silk tie painted with flowers and butterflies the get-up of a Berkeley mathematics whiz who now must dress for the suits.  <p> This is Chaum, the acknowledged intellectual genius in the field of electronic cash. An iconoclastic visionary, he has been working for 15 years on politically charged ideas that could redefine the concept of money for a wired world. Only lately, though, has anyone paid him much mind.  <p> If someone were to make an <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>-style "You Will" advertisement for digital cash, the voice-over might go like this: Ever send money to your kid in college via E-mail? Ever use your cellular phone as a cash machine? Ever keep your loose change on a microchip? You will and the people who'll bring it to you are a ponytailed expatriate and his bunch of Dutch hackers.  <p> Or at least, that's what David Chaum hopes. For years, his prognostications about digital cash seemed like science fiction to hardheaded bankers who believed electronic data could never replace bills and coins on a mass scale. But now that few dare hand out business cards without an Internet address, those same financiers are in a chaotic rush to establish standards for "E-money." An improbable number are coming for advice to a man they once scorned as a hippie with a pie-in-the-sky agenda.  <p> The Korean businessmen, for example, are here to see Chaum. They want to put electronic money on 10 million cards equipped with razor-thin microchips. "Ten million smart cards," Chaum says aloud, blown away by the size of the project. An elegantly tailored Brit idles nearby. His company wants to revamp New York's subway system and Chaum could help him replace turnstiles with sensors that subtract fares directly from commuters' pockets as they surge out to the street.  <p> These are thrilling prospects. Yet as we rise up to DigiCash's bustling suite on the top floor, Chaum looks worn out, even ill. The pace of his life has become hard to handle lately. His barefoot young programmers aren't finished working on new software for DigiCash's trial of E-cash on the Internet software that was supposed to debut the day of my visit. Besides fixing that problem, Chaum must meet an endless stream of people. He can't slow down: The coming months mark his best chance yet to realize his radical vision or to set himself back for years. He pops an allergy pill and wills himself onward.  <p> Although Chaum is a pioneer of E-money, he's best seen these days as a besieged underdog. The list of companies scrambling to trump him is a virtual Who's Who of finance and technology: the major banks, credit card providers such as Visa and MasterCard, and the ubiquitous Bill Gates and <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>. You might think it doesn't much matter who comes out on top: Digital cash, afterall, is digital cash. Who cares about the brand name, as long as merchants accept it? But in fact, the stakes in this battle extend far beyond the banal exigencies of business to touch on politics and even ethics.  <p> Virtually alone among E-money thinkers, Chaum insists on creating anonymity for all transactions building a tamper-proof system that works just as "real" cash always has, from cowrie shells to $100 bills. The key, he says, is this: Without the spender's say-so, no one should be able to trace who paid whom for what, whether a transaction takes place online or in a swipe of a card at a coffee shop. It's a libertarian approach in tune with Chaum's roots in freewheeling communities such as Berkeley and Amsterdam but it is anathema to control freaks like the FBI, the IRS, and corporate information marketers.  <p> Chaum says every digital-cash system but his has the potential to be abused or compromised and the math seems to bear him out. His competitors, however, insist their plans will prove plenty secure in practice. They dismiss Chaum as an incorrigible purist, a brilliant mathematician and innovator whose political views are hindering his chances of success.  <p> Sniffs Magdalena Yesil, vice president of marketing at CyberCash, a rival start-up in California's Silicon Valley: "We're trying to fit into today's world. Chaum is trying to create a new world." <p> Like many in the digital elite, Chaum, an unabashed utopian, does want to create a new world. To him, electronic money is just the first consumer use of an arcane field he hopes will transform society: cryptology, the science of secret codes. In cyberspace, these codes can prove a powerful way of shielding a person's identity or of verifying an identity without giving away extra information. Armed with personal computers and good software, says Chaum, ordinary people will finally have the power to do and say things without being tracked by Big Brother.  <p> As far back as the 1970s, Chaum saw that this type of technology could make for a new era in politics. Besides digital money, codes can enable anonymous electronic voting, cheat-proof tallies where no one could cast more than a single ballot. Congress could allow millions of voters to express their opinion weekly or daily on intervention in Bosnia. Pollsters could measure what doctors think about abortion, verifying that all respondents had M.D.swith out knowing how any particular doctor had voted. Like a more hands-on version of Newt Gingrich, Chaum chats about using computers to create "something more democratic than democracy."  <p> This kind of talk unnerves people and not just those who might be disenfranchised because they don't have access to technology. Throughout his career, Chaum's ideas have faced forceful opposition. At the University of California at Berkeley, for instance, Chaum recalls computer-science professors telling him to forget about electronic voting because "it was wrong to work on any technology motivated by social consequences." His political-science professors also objected, fearing the tyranny of such direct, immediate democracy.  <p> Chaum decided they were mistaken and went on to gain renown in cryptology, publishing numerous papers and receiving patents for his privacy techniques. "Chaum's papers on anonymity really made his name," says Peter Wayner, a Baltimore-based cryptology expert and author of the new book Digital Cash. Still, Chaum continued to confront antipathy from groups that might have seemed to be his natural allies. Bankers found his digital-cash message too futuristic and didn't see why they should promote a benefit their customers didn't know could be provided.  <p> Many fellow cryptologists shrank from considering the political implications of their work, preferring to concentrate on intellectual puzzle-solving. And privacy advocates in the U.S. and Europe were "at least uninterested and in many cases hostile" when Chaum lobbied their support. Many insisted that technology is no match for the law when protecting civil liberties.  <p> In 1995, as commerce flows into cyberspace, the evidence suggests that Chaum was simply ahead of his time. A recent survey found 70 percent of Americans have refused to give information to a business because they thought it was not needed or too personal, up from 42 percent three years ago. When Sandra Bullock stars in The Net, a big-budget film that exploits fears about computer databases, it's safe to assume that something is happening. <p> These days many online pioneers see cyberspace as a new kind of domain, a place of unfettered freedom where individuals go to escape the tyranny of their flesh-bound identities and of structures like business and government. For these trend-setting digerati, libertarianism is something of a secular religion. Add to this the fact that encryption is now cheap and easy for almost anyone with a personal computer, and Chaum seems positively in tune with the electronic ethos.  <p> "Privacy is going to be incredibly important in cyberspace," says Nick Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a San Franciscobased market-research firm that studies attitudes toward technology. "People aren't going to work with you unless you can guarantee them privacy. In a decade or so, privacy will be to new media what safety is to car sales."  <p> In person, Chaum doesn't  fit any preconceived notion of a crusader. There's nothing of the evangelist in him; he's not a slick promoter or a hyper-confident executive. He is soft-spoken and reflective, with a quiet warmth that emerges over time. Sometimes, when he encounters colleagues at the office, he'll just look them in the eye for a pregnant moment, as if he is in no rush to speak. When I ask him questions, he thinks about them silently for awhile. Sometimes he waits a day or two before giving me a thoughtful, detailed answer.  <p> His personality is a study in juxtapositions the acclaimed researcher who sweats the prosaic details of running a company, the man who prizes abstract mathematics but remains engaged by political issues. He represents an almost-forgotten tradition of the public intellectual, deeply engaged in both business and the controversies of his time. <p>Chaum grew up in the Hollywood Hills, near Los Angeles, on roads such as Beverly Glen and Laurel Canyon. He recalls bicycling through the city with his father, a businessman who at various points owned a retail store and worked as a stockbroker. One day they passed an industrial park and stopped to admire the distinctive architecture. His father asked, "Wouldn't it be nice to have your own company like that?" Chaum dates his abiding interest in business to that moment.  <p> The youngster went on to study computer science and specialized in cryptology, a field that has been associated with cutting-edge thought since the days of the World War II code breaker. As part of the Berkeley Ph.D. program, students were required to choose two minor concentrations. While most of his colleagues picked technical fields, Chaum minored in business administration, taking courses with the M.B.A. students. He remembers in particular a Wednesday-night course that brought in guest speakers, company founders who regaled the students with first-person stories. Chaum was so fascinated he took the course a second time.  <p> But despite his entrepreneurial bent, Chaum says he remained "deeply immersed" in academia specifically, the implications of cryptology. In 1982 he took a tenure-track appointment at the University of California at Santa Barbara but found that, like most scholars, he preferred research to teaching. Months later, when the Free University in Amsterdam offered him a half-year visiting professorship and said he wouldn't have to teach, he took a chance and moved to Europe.  <p> Once in Amsterdam, Chaum was charmed by the bohemian atmosphere and the interest the Dutch showed in his work. He found himself recruited by CWI, a high-powered research institute funded by the Dutch government. He never really intended to stay, however, so he didn't bother learning the language he simply kept stretching out his visit. "I still don't really speak Dutch," he confesses sheepishly, an accidental expat now for almost 15 years.  <p> "Why don't we come to the really important stuff?"  <p> I'm sitting with Chaum under the vaulted ceilings of the grand caf at the American Hotel, a turn-of-the-century Art Nouveau landmark. Through arched windows we can see the glorious chaos of the Leidseplein, a mad whirl of bicyclists and trams and people out for a good time. The square is significant for Chaum: It's where he used to come more than a decade ago to sip coffee and puzzle out his theories.  <p> Chaum's passion for "informational rights" was fanned by the writings of Alan Weston, a Columbia University professor who gained notoriety in the 1970s as one of the first thinkers about privacy in the computer age. But even more than academic discourse, Chaum was turned on by his own investigations and the prospect of a solution to the info-ills of the late 20th century. Offering individuals real privacy without cutting them off from society indeed, by giving them more power in society seemed a truly inspiring goal.  <p> By the early 1980s, Chaum felt confident he had proved, mathematically at least, that both electronic money and voting could work. Once he had perfected the math becoming one of the world's leading cryptologists in the process he moved on to the morals. In 1983 and 1984, he neglected most of his responsibilities to focus obsessively on the potential effects of his work.  <p> Chaum terrorized interlibrary-loan clerks. He commanded assistants to wheel in cart after cart of books. He traveled throughout the U.S. and Europe to seek out top political theorists in person, probing them to make sure his ideas couldn't backfire. In the end, he says, "I convinced myself the answer was clear enough. So I decided to devote my energies not to look back and question anymore."  <p> His first task was to write a dense manifesto entitled "Security Without Identification: Card Computers to Make Big Brother Obsolete. "The article begins ominously: "Computerization is robbing individuals of the ability to monitor and control the ways information aboutthem is used. Already, public and private sector organizations acquire extensive personal information and exchange it amongst themselves. Individuals have no way of knowing if this information is inaccurate, outdated, or otherwise inappropriate, and may only find out when they are accused falsely or denied access to services."  <p> Sketching a scenario straight out of The Net, Chaum goes onto argue that "even a small group ... tapping into data gathered in everyday consumer transactions could secretly conduct mass surveillance, interfering in individuals' lifestyles, activities,and associations." He predicts that "as the public becomes more aware of the extent and possibilities of emerging information technology, there should be a growing demand" for systems that protect privacy systems such as the one he proposes.  <p> In 1985, Chaum published his article in the journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, and for several years he gave lectures to drive the point home. But as time passed, he says, he realized that "running around giving presentations wasn't going to get this stuff into general use." Drawing on his longstanding entrepreneurial impulse, he resolved to start a company to popularize his thinking. <p> His golden opportunity came in 1989, when the Dutch government wanted to introduce automated toll collections on highways. Community groups worried that bureaucrats would have the power to track the comings and goings of motorists and so the Dutch approached Chaum, by now an expert on technological privacy. The American proposed roadside sensors that could scan a strip on passing vehicles and collect an anonymous digital payment and Chaum quickly landed a consulting contract.  <p> The windfall enabled Chaum to found DigiCash. He hired a dozen talented programmers and quickly segued into serving Europe's healthy market for smart cards, cards containing computer chips that can pay for phone calls, parking meters, and the like. DigiCash needed no other venture capital: The company, which now has 30 employees, was profitable from the start.  <p> In spite of its old world location, Digicash has the look and feel of a Silicon Valley start-up except for the occasional technochatter in Dutch. There's no hint of formality here; Chaum manages by walking around and holding ad hoc meetings in hallways, the lobby, the kitchen. Twentysomething employees leave sneakers and workboots strewn about. One programmer races off to practice with the Olympic rowing team; a manager leaves for her aerobic-dance class. This could be Palo Alto.  <p> Chaum, however, seems fascinated by Amsterdam's unique heritage. He lives on the fashionable, tree-lined Keizersgracht, a grand canal favored by wealthy merchants and traders ever since it was built in 1612. His apartment,he's single, is just down the canal from the headquarters of most of the big, old Dutch banks to which he's evangelizing his futuristic vision of money.  <p> Not surprisingly, his pitch to these old-line institutions is a practical one. Giving customers access to cash, Chaum explains, is an expensive service for banks to provide. Gun-toting guards must transport money around. Chartered planes must carry checks to clearinghouses, where clerks must look at each piece of paper several times. Branches require employees and real estate. Cash is something of a loss leader for banks the storefront from which they sell more profitable products, such as credit.  <p> But consider this: In a world that's just around the corner, consumers will be able to bargain-shop for their credit (or their investments, or their mortgage) over a computer network. Many banks will suddenly find themselves in more of a commodity market. How to keep a customer's loyalty? By being the best storefront supplier of E-money, Chaum argues. That means providing a brand of digital cash that smart people will trust cash that won't land them on a list when they spend it.  <p> It's a convincing rap, but it may not win the day. Chaum has launched a 10,000-person trial run of his E-money on the Internet, but his tiny company is up against some huge competitors, none of which are using his privacy techniques. Though Chaum say she's "seriously involved" with some major banks, no such alliances have been announced yet. Why is he so sure his vision will triumph, leading inevitably to a new sort of electronic democracy? Could he be, as his rivals say, too paranoid about privacy for his business's good?  <p> Perhaps in answer, Chaum takes me on a taxi tour of his adoptedcity, asking the driver to zigzag through the old Jewish quarter. He shows me the building where Amsterdam once maintained records of all its inhabitants a practice instituted by Napoleon. During the Nazi occupation, says Chaum, the underground tried to destroy those records, which included information about religious affiliations. But the filing cards were packed together tightly and wouldn't burn quickly enough.  <p> As the taxi drives on, Chaum points out the bank where Jewish assets were seized and concentrated. Then we pass the theater where Jews were held before being sent east to the death camps. Chaum's own family emigrated from Europe before the Holocaust, but he vividly recalls the numbers tattooed on the wrists of his father's friends. <p>We're both silent as we cross the moat back to the safety of DigiCash. Chaum has made his point.  <p>     <p> ALL E-MONEY IS NOT CREATED EQUAL  <p> The first thing you need to know about so-called digital money is that it already exists, and almost everyone's got it banks, financial markets, governments, corporations. Everyone except the little guy. When Bank of America sends $100 million to Banque Nationale de Paris, it doesn't load burlap sacks of greenbacks onto an airplane, nor does it put a check in a Federal Express envelope. It simply sends a stream of electronic data to BNP's computers over SWIFT, a network created by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. So that no one changes the $100 million to $1 billion, the information is transmuted into secret code using the estimable mathematical abilities of computers.  <p> In this setup, the data is the money. And the beauty is that digital money allows for instantaneous payment of any amount, pretty much anywhere in the world, without anything physical having to move. The closest most regular folks can get to this simplicity is giving a credit card number over the phone or using a cash-machine card to buy groceries.  <p> Electronic money exclusively for the big guys made sense when computers filled a room and only major institutions could afford them. But now the Compaq on your desk is more powerful than one of those old mainframes. And even a smart card that fits in a wallet contains a tiny silicon chip that can handle encryption duties. With the proper software, you can easily code a message with the same level of security as SWIFT uses for that $100 million transfer. And it's just as well, because consumerism is comingto the Internet and we'll need a way to pay for the stuff we buy online.  <p> Currently it's hard to get paid for anything on the Internet. Granted, a number of services have thrived by charging monthly subscriptions for access or by accepting advertising. But one-time-only transactions are difficult: People don't like to give out credit card numbers over a computer network because they're scared some evil hacker is listening in. David Chaum's solution, now being tested, is simple: Build a system that allows individuals to send digital money to one another a populist version of SWIFT. People could store E-money on a home computer and transfer it to an online merchant with the click of a mouse button. They could also download the money to a smart card, which they could then use to pay for things "in real life." Chaum adds one feature that SWIFT doesn't provide: privacy. Consumers must be able to leave no audit trail, he says, just as they can always choose to pay with physical cash.  <p> This won't happen quickly. People are already comfortable with plastic, so encrypted credit card numbers will likely be the first form of payment to gain widespread use in cyberspace. The powerful trio of Visa, MasterCard, and Microsoft is trying to create a standard for this kind of transaction. But cryptocredit has its drawbacks. It's impractical for small transactions yet fees of just a few cents (to get a single stock tip online, say, or read a news story) will be big business in cyberspace. What's more, sellers must be certified and must give a cut to the card issuer. Consumers still must mail checks every month while all their purchases, down to the articles they read online, will be logged in a computer somewhere.  <p> A related strategy, promoted by First Virtual, a start-up founded by former talent agent Lee Stein, sets up an intermediary to handle transactions so that credit card numbers don't fly over the Internet. Yet the approach has many of the same hassles as cryptocredit and also results in centralized records of every purchase. A third approach, mostly for real-world transactions rather than cyberbuying, relies on special "stored value" hardware such as electronic wallets. The best example of this is Britain's Mondex, a joint venture of National Westminster Bank and Midland Bank.  <p> Mondex doesn't rely on a central computer, so its transactions a user swipes a money card in a special reader are pretty private. And Mondex cash is encrypted, so it's reasonably secure. But the system is said to use an identical code in every device: Anyone who can tamper successfully with just one unit gets the key to the whole system. It's a rather distant prospect, but a frightening one. <p>Chaum's vision addresses all these problems: It's instantaneous, secure, and final; can be used for micropayments; works in cyberspace and the real world; and has no central database. In short, it's cash. Its main drawback is that none of the big backers Chaum says his Dutch firm has lined up have yet been revealed. And with competitors like Visa and Microsoft waiting in the wings, DigiCash will likely need some help to succeed.  A.D.  <p> ---------------------------------------  <p> HOW TO MAKE E-MONEY TRULY PRIVATE  <p> To understand david Chaum's ideas about digital cash, take our short course in encryption. No math is required.  <p> We'll start with the kind of code you learned in grade school. It's called "single key" encryption: You code a message using a key, send the message to me, and I open it using the same key. As an example, the key might be to replace every letter with the next letter in the alphabet, so alan becomes bmbo. The drawback with this simple code is that you can't send secure messages to someone you don't trust with your secret key.  <p> This dilemma was solved in the late 1970s with the invention of "public key" encryption. In this ingenious scheme, you create two unique keys that work together: Each decodes whatever was coded with the other. You make one of your keys public but keep the other to yourself. Now if I send you a message coded with your public key, you're the only one with the private key to unlock it. Similarly, you can send me secure messages using my public key. This sort of encryption also provides a fool proof "digital signature." If I can use your public key to unlock asecret message you've coded with your private key, that proves you sent it.  <p> This is where Chaum comes in. He conceives of a "digital coin" as a number that can be passed around electronically like a serial number that's been liberated from its dollar bill. When a bank issues you E-money, it attaches a signature encrypted with its private key. Since you can read the signature using the bank's public key, you know it's real cash. As soon as a coin is spent,the merchant sends it back to the bank, where the number is retired so the coin can't be spent twice. (Copying is easy with computers.) The only hitch is that the bank can track where you spent every coin. So Chaum devised a way for banks to verify a coin's value without knowing the serial number. In rudimentary form, here's the concept.  A.D.  <p>

						October 1995   <p>Worth  magazine/Advisor  <p> BOOTING UP YOUR PERSONAL LAWYER  <p> By Mike France  <p> If you're injured in a train crash, it isn't hard in America to find an attorney. (Trust us: One will find you.) But what if you have a less dramatic legal problem if you need to sublease the apartment above the garage, or make a contract with some college kids to paint your fence, or decide who will get your property when you die?  <p> Odds are that you muddle ahead without the help of a lawyer or any legal documentation. The majority of adults don't have a will, and most of them enter into legal relationships all the time loaning others money, joining lottery pools, hiring people without creating contracts detailing the terms of the deals. All this leaves them vulnerable: They could suddenly die, or, even worse, the holder of the winning lottery ticket could conveniently forget about the other members of the pool.  <p> Now there is an automated solution to this problem. A new generation of inexpensive software packages with names such as Do-It-Yourself Lawyer (Expert Software, $14.95) is giving lay people the power to act as their own attorney. The programs are safe to use and perfectly suited for those times when people generally do without legal documents.  <p> Although the idea of retaining a virtual attorney may be anxiety-inducing, it's certainly better than using no attorney at all. And for those traditionalists who just don't think good legal advice can come out of a computer screen, here's a little trade secret: Many lawyers now use this same type of technology themselves.  <p> Priced between $9.95 and $69.95, these programs are easy to install and require no special computer expertise (but be sure your system has the modest amount of power and memory they require). All the programs can produce certain core documents: wills, powers of attorney, leases, promissory notes, and employment agreements. Beyond that, there's some variation. Among the 61 documents that can be churned out by Quicken Family Lawyer (Parsons Technology,$49) are a premarital agreement, a letter to challenge a credit rating, and a complaint letter to the Better Business Bureau. PC Attorney (Cosmi Software, $14.95) can produce a consignment-sale contract, a child-travel permission form, and, yes, a lottery-pooling agreement.  <p> Almost all the software uses a question-and-answer format (much like the popular Turbotax and TaxCut programs). Users first select the type of document from a menu, and then a series of queries appears on the screen. To create a will, for example, the software will ask 20 to 40 questions: What bequests will be made? Who will serve as executor? Should money given to children be held in trust?  <p> If the user gets confused or wants some practical advice, help can be summoned with the click of an icon. Online legal "textbooks" have been built into each of the programs, although their quality varies. Most of the software also contains detailed instructions on how to make a document legally valid, which usually requires some combination of signatures, notary stamps, or witnesses. <p> The best of the new breed of legal software programs can produce sophisticated documents custom-tailored to the needs of the user. For example, Quicken Family Lawyer's residential lease is capable of creating specialized clauses dealing with storage, parking, penalties for late payments, and a pet-damage security deposit. In contrast, the lease offered in Legal Documents (DSR Software,$14.95) offers little more than the preprinted form you could buy in a stationery store.  <p> Of the programs currently available, Family Lawyer is the best all-around choice. The program offers well-drafted documents, and the online legal advice is comprehensive. Managing Your Money's Personal Attorney (Meca Software, $9.95) is a pretty good second choice, but it offers only 18 documents. For drafting a will,the best choice by far is WillMaker 5 (Nolo Press, $69.95). The most sophisticated legal software on the market, it makes only wills and powers of attorney, but it permits far more customization than do any of its competitors. WillMaker 5 also comes with a detailed handbook explaining the intricacies of estate planning.(Warning: No one who has an estate greater than $500,000 should use any of these programs to make a will. See a real lawyer.)  <p> Among the software packages below $20, the only recommended choice is Do-It-Yourself Lawyer. PC Attorney and Legal Documents are extremely limited in the range of documents they can generate, and the database of practical advice is scant. And for those who can wait a little while, the <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> Network Microsoft Corp.'s new on-line service will soon allow subscribers to download many of the same documents available from the programs mentioned here.  <p><p>

						<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Since the beginning of 1994, 69 new asset-allocation mutual funds have been formed, according to Morningstar, Inc. These investment vehicles have been around since 1951 but became popular after Fidelity created the Asset Manager fund in 1988. Asset-allocation funds operate on the theory that owning a range of asset classes over a long period will provide good returns with less risk than investing in any single asset class, like stocks.<p><a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>'s $6.185 billion Global Allocation Fund is one such fund--a portfolio of domestic and foreign stocks, bonds, and money market securities. "We would feel relatively comfortable with this being your only fund investment," says one Merrill fund marketing executive.<p>That prospect makes investment advisor Ronald Roge cringe. "Asset allocation has to be tailored to your needs, time horizon, tolerance for risk, and tax bracket," says Roge, president of R.W. Roge & Co., in Centereach, New York. The Merrill fund "might suit the needs of someone with a small portfolio who's in his mid-50s," he says, but it would be a poor choice for a retiree in search of income and security, or for someone in his 20s or 30s looking for aggressive capital growth.<p>Moreover, while the image of these funds suggests conservative diversification, some may adopt aggressive strategies. For instance, the <a name="FUND:VAAPX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VAAPX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund</b></a> recently held 48 percent of its assets in bonds with an average maturity of 25.6 years--a big bet that interest rates won't rise. In a flat stock market, a 1 percent rise in interest rates would hit the fund with a loss of about 5.5 percent.<p>The marketing of these funds is not always straightforward. "Diversification made simple" is the pitch appearing on the cover of Fidelity Asset Manager sales brochures. "With one investment, your money is spread across a wide range of stocks, bonds and short term instruments.... And when there are changes in the economy or financial markets, you don't have to decide what adjustments to make or when to make them." But last year, this "diversified" fund--the largest in the class with $11 billion in assets--fell 6.6 percent in value because about a fifth of its portfolio was exposed when the Mexican peso collapsed.<p>The sales brochure for <a name="FUND:FAAAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FAAAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fortis Asset Allocation Portfolio</b></a> quotes an investor saying, "I want to spend time enjoying my family and building my career--not managing my investments." But does this secure parent know that, according to Morningstar, 43 percent of the fund's stocks are in the volatile technology sector--more than three times the technology weighting of the Standard & Poor's 500?<p>One fund does not fit all, says Don Phillips, publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds. But it can be difficult for an investor to uncover just where an asset-allocation fund has its money at any given moment. That's because many asset-allocation funds continually shift their weightings. For example, <a name="FUND:DWSTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/DWSTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dean Witter's Strategist Fund</b></a> started in October 1988 with 75 percent of its money allocated to stocks and 25 percent to fixed income. In February 1989, it held 48 percent in equities, 48 percent in fixed income, and 4 percent in money markets, but returned to 75 percent stocks and 25 percent fixed income by August 1989.<p>These portfolio shifts can cause problems, says Roge. "If you're close to retirement and the manager decides to load up on gold or to be bearish on bonds, and the manager bets wrong, you've done yourself a real disservice." To avoid this trap, ask funds for a list of their largest tactical shifts over the last three years, or find a fund, such as USAA Investment Cornerstone, committed to a certain allocation mix, in this case 22 to 28 percent of assets in each of four classes: value stocks, U.S. Treasurys, foreign stocks, and real estate.<p>The asset-allocation category may soon address the investor's evolving lifetime needs more directly. The Stagecoach LifePath Funds, for example, are a series of five funds pegged to investors who will retire in 2000, 2010, 2020, 2030, and 2040. They invest in 14 different asset classes and tactically allocate 25 percent of the portfolio. As the portfolio's target date nears, the fund gradually moves to a mix of roughly 20 percent stocks, 65 percent bonds, and 15 percent money markets. Another alternative is <a name="FUND:VSMGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VSMGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard's LifeStrategy</b></a> Funds, a set of four funds with asset-allocation mixes directed at growth, moderate growth, conservative growth, and income investors, and achieved by investing in other Vanguard funds. "These new asset-allocation funds aren't custom fits, but they are coming a lot closer to giving you the size you need," says Phillips. <p><p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Feature  <p> BEYOND CHECKS AND BALANCES <p>Quicken software changed the way we track our money. Now Scott Cook, its cocreator, is getting more ambitious. Will your next financial advisor be a computer?  <p> By Thomas E. Weber  <p> Scott Cook started up <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a> Inc. back in 1983 with hopes of creating a personal-finance tool that would tap the power of personal computers. The former marketing executive asked consumers what they wanted, and the resulting program, Quicken, was a computer geek's dream: an easy way of storing and categorizing every last detail of your financial life. To those who were getting along just fine with paper and pencil, the software may have seemed laughably anal. But no one's laughing now. With more than 6 million users, Quicken is a juggernaut. Late last year, software mogul Bill Gates endorsed Cook's vision--and triggered an antitrust fight--by agreeing to pay $1.5 billion to bring Intuit into the <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> fold. Will the 42-year-old Cook, with or without Gates, change the way we handle our finances? Associate editor Thomas E. Weber spoke to Cook and found that the future of money maybe closer than we think.  <p>  <p>WORTH: Many people fear that computers will complicate their lives--not make things easier. As you try to put Quicken in everyhome, how will you erase people's memory of flops like home banking? <p> COOK: Home banking turned out to be one of the stupid uses of a computer--that and storing recipes. Banks invested something north of $100 million on the idea, and they lost every penny. At the core, it stemmed from not delivering what customers wanted. One New York bank ran a television commercial that showed a guy telling his wife he was going to the bank. He puts on his overcoat, looks at the snow coming down, turns around, and turns on a computer. The message was "You don't have to go out of your home anymore. "But what's the most common reason you go to a bank? To get cash, right? And what's the second most common reason? To make a deposit. Could you do either of those with home banking? Of course not. No wonder consumers didn't buy it.  <p>  <p>So what can computers deliver?  <p> You have to ask, "What do consumers want?" First of all, they don't like financial work. They want to take care of their money in as little time as possible. Another thing they want is answers to the questions they're asking. One question they ask is "How much money do I have that I can write checks on?" Well, banks don't know that number. Banks only know the checks they've processed; they don't know the checks you've written that are still outstanding. Our software helps.  <p>  <p>What else?  <p> People want to know "Where'd my money go?" Not just from my main checking account, but also if I'm using an account at another bank, or especially if I'm using several credit cards. They want to track their investments. And everything has to work together very easily, so you don't have to be a nerdo and figure out alot of advanced technology.  <p>  <p>Are you saying there's no such thing as home banking, then? That you just need software like Quicken, not some special service from your bank?  <p> I don't want to get tied up on names. "Home banking" just confused everything. The future is in software that runs on a consumer's PC. The software drives a link with the financial infrastructure--your bank, your credit card. And it uses CD-ROM for all the richness that's available there: graphics, video, sound.  <p>  <p>And what'll make all this catch on?  <p> Well, we don't want to force things on anyone. I have yet to see the Microsoft police in software stores with guns, forcing you to buy their titles. The only way a product will sell is if customers like it and tell their friends about it. The intersection between what people really want and what technology does really well--that's where true greatness is found. Let's say you're looking at your stocks and you want to get the portfolio's value updated. With most online services now, that's a real pain. What people want is to push a button called "update portfolio" and--poof!--instantly have all of those stock prices updated.  <p>  <p>That's pretty easy to explain. What else will make people love using computers?  <p> Well, that's just one example. In the future we'll be able to track all of your transactions--credit cards, stocks, even cash--so that you don't even have to type in the fact that you bought or sold something. All this information will enter your records automatically from the financial infrastructure. We have this capability today on Quicken with credit-card transactions, for instance.  <p>  <p>But it still boils down to just one thing: record keeping. That isn't very glamorous. Is it enough to convince real technophobes to try a computer?  <p> No, but an equally important part of people's financial lives is planning for the future. Things like "What kind of insurance should I have, and how much?" Right now, people rely on two sources of help: books and magazines like Worth, and other people. Books and magazines are unbiased, wonderfully complete, and low cost. Unfortunately, matters have gotten very complex over the last 30 years. For instance, there used to be one kind of mortgage, the 30-year fixed rate, and it was pretty easy to price shop. Today, there are so many kinds of mortgages. Even a great magazine puts the burden on its readers: How does this apply to me? There's no way a typical consumer can piece together a retirement plan based on a book or magazine.  <p>  <p>That's why people turn to professionals.  <p> The problem there is the reverse. Financial advisors give you very good advice and a very complete plan, custom-tailored for you. But they're not low cost. A true financial planner will set you back hundreds, even thousands of dollars. The other kind of financial planner is a commissioned salesman, who can cost even more. The most frequently consulted financial expert in the country is the insurance agent. Many are honest, great people. But unfortunately, there are many other who are more influenced by commission.  <p>  <p>And you think personal computers will solve this dilemma by giving personalized advice that's cheap and unbiased?  <p> Yes. For not much more than the price of a book or magazine, you'll be able to get a program that will ask you questions about your financial condition. It'll then apply wisdom from the best experts to your data. It'll suggest which parts of your portfolio you should look at and even suggest actions for you to consider. <p>  <p>That sounds like a big threat to banks, brokers, insurance salesmen--people who make money by giving advice. Why would they help you usurp that business by funneling financial data into the PCs of folks who run your software?  <p> There will be a happy solution. As a software company, we're not going to provide the sort of financial products our software might suggest for you to consider. We're not a bank or a mutual fund company or an insurance company. What this will do is create a new way for financial companies to reach consumers. It's a very low-cost channel. Many customers will be self-service. In that cost saving there is an opportunity for gain for everyone. Consumers don't want to be locked into a single company's services. They don't trust that. It's not in our interest to try to force people to buy only Intuit financial products. Consumers would exit stage right in droves. They want the choice they have now. Who do they trust with their money? They trust the people they're already using. That's not us.  <p>  <p>As you say, trust is vital when it comes to money--so let's talk about privacy. If my financial data must zip around electronically for this new world to work, how do I know my whole life won't end up in Big Brother's database?  <p> In my scenario, the only place all your data is stored is on your own PC at home. There's no central repository at Intuit or anywhere else. And you'll be assembling your own information from people who already have it. Your credit card companies, for example, know all about your spending habits. Your broker knows all about your investments. If you're worried about that, that's a separate issue. We're doing nothing to increase your exposure. In fact, we may be diminishing it slightly. Instead of having that stuff sent through the mail, it'll be sent electronically. Anyone can go to your mailbox, but making electronic links very secure is trivially easy.  <p>  <p>Okay, another trust issue. If I talk to a broker, I know he or she has passed the Series 7 exam. I also know I can complain to the SEC or the NASD--or even sue--if I'm mistreated. Should software pass an exam before it can provide me with these services? <p> All of those safeguards are in place today. In order for a computer to accept a stock trade, the people who manage that trade on the other side must have Series 7 registration. If it's another type of transaction, they must have certification for that. And if someone writes financial advice or guidance--someone like Andrew Tobias, for example, or Worth magazine--that's an unregulated business, in software or in print. Well, it's actually regulated by the market. If you give bad advice, people tend to have bad experiences.  <p>  <p>You believe technology will transform the way we handle our finances. How far along that path are we? What percentage have we explored so far?  <p> Ten percent. We will look back 20 years from now and be amazed by how people did financial work in 1995--how burdensome it was, how hard it was to make decisions.  <p><p>  <p>

Our panel of experts took the leading financial software on a hard drive. Here's their report. <p>Edited by Jim Jubak<p>Mutual Funds:<p>* Morningstar Mutual Funds On Floppy (Version 1.0)
You've seen the stars (in virtually every mutual fund ad), now use the database. That's both the draw and the drawback of this program. It's tempting to skip all the analytic features and just scan for the five-star funds. That would be too bad. The ranking system is the weakest part of this software. There's more than enough data here, though, for an investor to create his own ranking of funds.<p>Specs: $45 for one-time disk, $95 for quarterly updates, $185 for monthly updates from Morningstar Inc.; IBM only; 800-876-5005.<p>
* Mutual Fund Expert Pro Plus (Version 2.03)
Most investors have never heard of this program, but it's better than Morningstar's. The graphics are far superior--they're brighter and have more options for graphing funds and indexes against one other--and it features better data for calculating risk too. Best value probably isn't the Pro Plus version, however; the Personal version gives data on just 900 fewer funds for $400 less.<p>Specs: $399 with quarterly updates or $599 with monthly updates from Steele Systems Inc. (Personal version with monthly updates costs $185; Professional version costs $499); IBM only; 800-237-8400, ext. 752. <p>
* Markex II Plus (Version 6.0)
This program looks like hell, but it works and the price is right. Ignore the dubious investment strategy. A Windows version of the program is scheduled for a September release. Users can update fund data by modem.<p>Specs: $59.95 from Huntington Associates Financial Inc.; IBM only; 800-883-3863. <p>
* The Mutual Fund Investor (Version 5.2)
This software integrates a mutual fund database and portfolio manager, a plus if you're one of those investors who actively trades mutual funds. One big warning: The instruction manual contains an error on page 17 that gives the wrong information on how to start the program. A Windows version of the program is scheduled for December.<p>Specs: $295 from American River Software; IBM only; 916-483-1600.<p>STOCKS:
Fundamental--<p>* Macro*World Investor (Version 7.0)
A software dinosaur. The program is slow, clunky, and not particularly user-friendly. On the other hand, it won't crash or hog memory, and beneath that primitive surface lurks what one of our reviewers called "one of the most sophisticated programs for portfolio analysis." Using its database of real-world economic indicators, Macro*World correlates the price movement of individual stocks with conditions in the economy.<p>Specs: $699.95 ($200 discount to members of the American Association of Individual Investors), which includes six monthly updates ($39 a month after that), from Macro*World Research Corp.; IBM only;  800-841-5398 <p>
* Telescan Analyzer (Version 3.0)
Easier to use than less powerful programs--our reviewer even logged on without having to call customer support--and able to leap tall portfolios in a single bound. Telescan provides it all: both fundamental and technical data, news, S&P company reports, sample issues of 22 newsletters, complete insider-trading filings, and even--for a surcharge--access to Morningstar and Macro*World stock data.  The $45 a month flat rate only covers unlimited nonprime use. Anyone who wants to log on before 8 p.m. is going to get socked for 94 cents a minute. Better have a fast modem.<p>Specs: The software is free ($12.75 for shipping and handling), and data costs either $45 a month (off-hours) or 94 cents a minute (prime time) from Telescan Inc.; IBM only; 800-324-8246.<p>
* SSG Plus (Version 1.2), The NAIC Investors Toolkit (Version 2.0), and Take Stock for Windows (Version 2.0)<p>The great thing about this software, available through the National Association of Investors Corp., is that you can actually talk on the phone to Ellis Traub, the guy who wrote it. Unfortunately, you'll need to talk to Traub a lot. We couldn't do the simplest things in SSG Plus without calling technical support. Which is a shame. NAIC's method for picking stocks is a great approach for beginning investors; we suggest reading the association's magazine instead.  Each revision of this software has been slightly better; the next version is due later this year.<p>Specs: SSG Plus costs $114 (NAIC member $79), Investors Toolkit costs $160 (member $125), and Take Stock costs $175 (member $150) from National Association of Investors Corp.; SSG is IBM only, others are for IBM or Mac; 810-543-0612, ext. 330.<p>
* Quant IX (Version 5.0)
A cheap program that combines good portfolio management with solid fundamental analysis. The program's six different models let an investor estimate the value of a stock using such tried-and-true methods as earnings growth. A "what if" function projects the effect of such events as an earnings surprise or a change in interest rates on estimated valuations. A great way to become a disciplined fundamental investor.<p>Specs: $59 from Quant IX Software Inc.; IBM only; 800-247-6354.<p>
Technical--
* MetaStock (Version 4.0)
If you want to learn about technical analysis, this package is the place to start--and we  guarantee that you'll never outgrow it. This may be the most well thought-out and easy-to-use package that we reviewed--the tutorial will get an investor up and running in just four hours. The program comes with 80 predefined indicators for predicting the price movement of a stock or group of stocks. A system tester lets you see if the strategy you've developed would have made money, and the explorer feature searches for stocks that pass your screens.<p>Specs: $349 (for version that analyzes end-of-day prices) or $495 (for version that uses real-time pricing data) from Equis International Inc.; IBM only; 801-265-8886. <p>
* TradingExpert (Version 2.5)
Everything about this program is heavy, from the nearly $1,000 price to the 700 pages of documentation, which weighs almost 5 pounds. TradingExpert uses some of the techniques of artificial intelligence to produce a bullish-to-bearish ratio on each stock it analyzes. To judge from our experience, the program will cycle through two or three buy and sell signals a year on each stock. That means a user will either do an awful lot of trading or he must be able to use other technical indicators to separate the really profitable signals from those that are just noise. A new version, with fundamental analysis and mutual funds, was due last month.<p>Specs: $996 from AIQ Inc.; IBM only; 800-332-2999.<p>
* Personal Analyst (Version 1.7)
One of the few Macintosh programs in the <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>-dominated world of technical analysis. Features real-time charting, advanced analysis with all of the indicators that technicians dream about, trading models that make buy and sell recommendations, and access to data through the usual sources. <p>Specs: $395 from Trendsetter Software Inc.; Macintosh only; 800-825-1852<p>
* Windows on Wall Street (Version 2.1)
Technical analysis comes to the mass market. Despite the package's claim to be "your complete personal investment solution," you can't use the software to call down basic fundamental information--such as price-to-earnings ratios--even if you want to. The strengths of Windows on Wall Street are in its incidentals. Some of the best graphics we've seen make the charts addictive. And the built-in software for downloading stock-price information was among the easiest to use in our sample.<p>Specs: $295 from MarketArts Inc.; IBM only; 800-998-8439.<p>
Portfolio Management:
* Quicken (Version 7 for DOS, Version 3.0 for Windows, and Version 4.0 for Macintosh) and Quicken Companion (Version 2.0)
There's a race under way among the mass-market financial software makers--they're all trying to catch Quicken. The graphics are intoxicating. It's easier to set up and use than CA-Simply Money, it's more comprehensive than Managing Your Money, and it's better at integrating all of an individual's finances than Reality's WealthBuilder. Quicken isn't perfect, though. It anticipates too much. For example, it has trouble dealing with the whole idea of paying rent. When you tell it that you make a rental payment on the first of the month, it assumes you're receiving rental income. (Nice thought, but c'mon.) The new addition, Quicken Companion ($29.95, IBM only), organizes a home inventory, estimates taxes, and downloads stock and mutual fund prices.<p>Specs: $69.95 for IBM versions, $34.95 for Macintosh version, from Intuit Inc.; 800-624-8742.<p>
* WealthBuilder by Money Magazine (IBM version 3.1, Mac version 3.0)
A real mix of the good, the bad, and the ugly. Starting the program is like wandering through a maze. A user can't move on to the next stage until he's filled out the current worksheet or portfolio or whatever. But be patient. The terrific fundamental stock-picking tools make the whole program worthwhile. These screens constitute the best fundamental analysis software we reviewed. (Warning: If you choose the program's most expensive option, you get a monthly price update via disk. That's too long a delay for some investors.) Reuters just bought a majority stake in Reality, and the information giant has already moved to overhaul the newsgathering and on-line services that come with WealthBuilder. We look forward to the next version.<p>Specs: $109.95 from Reality Technologies Inc.; IBM and Macintosh; 800-346-2024.<p>
* Managing Your Money (IBM version 10.0, Mac version 6.0)
Graphics aren't everything. The star of this program is its prose. The program takes the time to explain assumptions and discuss the principles of financial planning and investment in detail. In the retirement planner, for example, the program explains how much money a retiree should expect from Social Security. Although the program won't help you pick individual stocks, its sections on asset allocation, buying life insurance, buying a mortgage, and retirement more than justify the price of admission. <p>Specs: $79.95 from MECA Software Inc.; IBM and Macintosh; 800-820-7457.<p>
* <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> Money (Version 3.0)
Microsoft is clearly serious about entering this market, but wait for the next version. There's no single part of the package that's so good that it's worth buying the whole to get at just that single function. <p>
Specs: $34.95 until April 15, $69.95 thereafter, from Microsoft Corp.; IBM only; 800-426-9400.<p>
* FolioMan (Version 1.3)
It's harder than it should be to find portfolio-management software that accurately calculates investment returns. Many programs treat capital gains as the only kind of gains, which slights income-oriented investments. FolioMan does the best job of any program we reviewed in giving an investor both a capital gains and a total return calculation for income investments. The program also does a good job of tracking the cost basis of an investment--a tricky problem for mutual fund investors trying to figure out capital gains for tax purposes. This version has no graphics, just simple printed tables. A version with graphics was just about to hit the market at press time.<p>Specs: $89 from E-Sential Software; IBM only; 213-257-2524.<p>
* Allocation Master (Version 3.2)
A professional-level program for asset allocation that uses a very straightforward graphic presentation to give any investor access to the secrets of modern portfolio theory. Allocation Master shows that the point of investing is not simply to go for the highest possible return, but to create the best mix of risk and return. At $800, this is certainly too expensive for casual use, but anyone who actively moves investments among asset classes in an effort to get top performance out of a portfolio ought to seriously consider this tool. <p>Specs: $795 from Frontier Analytics Inc.; IBM only; 310-301-3988.<p>
* StreetSmart (Version 1.0)
Trading software from the two biggest discount brokerage firms, Schwab and Fidelity, keeps getting better. Schwab's newest , a Windows upgrade from the DOS-based Equalizer, links extremely easy on-line trading with ledgers that keep track of positions and trades in each portfolio. The impressive communications software can also be used to pull in research reports and download stock and mutual fund prices. Of course, you'll need to open an account at Schwab, too. <p>Specs: $59 from <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab & Co.</b></a>; IBM only; 800-334-4455.<p>
* FOX (Version 2.1)
This was the best, but Schwab raised the bar by adapting StreetSmart for Windows. Fidelity Investments hasn't yet announced its update; the current DOS version provides historical and real-time quotes, performance analysis, and company news. And, yes, you'll need a Fidelity brokerage account.<p>Specs: $49.95 from Fidelity Investments; IBM only; 800-457-1769.<p>Written by Jim Jubak. Software reviewed by Andrew Feinberg, Jim Jubak, Richard Maturi, and Tim Middleton. Additional reporting by Marie D'Amico, Jim Melloan, and Kevin Caliendo.<p><p>

A low-priced computer program brings the power of technical analysis into the home<p>By Robert N. Veres<p>The stocks of basin exploration and Noble Affiliates, two publicly traded oil-drilling companies, looked virtually indistinguishable earlier this year. Both were selling at price-to-earnings ratios in the middle to high 20s. Both had a 97 percent rating on the Investor's Business Daily EPS ranking system, which compares earnings growth to the market as a whole. "The fundamentals were about as close as you can get," says David Vomund, who runs a fax market-timing service called Stock Alert. "They could have been mirror images of each other."<p>Not so to technical analysts. Using computer programs from AIQ, Vomund blended various technical indicators into a single rating; Noble Affiliates got a buy signal on May 18, but Basin did not. Over the next three months, Noble's stock price rose 20 percent, while Basin's inched up only 1.5 percent.<p>Since the days of Benjamin Graham, the granddaddy of fundamental analysis, most investors have bought stocks based on fundamentals--figures, ratios, and other tangibles drawn from company financial reports or other intelligence sources. But anybody who invests in the stock market knows that fundamentals don't always point the way to stocks that go up. Two companies may have experienced good earnings growth, each may be selling at a relatively low price-to-earnings ratio, and both may be carrying very little debt on their books. Yet one stock price might fall while the other takes off.<p>People who claim to understand this strange behavior are called market technicians--mathematically oriented traders and analysts whose conversations are largely unintelligible to the general public Rather than relying on fundamental concepts such as price-to-earnings ratios, book values, or earnings growth, technicians will look for opportunities in the trading pattern of a stock--usually in its price movements and volume of shares traded. <p>In times past, technicians studied their reams of statistical data like medieval scribes, drawing their own charts and analyzing numbers on slide rules. Now computers have taken over, making some of the technicians' arcane mysteries accessible to individual investors.<p>Technicians talk in intimidating terms about "trend-line breakouts," "MACD oscillators," "stochastics," and "trading-channel indices." Don't be confused. What they're really talking about are the basic laws of supply and demand. "If a lot of people want to buy a stock and not many people want to sell, then the price should increase," says Mitch Legarza, an executive with AIQ Inc., a computer-software manufacturer located in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, that specializes in technical-analysis programs. <p>How can investors measure supply and demand in a constantly fluctuating market? "If the price is increasing and the trading volume is high, that means enthusiasm for the stock is increasing," Legarza explains. "If volume is going up and prices stabilize or drop, that suggests that sellers are beginning to outnumber buyers."<p>At last count, there were some 60 different ways that technicians measure a stock's upward or downward movement, also known as momentum. AIQ software calculates and tracks about 30 of them. One of the simplest is a program that tracks a stock's current price and its average price over the last 200 days--called, appropriately enough, the 200-day moving average. When the moving-average line rises above the current price, that simply means that the stock has traded higher over the past 200 days than it does now. A technician might buy at the moment the moving average falls below the current price and sell when it starts to turn back upward.<p>A slightly more complicated way to view the same data is to compute the 10-day and 49-day moving averages. If the price of a stock is moving up at an increasing rate, then the 10-day line will move above the 49-day line--a bullish signal for technicians. <p>In the past, technicians and fundamentalists were a little like the Hatfields and the McCoys: Fundamentalists thought that technical analysis was numerical voodoo, while technicians pointed out that most fundamental analyses involve predictions about future corporate earnings based on statistics from the past. But shrewd investors use both approaches. "I don't even consider a stock technically until I'm satisfied with the fundamentals," says Tom Barrett, director of research for Comprehensive Capital, a regional brokerage firm in West Palm Beach, Florida. "We find a group of stocks to pick from that are very strong fundamentally, and then we look at their strength technically to see when to get in or out."<p>In 1991 and 1992, Barrett used AIQ programs to generate monthly buy and sell recommendations on what he perceived to be the strongest ten stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. As if technical analysis weren't already complex enough, Barrett found that different technical indicators seem to work best with different stocks. For instance Barrett found the MACD--moving-average convergence/divergence indicator, a graph of the differences between two moving averages--using the 10-day moving average and the 49-day moving average seemed to work best in predicting future movements in Disney shares.<p>For <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>, Barrett prefers something called stochastics: a graph of the range of the stock's price over the prior 21 days. "If today's price is in the lower 20 percent of the stock's trading range, then chances are pretty good that its next move is going to be up," says Barrett. Why? Because, according to Barrett, a stock will trade in a spectrum that's 30 percent above or below the middle of its 21-day trading range 90 percent of the time.<p>Legarza believes that most investors will use technical analysis as a kind of junior partner to their fundamental investigation. This is exactly the approach taken by the regional brokerage firm Edward D. Jones & Co., which has recently begun using technical analysis in the stock recommendations it offers to clients. "If a stock is fundamentally sound, the next question is, is this the right time to buy it?" says Legarza. "Let's say we're looking at a $40 stock, but the technical indicators suggest a minor correction. If, over the next two weeks, the stock goes from $40 to $38, and then our technical analysis says that it has found a little support--we just saved the client 5 percent." Saving another 5 percent on the sell side is even better.<p>With its three software programs ranging in price from $249 to $996, AIQ is well within the reach of individual investors. While most investors are probably better off buying mutual funds than they are buying and selling stocks based on some wiggly lines on a computer screen, it's still good to know that the same tools used by professionals are now available to the rest of us. Individual investors are getting more and more equal all the time.<p>Robert N. Veres edits and publishes Inside Information, a monthly newsletter for professional financial advisors. <p> <p><p>

Keep your money in the neighborhood. Canada is about to experience an economic revival.<p>By Jim Rogers <p>Canada hasn't exactly been an investing hot spot during the past 25 years. In 1971, the Canadian dollar sold at a premium to the U.S. dollar, at $1.09. Today it sells for 73 cents, a fall of 33 percent during a time when U.S. currency has taken its lumps in world markets.<p>Canada's leaders are partly to blame for the nation's sorry economic performance. But Canada, as an economy based on natural resources, has also suffered to no small degree from the great commodities price slump of recent years.<p>What is Canada's place in the parliament of nations? In geographical size, it's second only to Russia. It has roughly one-tenth of our population, 28.8 million people -- slightly fewer than California. Only one-third of its vast area has been developed.<p>Among the world's manufacturing nations, Canada holds a prominent position. However, it is dependent on the U.S. not only for investment capital but also for markets than can absorb its big surpluses of petroleum and agricultural and manufactured goods. In addition to large petroleum reserves, the nation is a leading producer of asbestos, nickel, zinc, and potash, as well as a major source of uranium, aluminum, titanium, cobalt, gold, silver, copper, platinum, iron ore, lead, and molybdenum. Canada's forests provide more than one-third of the world's supply of newsprint. Its farms and ranches produce vast quantities of wheat and beef, much of which is exported.<p>Fully half of Canada's exports are industrial machinery, agricultural machinery, cars, trucks, engines, parts, and office machines. In 1994, 82 percent of these goods were exported to the U.S. Its next largest trading partner is Japan, to which it ships less than 5 percent of its output. Economically, Canada might as well be our 51st state.<p>Canada's labor force is educated and has a strong work ethic, and Canada has a solid infrastructure with a large manufacturing base. It is chockablock with natural resources. Despite paying higher hourly wages, <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> has found it cheaper to build cars in Canada and the U.S. than in Mexico.<p>So why has the Canadian economy done so poorly? Simple: The country has run up a huge national debt. On a per capita basis, its citizens owe more in public debt than U.S. citizens. National deficits and debts are the twin crippling diseases that afflict all too many developed countries, including most of Europe and the U.S.<p>Canada's heritage could have given it the best of all worlds -- English government and politics, French culture, and American technology. Instead, it has adopted a far less appealing blend: English technology, French government, and American culture. Just how this came to pass is a mystery for sociologists and historians to sort out.<p>Despite all this, I believe that this could be a good time to invest in Canada. First, Canada should benefit as the world moves from a declining market in natural resources to a boom -- a subject I've harped on often in these pages. The giant stockpiles that the Russians have been dumping on the world economy have all been dumped, and worldwide prosperity in developing economies is demanding more raw materials than the world can currently produce. It will take time for new supplies to come on board. Countries with abundant supplies of timber, oil, agricultural products, and mine ores, such as those in Africa and South America, are going to do very well. Canada should do well, too. <p>Second, there's a good chance the political climate in Canada may have taken a turn for the better. In the most recent election in the province of Alberta, the current state premier, Ralph Klein, ran on an unusual platform. Elect me, he told Alberta's voters, and I will fire the province's excess workers and balance the budget. Alberta said okay, and Klein kept his campaign promises. Amazingly enough, his popularity has soared. Klein has been so successful that he recently wrote to his province's voters for advice on how to spend the growing surpluses.<p>Following Alberta's example, seven of Canada's other nine provinces have balanced their books in the fiscal year ended March 31 or are likely to do so in 199697. Ontario (the biggest non-sovereign borrower in the international capital markets in the early 1990s) has taken an ax to public spending. Under the Conservative government that took office in mid-1995, welfare payments have been cut and business subsidies frozen. Even in Quebec, Lucien Bouchard, the new premier, has said that the province's economic problems have a higher priority than does a renewed drive to secede from Canada. <p>The federal government may also be headed in the right direction. In 1993, it had a deficit of 5.9 percent of gross domestic product. This should be lowered to 2 percent in 1997 -- a vast improvement. The finance minister has promised to balance the books. If the country can do this according to plan, the deficit will be down to 0.7 percent of GDP in 199798 -- the lowest of the Group of Seven, an association of the world's leading industrialized nations.<p>In short: The revolution that started in Alberta is growing in influence across Canada, and if it goes all the way, the country will become an economic powerhouse during the coming commodities boom. And this revolution will be none too soon, either. It 
is a transformation every G-7 country must go through -- 
or perish.<p>There are yet other advantages to Canadian investments. For about five years, Canada's rate of inflation has been lower than that of the U.S. Also, Canadian corporations have been undergoing the same sort of fundamental restructuring as their U.S. counterparts. Canadian firms have been investing large amounts of capital, positioning themselves to make steady gains in productivity. Indeed, unit-labor costs are down by almost 25 percent since 1991, and only three countries have a better record: Sweden, Italy, and Finland. In the U.S., unit-labor costs are declining at only half the Canadian rate. <p>How to invest in Canada?<p>One easy and safe way is to buy the Canadian dollar. Purchase a Canadian money-market account, CD, T-bill, or simple savings account. Canadian bonds at this point yield more than U.S. bonds, so bright investors might be able to achieve a double whammy: earn higher interest payments and ride an increase in the Canadian dollar against that of the U.S.<p>When our stock market falls, Canada's will, too, but probably not as much. Also, its subsequent rise is likely to be more robust. According to the 1994-95 G.T. Guide to World Equity Markets, Canada's equity market is the world's sixth largest. "It's well developed, liquid, heavily researched, and an important provider of corporate finance," the guide says. There are five stock exchanges in the country: in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Winnipeg. The markets in Toronto and Montreal are the primary trading venues for the securities of major Canadian corporations and handle 95 percent of the total value traded in Canada, while the Vancouver Exchange has a reputation as a wild venture-capital market for companies with smaller resources. There are 1,288 companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.<p>The market in Canada is sometimes compared to the South African and  Australian markets because of the influence of the prices of natural resources, but the largest and most active stocks listed in Montreal and Toronto include "a heavy representation of communication companies, diversified industrials, utilities, and banks," according to the G.T. Guide.<p>A savvy investor might buy Canadian natural-resource companies, of which there are hundreds and which should produce Canada's biggest success stories over the next ten years. And if you are of a mind to buy bank stocks, consider Canadian banks. If you like retailers, why not research Canadian retailers? <p>A note of caution, however. Like most countries assembled by empire builders, Canada was put together without much thought to the region's natural geographic, ethnic, and linguistic borders. At some point, I believe, Canada will split up, and not just into two parts (French speaking and English speaking) but probably into four. 
A map quickly shows why. If Quebec takes itself out of Canada, it leaves a wide tear right down the country's middle. Cut off from the other provinces by hundreds of miles, the maritime provinces in the east will find it difficult to form an alliance with those in the west and may well seek an alliance with the U.S. to become -- what? The state of North Maine?<p>Western Canada -- British Columbia, the Yukon, and Alberta -- has the same rugged approach to life as our own west, and it is not likely to want to associate itself with the big spenders back east. Vancouver today is full of Asians who have brought a work ethic that puts Anglo-Saxons to shame, as they believe strongly in saving and investing for the future. They'll be reluctant to pay for somebody else's sluggardly lifestyle. I expect the separatist movement that eventually succeeds will originate in the west and not among the French speakers of Quebec.<p>To sum up, Canada's body politic is changing rapidly, and the country's  natural resources are about to pay off big. With prosperity likely to arrive, the French separatists will not be as eager to push away from their brother states. Indeed, I don't believe Canada's breakup will happen for another 10 to 15 years -- until the coming commodities boom is over and the next downturn arrives. <p>What does history tell us about such situations? Unfortunately, we have little relevant past to examine. The last 200 to 300 years have been a period of empire building, not empire breaking, and the rise of huge central-government debts is a phenomenon of only the last 100 years.<p>Canadian investments may be good for the next ten years or so, but don't put them away and forget about them, because the country's current problems will come back to haunt it. Canadian investments are not the sort you sock away for your estate or your grandchildren.<p>

The Japan Question -- Again<p>By Todd G. Buchholz<p>When I last wrote about the Land of the Rising Sun, in October 1995, dawn appeared to be indefinitely postponed. Bad debts in the banking sector were estimated to total about $800 billion, around four times higher than those racked up by the U.S. during the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s. At the same time, economists couldn't find a pulse in the Japanese economy, and consumer prices were falling in a deflationary spiral that the Japanese referred to by the forbidding phrase "price destruction."<p>Why, then, have investors been on a stock-buying spree? The Nikkei, Japan's key stock index, jumped over 26 percent in the year ended May 10, 1996 (though U.S. investors would have seen all but 0.49 percent of that gain evaporate because of the dollar's rebound against the yen).<p>Clearly, buyers of Japanese equities see an economic recovery, and the evidence suggests there may be one on the horizon. The Japanese shopper, after an extended hibernation, is once again stirring, sending department-store sales up by 6 percent year over year. Car sales are up 7.7 percent. After the deflation of the past few years, Japan's consumer price index actually showed a plus sign (+0.1 percent) in March, giving business leaders reason to increase investments in order to raise production to meet burgeoning demand.<p>It appears, then, that Japan's battered economy is slowly on the mend, helped by an astoundingly low official discount interest rate of 0.5 percent and by the rise of the dollar against the yen, which makes Japanese exporters more competitive.<p>So, is it time for investors to jump in and catch the rising wave? I think not. Japan's government is in a policy dilemma. For two years, the Bank of Japan has been stomping on the monetary accelerator, trying to add liquidity to the banking system -- thus, the 0.5 percent discount rate (compared with a 5.25 percent Fed Funds rate in the U.S.). Fiscal policy has also been loosened by the Ministry of Finance, with one stimulus package after another riding through the Diet, Japan's congress. The fiscal expansion has been so great that Japan's budget deficit now stands at just under 8 percent of gross domestic product, compared with a U.S. budget deficit at under 2.3 percent of GDP.<p>The easy-money policy of the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan's support of low official interest rates (which makes the central bank appear subservient to the government's political needs, unlike the independent Bundesbank in Germany or the Federal Reserve Board in the U.S.) worry many market analysts, who fear a sharp slowdown will hit in the fall. That's when last year's stimulus spending runs out. In addition, Bank of Japan chief Yasuo Matsushita has said he expects interest rates to rise over the course of the year.<p>The big question is whether Japan's private sector will pick up the slack or slide back into a recession after the government stops pumping up the economy. The June 7 tankan report, which takes the temperature of private-sector sentiment to gauge expectations for economic activity, will be closely scrutinized for answers to that question. A strong report will push the Nikkei stock index higher but punish the Japanese bond market, which will look back at today's 0.5 percent discount rate as a distant memory.<p>You can hear the bond bears snarling across the Pacific.<p>Contributing editor Todd Buchholz is a managing director of a New Yorkbased international investment fund and the author of From Here to Economy: A Shortcut to Economic Literacy.<p> <p><p>

						By Anne Field<p>After 1994's peso debacle, Latin-American funds have come roaring back in 1996 with an average return of 16.1 percent through April 30. "We think Latin-American markets will continue to outperform the U.S.," says Jon Teall of Lipper Analytical Services. The mutual-fund rating company Morningstar lists the following five among the best of the 26 open-end Latin-American funds.<p><a name="FUND:BTLAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BTLAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>BT INVESTMENT LATIN AMERICAN EQUITY</b></a>. The managers of this fund, supported by 15 New York based emerging-markets analysts, pick investments strictly top down: first by country and then by theme. In Argentina, the theme is growth, played through financial services and cyclicals.

						The gurus say Japan is back, but the country hasn't solved its biggest problem: It still saves too much<p>By Walter Russell Mead<p>The conventional wisdom on Japan moves almost as fast as one of the country's famous shinkansen bullet trains. Seven years ago, investment gurus argued that the Tokyo stock market wasn't overvalued when the Nikkei Index moved above 35,000.<p>Then, in 1992, the stock market and the country's real-estate boom both collapsed. Japan, said the gurus, was all washed up. Newly competitive U.S. corporations and aggressive competition from the Asian tigers had struck a mortal blow to Japan's industrial giants.<p>Now, say the same experts, Japan is back. The long economic slump is over, and the stock market -- still 44 percent below its 1989 peak -- looks tempting. Bill Clinton's spring trip to Tokyo revealed a new, confident Japan, one ready to take a higher security profile in the region.<p>Ten years ago, nothing could stop Japan. Three years ago, nothing could save it. Is the financial press going overboard on Japan again? You bet. Japan has not solved any of the deep economic and political structural problems that took the country on that wild boom-bust ride in the 1980s. In fact, it seems unlikely that Japan will rejoin the ranks of the world's high-growth economies anytime soon.<p>I understand why it feels like Japan is firmly launched on a course of recovery. I know it feels like the excesses of the boom are being wrung out of the system, that banks are regaining solvency, that investors are newly sober. It's easy to draw a fairly convincing analogy between what is happening in Japan today and the cycle of financial excess, pain, and recovery that characterized the U.S. savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s. But that analogy is dangerously deceptive. A system of traditional attitudes and relationships makes capitalism in Japan essentially different from the version practiced in the U.S. And the nature of Japanese capitalism prevents the kind of healthy cleansing that occasionally sweeps through U.S. financial markets.<p>Back when Japan Inc. was working, Americans stood in awe of its dynamic industrial system. Products of amazingly high quality -- selling for remarkably low prices -- poured out of factories run by legions of dedicated workers operating the latest in robots. U.S. executives at company after company launched crash-course programs to catch up, often adapting Japanese methods of production (such as just-in-time inventory) that seemed responsible for that country's success.<p>But U.S. business leaders were powerless to duplicate the nationwide thrift that was the ultimate source of Japan's industrial edge. Japan was the world's most awesome savings-and-investment machine. Here's how it worked.<p>Every year, Japanese consumers and businesses managed to sock away about 33 percent of the country's gross domestic product -- 155.8 trillion yen, or about $1.5 trillion, in 1992, for example. (In comparison, the U.S. savings rate that year was 15 percent.) Japanese companies used the resulting tidal wave of low-cost capital to continuously upgrade their production processes and products. The low cost of capital was a major source of Japan's advantage in international markets. In 1978, for example, Toyota was able to borrow money at 6.42 percent interest in Japan, while its rival General Motors faced a prime rate of 9.06 percent in the United States.<p>In the glory years, the average Japanese citizen's thrift was part of a virtuous cycle. High export earnings -- made possible by the manufacturing efficiency financed by domestic savings -- fueled corporate profits and wage increases; these allowed the Japanese to save still more; in turn, this lowered the cost of capital to Japanese companies, enabling them to expand production and increase export earnings. While it worked, Japan posted remarkable rates of economic growth -- an average of 17 percent annual increases in GDP in the 1960s, 14 percent in the 1970s, and 7 percent as late as 1990.<p>So what went wrong?<p>The virtuous cycle, it turned out, had a weak link: export growth. As Japan grew larger and its export share in key industries -- such as VCRs, TVs, and automobiles -- increased, it ran up against a basic but bitter truth: No country can grow faster than its markets forever. For example, by 1988, the Japanese had captured 75 percent of the global market for VCRs. But by that time, the market was mature. In the U.S., the market for VCRs actually shrank by 9 percent between 1988 and 1989. To help keep the Japanese home economy growing at 10 percent a year, Japanese VCR makers struggled to capture more of this market -- a difficult task for companies facing competition from cheaper VCRs made in South Korea and Taiwan.<p>As Japan's growth slowed, the hunger for capital abated, but the country's savings machine rolled on, pumping ever increasing amounts of liquidity into a system that didn't need it. For a while, Japanese companies, believing that the era of rapid growth would one day return, continued to pour more money into expansion. But once new factories were built, many were forced to run below capacity. Gradually, companies began to scale back capital investment.<p>Which left a lot of capital looking for a home. From 1985 through 1993, the Japanese added a total of about 1.2 quadrillion yen -- or about $12 trillion -- to their national savings, an amount equal to twice the value of goods and services produced in the U.S. annually.<p>Imagine a huge fire hose writhing out of control as it spews water in every direction. That's how Japan's surplus savings, no longer absorbed in financing industrial expansion, flooded Japanese and world markets. Investors and speculators sent the value of the country's real estate soaring until the paper value of a country slightly smaller than California was four times that of all the real estate in the U.S. Valuations on the Tokyo exchange climbed and then climbed some more -- Tokyu Corp., for example, hit a price-to-earnings ratio of 500 in October 1989.<p>Japan's banks joined in the orgy. With the price of everything in sight going up, up, up, there seemed no way for a bank or its customers to lose money making real-estate loans. Banks felt especially flush because, like German banks, Japanese banks can take equity positions in industrial companies. With their portfolios bursting at the seams with rapidly appreciating stock, banks had plenty to lend.<p>Industrial companies got in on the act, too. They were no longer able to make money by expanding their share of foreign markets, but they could still make plenty of money at what the Japanese call zaiteku, a short-term investment strategy that puts excess corporate cash into futures, options, and other derivatives. Company treasurers played the stock and property markets -- and made fortunes. Those earnings then drove stock prices up -- and the higher stock prices drove earnings up again. This "bubble economy" resulted in the biggest bout of financial speculation since the 1920s.<p>The bubble may have burst, but the buddy-buddy financial system that produced it remains intact. Efforts at reform are at a standstill. Even something as simple as writing down bad investments has not proceeded very far.<p>No one knows just how bad the problems are at Japanese banks. Officially, the Japanese government estimates that bad loans in its banking system amount to $350 billion. Outsiders believe that this is wildly optimistic and that the real figure is $800 billion -- and may well go higher. (Compare this with the U.S. savings-and-loan disaster, where the best estimate puts the level of bad loans at $52 billion in an economy a third larger.) An alarmed Japanese government is keeping interest rates low and allowing banks to hide problems while frantically casting around for a long-term solution.<p>Meanwhile, Japan's political gridlock persists. An unbelievably corrupt and unresponsive political class can't come to grips with the painful decisions that need to be made. Lobbies and corporations with vested interests in the old system have blocked any real progress toward structural reform.<p>Essentially, Japan has three choices today. It can muddle on with an economic strategy that no longer makes sense. It can lower its savings rate until it is like those in other advanced countries. Or, and this increasingly seems the most likely course of action, it 
can boost spending and cut savings through expanded military spending. By increasing military spending over the next decade from its current level (between 1 and 2 percent of GDP) to something like 3 to 5 percent of GDP and investing in high-tech aerospace industries, Japan could revive its economy, challenge the U.S. and European duopoly on civilian aviation, and guard itself against the possibility that the U.S. will someday retreat from Asia even as China becomes stronger.<p>Although this last approach risks angering the many Japanese who remain pacifist and anti-militarist, their anger may be easier for politicians to face than the power of the vested interests who don't want the serious domestic reforms that are required. The increasing nationalism of Japanese politics and growing opposition to the U.S. military presence in Okinawa suggest that the Japanese consensus may be moving slowly toward what Americans used to call military Keynesianism.<p>In the short run, that might be good for Japanese stocks. In the long run, it is unlikely to be good for U.S.Japan relations, or the peace of East Asia.<p>Walter Mead is the presidential fellow at the World Policy Institute at the New School.

						By Todd G. Buchholz<p>Venezuela Hears the Fall of the Wall
The Berlin Wall came crashing down in 1989, but the reverberations from that symbol of socialist economic collapse continue to spread, most recently to Venezuela. <p>Populist president Rafael Caldera came to office in February 1994 promising a mixed socialist/capitalist economy. But after successive years of a declining gross domestic product, inflation that hit 70.9 percent in 1994 and 56.6 percent in 1995, and constant rumors of coups and riots, he has accepted a deal with the International Monetary Fund that requires him to end controls on interest and exchange rates.<p>How did Caldera manage to retain power despite such a dismal performance? In a word: oil. Venezuela exports millions of barrels of oil every year, producing a source of foreign revenue that keeps the nation's trade account in surplus.<p>In many ways, oil has been a curse for Latin America, allowing countries like Mexico and Venezuela to prop up huge and inefficient state-run industries. In the case of Venezuela, oil revenues also let the government curry favor with the public by maintaining artificially low gasoline prices. Now, however, Caldera has agreed to a gasoline sales tax, which will raise an estimated $1 billion annually. This revenue is badly needed to fight the government's deficit, which last year hit a worrisome 5.9 percent of GDP.<p>In return, the IMF, the World Bank, and the InterAmerican Development Bank have pledged up to $2.5 billion in aid, allowing Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff to float the bolivar against the U.S. dollar. Previously, Caldera's exchange-rate-control policy pegged the bolivar at 290 to the dollar, overvaluing it by about a third. The expected devaluation should help Venezuelan exports.<p>Caldera will also allow interest rates to float, and they should rise as a result. This means that borrowers and the banking industry will experience a near-term crunch. The average Venezuelan will feel it, too, as prices increase, government spending falls, and the bolivar buys less on the international market. In fact, under this plan, there is a good chance that Venezuela's 1996 numbers for GDP and inflation will be worse than 1995's.<p>So what's the point? Only by establishing fiscal credibility can emerging-market countries like Venezuela afford to borrow the money they need to build factories and create wealth. In fact, the announced reforms have already produced some positive results. Back in December 1995, Venezuela had to pay 6.4 percent more than the U.S. to borrow in the international Brady-bond market. By April 16, a few days before Caldera's reform speech, the spread had narrowed to 5.5 percent. That's a 14 percent cut in borrowing costs. The equity market has also embraced the reforms, with the Caracas Stock Exchange up about 85 percent since January 1. American depositary receipts traded in New York for Venezuelan steelmaker Sivensa and chemical maker Mantex have jumped by about 100 percent and 30 percent, respectively, since December 8, 1995.<p>Of course, much could go wrong. Savers may send their bolivars out of the country, which would devastate the financial sector. It's a touchy situation, but in the past five years, the Argentine and Brazilian markets have fought back against even higher inflation and longer odds. <p>Contributing editor Todd Buchholz is a managing director of a New York based international investment fund and the author of From Here to Economy: A Shortcut to Economic Literacy.<p> <p><p><p>

						May 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE  <p> By Pamela Black   <p> Last year the U.S. stock market returned 37.14 percent, leaving the rest of the developed world in the dustall those other markets combined returned just 11.41 percent, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International. But the ten-year figures show a very different picture: After corrections for the decline of the dollar, the U.S. barely makes the list of the ten developed countries with the highest average annual returns. Hong Kong, driven by hot growth in the Pacific basin, tops the lists in both local currency and dollars. But the U.S. also trails such slow-growth/strong-currency markets as Switzerland, where the market returned 9.55 percent annually in francs but 16.18 percent in dollars.  <p> Although the comparative performance of the U.S. market will improve if the dollar strengthens, Latin-American markets could be the new growth stars, according to Bill Wilby, director of Global Equities at Oppenheimer Mutual Funds. <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Columns  <p>  <p>SAFETY NYET <p>Conventional wisdom on Russia's future isn't worth a ruble. And have you priced the ruble lately?  <p>  <p>By Jim Rogers  <p>  <p>A popular investment refrain making the rounds today is that the former Soviet Union is an economically alluring place, perhap seven another Southeast Asia in the making. Franklin Templeton Group, an internationally savvy investment outfit, has started a Russia fund. Huge Western oil companies have sledded into Siberiato drill. Plans are afoot to export tens of millions of board feet of clear pine from Siberia to the U.S. Even <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's </b></a> is doing a brisk trade selling Quarter Pounders to the Russians.What's not to like? The opportunities seem immense; gargantuan fortunes are ripe to be plucked.  <p> Not with my money. As far as I'm concerned, the former Soviet Union is still the world's great economic, political, social, and military disaster in the making. It will be so for years, if not decades. It's not a good place to run a business, conducttours, operate a charity, have an artistic career, be a bureaucrat, or invest.  <p> The most important thing to understand about this part of the world is also the most obvious: It was an empire created from a collection of 170 separate nations and ethnic groups. It was the largest contiguous empire the world has ever known, covering more land mass than the empires of the Chinese, the Romans, the Spanish, or the British. The Soviet Union stretched across half of Europe and all of Asia, from the Baltic and the Danube to the Bering Sea and the Pacific, 9,000 miles in total--a span equal to the distance between London and Honolulu.  <p> It grew over the course of a thousand years. The czars pulled most of it together. But it was the Communists who finished the project of unifying--or attempting to unify--these 170 separate groups under one umbrella, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Given the current difficulties Russia is having policing Chechnya--a province the size of Connecticut, with 1.5 million people--I would say that keeping all of Russia's disparate groups together is going to be next to impossible.  <p> The Western press, however, appears to disagree with me. It believes that the time has come for healing now that the Soviet Union has split into 15 separate nations. The best and brightest  Russians are at the Harvard and Columbia business schools, and once they've mastered the lessons taught there, they will return to Russia, where, after a year or two of transition, they'll turn the country into a democratic powerhouse--or so the theory goes.  <p> I'm dubious. I predict further unraveling. Before it is over,I expect to see 50 countries, 100 countries. At the moment, few citizens in the former Soviet Union are paying attention to the empire's central government. I had a strong sense of this when I motorcycled across Russia on both the northern and southern routes--9,800 miles of mystery, beauty, and misery. I saw evidence everywhere of a collapsing society: rusting missiles, dilapidated military trucks, crops rotting in the fields, lakes filled with sewage, oil rigs in disrepair. Thanks to the Central Intelligence Agency, the U.S. never recognized that the Soviet Union was no more than a third-world country with a fine space program and a savvy chess team. We should have learned from the Soviets' war in Afghanistan that there wasn't much left to the once great Red Army. After all, Afghanistan has only 16.5 million people, and it's right next to the Soviet Union, not half a world away, as Vietnam, with its 70 million inhabitants, was for the U.S. <p> Authority in the former Soviet Union has devolved into the rule of the warlord, that political leader who always surfaces with the breakdown of central power, particularly during the crack-up of empires.  <p> History tells us that no empire lasts forever. With regard to the Soviet Union, a number of factors contributed to its breakdown, not the least of which was its effort to be a superpower on a third-world budget. Relying on a wacky economic theory didn't help matters, either.  <p> The larger the empire, the greater the disruption when it blows to pieces. We're still feeling the turbulence from the breakup of the Ottoman empire seven and eight decades later, through the unrest in Iran, Libya, Iraq, and Algeria. Only in the past few years have Mexico and Peru approached stability, more than a century after the Spanish empire crumbled in Latin America. <p> When an empire becomes unstable and lawless, a period ensuesin which warlord fights warlord. Today, Soviet warlords include gangs, the Mafia, dictators, liberators, and Communists. The so-called entrepreneurial spirit in Russia, about which we read so often, is actually nothing more than a spirited bout among thugs.  <p> There's an old investing adage, supposedly uttered by Nathan Rothschild: The best time to invest is when blood is in the streets. What he meant, probably assuming it too obvious to spell out at the time, was that the only smart time to invest is when a political and social situation is about to become stable, predictable. <p> But in the former Soviet Union, it's just the calm before the storm, the lull before total disaster. Much of Russian society is angry, bewildered, unable to understand what is happening. Very likely, the Russian people will welcome whichever demagogue makes the most lavish promises. Only a few years ago, the ruble was worth roughly a dollar; today, it takes about 5,000 rubles to buy a dollar. Inside a year, it will require 10,000; within three years, 100,000.  <p> Perhaps you're tempted to invest in a project to drill for oil in Siberia. Any such project will have to be developed under what will soon become yesterday's management. When the next provincial governor arrives, he'll explain that no one understood that your enterprise planned to take oil out of the province.  <p> You simply can't win when there is no court, no rule of law, no stability. At the Irkutsk Aluminum plant, which produces ingots that command foreign hard currency, the last six managing directors have been murdered. Scores of Soviet bank presidents have been shot as well. Meanwhile, the mafiosi, the warlords, the nomenklatura, the apparatchiks, and the insiders will be working hard to get their own money out of Russia and into Switzerland or some other haven. Shouldn't that tell you something?  <p> Profits made by foreigners will be taxed away, inflated away,or taken away, with the emphasis on "away." Own shares? The share register may be altered overnight. Or the Duma, the parliament, may declare contracts such as yours fraudulent.  <p> Insiders have already grabbed whatever buildings, factories,and stockpiles of raw materials were available--helping to trigger worldwide fire sales in titanium, uranium, gold, zinc, lead, platinum, and palladium--plus tanks, missiles, and planes.  <p> These sales won't go on much longer, because the whole infrastructure is falling apart. Plants are closed. Electricity, fuel, trucks, roads, phones, spare parts, rail cars, and rail track are all in short supply. Grain production has fallen drastically, and what is produced can barely be gotten to market before it rots. <p> Nobody knows precisely how bad things really are. None of the figures on trade, budgets, tax collection, and currency reserves under the Communists could be trusted, and it's worse now, as there's no central authority to gather the information and no cooperation from the former empire in collecting it. The Russians haven't made any meaningful payments on their debt in years. <p> Paradoxically, only maps of the former Soviet Union accurately foretell its future. If you look at a map for each of the past ten centuries, you'll notice a continent in constant change--borders shifting, alliances merging and separating. Tragically enough,the inhabitants of the former Soviet Union have been at war and killing one another for centuries.  <p> What might rise from the ashes of the USSR? Scores of phoenixes: brightly colored birds that can still be found in full plumage in the old maps. They include various linguistic, religious, tribal, and nationalistic groups, such as the Buriat Mongol tribes, the Tatars, and the Moldavian Republic.  <p> The only way I see an investor profiting from the situation in Russia is by buying commodities. As the raw materials produced chiefly by Russia dry up, an investor, expecting shortages, might purchase the materials or the means to produce oil, uranium, gold, zinc, lead, platinum, palladium, and titanium.  <p> I'm often asked why, if I'm so sure this is a bad time to invest in Russia, I think this is a good time to invest in Africa and Latin America. Surely the latter two regions are as destitute as any place on the planet.  <p> Little is as it appears. It's important to look not just for an emerging country but for emerging stability as well. Africa and Latin America have had their collapses and have learned their lessons; they've experienced unworkable theories and chaos. Their peoples want stability and are willing to fight for it.  <p> This summer, the Russians may hold an election to select their first president since the breakup of the union into 15 separate parts. But don't be fooled. The American press will have predictions about this election, handicapping who's ahead and who's behind--but the results will be totally meaningless. An enormous historical force is playing itself out. The collapse of the Soviet Union has only just begun.  <p> Jim Rogers is a contributing editor and the author of Investment Biker (Adams).  <p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> SIFTING THROUGH THE RUINS ABROAD <p>Finding a foreign fund can be tricky after two years of lousy returns  <p> By Andrew Feinberg  <p> Prognosticators of all stripes are touting the return of international stocks this year. The argument is pretty simple: The U.S. market is due for a breather, and foreign stocks are cheap after two tough years. The average European issue now trades at five times cash flow, notes Jean-Marie Eveillard, manager of the <a name="FUND:SGENX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SGENX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SoGen International</b></a> and <a name="FUND:SGOVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SGOVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SoGen Overseas funds</b></a> funds. "In the U.S., the multiple is ten for the Standard & Poor's 400 industrials," he says. In January,the average international fund outpaced the S&P 500 Stock Index, returning 3.81 percent compared with 3.4 percent for the S&P, according to Morningstar.  <p> But the mutual-fund investor who finds that scenario convincing or who simply wants to diversify a portfolio heavy with domestic securities still has to decide which international fund to buy. Certainly the average fund doesn't look too appealing. In 1994 foreign funds returned a negative 2.05 percent on average, according to Morningstar. Last year, the average fund earned an underwhelming 6.54 percent, trailing the S&P 500 Stock Index by some 30 percentage points. Although it's tempting to buy the fund that recently earned the highest return, this is not the best way to pick a foreign fund for the long haul.  <p> Instead, our selection formula starts with a close examination of performance (and what caused it), subtracts points for high sales charges, and then adds a bonus for  experience and an extensive overseas network of analysts.  <p> Foreign funds come in many flavors. Some invest mainly in the industrialized countries of Europe and Asia. Others add volatile emerging markets, such as Turkey and Brazil. International funds don't invest in the U.S., but global funds do.  <p> Why is this important? Because a fund's return depends on the combination of countries represented in its portfolio. Some funds, such as <a name="FUND:OEIAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/OEIAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>One Group International Equity Index</b></a>, approximate the country allocations of the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, AustralAsia, and Far East Index (EAFE). These are heavily skewed toward Japan, to which the EAFE allocates 40.3 percent of assets. Other funds, such as  GAM Asian funds, underrepresent Japan --  their portfolios more closely match a benchmark such as <a name="FUND:MSJEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MSJEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley's Far East</b></a> ex Japan index. The difference? EAFE  returned 9.42 percent last year compared with a negative 3.53 percent for Far East ex Japan.  <p> Country choice isn't the only strategic decision that influences performance. There's also asset allocation. <a name="FUND:GAMNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/GAMNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>GAM International</b></a>'s flexible charter lets the fund switch between stocks and bonds. In 1995, manager John Horseman buried the competition, returning 30.09 percent --  almost six percentage points better than the 24.39 percent earned by <a name="FUND:FPSSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FPSSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Founders Passport</b></a>, the second-best-performing international fund --  by placing heavy bets on German bonds and British utility companies. In fact, only 11 percent of GAM International's assets were in stocks. Founders Passport ran a completely different portfolio: 75 percent stocks and no bonds.GAM's performance varies so much from that of other foreign funds that Morningstar recently moved it to  a category called Multi-Asset Global, composed of funds that move freely between stocks and bonds.  <p> These differences make some funds more erratic than others. The more concentrated a fund is in a few countries, the more volatile it is likely to be. Right now, many funds have over40 percent of assets in just two. <a name="FUND:VWIGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VWIGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard International Growth</b></a>, for instance, had 29.2 percent of its assets in Japan and 13.6 percent in the U.K. as of February 15.  <p> To assure more consistent returns, start with funds that have at least a five-year track record. "Don't buy a fund with a record built on three great years and five mediocre ones," advises Ken Gregory, editor of The No-Load Fund Analyst  in Orinda, California. "The more consistency you see, the more likely that the record is based on talent, not luck."  <p> Standard deviation, a number found in Morningstar Mutual Funds and other investment newsletters, is one way to measure consistency. A high standard deviation means that annual returns vary more. <p> For example, GAM International has delivered average annual returns of 20.15 percent over the past five years  versus 14.7 percent for <a name="FUND:HWINX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HWINX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hotchkis & Wiley International Fund</b></a>. But GAM is farmore volatile. At 14.51 percent, its five-year standard deviation was third highest among foreign funds with five-year records as of December 31, 1995. Hotchkis & Wiley delivered its returns with a standard deviation of 12.27, which was near the group average.  <p> But standard deviation alone will not tell an investor which funds best combine return and consistency. That can be gleaned in part from a formula such as the Sharpe ratio, which calculate show much performance a fund delivers per unit of risk. Putting volatility and return together gives a slight edge to GAM International: Its Sharpe ratio is 1.21 to Hotchkis & Wiley's 1.11, which means GAM delivers more return per unit of risk.  <p> Unfortunately, neither standard deviation nor the Sharpe ratio considers sales charges, called loads. GAM International's class-Ashares carry a load of 5 percent, whereas Hotchkis & Wiley has no sales charge. The longer an investor holds a fund, the less the load matters, but in the short run, it can take a substantialbite out of returns. For example, GAM International's 5 percent load reduced the one-year rate of return for an investor who bought into the fund on January 1, 1995, to 23.59 percent from the 30.09 percent listed by Morningstar.  <p> No investor should rely solely on numbers to judge a fund's consistency and potential. International markets  are relatively inefficient, so managers can earn extra returns by finding undiscovered stocks. Here experience and  in-country contacts can make a big difference. The standard for investment expertise has been set fairly high by such old hands as Hakan Castegren and Mark Mobius. Castegren, who manages <a name="FUND:HAINX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HAINX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Harbor International</b></a>, has been buying foreign stocks for 35 years. "He has an incredible frame of referenceand a network built up around the world over time that a 28-year-old manager can't have," says Susan Belden, senior editor of The No-Load Fund Analyst. Mobius, who manages $7 billion in emerging-market funds for the Franklin Templeton fund group, travels ten months of the year to visit some 300 companies.  <p> Although Mobius researches most of the stocks he buys through personal visits, other fund managers can deliver  a similar degree of expertise by exploiting a network of foreign offices. For example, Rowe-Price Fleming, a joint venture between T. Rowe Price Associates and Robert Fleming Holdings, an investment-banking firm based in London, gives the T. Rowe Price International Stock fund access to more than 100 analysts located in 14 countries who follow 4,000 companies.  <p> When all these factors are considered, <a name="FUND:WIETX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/WIETX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Warburg Pincus International Equity Common Shares</b></a> (800-257-5614), Hotchkis & Wiley International (800-346-7301), and <a name="FUND:PRITX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRITX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price International Stock</b></a> (800-638-5660) are among the few funds that make the grade. Each has been around at least five years, cranking out consistent returns in the 14 percent range. Like the others, Hotchkis & Wiley has an experienced management team. Four managers, each  specializing in different countries of Europe and Asia, seek high yields and good values with the help of a network of about 100 overseas analysts.  <p> Of the three, Warburg Pincus has the highest five-year standard deviation, 13.94 percent, in part because it has the most exposure to volatile emerging markets. Hotchkis & Wiley has the lowest volatility: It uses high-yielding stocks as a cushion against downdrafts in the market.  <p><p>

						Japan's stock market is changing as industrial giants give way to more consumer-oriented companies  <p> By Marlene Piturro  <p> The Japanese market appears to be on the mend. After many gyrations,the widely followed Nikkei 225 stock-market index climbed from a new low last July of 14,485 to 20,751 on February 6, 1996. Thinking the worst was over, investors poured money into Japan mutual funds at a rate of $35 million to $40 million a week in January 1996, about twice the $18 million a week of a year earlier,according to AMG Data Services in Arcata, California.  <p> But Japan, like the U.S., has more than one stock market, and last year, these markets took different turns. Japan's Nikkei 225, which is similar to the Dow Jones Industrial average of 30 large-cap stocks, showed a total return of .74 percent in1995. The Topix, a more comprehensive market benchmark that resembles the U.S. Standard & Poor's 500, returned 1.19 percent. The Jasdaq, or over-the-counter market, lost 11.06 percent.  <p> Investors interested in buying a Japan fund that invests in a specific combination of these stock markets should know that Japan's market is undergoing a transition similar to that in the U.S. in the late 1970s. Older industrial giants are losing ground to younger, more consumer-oriented businesses, says Dan Duane, Pacific Basin portfolio manager for Prudential Securities. Although large-cap stocks may do well in the near term, he says, the best long-term picks are larger consumer-driven issues and over-the-counter stocks, particularly in electronics, real estate,and nonbank financial services such as credit cards.  <p> The 17 Japan funds now available to U.S. investors run the gamut of these markets. <a name="FUND:PRJPX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRJPX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price Japan Fund</b></a>, which declined 3.12 percent last year, according to Lipper Analytical Services, buys Japanese blue chips such as NEC and Mitsubishi, at discounts if possible. Co-manager Chris Alderson believes these companies are currently undervalued.   <p> By contrast, <a name="FUND:WEITX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/WEITX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Warburg Pincus Japan OTC Fund</b></a> scours the over-the-counter market for fast-growing small-company stocks. Co-manager Shuhei Abe likes companies that serve niche markets --  especially small retailers, computer makers, and construction firms --  and cancircumvent the inefficiencies of the Japanese economy. His 1995 return of negative 1.09 percent easily beat the Jasdaq.  <p> <a name="FUND:GAJCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/GAJCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>GAM Japan Capital Fund</b></a> manager Paul Kirkby takes an eclectic approach, starting with an industry group and then zeroing inon stocks he considers a good value. That strategy won him the top return among Japan funds last year (6.34  percent), when he favored technology, business services, and retail stocks over cyclicals. <p><p><p>

						While the nations of the First World stumble along in search of growth, some of the roller-coaster emerging-market economies will find it in 1996. Will it be China in the Year of the Pig, or Brazil in the year of low inflation? And what if Russia and the ruble melt down? Take a trip and find out.    <p>
 By Todd G. Buchholz  <p>
 Nineteen Ninety-five could have been written off before it began, so far as the emerging markets were concerned. That was due entirely to the December 1994 collapse of Mexico's economy and financial markets. Investors quickly transferred their loyalty, money, and attention to the mature markets and to such old reliables as U.S. Treasury bonds and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The U.S. did well in 1995, buoyed by long-term interest rates that fell throughout the year. But overall, the global investor had little to cheer about. Europe stayed stuck in the mud, with Germany's economy barely inching ahead and French unemployment stagnant at a dizzy 11.5 percent. Japan, meanwhile, looked on glumly as its economy continued to stall and the yen continued to climb.  <p>
 Unfortunately, 1996 is likely to be pretty much a repeat of last year, when the industrialized nations averaged roughly 2 to 2.5 percent growth. In fact, both Europe and the U.S. risk a slowdown, since consumers have piled up formidable amounts of debt, and though Japan may pull itself out of its funk by the second half of the year, its debt-ridden banking sector will limit any recovery.  <p>
 For investors, this means a return to emerging markets, which are able to rev up growth rates faster than the much larger mature economies. In fact, with their immense and rapidly growing populations, the emerging markets could, if all goes well, be the engine that pulls the rest of the world economy in 1996. I've focused below on five countries, including three in the the crucial Latin American region. As always, the enormous risks inherent in investing in these volatile markets loom above the rich rewards they sometimes provide.  <p>
 RUSSIA Even Russophiles find it difficult to make a convincing argument on behalf of Russian monetary policy. The reason is that no one is firmly in charge. Acting central bank chairwoman Tatyana Paramonova has restored credibility to the ruble after its 20 percent nose dive in value on Black Tuesday, October 11,1994, by resisting pressure to print more money and raising there serve requirements for banks. As a result, monthly inflation fell from about 15 percent in October 1994 to just over 4.7 percentin October 1995. Likewise, tradable Russian debt prices rallied impressively during the summer of 1995. The worry, given Paramonova's provisional status, is that she will be ousted and a more pliablefigure installed. If this happens, the markets domestic and foreign will see it as a signal that Yeltsin has sacrificed his monetary policy on the altar of politics.   <p>
 There's further reason for concern on the political front. On October 26, Yeltsin's heart problems brought debt prices down 2 percent, and the December 17 elections are sure to show a resurgent Communist yes, Communist party. Though these Communists claim they won't renationalize the economy but will merely stop further privatization, an electoral turn away from democracy will slow reform and discourage investors. And the importance of the December ballot pales beside the June presidential election.   <p>
 Obviously, investors in Russia need to keep an eye on these events, but so do those with holdings on the Continent. Crises in Russia tend to hurt the German deutsche mark and help the dollar (as a safe haven). Since Russia exports key commodities such as aluminum and oil, stocks of such companies as Alcoa and <a name="NYSE:XON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10537"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Exxon</b></a> may very well rise or fall depending on whether or not the elections suggest Russian industry will continue to modernize. In addition, there is always the fear that Russia's problems will spur massive emigration, creating political and fiscal problems for Germany. Finally, in an Eastern European version of the Tequila Effect (see Argentina below), Polish and Czech investments will certainly suffer if Russia erupts.   <p>
 CHINA Rumors about 91-year-old Communist leader Deng Xiaoping's health circulate constantly, while China sits in vigil and the world wonders what will happen after his death. With that enormous uncertainty in mind, we again can expect to find a central bank working to curtail credit and rein in inflation. Like Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve Board, Zhu Rongji (former governor of the People's Bank of China) and current governor Dai Xianglong have tried to engineer a soft landing for China's economy. Zhu successfully slowed inflation from about 25 percent in 1994 to near 1995's target of 15 percent. The growth rate of the gross domestic product seems to be around 9 percent. (The Chinese government does not have a reliable data-collection system, but anecdotal evidence consistently suggests prices are rising more slowly than last year and that the economy has lost some steam.)   <p>
 Tight money has pinched state-owned enterprises, which make up 40 to 50 percent of GDP. Even the Chinese government acknowledges that about half these ventures lose money, so the true percentage is far higher. This means hundreds of millions of Chinese work for unprofitable companies, which presents the government with a dilemma. It must downsize to stanch this fiscal hemorrhaging, but if it does so, the sheer number of people thrown out of work would threaten the legitimacy of the government. The state factory problem multiplies when you consider that smaller firms, often ruled by local warlords, supply components to the larger enterprises.  <p>
 The banking system is in equally bad shape. Four banks make up around 80 percent of all lending, which is heavily influenced by Beijing's interest in certain industries and provinces. The big four are holding an estimated $88 billion in bad debts, lent at artificially low rates to keep the state enterprises afloat. This sum is roughly half the size of the U.S. savings and loan bailout of the early 1990s. But the U.S. economy is many times the size of China's.   <p>
 China, like the U.S. (and Japan), must decide who will pay for the coming bailout. I have little doubt the government will ease credit conditions in late 1995 or early 1996 to alleviate, but not solve, some of its economic problems. The political costs of closing factories and banks are just too great. Meanwhile, on November 6, shares of China's state enterprises that trade in Hong Kong fell by as much as 13 percent on fears that the People's Bank would jack up interest rates.   <p>
 With nearly a billion citizens, China affects the entire global economy. In particular, China now imports agricultural goods, so a good year for China's GDP could mean more exports for farmers around the world. Capital investment from the industrialized nations, all of which want early access to this huge market, has grown explosively from around $7 billion in1992, to $34 billion in 1994. The Japanese have seemed more intent on building new factories in China than at home, and U.S. firms from <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> to <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a> to <a name="NYSE:BA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10221"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boeing</b></a> to <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> can't wait to sell, or sell more, to the "middle kingdom."   <p>
 But while cheap consumer goods like cigarettes and soft drinks are likely to generate immediate profits, the outlook for capital-intensive industry is unclear, and the stock prices of these companies may come to reflect this uncertainty as their investment in China grows.   <p>
 MEXICO The great economist Joseph Schumpeter once said that economies sometimes can find a recession reinvigorating, like a cold shower. But the Mexican peso crash was more like drowning in a polluted river. It produced a 10.5 percent contraction in the second quarter of 1995 and a record number of bankruptcies. Even efficient firms can go out of business when short-term interest rates hit 45 percent.   <p>
 In 1996, with unemployment rising and his political mandate in doubt, President Ernesto Zedillo will be tempted to inflate the economy. In fact, without further foreign aid or domestic pump-priming, the economy is headed for, perhaps, 2 percent GDP growth in 1996 woefully inadequate for a country whose population is climbing rapidly and whose workers have seen only meager wage gains over the past 15 years.  <p>
 Meanwhile, the peso seems to be evaporating. Before its collapse in December 1994, it traded at about 3.5 to the U.S. dollar. By spring, the government thought it might be able to establish a stable trading band at around 6 pesos to the dollar. Right now, the government would be lucky to make 7.25 a credible, durable number. Finally, Mexico's recovery also requires a strong U.S. economy. A slowdown here, which many economists expect, could doom Mexico's chances of positive growth in 1996.   <p>
 ARGENTINA The Mexican peso devaluation debacle created a so-called Tequila Effect, a shock wave of investor disenchantment that depressed the stocks and bonds of all the other Latin American markets.   <p>
 The Tequila Effect hit Argentina particularly hard, causing a recession and unemployment of nearly 20 percent, up from 6 percent as recently as 1991. The Merval stock index began recoveringnicely during late July and early August, but it has since dipped sharply. This was a surprise to many analysts, who looked forArgentina to diverge from Mexico with its drastically different economic policies. Mexico's central bank, officially independent, remains under the influence of the finance ministry and the president, while Argentina, under Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's "Convertibility Plan," directly links the supply of Argentine pesos to the supply of foreign reserves held by the central bank.   <p>
 After Mexico devalued its peso, Cavallo feared a run on his nation's banks. To forestall this, he offered to redeem Argentine pesos for U.S. dollars on a one-for-one basis, since each peso is effectively backed by a dollar in reserves (in fact, Cavallo exaggerated the extent of the backing). This convertibility arrangement boosted confidence in the currency but leaves Argentina at the mercy of foreigners to fund growth, since the bank can't print more pesos. There's the rub: When foreigners don't feel like investing in your country, and your country falls into recession, what can you do? Pray, pretend, and wait.   <p>
 That's been the Argentine policy since December 1994. Argentines have prayed for foreigners to come back in, at least to purchase floating-rate bonds paying around 15 percent. They have pretended that the economy was growing, with Cavallo insisting on a 3 percent growth rate in 1995, even as the numbers were rolling in on the negative side. And they have waited for the world economy to pick up, which would spur exports and capital inflows.   <p>
 So far, however, not much has worked, and in 1996 Argentina must pay the U.S. $10 billion in outstanding loans. In sum, Cavallo has developed a policy that creates great sympathy and credibility among foreigners he's a virtual poster boy for the International Monetary Fund but that doesn't help him or President Carlos Menemget the country back on its feet. The situation is complicated because Menem and Cavallo, longtime political rivals, seem to enjoy undercutting each other.   <p>
 Each time Cavallo has visited Wall Street, the analysts have been taken in by his charm and competence. But the luster is wearing off and, with it, so are the hopes for a good year in the Argentine market.  <p>
 BRAZIL Not all Latin economies are shrinking. Brazil was humming along too fast in the spring of 1995, creating inflation worries with first-quarter GDP growth over 10 percent. Consumers went on a buying spree, quickly dissipating a $10 billion trade surplus, but over the summer and fall, the economy slowed to a sustainable 5 to 6 percent growth rate.   <p>
 Why, then, has the stock market performed so miserably since September? First, the Tequila Effect. Second, the central bank may have squeezed the money supply too hard in order to strangle the double-digit growth of the first quarter. Retailers now have stockpiled inventory, bankruptcies have jumped, and jobless numbers are up in Sao Paulo. Third, the government raised import tariffs, causing domestic producers to raise prices. Fourth, nobody knows if President Henrique Fernando Cardoso has the power to push his free-market reforms through congress.  <p>
 This is the big issue for Wall Street. The smart money knows that the Brazilian economy is in pretty good shape, and that alone is quite an accomplishment. As recently as June 1994, Brazil's monthly inflation was 50 percent. Today it's down to around 1 percent. Still, investors want proof that Cardoso can convince congress to bust the state oil monopoly, reform the mining industry, open up financial services, and privatize more of Brazil's still huge public sector. Cardoso is a quiet, scholarly persuader and consensus seeker, but 1996 will show whether nice guys can finish first in Brazil.   <p>
 Overall, Latin America presents a mixed picture this year, particularly with the drag on the region from Argentina and Mexico. A good year would mean no calamities. Perhaps the headline for December31, 1996, will be "Narrow escape!"  <p>
 In 1995 U.S. investors reaped enormous gains amid a sluggish world economy. This performance will be tough to repeat. Our success was based on two key factors: the continuing fall in interest rates, and the competitiveness of U.S. firms stealing market shares around the world. Our exporters will still have the edge in 1996, though we can't expect interest rates to continue their march toward zero. It's shaping up as a sluggish year for big trading partners in the developed world, which could slow exports, at least until the second half. While the emerging markets could shift into dramatically higher growth rates, they standan equal or better chance of falling apart. In sum, families around the world just don't feel good about their job prospects or their spending plans. (Will our circus-like presidential election year lift or quash spirits?) It's a tough environment in which to be an optimist.   <p>

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Experts  <p> LANDS OF DISENCHANTMENT   <p> By Walter Mead  <p> Is the emerging-markets boom over? Returns from investments in up-and-comers such as Mexico, Thailand, and Brazil have been lousy this year. Mexico is down 37 percent, in dollar terms, for the year (through early September), Brazil down 21 percent, and Thailand down 4 percent.  <p> But performance numbers like those don't signal the end of anything. In fact, they represent business as usual for the emerging markets. Investors in these markets are used to meltdowns, and to the brutal, hard months being balanced by torrid seasons of two-digit and even three-digit returns. In 1993, for example, Hong Kong was up 117 percent and Turkey up 220 percent.  <p> In the long run those who stayed with emerging markets made more money because of those extremes. Ride out the volatility, said the best investment gurus. A market crash is a buying opportunity. Those who listened, prospered. Investors, of course, behave like Pavlov's dog: Before long, every time the bell rang to announce a new emerging market, investors began drooling. For example, the Templeton Developing Markets fund saw a 678 percent increase in net assets in 1993 (from $180 million to $1.4 billion).  <p> But as difficult as it is to discern a trend when the month-to-month numbers show more ups and downs than a Coney Island roller coaster, I detect signs that the mad doctor is changing the nature ofthe experiment. First, volatility seems to be increasing. Strangely enough, the end of the Cold War may be to blame. Second, and more important, developing nations are becoming hostile to foreign portfolio capital. U.S.based mutual fund investors may in the future find it harder to put money into the most attractive markets. <p> At the end of the Cold War, many investors leapt to the conclusion that the world would be a peaceful, stable place now that it was no longer divided into two armed camps poised to annihilate each other. Today, that no longer looks like such a safe bet. When leadership struggles in China cloud the future, Hong Kong's stock market drops like a stone. When China tests missiles in Taiwan's neighborhood, stock markets swoon all over Asia. And well they should. A war there could wipe out all the paper profits investors have made over the last 20 years.   <p> This isn't just fantasy. It happens. In the 1920s, Western journalists gushed about Shanghai, the "city of the future," and Western investors poured money into China. The world's largest market! The giant of the future! You can't afford to miss it! What the Japanese didn't destroy, the Communists took. Investors lost every dime.  <p> Local wars have affected stock markets more than did the threat that the superpowers would turn the world into a radioactive cinder, maybe because it's hard to figure out a safe haven for money in a postapocalyptic world. And with the East/West balance of power no longer a restraint on the ambitions of client states, the outcome and extent of local wars are far more uncertain. The war in Bosnia, for example, is so intractable because Russia doesn't have nearly the clout with the Serbs that the old Soviet Union would have had.  <p> Still, investors will get used to this increase in volatility, given enough time. The more risk averse will leave emerging markets. Investors with stronger stomachs will demand higher rates of return to make up for the increased uncertainty.  <p> But investors will have a much harder time adapting to the second change in emerging-markets investing. Call it disenchantment risk. Emerging markets are not as interested in emerging as they used to be, and the governments of developing countries want foreign investors to pay a higher price to participate in their growth. Third-world countries and Eastern European nations are starting to realize that foreign portfolio investment can lead to chaos in their financial markets and economies.   <p> The recent Mexican crisis has played a major role in this seachange in thinking about foreign investment. It wasn't just U.S. investors who got a nasty shock when Mexico's stock market crashed. Companies throughout Mexico suddenly found themselves unable to raise capital at reasonable cost--or at all. The average Mexican saw his standard of living plummet.   <p> In Mexico, the loss of faith is palpable. The boom-and-bust cycle of the 1990s followed the boom and bust of the '80s, and the economy has been undergoing "reforms" since the debt crisis of 1982. During all that time, Mexico has faithfully, if slowly, heeded the advice of the United States and of international financial organizations like the International Monetary Fund. But the Mexican strategy--opening domestic-goods markets to spur competition, keeping the currency at a high level, and opening capital markets to attract investment--no longer looks very attractive.  <p> "We told you so," say the Chileans, who rejected this model after their economic crash in 1982. The Chileans never had much faith in this approach--since 1982, Chilean policy has been almost the opposite of Mexico's. The key is the currency. Mexico tried to keep its currency high to cut inflation, but the result was a gradual accumulation of risks that finally triggered a massive slide. The high, apparently stable value of the Mexican peso helped lower inflation. Foreign goods, made artificially cheap by the high peso, rushed into the country, forcing Mexican producers to compete with the world's best. As the high peso forced Mexican industry into a major restructuring, foreign capital poured in. <p> For a while, this strategy worked, and long-standing problemsseemed unimportant. Corruption, inefficiency, one-party rule: nobody cared. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari got himself elected to the board of directors of Dow Jones--where he still sits today, to the considerable embarrassment of the company's flagship publication, The Wall Street Journal.   <p> But fundamentally, this was a development strategy based on hot money, the easy-in, easy-out flows controlled by mutual fund managers and individual investors who can abandon a market with a phone call. The high peso exchange rate, supported by the government, contributed to a current-account deficit. (The current account is the net of exports minus imports plus investment income.) Mexico's prosperity therefore depended on a positive flow of investment capital. The amount of money foreigners invested in the country had to be greater than the total of the trade deficitand the amount Mexicans invested abroad.   <p> When the crash finally came, many observers blamed it on foreigners fleeing the Mexican market. In fact, the story was more complex. Initially, it was the flight of Mexican capital that caused the crisis. Big Mexican investors looked to the future of the peso, and they didn't like what they saw. They cashed out of Mexico and took their money elsewhere.   <p> And then the foreigners started to bail out. Mexico's peso and stock market collapsed, and the economy followed. Mexico's economy shrank by more than 10 percent from mid-1994 to mid-1995; there is more still to come. Meanwhile Mexico must now listen to the Monday-morning quarterbacks of the economic-policy world. The same people who used to praise Mexico and tout it as an example to other developing countries now can't say enough about how wrongheaded the Mexicans were and how much harder they've got to work before they genuinely manage to reform their economy.  <p> The lesson wasn't lost on developing and transitional countries. Dependence on hot money is bad, many have concluded.  <p> Take Hungary. Once it was the Eastern European darling of foreign investors, but after Mexico everybody took another look. With a serious current-account deficit balanced by inflows of hot foreign capital, Hungary suddenly looked like Mexico with goulash. Meanwhile, Hungarians began to have second thoughts about selling equity control of major enterprises to foreign interests. As disputes between Hungarian and foreign bidders mount, Hungary's once-promising privatization program has slowed to a crawl.  <p> Then there's Taiwan. Long under pressure to open its capital markets to foreign investors, Taiwan recently passed a law that ostensibly does just that. Foreign money-fund managers have been shocked to discover that the new law actually tightens key restrictions. More surprising still, Taiwan took this risky step while its market was weak. Keeping foreign investors happy just wasn't a priority.   <p> Brazil has also changed its ways. I was there last February, and I returned this August to a very different country. In order to avoid Mexico's fate, Brazil was taking strong steps both to close its current-account deficit (by protecting key industries like auto making) and to restrict the influx of foreign portfolio capital. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, whose successful anti-inflation program and commitment to economic reform made him a hero to foreign money managers, recently announced plans to impose a 15 percent capital-gains tax on foreign portfolio investors.   <p> Other countries, including Russia, India, Cuba, and the Philippines, are examining whether rapidly opening their capital and goods markets is such a good idea. Sometimes for reasons of national pride, sometimes for economic reasons, policy makers in these countries urge more caution.   <p> Countries such as Brazil are switching to other development models. Many of these involve tight controls on foreign capital, and most can trace their roots back to the successful Pacific Rim economies of East Asia.   <p>  In the last generation, countries like Taiwan and Japan have moved from poverty to affluence with a policy mix that to a large extent is the opposite of what Mexico adopted in the 1980s. While Mexico welcomed foreign goods and foreign portfolio investment and kept its currency artificially high, these countries kept foreign goods out, zealously limited the role of foreign portfolio investment, and kept their currencies as cheap as possible against the dollar. Instead of relying on foreign portfolio investors, these economies generated the investment capital they needed through domestic savings. Savings rates in these countries show how this worked: In 1993, the savings rates in Japan and Taiwan were, respectively, 32.7 percent and 28 percent of gross domestic product. Compare this with the U.S. at 15.2 percent, Mexico at15.9 percent, and Argentina (another hot-money economy) at 16.5 percent. (This measure of savings, unlike the more commonly cited household savings rate, includes all corporate savings, investment in plants, equipment, etc.)  <p> Historically, countries have had another reason for wanting to control access to their capital markets. It wasn't just that they wanted security from the side effects of huge hot-money tides sloshing in and out of their economies; they also wanted national control of their national economies. The Japanese did not want the Americans to own the crown jewels of their economy. The South Koreans still don't want to see Japanese investors taking over the commanding heights of their economy.   <p> This motivation remains very strong--at least outside Japan, where there is no longer much fear that foreigners will buy up all of the country's stocks--and has produced some of the capitalist world's most restrictive investment policies. The American investor cannot call his broker to order a stock in Taiwan or in China today. Direct ownership of stock remains difficult for foreigners, and there are limits the equity stakes foreign investors can own.   <p> American mutual funds and their investors are likely to find the welcome distinctively chillier in many developing countries as the countries adopt this Pacific Rim strategy. The speed of the liberalization of capital markets in these countries will slow down; in some cases the liberalization process could actually move into reverse. And, to the chagrin of foreign investors and money managers, some of the most closed markets may be among the most attractive.   <p> In fact, this makes sense--from the standpoint of a developing country. If your policies and accomplishments make your country one of the most promising places in the world to invest, why shouldn't foreigners pay a premium to invest in your market? If your people are developing the skills to run their own world-class enterprises, and if they are saving enough to generate most of the new capital your industry needs, why shouldn't you ensure that control of local business remains in local hands?   <p> The old paradigm of economic development assumed that as more countries around the world developed, global capital markets would become more integrated. National governments would lose control of their economic policies as the international capital markets forced all countries to compete for scarce investment capital. But suppose high savings rates--as in East Asia--reduce the need of successful economies to import capital from abroad? In that case, economic development could lead to a new era of independent national capital markets with relatively high barriers to foreign portfolio investors.   <p> If that begins to happen, wise foreign portfolio investors will want to move to the sidelines. The only foreign economies that would need massive portfolio investment from abroad would be weak ones that could not rely on internal savings. Investors could do worse than to remember the classic investment advice of Groucho Marx: "Please accept my resignation," he wrote. "I don't care to belong to any club that will accept me as a member."  <p>  <p>Walter Mead is the Presidential Fellow at the World Policy Institute at the New School.

						The U.S. right and left would both be uncomforable if they truly understood why Chile's economy if booming.<p>By Walter Mead<p>It didn't take me long to lose my bearings in Chile. <p>I stepped out of a cab in the capital city, Santiago. Across the street I could see the presidential residence, still scarred from fighting during the 1973 coup. Looking up at a street sign, I realized I was in trouble.<p>I had asked the taxi driver in my best gutter Spanish to let me out at the corner of Teatinos and Alameda for an appointment at the foreign ministry. But here I was with just five minutes to spare, and I seemed to be at the corner of Teatinos and Avenida O'Higgins, an enormous street named, like almost everything large and impressive in Chile, for Bernardo O'Higgins, who liberated Chile from Spain in 1817. "Donde esta la Ministeria de Relaciones Extraneros?" I asked the military guards in front of the Presidential Palace. Helpfully, the guards pointed to all points of the compass.<p>I cursed the taxi driver, the wretched state of my Spanish, the baffling city, and, most of all, my own stupidity in assuming that I knew where I was going.<p>
As I passed the Plaza de Armas, again, I began to hunt for a pay phone, a sure sign of desperation in South America. The statue of Pedro de Valdivia, the Spanish conquistador who founded Santiago, caught my eye. Unlike his colleagues Corts and Pizarro, Valdivia never actually conquered the local indigenous tribes. After founding the city in 1541, he lived to see it reduced to a smoldering ruin. Valdivia himself was captured by his native opponents and dispatched by having molten gold poured down his throat.<p>Suddenly I heard my name. "Senor Mead?"<p>It was my contact at the foreign ministry, come down to look for me. As it turns out, Avenida O'Higgins is the official name of the street; Alameda is what everybody calls it. I had been wandering around in circles. <p>Chile has been baffling North Americans for a long time. Usually, it's our own fault. We lump the country together with the rest of Latin America. Like Valdivia, we know almost nothing about the locals. And we see everything as either black or white. <p>That's what happened to Amasa Delano, whose tale of self-deception inspired "Benito Cereno," a short story by Melville (and later an opera by Britten). In 1803 an American sealing ran into the Benito Cereno, a becalmed and bedraggled Spanish ship with a cargo of African slaves. The Americans offered the Spaniards provisions and sails, but the Spanish captain was strangely ungrateful--so much so that Delano, the Yankee captain, began to suspect that the captain intended to murder the Yankees in their sleep. The Americans discovered the truth only when the slaves, who had mutinied, attacked them by surprise. The slaves had kept the captain alive to sail them back to Africa.<p>In Melville's story, Delano was haunted for the rest of his life by his actions: He realized that his own assumptions about the natural order of things had blinded him to the possibility that the slave had become the master, and while he knew he had acted in self-defense in his bloody suppression of the revolt, he had also condemned the surviving slaves to a life of horror.<p>Contemporary Americans approach Chile with their own blinders. The country has become a counter in the continuing argument in this country between right and left about the proper role of government in an economy. In 1973 the United States supported a military coup against the freely elected Marxist government of Salvador Allende. The military regime, headed by Agusto Pinochet, restored order by torturing and killing its opponents.<p>But the Pinochet government, unlike, say, the similarly repressive and contemporaneous military regime in Argentina, also rebuilt the Chilean economy. It pioneered radical free-market policies in everything from telecommunications to public finance. Although Chile was hit badly--and the Pinochet regime deeply shaken--by a major economic crisis in 1982, over the last decade Chile has enjoyed an economic boom. Growth has averaged 6.3 percent for the past ten years. In 1990 Pinochet turned over power to an elected successor.<p>Free-market economists and policy gurus in the United States see the Pinochet dictatorship as a painful but necessary period of reform. Want to know how to "fix" Mexico? Look at Chile. Get the government out of the economy. Put a strong central bank in charge of creating a sound and unmanipulated currency. Privatize wherever possible. There are even lessons here for the United States, they argue. The Chileans have recently privatized their old-age pension system; wouldn't something similar solve the Social Security crisis in the United States?<p>But I couldn't shake the tale of poor Amasa Delano as I listened to these experts and their opponents. I wondered whether, once again, we North Americans were seeing Chile only in terms of our own domestic categories of white and black. I wondered whether, in our anxiety to settle our domestic political battles over the role of government in the U.S. economy, we had again misinterpreted Chile.<p>To understand Chile and Chilean economics, start with the giant open-pit copper mine at Chuquicamata--the largest man-made hole in the ground in the world. Like much of the American West, Chile has had an economy based on mining for the past hundred years, with booms, busts, and violent social protests exploding with the discovery of new deposits, the exhaustion of old ones, and every swing in international commodity prices.<p>Chile's most important mines lie in the vast deserts of the north. Imagine an American West without the fertile fields of coastal California--one where the waves of the Pacific break directly on the dry sands of Death Valley. And then think drier, a lot drier.
To get to Chuquicamata, I set out from Antofagasta, an important port city in northern Chile that once belonged to Bolivia. The cold Pacific currents create a rich fishery offshore, but they also block any eastward flow of moisture. The mountains behind the city provide rich mineral deposits, but they cut off any stray moisture from the Atlantic. The resulting desert--the Atacama--is the driest spot on earth.<p>Nitrates, once used both as a fertilizer and as an ingredient in gunpowder, first made this region a cockpit of international politics. British investors, interested in exploiting the region's rich deposits and alarmed at the unstable, xenophobic policies of Bolivia, tacitly supported Chile's annexation of the region in the 187981 War of the Pacific. Nitrate mining, largely controlled by the British, boomed after the Chilean conquest--until German chemists, cut off from natural nitrate by the British naval blockade, learned to make synthetic replacements during World War I.<p>Fortunately for Chile, the copper boom started just as nitrate mining went bust. Huge copper discoveries early in the 20th century led to the development of the largest copper reserves anywhere and what remains Chile's largest industry. Mining at Chuquicamata, now a half mile deep, two and a half miles across, and a mile and a half wide, began in 1917.<p>As I wandered among the huge ore-crushing machines and watched enormous buckets of molten copper being poured into molds, I realized how much of Chile's future will be shaped by its past. This single copper mine still produces 20 percent of Chile's total export earnings. With huge untouched reserves, Chile will be a major copper producer for the foreseeable future.<p>For almost a century, Chilean miners battled foreign mining companies--often U.S.--over control of the wealth that came out of this ground. The Chilean government, dependent on foreign financiers for its capital, usually sided with the mining companies. In 1907, for example, hundreds of miners and their relatives were killed by government forces after a long, bitter strike.<p>
For most of the 20th century this logic of confrontation has determined Chilean politics. Many Chileans viewed foreign investors as cynical, ruthless exploiters; the Chilean bankers and politicians who worked closely with foreign capital were seen as Benedict Arnolds willing to oppress their own people to keep their high-paid jobs. The country's economic elite, on the other hand, believed that giving in to the economic and political demands of the poor would ruin the country. Desperately and without success, some politicians, most notably the Christian Democrats, tried to create a "third way."<p>Chuquicamata played a central role in the most recent reenactment of this confrontation. In 1970, when the Socialist party candidate Salvador Allende was elected by a minority (36 percent of the vote in a three-way race) and tried to put through a radical program that would have given Chile a Cuban-style economic system, one of his first acts was to nationalize the Chuquicamata mine. During the Pinochet years, the military turned one of the ghost towns that had housed militant miners into a concentration camp for political prisoners. Today that town has returned to the ownership of its ghosts. As I toured it on foot, passing the parade ground, the theater, the barracks where both miners and prisoners had lived, I could make out the graffiti left on the crumbling walls. More than 1,000 people were killed in Pinochet's coup, and thousands more were arrested and tortured while Pinochet was in power.<p>Today, 22 years after the coup, the mine still belongs to the national government. Far from selling off this crown jewel of Chilean industry or returning it to the original owners, the military has reserved 10 percent of the state copper earnings for its own permanent budget.<p>Codelco, the state company that runs the mine, is much better managed than the average state-owned enterprise in South America. The payroll isn't nearly as bloated with make-work jobs. Staff layoffs have cut 7,000 jobs from a payroll of 27,000 since 1990, and restructuring continues. Mature mines like Chuquicamata are usually less efficient than newer ones, yet at 64 cents per pound and falling, Chuquicamata's costs are well below the international price of copper. The mine's managers know that it must remain competitive on the world market.<p>I noticed the same pragmatic mix elsewhere in Chile. Government-sponsored television ads call on Chileans to make the elimination of poverty a national priority at the same time that Chile's technocrats and businessmen preach that the free market can transform Chile.<p>After decades of class warfare, has the "Concertacion"--the five-party coalition that now governs Chile, led by the same Christian Democrats whose pre-Pinochet quest for a "third way" ended in costly failure--finally found that middle path?<p>Just as the mine at Chuquicamata stands for the old Chile, the telephone symbolizes the new. The innocent-looking pay phones and hotel telephones of Latin America have broken many a North American heart over the years. In my travels in South America, I've repeatedly had to abandon the phone in my hotel and do what the natives do: go to telephones at the post office and stand in line.<p>Chile these days reminds me of home--that wonderful country where the phone companies send me checks so I'll change my service. Billboards on the road from the airport are plastered with the salvos of a good old-fashioned price war among telephone carriers. International telephone calls are easy to make and inexpensive. Chile may have the cheapest international telephone rates anywhere in the world outside the U.S.<p>It is all, explained Jorge Rosenblut, a bearded and energetic young official in the Chilean telecommunications ministry, part of the government's strategy to gain a competitive advantage for Chile in international markets. Telephone service is a basic cost of doing business; if the nation lowers telephone costs and makes new lines easy to get, business will boom.<p>The classic Latin American approach to fixing the phone service would be to invest government funds in the telephone monopoly. In Chile, the government provides occasional subsidies and favorable deals for telephone companies that meet social needs--such as providing service in rural areas--but generally restricts its role to creating a favorable regulatory climate for private companies. Competition does the rest.<p>For Rosenblut, this is only the start. Telecommunications, he told me, is a linchpin of Chile's broader modernization strategy. In the coming "third wave" service and information-based economy, Chile hopes to position itself as a communications hub for Latin America. With the government pushing a new transpacific cable to improve links to Asia and with Chile already handling calls from neighboring countries with inadequate telephone services, Rosenblut said, Chile is poised to serve as a "hinge" between Latin America and Asia in the emerging new era.<p>It was all visionary and exciting, but I was somewhat perplexed. Third wave, competition, a level playing field--those all sounded like Newt Gingrich. But the government targeting telecommunications as a crucial future industry? That sounded like--dare I speak the words--industrial policy. In a country that had become a potent international symbol of laissez-faire economics, Rosenblut's ministry was picking winners, a strategy derided by free-market economists.<p>Well, I thought, what else could I expect from a bureaucrat? Things would be different at that traditional home of free-market orthodoxy, the stock exchange. Founded in 1893, the Santiago Stock Exchange has enjoyed some stellar returns lately--notably in 1991, when the general index rose 166 percent in a year. Surely I wouldn't find any critique of the free market there.<p>
Pablo Yrarrazaval, the chairman of the exchange, wasn't having a good day when I arrived. Stock markets throughout Latin America were in a free fall as a result of capital flight following the Mexican crash. The Chilean financial markets were near panic as I sipped my hot sweet coffee in an office cushioned by Yrarrazaval's collection of Oriental rugs.<p>Chile's investment policies, as Yrarrazaval explained them, are simple but, once again, hard to classify. If you are a foreign direct investor, Chile wants you badly. New factories build up the country, and as Yrarrazaval and others reminded me, if foreign direct investors panic, they can't take the factory with them. <p>On the other hand, Chile views portfolio investors, such as U.S.run mutual funds, with a certain suspicion. Hot money can pour in from abroad in good times and pour out in bad, doing damage either way. Too much foreign money in a small country like Chile can change the supply and demand equation for the local currency and drive the value of the currency up so far that the country's exports are no longer competitive. On the other hand, if foreigners panic, hot money can leave the country even faster than it came in. Just look at Mexico.<p>So a foreign investor is free to put money into the Chilean stock market, but that money has to stay in the country for a year. This doesn't affect long-term investors, but it does discourage speculators. The country can afford to be choosy now. In 1994 almost $5 billion in foreign investment came into the country. This all seems eminently sensible, but it isn't laissez-faire.<p>Nor, it turns out, is the vaunted Chilean experiment in privatizing the country's old-age pension system. Sometimes mentioned as a model for reform of the U.S. Social Security system, the Chilean private pension system has been praised as an example of how to get government out of the pension business. Instead of paying Social Security tax to the government and then drawing a pension in retirement, Chilean workers are required to invest a fixed percentage of their pay in one of a number of licensed pension companies. These companies act as money managers, investing the savings of Chilean employees in stocks and bonds.<p>It looks like another retreat by the Chilean state out of the business of managing the economy, but once again initial impressions are misleading. The pension funds have to be regulated, Yrarrazaval explained; otherwise funds might take too many risks and go bankrupt--leaving thousands of people with no income in retirement. Most of these regulations are commonsensical and might well be warmly welcomed by investors in U.S. mutual funds: limiting the types of bonds pension funds can buy, restricting their stock purchases to well-established blue-chip companies, and so forth. But most crucially, the pension funds must invest no less than 90 percent of their assets in Chilean stocks and bonds. <p>From a portfolio manager's perspective, this is a foolish regulation; it actually increases the chance of a fund crash. Few money managers would recommend a portfolio that put 90 percent of assets in Chile and only 10 percent in the rest of the world.<p>But what is bad for individuals can be good for the group. The large pool of captive savings represented by the investment in Chilean pension funds can be used for the expansion of Chilean businesses. Furthermore, this pool of savings gives Chile some insurance against capital flight. Rich Latin Americans are notoriously quick to get their money out of a country when trouble threatens. The regulations of the Chilean pension system deny poor Chileans this safety valve, but by ensuring that some capital will remain in the country they also insulate Chile from the worst effects of capital flight. A Marxist might say that the Chilean elite is using the savings of the poor to safeguard the wealth of the rich--and the Marxist would be right. On the other hand, the Chilean pension system also helps protect the jobs of the poor by cushioning the effects of economic shocks.<p>The more I learned about the Chilean economy, the more I felt it reflected a careful strategic plan rather than market forces. An interview with one of the chief architects of the contemporary Chilean economy, Roberto Zahler, president of the Central Bank, cemented that conviction.
According to Zahler, 1982 was a watershed in modern Chilean economic history. That year the country, which had adopted a free-wheeling financial system influenced by the monetarist and free-market teachings of the Chicago school of economics, plunged into a deep depression. A set of policies that might have worked well for a developed country with control over its own currency instead produced a dependence on foreign portfolio investment and a radically overvalued currency.<p>After a period of indecision and debate, Chile's economic strategists moved decisively away from these doctrinaire free-market theories to something much more like the economic model practiced in East Asian countries such as Taiwan, one that stresses control over capital flows, discourages domestic consumption, and systematically promotes exports and savings.<p>For example, while Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil in recent years have all tried to keep their currencies at high levels, Chile has deliberately chosen to push the value of its peso down, keeping Chilean exports competitive in international markets. At the same time, Chile's central bank works to prevent the domestic economy from overheating by keeping domestic interest rates high. <p>The results so far have been more than encouraging. "We may not be a tiger yet," one businessman told me, referring to the economic tigers of East Asia, "but we are already a jaguar."<p>Santiago, a city of 5.5 million people at the foot of the Andean mountains, stretches out for miles like a Los Angeles without freeways. To get around, I spent a lot of time in taxis. My drivers saw a very different economy than was visible from the offices of the central bank. In fact, they sputtered with rage when I told them what I was hearing from economists and government officials. In a country that less than 30 years ago tore itself apart because it couldn't agree on an economic contract, that anger is important.<p>
"Look at me," said one. "I work 50 hours a week to support my family, and still we don't manage. I used to be a university professor!"<p>A tourist in New York could get the same comment from one of that city's cabbies, to be sure, but even in the city's poorest areas he wouldn't see slums like those in Chilean cities. Some of the housing I saw was on a par with the shanties I'd seen outside Johannesburg and Cape Town. Unpainted shanties leaned against one another at crazy angles; half-naked children ran barefoot in filthy, unpaved streets; families picked through piles of burning trash at the city dump.<p>In the heady days of the Allende regime, the Communist party of Chile had organized the discontent of the have-nots and moved inches from power. Pinochet's years of repression never managed to destroy the Chilean communists, but the return of democracy to Chile and the collapse of the Soviet model in Europe have driven the party into the political wilderness.<p>But Jorge Insunza, a harmless-looking, chain-smoking member of the Central Committee, insisted that his party's eclipse was not permanent. The days of protest and revolution are not over. Chile, Insunza told me, remains dependent on the world market, and the world market remains vulnerable to chaos and catastrophe. Listening to him, I thought back to my conversation with some bitter university students a day earlier. "It gets better for the rich," said one, "but for us there is nothing." If enough Chileans feel this way, then Insunza is right and the days of protest and upheaval will return.<p>In the bad old days, all it took was a collapse in the world market price of copper to plunge the Chilean economy into depression. The technocrats of Santiago are determined to create a new Chilean economy based on telecommunications, agricultural exports, and tourism. They talked glibly about Chile as the "telecommunications hub" for Latin America--but exactly how many jobs would it create?<p>I drove out one afternoon to the Santa Rita vineyard, about an hour south of Santiago. Here I ate and drank the fruits of the new Chilean economy. For lunch I had Chilean salmon from the farms along the southern coast, exquisite and delicate fruits from Chile's famous orchards, and an impressive selection of Santa Rita wines. Winery executives told me they were about to introduce new, premium varieties to the U.S. market. <p>For the moment, the Chilean glass seemed half full. Chile can join the trading bloc created by the North American Free Trade Agreement and, unlike Mexico, would experience the benefits of lower tariffs for its exports without a reverse flood of U.S. products. The country's small size and underpriced currency would see to that.<p>A day later and much farther south the wine of the new Chilean economy turned sour. Like the Santa Rita vineyard, resorts such as the Hotel Explora in the far south are a key part of the new Chilean economy, too. With its soaring mountains capped by pristine snow and a landscape full of exotic animals, Chile has the raw materials for a thriving tourist industry.<p>On my first morning at the resort I asked another guest, a distinguished-looking Brazilian, what he did for a living.
"Oh," he said, "I'm mostly retired now. I grow orchids. I suppose I'm a bit fanatical about them. Over the years I've collected 20,000 varieties."<p>A hotel can do a good business attracting clients like this. He probably found the empty Chilean mountains a refreshing break from the crowds in the Swiss Alps. Besides, the undervalued Chilean peso made this vacation a bargain.<p>But the Hotel Explora, for better or worse, will never attract the crowds of a DisneyWorld or even a St. Moritz. How many people would do what I had done to reach the Explora? The flight from Santiago to Punta Arenas--on the Pacific side of the Strait of Magellan--was a rough and bumpy four hours' ride. From the airport to the hotel was another six hours across, mostly on dirt roads.<p>Chile is not really on the way from anywhere to anywhere. Enthusiastic chamber of commerce types rant on about how Santiago is inevitably destined to become a managerial and financial-services center for Latin America. But nobody could ever tell me why Santiago was a better location for the Latin American office of a multinational than, say, Miami.<p>The boosters, it seems to me, are wrong. Chile isn't going to become the Germany or the Japan of South America. Chile today is a moderately sized Latin American country with an economy one eighth that of Brazil and one fifth that of Argentina. Despite its remarkable progress, Chile cannot suddenly transcend its history. It will still depend on its mines and its natural resources. Its overall level of prosperity will, to a large extent, be controlled by external forces. And the aspirations of Chile's poor will still run up against the demands of international investors for profits.<p>But Chile doesn't have to become Japan or an international telecommunications hub for its people to live a better life. The horror of the Pinochet years--and the twin failure of the extremes of free-market and command-market economics--have produced a remarkable consensus behind an economic system that, while borrowing from many models, is uniquely Chilean. No Latin American country I have visited has such a well-organized partnership between business and government; no Latin American government that I have talked to has thought as deeply about its economic reforms. Few countries anywhere have thought as deeply about the social purpose of their financial markets.<p>North Americans seem to vacillate between euphoria and despair when they consider the future of South America. At one moment these countries all have learned the lessons of the marketplace and represent amazing opportunities; the next they're all corrupt casino economies trapped in boom-and-bust cycles.<p>Chile, like each of the other countries on the continent, is unique, a product of its own geography and history. And, at the moment, Chile's glass is both half full and half empty--this promising, fast-growing economy cannot possibly fulfill all the dreams of its boosters, but then maybe it does not need to. <p><p><p>

						Wall Street tells a great story about emerging markets like Brazil. Experience tells a different one.<p>By Walter Mead<p>Forget poring over charts and graphs. throw those economic statistics from the ministries of trade and finance into the trash. Wall Street research on emerging markets? Who needs it? To invest successfully in Brazil, learn to samba.<p>This idea came to me in February as I stood high in the stands of Rio de Janeiro's Sambadrome and watched the city's premier samba schools march past as part of the pre-Lenten carnival madness. As naked dancers on elaborate floats gyrated to the thunderous rhythm of the drums and the Brazilians around me performed jubilant sambas and bellowed out the lyrics to their favorite carnival songs, I realized I was learning an important financial lesson. Investment markets in Brazil work more or less like carnival. Brazilians understand the rhythms of their national economy, and foreign investors who don't feel the beat usually stumble.<p>I could see this in the crowds below me. It isn't hard to spot the foreigners during carnival. Partly it's skin color. By carnival everybody in Brazil who wasn't born black sports a dark and luxurious tan, while most foreign tourists are either fish-belly white or boiled-lobster red. The Brazilians, somehow familiar with even the newest carnival sambas, twist to the music. The foreigners mumble and shuffle.<p>Foreigners who want to make money investing in Brazil don't literally need to take dance lessons, of course, but they do need to learn how to follow the unique beat of a specific national economy. (And that advice goes as well for investors in Thailand, the Philippines, and Turkey, among other markets.) Almost no one on Wall Street called the indiscriminate selling panic that swept through the Latin American stock markets last February and March__just as almost no one warned investors during the overheated panic buying of 1994 (though I can't resist noting that I did warn Worth readers against the Latin America boom in September 1993). And I think I know why. Wall Street gurus were so busy analyzing the global macroeconomic trends that they forgot to immerse themselves in the details of day-to-day life in countries far from New York City. A smart investor could have learned more about the reality of the Brazilian economy__and still can today__by buying a coconut on Copacabana Beach than by reading volumes of Wall Street reports.<p>Before you dismiss this as the kind of hindsight so often passed off as investment advice, let me tell you what I learned about Brazil on my latest trip. In February 1995, the green coconuts on sale at the kiosks on the beach cost almost U.S.$2 each; the Brahma Beer was $1.20. So what, you say? Well, the last time I'd been in Rio, in 1992, the coconuts cost just 50 cents and the beers were a quarter. In dollar terms, the price of coconuts was four times higher than in 1992.<p>What had changed between 1992 and 1995? Had the Brazilian economy taken off? Were the shoe-shine boys four times better off? Were the taxi drivers moving up to First World standards of living? <p>Well, no. Brazil was as poor as ever last winter. Little kids still mooched leftover food at the beachside restaurants. Crippled beggars still hung out at the busy intersections. The hotel maids still lived in the favelas__the squalid slums of Rio.<p>But on my previous visits, the Brazilian price structure had been normal for a poor country. Services provided by Brazilians__shoe shines and taxi rides__were cheap, and so were goods produced in Brazil for sale in Brazil. But anything imported was expensive: Levi's jeans cost more in Brazil than in New York. In 1995, imported goods and machinery were still expensive__but domestically produced goods and services weren't cheap. In dollar terms, a shoe shine in Rio cost the same as in New York. Something was out of whack.<p>A Brazilian, of course, would have understood this instinctively, even though I didn't. In an effort to overcome Brazil's chronic and crazy inflation, the government was running a massive currency scam. It had abolished Brazil's old and worthless currency and replaced it with a shiny, overvalued new one. Brazil's real__a new currency introduced after previous currencies such as the cruzado, the cruzeiro, and the cruzado novo had all inflated to worthlessness and fallen out of circulation__was valued last winter at the insanely unrealistic price of U.S.$1.20 to one real. Hence $2 coconuts. Hence also the soaring prices of shares on the So Paulo and Rio stock exchanges.<p>This kind of exchange-rate madness costs money to sustain. Foreigners who hold reals rush to sell them, both because they get a lot of dollars when they do and because they're not sure how long this favorable price will last. If no one bought reals, the price would fall and the government's domestic inflation policy would lie in ruins. So the government has to buy its currency if no one else will.<p>When the new currency was introduced in mid-1994, Brazil had $40 billion in foreign-exchange reserves__enough by far to defend the value of the real. But while the overpriced currency and tariff reductions did keep the lid on domestic inflation, they took a toll on the country's balance of payments. As the overvalued currency made imports relatively cheap for Brazilians and made Brazilian exports more expensive abroad, Brazil's balance of payments swung into deficit, and foreign reserves began to dwindle.<p>Clearly, the real would have to come down. Anybody who had bought a coconut recently would know that. But when and how? As I sipped my caipirinas by the beach (financial journalism is a dirty job, but someone has to do it), I discovered part of the answer: Devaluation would begin after the foreign tourists, who were now exchanging dollars at a rate of $1.20 to the real, had gone home from carnival. In fact, the Brazilians devalued the real soon after the last tourists had taken their hangovers north.<p>This one example illustrates an important principle. Scenarios of inflation and currency devaluation of this magnitude don't run through the heads of people about to put money into U.S. markets, nor should they. Brazil, on the other hand, has a history of currency manipulation, inflation, and shock therapy. Between the 1940s and the 1990s, rampant inflation__often as high as 2,000 percent a year__forced the Brazilians to drop 12 zeroes from their currency. In other words, it took 1,000,000,000,000 cruzeiros of the 1940s to buy one real of the 1990s.<p>Rich Brazilians know this history. They know that Brazilian money in their pockets and Brazilian stocks in their investment portfolios are susceptible to sudden and irrational changes in value. Over decades and generations, they have mastered the art of dealing with chronic economic instability.<p>U.S. investors are accustomed to markets and currencies with very different rules. The U.S. hasn't had this kind of instability since the 19th century, and the models of investment risk that all U.S.based investors carry around in their heads are based on our own national economic rhythms.<p>It doesn't help that U.S.based investors approach markets such as Brazil wearing the blinders of currently fashionable economic jargon. During the last few years, Wall Street has been telling investors that they haven't been buying shares of companies in Brazil or Argentina or Mexico. Instead they've been buying pieces of a beautiful story: the Emerging Markets Scenario.<p>The narrative is simple. Latin America's poverty was the result of bad economic policies. These included restrictions on imports, overregulation of private capital flows, inefficient state-owned industries, rigid labor markets, and other consequences of too much state intervention in the economy. Now, however, say the gurus on Wall Street, Latin American leaders, having learned from the mistakes of the past, are replacing bad, statist policies with good, free-market policies. Once the new policies are in effect, these economies will gradually come to resemble those in the U.S. and Europe.<p>But this is just a story, and if you doubt that, remember that not so long ago we didn't talk about emerging markets at all. Instead we called these countries underdeveloped. The economists of underdevelopment theory used to contrast the countries at the periphery of the capitalist system__like, say, Haiti and Brazil__with countries at the core, like France and the United States. Core countries progressed through stages of industrialization and modernization to the affluent consumer democracy found today in Western Europe and the United States. Peripheral countries didn't. Their economies and their political systems were stuck in backwardness. Just as the American South remained dependent for decades on cotton and tobacco, so too were countries like Brazil doomed by their dependence on raw materials and agriculture.<p>Underdevelopment theory, unlike the current way of thinking about these countries, didn't assume that a country like Brazil could simply reform itself into the First World. It emphasized how difficult it is for a country that had received its capitalism from abroad to control its own economic fate.<p>Take Brazil. First valued by the Portuguese for its mineral wealth, Brazil ultimately developed into a sugar colony. Brazil's planters imported slaves from Africa and sold sugar to Europe. When sugar prices began to fall, Brazil found new crops__rubber and coffee__to sell on world markets, but the pattern was always the same. Like most underdeveloped countries, Brazil sold raw materials and imported manufactured goods. And the world market in which Brazil traded was dominated by foreign countries__by Portugal and Spain in the early colonial period, then by Great Britain in the 19th century, and finally by the U.S.<p>Underdeveloped countries cannot control their economies like developed market economies do. In countries like the United States, Germany, and Japan, central banks have enormous powers to control short-term interest rates and to influence long-term ones. Other branches of the governments in developed market economies set fiscal policy in ways calculated to enhance domestic prosperity. Brazil isn't this lucky. International economic developments__especially developments in the U.S. economy__overshadow most decisions made by Brazilian institutions. When the Fed raises interest rates in the U.S., rates rise in Brazil__and, often, the stock market falls. When U.S. mutual funds and other investors decide Brazil is the next Taiwan, they flood the country with capital, producing a boom, which comes to a crashing halt when international capital flows out to the next hot spot.<p>The result is that both policy and economic conditions tend to lurch from one extreme to the next in Brazil__and in many other underdeveloped economies. Governments don't have the luxury to pursue moderate, long-term policies; they must react to sudden external shocks. Chronic inflation is one very common response to this situation; so is alternating between closed, protectionist economic strategies and free trade. Throughout Latin America, policy has swung between protectionism and free trade; last winter's turmoil in international currency markets forced both Brazil and Argentina to move toward a less open, more protectionist stance. No Brazilian or Argentine would assume this is a permanent condition.<p>Patient investors with the time and money to investigate local conditions and with strong stomachs for risk and long time horizons can do well in these markets. Very well. But investors who don't learn how to dance to the pulse-pounding beat of Brazil__or the very different rhythm of any other emerging market__run much higher risks than they realize. Over time, tone-deaf outsiders will underperform insiders in an underdeveloped economy. That is the Golden Rule of Latin American investing. Samba lessons, anyone?

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>THINK LOCALLY, ACT GLOBALLY<p>By Manjeet Kripalani<p>To maximize long-term performance, an investment portfolio must be globally diversified, with at least 20 percent foreign exposure. We've said this many times in these pages, and our reason for doing so is pretty basic: Over the long haul, the world economy is simply going to grow faster than the U.S.'s. The only way to take advantage is to participate.<p>One way to do this, of course, is to own foreign stocks--buying them either directly or through mutual funds. This is decidedly not a risk-free strategy, as recent events in Mexico and some Asian markets have underscored yet again.<p>An altogether different approach is to acquire stocks in U.S. companies that do business either in foreign lands or with foreign partners. This option has been eclipsed amid the global-investing craze of the last several years. To this day, in fact, most asset-allocation models, including those at private banks, count all U.S. stocks as 100 percent domestic investments, regardless of the amount of revenue or assets from foreign operations.<p>Nevertheless, more than 200 companies among the Standard & Poor's 500 get at least 20 percent of their revenues from exports or overseas operations. By buying the right ones, an investor can build a portfolio that, for all practical purposes, is as global as that of an investor who owns a mix of international stocks.<p>Such an all-domestic "global" portfolio also has a number of advantages, including minimum exposure to foreign stock market risk, reduced currency risk, accounting under U.S. standards, and, in some cases, lower taxes.<p>Several money managers--like Edward Bousa, a manager in Putnam's basic-value equity-fund group--are putting new emphasis on the concept of investing globally through U.S. stocks. Bousa believes the strategy has become more attractive because so many U.S. companies are now in a position to compete effectively worldwide, having raised quality standards and lowered costs in recent years. He also notes that U.S. companies continue to be superb marketers and technological leaders. Adds Madhav Dhar, head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley: "The [global economic] revolution is a consumer one, not a producer one. Don't underestimate an emerging market's consumers and overestimate its producers." In other words: Buying shares of companies in foreign markets may not always be the best way to play.<p>By their nature, multinational companies also offer their investors certain buffers against market gyrations through things like currency-risk management and international tax planning. A multinational can react quickly to global opportunities and can shift investment levels if business conditions deteriorate. "If you're Colgate and you're having a problem in Mexico, you can take your assets and put them into Taiwan in a heartbeat," says Bousa. "A Mexican toothpaste producer just has to stay put"-- with its investors presumably suffering the consequences.<p>We asked Bousa--whose funds include Putnam Managed Income, <a name="FUND:PGEOX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PGEOX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>George Putnam Fund of Boston</b></a>, and <a name="FUND:PEYAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PEYAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Putnam Equity Income</b></a>--to put together a sample portfolio of seven U.S. stocks that would give an investor a substantial degree of global diversification. His choices are shown in the table below.<p>As a group, the stocks in Bousa's portfolio get 47 percent of their revenue from overseas sales and operations. They also represent a combination of what Bousa describes as "the safety of your home market as well as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for U.S. companies to grow overseas." All seven are also among the leaders in their fields, at home and abroad. For instance, Colgate is the second-ranked seller of toothpaste in the U.S. (behind Procter & Gamble) and No. 1 in toothpaste overseas, and has overall annual growth of 15 percent abroad. <p>Bousa also believes each of the seven stocks are attractively valued now. "If you buy 100 shares of each, you can get the entire portfolio for less than $40,000," he says. "The companies provide good growth rates, respectable dividend yields, and good market positions in the U.S. and overseas." <p><p>

Worth magazine/Experts<p>WHY FEAR CUBA?
We guarantee billions in loans for Mexico. At the same time we force ordinary Cubans to live on $5 a month.<p>By Walter Mead<p>It would make a great Jeopardy question. "Latin America for $100, Alex." And the answer is, "The currency of this Spanish-speaking neighbor of the United States recently tumbled. But despite mounting international debts and a domestic economic crisis, efforts at political reform have been frustrated by the resistance of entrenched members of the ruling party. So many of its citizens have fled its poverty that immigration from this country has become a burning political issue in the U.S."<p>Forget about returning as defending champion, however, if you said, "What is Mexico?" The country I have in mind is Cuba.<p>Not that the mistake isn't natural. For example, both neighbors of the United States are suffering from declining standards of living, and the regimes in each use nostalgia for the revolutionary past to cling to power.<p>And yet, despite these similarities, the United States pursues radically different policies toward the two countries. In the case of Mexico, U.S. policy for the past ten years has worked to promote stability and prosperity. Forget the human-rights abuses, we have said. Forget the widespread corruption, the rigged elections, the murders of political opponents. None of these matter. The No. 1 U.S. goal in Mexico is political stability__and we have decided it is in our self-interest to promote the prosperity necessary for that stability, even if it means putting U.S. taxpayers' credit behind the peso. The alternative is to accelerate the flow of Mexicans looking for work in El Norte.<p>Contrast this with our Cuba policy. Not only does the United States look on with indifference at Cuba's economic crisis; our policy is to do everything we can to wreck Cuba's economy and destabilize the government.<p>Why isn't the sauce for the Mexican goose also sauce for the Cuban gander? And, for that matter, why has the United States been willing to defer democratic progress for the sake of economic growth in Mexico (as well as South Korea, Taiwan, China, and even Vietnam) while insisting on democratic progress as a precondition for trade with Cuba? I think that riddle is best answered by looking at the emerging postcold war world order and the legacy of more than a century of U.S. policy toward Latin America.<p>Now, I don't believe that all of Cuba's economic problems are our fault. Quite the contrary. On a recent trip to Cuba, I saw the same structural problems created by 35 years of central planning that I've seen in Eastern Europe. Too many of its factories produce things nobody wants, for example.<p>Cuban president Fidel Castro bet the ranch on a trading relationship with the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. For a while, the bet paid off handsomely. The Soviet Union lavished subsidies and credits on Castro's Cuba. Soviet importers paid more for Cuban sugar than prevailing world market prices and offered subsidized oil in exchange. Cuba got so much oil from the Soviet Union that it was able to earn extra money by selling the surplus. <p>This arrangement worked reasonably well for much of the last generation, and fortunately, unlike some of the other recipients of Soviet largesse, the Cubans invested some of their money well. Even today, Cuba's health and educational levels are far higher than those of Latin American countries at a similar level of development. At 10 per 1,000 live births, Cuba's infant-mortality rate is lower than the rates in Detroit, Poland, and South Korea. The literacy rate is 99 percent, compared with 90 percent in Mexico and 81 percent in Brazil.<p>But Soviet subsidies also severely distorted Cuba's economy. Consider the sugar industry. To raise productivity, Cuba decided to mechanize its sugar industry during the 1970s. Unfortunately for Cuba, that made the industry more dependent on imported oil and spare parts. When the USSR collapsed, Cuba lost much of its ability to earn hard currency. With imported oil, fertilizer, and spare parts in short supply, the sugar harvest collapsed. Sugar production in Cuba fell from a peak of 8.4 million tons raw value in 198990 to an estimated 4 million in 199394. Per capita gross domestic product is estimated to have fallen from $3,125 in 1983 to $1,684 in 1993.<p>Cuba has responded to this crisis with some of the measures that U.S. experts have recommended for Eastern Europe. Cuba has tried to replace its former Soviet markets with increased trade with Western Europe, Latin America, Canada, and Japan. It has identified tourism and biomedicine as industries where it believes it can be competitive and has supported them with generous credits. Tourism arrivals are up from 225,000 in 1988 to more than 540,000 in 1993, and Cuban biomedical products such as a meningitis B vaccine are now internationally competitive.<p>The regime has also opened the door to private enterprise. Foreign investors can now retain in excess of 50 percent of the equity in joint ventures and repatriate profits. Private markets have made more goods available to ordinary Cubans.<p>Rationally speaking, this should all make the United States happy. No sane American could want political chaos or economic collapse on this island of almost 11 million inhabitants 90 miles from our shores. However, U.S. companies still cannot invest in Cuba, and U.S. citizens cannot legally invest in foreign-investment funds in Cuba that are openly bought in the rest of the world.<p>It's hard to walk the streets of Havana and of rural villages as I did on a recent visit and feel that this policy is rational. Instead it feels like revenge. Elderly ladies with arms as thin as broomsticks begged for handouts in Havana's Old City; in the provinces, I saw regional hospitals with fewer scientific instruments than a good high school chemistry lab. I spoke to doctors who had no medicine to give to their patients; I spoke to dozens of ordinary Cubans frantically trying to survive on a monthly income of less than five dollars at the then-prevailing black market rate of exchange.<p>What exactly did Cuba do to call down this punishment on its head? Much of the U.S. national-security bureaucracy simply cannot forgive Castro. It was bad enough that he thumbed his nose at Washington and said nice things about Moscow. Worse still, he sent Cuban troops to Angola and Ethiopia. Washington was infuriated by Cuba's pursuit of a foreign policy that was independent of the U.S.<p>But Castro didn't just back anti-American forces in faraway countries. He had the temerity to support revolution in Latin America, a region the U.S. has claimed as its own since the days of James Monroe. For example, he aided the legitimate government of Nicaragua in its fight against U.S.funded rebels.<p>Now that the cold war is on at least temporary hiatus, the world map is no longer colored just red and white to Washington. Not every war is a sign of a domino ready to fall: We intervene in Kuwait because of Middle Eastern oil; we don't intervene in Rwanda. The Angolan civil war still sputters, but in a post-Soviet world it no longer shows up on Washington's radar.<p>But Cuba still does. Some in the national-security establishment fear that Castro's survival challenges the new world of economic spheres of influence just as much as his Cuba threatened the cold war's divisions of the globe. Cuba is the first and so far the only state in the Western Hemisphere to have defied Washington's vision for the region. Cuba must pay.<p>But others in Washington, and probably the majority, are guided by inertia and cowardice. Inertia, a never-to-be-underestimated factor in explaining the behavior of bureaucracies, fights change; cowards are afraid to take risks, however small. With bureaucrats ruled by inertia and politicians by cowardice, Washington dithers while Cuba waits.<p>Oddly enough, the biggest push for changing U.S. policy toward Cuba now comes from the U.S. business community__which smells profits and understands that U.S. power and interests in the Western Hemisphere have nothing to fear from Castro. Lee Iacocca visited Cuba last July; both Merck and Johnson & Johnson have sent representatives. Bilateral U.S.Cuba trade could easily hit $1 billion in the first year after the blockade ended, experts estimate.<p>Change is inevitable in Cuba__the only question is whether it will come easy or come hard. Sooner or later Fidel Castro, born in 1926, must go, as Mao put it, "to meet Marx." From the standpoint of selfish American interests, six months or even six years more of Castro is a small price to pay for an orderly transition.<p>And I'm telling you, the beaches in Cuba are sublime, the people are friendly, and the food is terrific.<p>

People trust their money to the mutual funds that rank highest each year. But the rankings may lie.<p>By Gary Hector<p>In 1994, <a name="FUND:WGITX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/WGITX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Warburg Pincus's Growth & Income fund</b></a> was the fourth best performer among the 387 growth and income funds tracked by Morningstar, Inc. Investors received a handsome 7.6 percent total return in a year that saw the average growth and income fund decline 1.4 percent in value. What's more, Warburg Pincus returned 17.18 percent on average in each of the last three years--good enough to place second in its category over that period. <p>The only flaw in this apparently flawless investment was revealed in an interesting qualification from a Morningstar analyst in Morningstar's annual rankings. The Warburg Pincus fund, said analyst Adam Wright, wasn't really a staid growth and income operation at all, but rather "an aggressive-growth fund in disguise."<p>In fact, the fund achieved its impressive record by investing in low-dividend, high-risk stocks like <a name="NYSE:MU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14116"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Micron Technology</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:NSM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11058"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>National Semiconductor</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:STK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11407"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Storage Technology</b></a>. Why, then, was such an aggressive investor to be found in the growth and income category? <p>One possibility is that Warburg Pincus was "gaming" the rankings--miscategorizing itself in such a way that its riskier investment strategy would loft it to the apex of the performance pyramid. Fund managers can accomplish this sleight of hand in part because fund categories are so loosely defined, and because funds are commonly listed under the heading suggested by the vaguely worded investment objectives found in their prospectuses. This allows managers, in effect, to choose the heading under which their funds will be ranked, a cozy arrangement from the not-too-distant time when the whole industry was small and stodgy rather than the cutthroat world of 5,700 or more funds it has become.<p>Wall Street professionals have suspected for years that gaming was widespread. Until recently, they haven't had much evidence to back them up, but two independent studies now appear to confirm that gaming not only exists but may be more widespread than anyone imagined. Both research efforts concluded that more than half of all mutual funds are misclassified in performance rankings. And more than one out of ten is listed inaccurately enough that investors could be misled about their true nature, according to one study.<p>Together, the reports suggest that a growing number of funds operate according to a Wall Street axiom: "The best way to win a contest for largest tomato is to paint a cantaloupe red."<p>Lots of painted fruit shows up in a study by Erik Witkowski, who as a Harvard undergrad wrote an honors economics thesis examining the performance of 709 equity funds for the five years ended November 1993. He looked at the standard categories--growth, aggressive growth, small capitalization, international, growth and income, and income--searching for funds whose performance patterns over time diverged from the patterns of their categories as a whole. Witkowski found that an astonishing 394, or 56 percent, of the funds were misclassified. Eleven percent, or 75, were at least two categories of risk away from where they ought to have been--enough to make a big difference to investors.<p>More disturbing, a five-year performance review revealed that of the 20 top-ranked growth funds, 14 were actually high-risk aggressive-growth or small-capitalization funds in disguise. And of the top 20 growth and income funds, a still lower-risk category, 9 belonged in those two high-risk groups.<p>Witkowski, who now works for Northfield Information Services Inc., a Boston-based provider of analytical software and information to institutional investors, noted that other research has shown that most consumers simply accept performance rankings at face value and act upon them. In other words, Witkowski says, "The reason that a fund manager might intentionally misclassify a fund is easily understood." <p>Dan DiBartolomeo, president of Northfield Information Services, describes Witkowski's results as "the wolf in sheep's clothing problem, or vice versa." High-risk wolves disguise themselves as low-risk sheep to outperform their "peers" when markets are booming, while low-risk sheep slip into high-risk categories to look stellar when markets tumble.<p>"An awful lot of funds act differently than their peer group." says DiBartolomeo. "Either it's purposeful misclassification or there is something dramatically wrong with the classification system. Nobody in the industry would be surprised to find out that it was purposeful."<p>In another study of mutual funds, two finance professors, Stephen Brown of New York University and William Goetzmann of Yale School of Management, analyzed mutual fund returns between 1977 and 1988 to see if the funds fell naturally into classes or categories. Like Witkowski, Brown and Goetzmann focused on monthly returns over time rather than portfolio composition.<p>After analyzing the returns on 758 funds, they found they fell into eight distinct clusters: growth and income, income, growth, value, small company, market timers, hedgers, and international. Most of these categories sound familiar, but their composition diverges greatly from the older classifications. <p>For example, Morningstar's growth category, with 282 funds, splintered into five different groups. Only 99 remained in Brown and Goetzmann's growth category. The remainder shifted into growth and income, value, small cap, and income. Funds from Morningstar's growth and income category fell into four distinct groups, with barely half staying in the growth and income area.<p>Brown and Goetzmann found their share of wolves. In Morningstar's growth category, 49 funds turned out to be more volatile small-company funds. Morningstar's growth and income group included 26 funds that belonged in the new growth or value groups. Their study also identified two new groups--funds that attempt to time markets, switching from cash to stocks and back, and hedge funds that invest primarily in precious metals.<p>The bottom line of both these studies is that annual performance rankings may be dangerous to the financial health of investors. The categories are too broad, and because fund managers can choose to be included in any category they wish, the rankings wind up comparing pineapples with kumquats, not apples with apples. This doesn't surprise market veterans like John Bogle, chairman of the Vanguard Group, who calls rankings "the greatest bunch of baloney foisted on the American public in years."<p>The only good news for investors is that most of the misclassifications the researchers found are neither serious nor intentional. Bogle points to <a name="FUND:VEXMX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VEXMX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard's Extended Market Portfolio</b></a>, an index fund that tries to match the Wilshire 5,000. That fund is classed as a growth fund though it might better be described as a midcap fund. <p>"If someone said it shouldn't be [a growth fund], I'd say, 'You are exactly right,' " Bogle says. But given the limitations of the fund categories, that is where the Extended Market Portfolio appears.<p>Similarly, Anthony Orphanos, manager of the Warburg Pincus Growth and Income fund, says, "To say that we are in the wrong category is incorrect. It's very difficult to take 1,600 or 1,700 funds and divide them into five categories."<p>Steve Rung, a Warburg spokesman, also notes that the fund last year had as much as 9 percent of its portfolio in bonds, an abnormally high percentage for a growth fund. This year, it's moved more into short-term instruments, giving a yield higher than most growth funds. <p>"The fund might not fit in the growth or the aggressive-growth category either,'' said Orphanos.<p>Other problems are a result of the mutual fund industry's ceaseless effort to create new kinds of funds. Patrick Geddes, the director of quantitative research at Morningstar, points to the <a name="FUND:MERFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MERFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merger Fund</b></a>, which buys shares of likely takeover targets and fits no standard system of classification.<p>Many funds that are drastically out of place are spotted by the data gatherers. Morningstar, Lipper, and others work diligently to find badly misclassified funds. Morningstar, for example, changed 205 listings in 1994, Lipper 154.<p>Investors should be particularly cautious about small funds, which tend to be misclassified most often, says Witkowski. Small funds have higher expenses as a percentage of assets and face potentially larger withdrawals as a percentage of total assets. As a result, their cash balances are relatively high, giving them relatively high income, which makes them look more like income funds than risk-tolerant pursuers of high growth. <p>Here are two examples from Morningstar of funds whose investment strategies might skew their performance within their chosen categories:<p><a name="FUND:ANABX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ANABX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Alliance North American Government Income</b></a> sounds like a cast-iron widows-and-orphans investment, but don't be misled. Its charter calls for investments in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico--risky enough these days--and, according to Morningstar, it had 24 percent of its funds in Argentine securities as of December 1994. <p>The fund's yield was 15.36 percent (for class A shares) during 1994. It not only sought out high-yield investments but, like Orange County, borrowed to buy them. The fund's three classes of shares took a bath last year, ranking 99th, 100th, and 101st out of 101 funds in Morningstar's worldwide-bond category.<p><a name="FUND:CAIBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CAIBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Capital Income Builder</b></a> ranked fifth over five years in the equity-income group, supposedly a low-risk category. But while other equity-income funds stay close to home, according to Morningstar, at last count Capital Income had 35 percent of its assets in foreign markets and 14 percent in small-cap U.S. stocks, as of December 1994. <p>These funds and many others will probably never be properly classed until the current ranking system is overhauled. "The academic evidence is mounting that traditional classifications, including what we use, may be too limited a way to categorize mutual funds," says Geddes of Morningstar.<p>The rankings, then, are pretty much unusable. Here's how an investor can inform and protect himself nonetheless: <p>Get the total returns for the last five years. Then deduct the front-end sales charge for a good performance gauge. <p>Look at year-to-year consistency. Inconsistent performance spells increased risk.<p>Compare relative volatility. How much more--or less--volatile has your fund been than the market in general? <p>Compare portfolio activity. How much  buying and selling is the fund doing, compared to others in its category? The more churning that's going on, the more unpredictable the fund is likely to be.<p>Check how fast assets are growing. Is the money coming in too fast to be managed effectively? Remember, highly ranked funds often get a flood of new investors. <p>Find out the average tenure of the fund manager. The more often the name on the boss's door changes, the less consistent the fund's investing philosophy will be. <p>This information should be yours for the asking at any reputable fund. If a fund won't readily answer your questions about how and how well it invests, that is probably the clearest signal of all that you ought to take your money elsewhere. <p><p>

						February 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> THE GOOD, THE BADLA, & THE UGLY <p>What does it mean, really, to be an emerging market? Come to, where the rules are unwritten and the traders deserve danger money.  <p> By Richard Todd  <p> The bombay stock exchange opens at 12 noon on weekdays and closesjust 120 minutes later. The reason for such circumscribed business hours, it is said, is record keeping. The exchange, which trades more individual issues than any other in the world, generates seven hours of paperwork for each two-hour trading session. <p> "Paperwork" is no metaphor here in Bombay. Every transaction involves a physical transfer of stock, complete with certificates of ownership, bills of sale, and some 121 separate stamps and sign-offs. Twice a month the market shuts down altogether--it closes sporadically anyway--for a daylong patavat, or exchange of shares. The stock certificates are swathed in red cloth bundles and carried around from broker to broker in a huge hall. So the Bombay market certainly has its logistical difficulties. But I suspect the real reason it doesn't stay open longer every day is more basic: No one could survive it.  <p> The Bombay Stock Exchange operates as an open outcry market. The outcry takes place in the regional language of Gujarati,the traditional language of India's trading caste, and with as many as 3,000 traders on the floor at any moment the noise is considerable. Traders wear hospital-blue smocks, moving at somespeed and only in straight lines. If you're in the way, you are moved aside. It looks like an emergency room full of deranged orderlies.  <p> For communication amid the chaos, traders use the traditional hand signals of their vocation--but those often don't do the trick. The preferred gesture here seems to be the cheek pinch, followed by the chin hold. On my first visit to the market, I saw a wholesale jobber being assaulted by no fewer than ten brokers, each looking for a part of his cheek to pinch. They all leaned into him, and soon they were atop him and each other. It wasa little like a rugby scrum, except that everyone carried a notepad and was screaming. From time to time the man in the middle--as lender fellow with long hair and a strangely serene look on his face--would rise with his notebook over the heads and make an entry. Then someone would grab his hair and pull him down again. The whole thing looked as if it could end only in orgasmor death. Instead it ended on schedule (and not a moment too soon) at two o'clock.  <p> My guide, a tall and gentlemanly Bombay broker, apologized for the scene. "I am sorry we are having such a quiet day," he said in that syncopated Indian English. "The market is stag-nant, you see."  <p>
Money flows with the logic of water--and pays as little attention as water does to where it ends up. Even so, Bombay seems an unlikely place for a stock market boom. Everywhere you look, squalor greets you. The crumbling streets still swarm with beggars, the maimed, the emaciated, the babes in arms. Seen from a distance, with a bit of a cocked eye, the place looks like a modern seaside city. But up close the buildings are shoddily built and maintenance nonexistent. Black streaks of mold deface their walls and, within, inadequate plumbing yields a frequent stench. Infrastructure is wanting. Phone service now works in the financial district, but long distance is spotty. As for the post office, you're better off leaving a letter on the street and hoping some kind soul delivers it. Half of Bombay's 12.5 million citizens live in sheet-metal hovels or in storm drains or under bridges. The yellowish coastal waters of the Arabian Sea are so polluted that no one dares swim at the city's beaches. Sanitation in general is primitive. Neither food nor water may be fully trusted.  <p> Yet India is the very model of an "emerging market," Bombay is its financial bazaar, and I guess if you are in this game a lot of things become more or less invisible. After lumbering along for 40 years as a closed socialist economy, India recently opened its doors to foreign investment. With the encouragement of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, capital has begun pouring in and the Bombay exchange is ascendant: Its index of key stocks,the Sensex, has risen from a 1979 base of 100 to something like 4,000 today. Mutual fund investors in Scarsdale and Grand Forks are helping to drive this market higher--though one wonders how many of them know where their dollars are tonight.  <p> In the marble lobby of the Oberoi hotel complex, an island of grotesque luxury in the city, you now see men from <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, Templeton, and Morgan Stanley. Before long, foreign industrialists will be a significant presence here--Kellogg, <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Electric</b></a>, <a name="NASD:TOYOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41889"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toyota</b></a>, and others are entering the market--but for the moment the action is mostly in finance, where the bright eyes of foreign analysts see unlimited prospects. Morgan Stanley alone has pumped $2 billion of Americans' money into Bombay through funds, including its India Magnum Fund; in five years that fund's per-share price has gone from $15 to $60. One of the firm's young bankers, as lender and harried Englishman named John Porter, assured me,"Even if the market crashes, you'll be able to get your money back in one to two years on the basis of earnings alone."  <p> In the minds of many, it seems, India's primacy among Asia's emerging markets is a certainty. Over the ritual afternoon coffee in his office, Nimesh Kampani, a prominent Bombay broker, ticked off for me the reasons. It was a list I would soon discover is standard wisdom: language and democracy, a long-standing legal system, a superior knowledge of accounting. "There are two tigers in Asia, India and China," said Mr. Kampani. "India will win." He also mentioned in passing, as everyone does, the great problem: population, the 900 million whose generally miserable existence is acknowledged almost superstitiously--"Of course, we must do something about the population problem."  <p> India's annual GNP is only about $310 per capita. However, it has an extraordinary savings rate, estimated at about 25 percent for wage earners. Even the very poor tend to have a small stash of gold, still a favorite repository of wealth for all classes. In the barren socialist economy that prevailed for two generations, only a minimal consumer society could develop. Those who own real estate tend to do so outright. So despite the abjectness everywhere, there is less debt and more liquidity than one might guess.  <p> And of course, even small percentages of the Indian population add up to rather big numbers. Fortunes are to be made by bringing small investors--and Western money, of course--into a Bombay market that may still be in its infancy. Mr. Kampani himself is a good example: He built his brokerage house, J.M. Financial & Investment Consultancy Services, from start-up capital of just $500. "We have e-du-cated the public," he told me. For many, the breakthrough came in 1993 when J.M.'s bond offering for Reliance Industries, the energy and chemical giant, raised well over $100 million and turned away many times that much in oversubscriptions. "The issue went like hotcakes," said Mr. Kampani. "Everybody realized there is money in India."  <p> There is also room for growth. Of India's 900 million people, just 25 million currently invest in stocks. As recently as 1980 only about 1 percent of the country's savings was in stocks; today the figure has climbed to 12 percent. In the U.S., the number is 45 percent.  <p>
Iguess the market was stagnant when I was there; daily fluctuations of 15 to 20 percent are not uncommon in Bombay. But lately the race had been run under a yellow flag. Owing to certain "irregularities," some trading practices had been suspended. By the time I discovered this, however, I had concluded that finding irregularities in Bombay's market was much like finding gambling at Rick's.  <p> The Bombay Stock Exchange, in a modern high-rise, dominates seedy Dalal Street. Dalal means broker in Hindi, and it has traditionally been a word of shady connotations; the same word serves for pimp. But brokers are rising in the Indian world as the public becomes fascinated with stocks. Today on Dalal Street hawkers mingle with food vendors, passing out prospectuses for new issues in the bazaarlike atmosphere. Throughout the city, billboards trumpet share offerings.  <p> Mrugank Sanghvi, a lean, amiable young man, runs a trading concern across the street from the exchange, one small enough that the difficulties of doing business in Bombay can be seen in microcosm. We met in his office, which had the atmosphere of a garment-district sweatshop, with six clerks laboriously stamping yard-high piles of documents. The heat was unbearable, but that was not the only reason Mr. Sanghvi motioned me down the stairs and out to the street. Come, I must explain something to you.  <p> What he told me was that the seeming inefficiencies of the Bombay Stock Exchange--the mountainous paperwork, the endless delays--are not inefficiencies for everyone. For one thing, with all those shares to transfer, there are excellent opportunities for counterfeiting. A few false shares stuck into the middle of some genuine ones give many a player a little extra profit. But that's crude thievery. More subtly, there is the creative use of delay. All those signatures that must be obtained before the stock can be transferred: Should one of them be missing, then the transaction doesn't happen.If things haven't gone your way, you can buy time. Also, the fewer shares that are traded, the more a stock's price may be influenced by any one trade.  <p> Mr. Sanghvi wanted me to understand that only a small minority of brokers use such techniques. And anyway, it's mostly small potatoes, he said, people manipulating the prices of minor stocks. But when you add this to the other practices I was told of--and realize that with 8,000 listings the exchange provides a wideplaying field--you begin to imagine a market full of rogues. <p> Yet oddly enough, in my wanderings I kept meeting gentlemen, none more accommodating than Mahesh Khubchandani, who operates a small but prosperous brokerage just off Dalal Street. With his partner he shares an office as spare as an officer's stateroom on a warship. The brokerage employs 53 people, most of them not selling stocks but stamping them, checking their signatures, organizing them into bundles. Mr. Khubchandani stands about six feet three inches and carries a comfortable girth. He must have an aggressive side, but in conversation he was soft-spoken and likable. A certain softness of manner seems to characterize businessmen on Dalal Street--those who aren't actually on the floor mauling one another.  <p> "Between brokers there is a strong ethical code," Mr. Khubchandani told me. "Word is all." This is actually a practical measure: The one fast rule of an otherwise mostly lawless Bombay market is that brokers bear full responsibility for their trades. If a client doesn't pay up, the broker must make it good. As a result, Mr. Khubchandani acknowledged with a smile, the brokers' code doesn't always extend to dealings with their clients. He knew that some of his fraternity, fearing a certain amount of default, provide their own "insurance." The primitive state of recordkeeping makes it easy to execute trades at any time during a session--but to report them to the client at a price that is most advantageous to the broker.  <p> Ethical looseness may be rampant here, but some of it appears to be a matter of definition. Two and a half years ago the exchange, suffering from corruption and mindful of stricter Western sensibilities, passed its first regulations against insider trading. The new rules are vague, and there has so far been little litigation. To most brokers here the very concept of insider trading seems absurd, like trying to play tennis without a ball. "This is a market that functions on insider trading," Mr. Khubchandani said to me. "Everybody who has made money has done so on nonpublic information. I hope they do not eliminate insider trading altogether. The market will be no fun without it."  <p> Of course, there are insiders and insiders. The ultimate inside information in Bombay is knowledge of what the "cartels" are up to. It's an open secret on Dalal Street that, at any moment, the fate of many stocks is controlled by a handful of brokers--including some at the best-known firms--who unite to manipulate share prices through the futures market. In an amusing and characteristically Indian twist, there is no futures market on the stock exchange. But there is something just as good: badla.  <p> In Gujarati, badla means "instead of." It's the name given to the fee paid to defer taking delivery on a stock one has agreed to buy. Badla is an informal way to make it possible for traders to take long and short positions on stocks. But this definition doesn't capture the aura of power that seems to emanate from the word. Badla is the enabler, the magic that makes possible control of the market. It's a rough magic that so far has survived the best efforts of both regulators and rascals to civilize it. <p>
Clearly, the Bombay exchange is no place for innocents. Yet innocents streamed in throughout the late 1980s. They were rewarded by the market's inexorable rise until 1992, when an event widely known as "the Scam" reminded everyone that there's a downside to the rawer forms of capitalism.  <p> The Scam was the work of an ambitious--some might say visionary--young broker named Harshad Mehta. It was Mr. Mehta's avowed purpose to break open the market by snatching control away from Bombay's cartels. To do this, he needed both large amounts of cash and the same weapon his foes were using: badla. Mr. Mehta's quixotic goals became well-known, and he briefly enjoyed life as a popular hero. The stocks he backed rose, cartels be damned; the entire market surged several hundred points over the course of just a few months as many investors followed his lead. But there was a difficulty. Where was this upstart getting his money?  <p> To understand what really happened in the Scam, I sought instruction at a table of well-connected financial types in the Bombay Cricket Club, one of the many places in India where you get the sense that though the oppressor has left, his manners, like his language, have been left behind to govern. I was told that Mr. Mehta's dealings had not been confined to the stock market--and that this had ultimately doomed him to failure.  <p> For his assault against the cartels Mehta assembled an initial war chest of some 100 million rupees (about $3 million) through unsecured bank loans. Some of it, I was told, was obtained viabribes involving 100 or so cars he bought for the purpose. Then he used his success--and, prosecutors have charged, fraudulent documents--to borrow yet more. It was, said one of my distinguished instructors, "a game of pass-the-pillow. In the end, Standard Chartered [a bank that lent Mr. Mehta money] got the pillow and lost $300 million."  <p> Mr. Mehta's empire went the way of all pyramid schemes. Many banks and thousands of individual investors were burned, and the ensuing scandal caused the Bombay market index to lose almost half its value. (It has since recovered.) Mr. Mehta's crowning mistake, it seems, was to claim publicly that he had given an illegal campaign donation of $300,000 to Prime Minister Rao, precipitating a political crisis that has yet to fully pass. My informants' view on this: "He should not have spoken of it."(Mr. Rao has denied taking any money from Mr. Mehta.)  <p> Aprs Mehta, the deluge. Major investigations followed; Mr.Mehta says he broke no law, but he awaits trial on a multitude of charges, including forgery and bribery. The Security Exchange Board of India was established to end the glory days of buccaneers on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Speculators' wings were clipped,and the magic of badla was suspended.  <p> "So there is no futures trading?" I asked a Cricket Club tablemate. <p> "Well, I would not say that, exactly. No."  <p> "But how do they do it without badla?"  <p> "Well"--smiling--"they do it with badla."  <p> Among friends and cartels, it seems, a little badla is always possible.  <p> I subsequently met Mr. Mehta. The reader, never having heard of him until now, will not be impressed. I'm afraid I wasn't sufficiently impressed myself; in Indian culture Harshad Mehta occupies a place of exalted notoriety.  <p> Mr. Mehta looks like a very big and well-fed teenager. He griped to me that his bank accounts had been frozen, but he was hardly cutting back on his lifestyle. In a city where it's singularly hard to achieve comfort, let alone luxury, Mr. Mehta was still striving to transform his waterfront duplex, in a posh neighborhood known as Breach Candy, into a pleasure dome. Some 20 workers chipped away at tile in one room as we met in what looked like a children's playroom decorated in Crayola tones of purple and yellow. It was, I slowly realized, his study. The tables were heaped high with books on money--American management tomes, along with an illustrated volume called The World's Richest People. <p> Naively, I had hoped Mr. Mehta would give me his side of the story. I had forgotten that a good hustler is always moving on. With the supreme mental health of that breed, Mr. Mehta had simply defined his troubles away. True, the authorities were nagging him about his past endeavors, but he was thinking about new things--"how to make India a superpower," for example.  <p> "How did Japan succeed?" he asked me, not rhetorically but in the insistent way of a teacher. I gave the usual answers: culture, technology, industrial policy.  <p> "Bullshit. They borrowed money at 5 percent and let their currency appreciate by 10 percent a year." I didn't fully follow the argument, but he seemed to be saying that <a name="NYSE:SNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41885"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sony</b></a> is the inevitable result of knowing how to borrow and lend.  <p> Mr. Mehta may be right. He may also be in jail soon. Ironically, he may do some good for his cause either way: The reforms he inspired could make Indian markets a better magnet for foreign investors.  <p>
Outside my window in the Oberoi Towers, I could see in the misty harbor 20 or 30 cargo ships riding at anchor. I began to imagine they were full of money. There is something inevitable about the appearance of restless Western capital here; this is its next port of call. It may be useless to think of the consequences. <p> Yet there seems to be an uneasiness here about all the money flowing into the Bombay Stock Exchange. The finance minister frets that it's "hot money," destined to leave as fast as it arrives. Others worry it won't benefit the country as a whole. I met one woman, an artist, who wishes the whole mess would just go away. "I think we are going to be colonized all over again,"she said.  <p> The optimists, meanwhile, hope for sustained growth that will be driven by foreign capital, internal investment, and India's famous "middle class," which everyone loved to describe to meas "250 million people--as big as your whole country." Just looking around, I had to wonder about this middle class: Who and where was it?  <p> I received a useful caution on this subject from a well-known Indian entrepreneur named Dilip Thakore, CEO of Datamatics Direct, India's largest direct-mail marketing database. When I asked Mr. Thakore what counts as a middle-class income, he said about $1,200 a year. It is quite possible to belong to the Indian middleclass and to have no refrigeration. You can look at this two ways. One: This middle class can't afford much. Or two: We've got a great market for refrigerators here. The latter seems tobe the approach of General Electric, and that could be the startof something big. It's certainly a powerful argument for those who pitch the Bombay Stock Exchange to U.S. investors. At the same time, it's hard for me to forget that 650 million still live in desperation. No one could make the drive into Bombay from the airport, 26 kilometers of unrelieved wretchedness, and have any illusions that capitalism will amount to a cure anytime soon.  <p> One of the more bathetic ways to spend your life is getting sad at the passing of things you never knew, and I'm afraid I do a certain amount of this myself. Of all things to get nostalgic for, I found myself feeling a bit that way about the Bombay Stock Exchange. Surely, they were about to solve the paperwork problem. Screen trading would begin. The floor traders would find less hazardous work. There would be a central depository for stock, and soon it would be wrapped not in red cloth but in electronic signals.  <p> I made my final visit to the exchange floor accompanied by a young trader named Rahul Patkar. Rahul looked to me like a Yale sophomore, lean, with an intelligent face and an insouciance about his gaze and gait. He had already traveled to the U.S.,where, I suspect, he bought his stylish oval-framed glasses. We met just before the market opened, and I wondered how he would survive on the floor, where soft-spoken good manners are a marginal asset. Rahul sauntered into the swirl notebook in hand--the only trader, I noted, not wearing a regulation blue smock. He had on a striped shirt with his sleeves rolled partway up each forearm. <p> "You want to see a deal. Please. Come."  <p> Rahul explained that he had to buy some fertilizer stock--quite a lot in fact, 20,000 shares. He would buy from more than one jobber so as not to reveal the extent of his need. He was authorized to pay up to 217-1/2 a share. As I watched, a strange transformation occurred: Rahul started to bellow in Gujarati, a guttural roar that sounded like Alleluia Alleluia Lock your home LockyourhomeLockyourhome. He was also waggling two fingers.  <p> This seemed to get the attention of a nearby jobber, and in a few minutes they were settled into conversation. Unfortunately, six other people were battling for the same jobber's attention. Rahul yelled louder: Peaseporridge Peaseporridge! Then he grabbed the man's chin and turned it toward him. It appeared the fellow understood, but there was clearly no deal.  <p> Rahul grasped the jobber's neck and squeezed tight on his chin so that all movement ceased. He yelled straight into the man's face. Out came the notebook.  <p> "You did the deal."  <p> "Yes. Would you like to see another? Come. Please."  <p> At odd moments in the trading Rahul explained to me how he was working in concert with other traders to assemble blocks of stock. But there was something he knew he couldn't explain about the whole process, and it was something I expected would carry him far.  <p> Later, I asked Rahul about his plans. He said he wants to go to a U.S. business school and then--well, who knows? I found it nice to think of him entering American corporate life. IfI were running a division of <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>, I would sleep better knowing Rahul was on my sales team. I can see him at the piano bar of some Radisson, chatting amiably about a client's kids. I imagine him, as the evening draws to a close, standing up and grabbing my client by the nape of his neck, squeezing his chin while the pianist plays "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head," and screaming Alleluia Alleluia Lockyourhome!  <p> He'd get the deal. And thus would the West fail to crush the admirable spirit of the Bombay Stock Exchange.  <p><p><p>

						February 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Experts  <p> VALUING THE SACRED  <p>In our economics everything has a monetary value. But in the Middle East some things are still priceless.   <p> By Walter Mead  <p> "Go ahead," said my guide, "you can touch it." I was standing on the holiest spot of ground in the world, Mount Moriah in the Dome of the Rock Shrine in Jerusalem. It is here that Abraham is said to have offered his son Isaac as a sacrifice to God, here that King Solomon built the First Temple, and from here that the Prophet Mohammed was carried into heaven.  <p> Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions all say that the Last Judgment will take place here. In the Muslim version, the most picturesque as well as the most alarming, a thread will be stretched from Mount Moriah to the Mount of Olives; the flames of hell will belch out from the valley below, and all human souls will have to walk across to enter paradise.  <p> The image aptly characterizes the entire Middle East at the moment. The seething emotional hatreds that constantly threaten to engulf the region in renewed violence continue to burn, but paradise tantalizingly beckons: Peace between traditional enemies seems possible. Decades of U.S. policy are bearing fruit. Careful cajoling has convinced the Jordanians, the Egyptians, and the Israelis to compromise, to give up territorial claims in exchange for the economic benefits of trade and millions in U.S. aid. But I have returned from my recent trip to the Holy Land deeply pessimistic about the ability of this process to succeed. Asan economist I find this awkward to admit, but after traveling through the region I doubt the power of rational economics--grounded in Western assumptions about human nature--to bring final peace. <p> I expected to find rage in my travels, and I wasn't disappointed. "Look at this!" said a Palestinian sociologist, pointing to avacant lot in the otherwise-crowded urban landscape of a refugee settlement in the West Bank. An entire family had been driven from its home after a teenage son was accused of throwing stones at Israeli cars. "The Jews came to this country 100 years ago and said they wanted only a few farms. Ever since then they have been taking and taking, and still today they don't stop. How can we live with such people?"  <p> I could see his point. Fortress-like Israeli settlements cluster on the hilltops around Jerusalem and throughout the West Bank. In many of them construction proceeded at a frantic pace as the Israelis struggled to, as they put it, "create facts on the ground." <p> But while I felt that some of the Palestinians' complaints were justified, I knew that the realities of the Holy Land are more complicated. On a visit to Auschwitz a few years ago, I met some Israeli high school students on a school trip. Many of their families had originally come from Poland; I asked them what they thought of the country.  <p> "It's not so good," said one. "The other day, we went to the memorial to the Warsaw ghetto. And there were some Polish kids there, and they shouted at us,  Jews go home!' " If these Jewish children are to have a home, it won't be in Poland, where their families had lived for 800 years.  <p> Terror attacks on Israeli citizens by Palestinian extremists remind Israelis just how fragile their security is. A retired general in the Israeli Defense Forces told me that his daughter had missed a bus by five minutes; that bus was destroyed by a suicide bomber. "Israel is a small country," he said. "Every army base that is attacked, every terrorist attack, touches us all."  <p> American policy in the Middle East is based on a secular logic peculiar to our own historic experience. Into a Middle Eastern politics of blood feuds and religion the United States has tried to insinuate a politics of compromise and economic progress. If the Israelis and Palestinians stopped fighting and started working together, they would both be better off, say the Americans. Lavish grants and loans underwrite our diplomacy: Israel and Egypt today are the two largest recipients of American foreign aid.  <p> In the U.S., the economic value of compromise is unassailable. But as I discovered in the Middle East, nations are capable of economic behavior that can only be considered self-destructive by American standards.  <p> Consider the Israeli economic policy in Gaza and the West Bank. "The Palestinians," Yasser Arafat told me only hours before fighting erupted between Arafat loyalists and militant Hamas supporters in Gaza, "have gained nothing from the peace process." Arafat and other Palestinians told me about clauses in the peace agreement that strangled the Palestinian economy and about how Israel undermines the new Palestinian authorities by withholding money and such critical computer files as tax records on the West Bank.  <p> Economics can't explain this behavior. Certainly, the Israelis understand that violence is more likely to appeal to a starving and hopeless Palestinian than to a prosperous one. But Western economic logic isn't ascendant here; the sacred is.  <p> In economics, assets tend to be fungible. Everything has a monetary value, and monetary values can be freely exchanged. A farm has a price, for example, and if two farms have the same price, they are equal assets from an economic perspective.  <p> Life isn't really that simple, of course, even in the United States. If the government wants to build a highway through my home, it offers compensation based on the market price of my property, but my home is worth more to me than the market price. Therefore, I take the government to court and spend thousands fighting the highway, even though my actions are irrational from a strictly economic point of view.  <p> But to a visitor, what is economically irrational seems the norm in the Holy Land. The value of many things--most obviously real estate--is set on an entirely different scale. For Christians, Muslims, and Jews, for Palestinians and Israelis, Jerusalem is more than a beloved city. There is only one City of David, and it has no price.  <p> The Bible tells how the wicked King Ahab went to Naboth and said, "Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house; and I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money." Ahab is acting like an economist, or an American--making what any realtor would call a fair offer to Naboth.  <p> But Naboth obeyed religious logic. "The Lord forbid," he told the king, "that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers. "The usual Biblical consequences flowed from this act: Naboth was stoned to death on orders of Ahab's wicked wife, Jezebel,who was then killed on orders from God. Dogs ate her flesh.<p>

						October 1994 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> THE ECONOMICS OF HOPE <p>What can possibly hold South Africa together, with its historyof conflict and pain? The common economic interest of its people,for one thing.  A surprisingly robust patriotism, for another.But will these be enough? A journey across the nation offerssome clues.  <p> By Walter Mead  <p> "My name is Themba," said the young, unemployed black man. "Inour language, it means 'hope.' " I wanted to believe him.  <p> I felt conspicuous and exposed as I looked around the schoolyardof the squalid squatter settlement on the outskirts of Johannesburg.Chilled by the wintry air of a June morning, I watched as mangydogs hunted hopelessly for scraps of food. Overhead flew a "trashkite," made from sticks and torn plastic from a dark green garbagebag. Angry shouts escaped from a nearby building where the localchapter of the Pan African Congress was meeting. The PAC hadacquired notoriety during the struggle for majority rule in SouthAfrica as the most militant of the major black-liberation groups."One settler, one bullet" had been the PAC's slogan then. Manynews reports linked camp militants to the practice of "necklacing"-- lighting gasoline-soaked tires placed around the necks ofthose deemed insufficiently enthusiastic in the revolutionarystruggle. I knew I was the subject of the current debate. I wascurious about how it would turn out.  <p> I had come to this camp, Orange Farm, to test the future ofSouth Africa. When I had met the national leaders of the PACat their headquarters in downtown Johannesburg -- only blocksfrom where a car bomb had killed dozens during the election campaign-- they were eager to explain to me that the Congress had changed."We have a new slogan now," Seleke Carter, the PAC's deputy secretarygeneral, had told me. "One child, one education." The group hadeven had relatively kind things to say about the recently introduced-- and very stringent -- South African budget produced by NelsonMandela's transitional government. "We think the priorities aregood," said PAC labor secretary Leshoana Makhanda. "We wouldlike to see them doing something more for the poor, but we understandthat they must keep the budget deficit under control. South Africacannot afford to fall into the debt trap."  <p> If the PAC could so quickly make the transition from incineratingopponents to debating them on development priorities, then maybewhat I was starting to feel about South Africa was true. Maybethe transition in South Africa was working. Maybe this countryhad a future on a continent that increasingly seems without one. <p> But the trip had suddenly struck me as very foolhardy at almostthe moment we reached the unmarked, unpaved streets of the settlement.My PAC guides from the national office seemed as lost as I feltamong the unnumbered houses -- no mail, no trash collection,no services except electricity. When we finally found the schoolbuildings, sheds actually, used for church and community meetings,they were marked with the violence of South Africa's internalwars. Nearly every pane of glass had been broken by stone throwersduring the years of boycotts and riots.  <p> The arrival of two whites -- myself and the intrepid South Africanphotographer Herman Potgieter -- had thrown the local membershipinto angry argument. Some clearly didn't want to give up theold slogan. One resident greeted Potgieter with a raised fistand an enigmatic smile: "One settler, one bullet, man," he said,and, fortunately, moved on.  <p> Themba, however, stayed by our side. He was from this village,and he had been active in the wars between black and white, blackand black, black and government. But he wanted to talk aboutthe future and not revive threats from the past. "I hope to enrollmyself in university," he said in remarkably good English. "Iwould like to go into journalism." Not print, though, he saidwisely. Not enough money in it. Too much work. Television wouldbe better, or possibly radio.   <p> Life wasn't easy for him. His mother had a hard time feedingthe family; there was no extra money for school fees. Jobs werealmost impossible to find -- unemployment in South Africa stoodat about 48 percent for blacks, 4 percent for whites.   <p> "But I think it is up to the individual," said Themba. "Youhave to keep a positive attitude and keep studying and working.I do not want handouts; I want to work and achieve for myself. <p> "The greatest thing we have in this country," he continued,"is democracy. Now I have the chance to accomplish everythingand no one will hold me back." As he talked to us, the debatein the schoolroom came to an end. Not everybody was happy tosee us, but no one was carrying tires either.   <p> All South Africa now has a chance to succeed. Will the countrymake the most of that chance? That is the big question in SouthAfrica today and about South Africa in the rest of the world.Last summer -- winter in South Africa -- I spent a month travelingthousands of miles and interviewing hundreds of people in southernAfrica to get an answer. I met with political figures representingthe extreme right, the extreme left, and the center; I visitedthe slums of Johannesburg and Cape Town and went to parties intheir luxurious suburbs. What I learned was simple: Most of whatwe Americans think we know about South Africa is wrong.   <p> There isn't any secret about the challenges facing the new SouthAfrican government. It must raise living standards for the country'sblack majority fast enough to prevent a social explosion, butit cannot frighten off foreign investors or drive South Africa'smost talented whites to emigrate.   <p> But it isn't easy to figure the odds that South Africa's peoplewill be able to pull this off. The struggle against apartheidhas distorted our view of South Africa in much the same way thatthis racial doctrine has perverted South Africa itself. We thinkof South Africa as a rich land, cursed by racial divisions butblessed with the sole modern economy in Africa. In reality SouthAfrica resembles the nations of the former Soviet bloc more closelythan it does France or Italy. South Africa must modernize itseconomy and adjust to a new era of global competition at thesame time it dismantles costly and inefficient state industriesdating from the era of apartheid and sanctions.  <p> Fortunately, even if the outside world doesn't see this, virtuallyeveryone in South African politics understands the problem. Fromthe Communist party to the Conservatives, South Africa's politiciansand its people know that they need to change. This is partlywhy the white government gave up the struggle against majorityrule: They knew that any attempts by a white government to cutsocial spending or raise electricity and water rates to reflectreal costs would set off an avalanche of violent protest. SouthAfricans of all colors hope that black trade unions will acceptausterity programs and economic reforms from a black governmentthat they would not accept from a white one. They hope that foreigninvestment will return to a democratic South Africa.  <p> The stakes are high for South Africa and indeed for the entirecontinent. Failure in South Africa could doom all of Africa toa generation of famine, pestilence, and war. Success could convinceinternational capital that Africa has a future.  <p>   <p> To understand South Africa today, you have to get beneath thesurface. Literally. The vast gold mines under the Witwatersrand-- an area of rolling hills in and around Johannesburg honeycombedwith the deepest, darkest mines on earth -- were the key to SouthAfrica's social and political evolution in the 20th century.The discovery of gold ensured the destruction of the rural biblicalutopia of the Afrikaans-speaking farmers. After trekking faracross the veld to get away from the British who ruled the coast,they were buried under a gold rush of English-speaking imperialists. <p> The mines shaped the history of blacks in South Africa too.Extracting the gold required building an advanced industrialeconomy thousands of miles from any major city. And it requireda vast supply of cheap labor.  <p> South Africa's mineral wealth has not made South Africans rich,however. When I went to visit the Kloof mine, a large mine outsideJohannesburg, I had visions of gold nuggets waiting to be pulledout of the ground. "Forget the nuggets," the engineers said."It's not that kind of a mine."   <p> Most of South Africa's gold is extracted from a thin band ofwhite-pebbled black ore laid down by prehistoric rivers. Minescan dive more than three kilometers below the surface as theychase the gold. One ton of ore, dynamited out of the earth, carriedto the surface, pulverized, leached, and purified, will yieldsomething like 20 grams of gold at the rich Kloof mine -- worthabout $270 at current market prices. At other mines, a ton ofore will produce half as much gold.  <p> The main elevator shaft at the Kloof mine is about a kilometerdeep -- well over twice as deep as the World Trade Center ishigh. The elevator makes the drop in one fast, fell swoop, leavingits passengers to pop their ears as best they can.  <p> Immediately after leaving the elevator, we walked through brightlylit tunnels as wide as a city street. Near the working face ofthe mine, however, the tunnels became narrower, the lightingless reliable. The temperature soared: It can easily go higherthan 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Glasses fog over; sweat runs freelydown the body.   <p> The mine seemed to squeeze in around me. Here at the workingsurface, the floor and ceiling of the mine are held apart bywooden posts and pallets; the enormous pressures from the mileof rock overhead split and compress these supports, and in placesthere is less than four feet of room between ceiling and floor. <p> At the end of the line, where the mine meets the ore, I reachedout and touched the bare rock reverently. There were no nuggetshere, no gleam of gold: only a thin, clearly marked layer ofwhite-flecked black rock squeezed by an ancient lava flow.  <p> Mining has a bitter logic. Machines can carry the ore and crushit, but it must be dug and blasted out by hand -- lots of hands.Most of that work is unskilled and dangerous. About 800 men --95 percent of them black -- die every year in South Africa'smines. More than 80,000 have died in the mines in the 20th century. <p> But the world price of gold, not the dangers of the job, setsan upper limit on the value of the work. South African mineswith their hard-to-reach, low-grade ores are high-cost producers.About $200 per month is good base pay for a miner. And the jobsare getting scarcer. As the old mines become played out and nonew deposits are found, South Africa's gold production has seena steady decline, falling 33 percent from 1972 to 1992.  <p> The harsh economics of mining, in a sense, drove apartheid.Mining depended on huge quantities of low-paid, unskilled labor.Blacks were recruited in large numbers and then tightly controlledto keep wages and safety costs low. A two-tier wage system quicklygrew up. Black miners were housed in cheap hostels provided bythe mine companies. Skilled jobs were reserved for whites. Overtime, the skilled white workers gradually won the same kindsof rights and living standards enjoyed by blue-collar workersin countries like the United States. Largely unskilled migrantblack workers remained in a kind of peonage. Families were deliberatelybroken up, as South African whites attempted to maintain thefiction that black mine workers were "temporary" residents ofthe places where they worked.   <p> Now the mines reflect the difficulties of South Africa's transition.Black miners have organized into unions and are demanding betteraccess to skilled jobs, better health and safety conditions inthe mines, equal treatment with whites, and better pay. Whiteminers have mobilized their unions to maintain their privileges.  <p> Clashes between black and white miners and between miners andmanagement have become a daily event in the gold mines. On theday I visited the Kloof mine, fistfights broke out between blacksand whites over the customary practice that allows skilled --white -- workers to jump the elevator line at the end of theday. Blacks are tired of waiting, sometimes for hours, whilewhites are unwilling to give up privileges they have come totake for granted.   <p> Blacks want improvements; whites feel squeezed. Mining, likemuch of South Africa's economy, is a zero-sum game.  <p>   <p> In this zero-sum game, advances for blacks will have to comeout of the paychecks of workers like those hanging around theAfrikaners bar in Rustenburg. This conservative mining communityand Conservative party stronghold voted against former presidentF.W. de Klerk's proposals to bring in majority rule.   <p> As I looked around, cliche piled on top of cliche. Primitivepaintings of Afrikaners performing folk dances hung on the walls;out back in an alley a family barbecued a sheep on a spit. Someof the men wore T-shirts that failed to cover their exuberantstomachs. I knew this bar. I grew up in the American South. Icould have been in a redneck bar in a backwoods Alabama town.  <p> I nibbled on biltong, a spicy dried meat snack that can be madeof anything from warthog to cow, and struck up a conversationwith the bartender, a man who also ran a small construction business.I asked him what he thought of blacks.  <p> "I just can't help it," said the bartender. "It's the way Iwas brought up. I can work with a black person; I have blackguys who work on my construction crew. That's one thing. ButI don't want to drink out of the same cup that a black personuses. And I couldn't use the same toilet."  <p> "So," I said, "What do you think of Mandela?"  <p> There was a thoughtful pause. "You know," said the bartender."He surprised me; he surprised us all. People around here werescared at the election. People were buying up candles and bottledwater. They thought there would be fighting. But now they feelpretty stupid. I'll tell you, Mandela isn't what we expected.He's an honest man and an educated man. He used his time in prisonwell -- he read books. Lots of books. I respect him. I trusthim to do the best thing for the country."  <p> Race is, of course, what South Africa and the United Stateshave in common. The American perspective on the country is dominatedby a simple analogy: The struggle against apartheid was SouthAfrica's version of the American civil-rights movement. WithNelson Mandela starring as Martin Luther King, South Africa'sblacks and nonracist whites held hands and sang "We Shall Overcome."The analogy is simple and clear; unfortunately, it is also wrong.  <p> Seeing South Africa this way is too easy. The whole countrycontrives to dupe the American visitor. South Africa even lookslike the United States. Like most Americans, when I think ofAfrica, I think of the rain forests of the Congo Basin, the parklikesavannas of Kenya, and the bleak waste of the Sahara. What Idon't expect is Cape Dutch colonial architecture, prairie landscapes,and lush forests. The scrubby forest that covers much of theKruger National Park looks like second-growth forest in the AmericanSouth; the elephants, giraffes, and rhinoceroses I saw lumberingthrough the bush looked as incongruous as they would have backhome in Louisiana.  <p> But the similarities faded as I spent more time with South Africans.South Africa's whites-only minority government hasn't just thrownin the towel to South Africa's version of our civil-rights movement.It has done something much more wrenching: In American terms,it has given the country back to the Indians. And Nelson Mandelais more like South Africa's Sitting Bull than its Martin LutherKing.   <p> If South Africa's whites had treated their "natives" the waywe treated ours, Nelson Mandela would be on a reservation inthe South African desert today. One can argue, and some SouthAfrican whites do so passionately, that the difference betweentheir country and ours is that their racial policies were lessgenocidal than ours.   <p> The young white men in the Rustenburg bar should be the mostbitter racists in South Africa. They -- poorly educated Afrikaans-speakingwhites from rural areas -- are probably the biggest losers inthe transition. Older whites will keep their jobs; better-educatedwhites will manage somehow. These kids are as close to trappedas anybody in South Africa.   <p> And things are tough for them already. "I work in the platinummine," said a handsome young blond man, "and I make 1,200 randa month, 1,500 if you count in the benefits." At 3.6 rand tothe dollar, that translates to $333 cash, $417 with benefits. <p> "Is that good?" I asked, trying not to look shocked.  <p> "Yeah," he said. "I'm lucky." Many of his friends couldn't gethired at the mine and were working for less. How much less? Around800 or 900 rand in garages, and even this wasn't the worst. Someof them told me that they were taking what used to be "blackonly" jobs -- as security guards, for example, where the paywas 25 rand a shift: $7. Waiters in restaurants can make stillless.  <p> How much would it take to support a family, I asked. They addedup the numbers: 5,000 rand a month. That's more than three timeswhat the mine pays, almost ten times what a guard makes.   <p> How are you going to manage? I asked. They shrugged. They didn'thave an answer. Did they worry about it? Yes, they said. Often.But they didn't blame the problem on the blacks. The economicsituation had been getting worse for as far back as they couldremember.  <p> And, they told me, at least one thing had changed for the better."No conscription," they said. For 30 years young South Africanmen had fought in places like Angola and Zimbabwe. Now all thatwas over, and if these kids were poor, they were at least freeand alive.  <p>   <p> I didn't truly understand how war-weary South African whitesare until I left the country. Tired of incessant talks aboutpolitics and economics, Herman and I took refuge at the ChobeGame Lodge, a luxurious resort inside the borders of an enormousnational park in Botswana. On lazy afternoons we drifted downthe river. Fish eagles swooped on their prey, herons hunted inthe river, giraffes bent low to drink, and families of elephantswith only the tips of their trunks showing swam across the stream.War and politics seemed far away -- until Potgieter sketchedin the history of this landscape.  <p> The Chobe River forms part of the boundary between Botswanaand the Caprivi Strip in Namibia, formerly the South Africandependency of Southwest Africa. When the Portuguese empire inAfrica collapsed in the 1970s, South African and U.S.-supportedforces fought Cuban troops with Soviet backing in Angola. Guerrillasfighting white rule in Namibia and South Africa used the areaas an infiltration point; South African armed forces patrolledthe strip and the Chobe River, sometimes engaging in firefightswith Botswanan forces. All this was just one part of a war thatraged, at one time or another, across the southern half of thecontinent.  <p> Many of the veterans of this war now fly tourists over VictoriaFalls or track game for the tourist camps in Zimbabwe, Namibia,and Botswana. They aren't ashamed of what they did. They tellstories of daring rescues and desperate battles around the campfiresat night. But if the kids don't want to fight, neither do theveterans. Armed white resistance is basically over.  <p> Just how over is clear from talking to Constand Viljoen, widelyconsidered the one man in South Africa with the ability to leada serious white-resistance movement. I met Viljoen at a barbecue-- South Africans call it a braaivleis -- in a beer hall outsidePretoria deep in right-wing territory. The only blacks in sightwere working in the kitchen, and the restaurant looked like theAfrikaner version of a Texas honky-tonk. The menu of steaks,spicy sausages, and mealie pap with barbecue sauce (the SouthAfrican version of grits and red-eyed gravy) enhanced the resemblance. <p> Viljoen, a former chief of the South African Defense Force,heads the Afrikaner Volksfront, the leading ultra-white movementin the country. With his contacts throughout the military --where whites from the old days still dominate the chain of command-- Viljoen could, if he wished, bring Afrikaner nationalism toa boil.  <p> But Viljoen's nationalism is surprisingly flexible. I knew hisgroup had only agreed to participate in the recent electionsin order to further its basic goal of a whites-only volkstaat,a place where Afrikaans-speaking white South Africans could enjoy"self-determination." But as I talked to Viljoen and his associates,it seemed that what they were seeking was less an independentcountry than the survival of Afrikaans language and culture --something less, in fact, than the French Canadians have achievedin Quebec. The Volksfront doesn't want a war either.  <p> Of course, you could argue that none of these whites want tofight because they've won. That thought keeps running throughmy mind as I think about my interview with F.W. de Klerk, presidentof the last white-minority government in South Africa and seconddeputy president in the new Government of National Unity. Wemet in the state president's offices from which he would shortlybe evicted, but he didn't look like a man who had just lost anelection. In fact, he wore a smile as broad and toothy as theone with which the crocodile greeted the naive young elephantin Kipling's "The Elephant's Child." And I asked myself the questionthat the elephant's child should have asked himself before bendinglow to hear the crocodile's whispers: Why is he smiling?  <p> Before I met him, I had thought of de Klerk as South Africa'sGorbachev -- a man who had set out to reform a system and endedup presiding over its dismantling. But unlike Gorbachev, de Klerkstill has some control over the process. When Yeltsin took power,Gorbachev was finished; when Mandela took power, de Klerk wasready for the next round.  <p> And history, de Klerk believes, is on his side. The AfricanNational Congress will break up under the strains of government,and the Nationalists will be ready to pick up the pieces, hetold me. The 1994 election was a "liberation election"; peoplevoted emotionally for the ANC. But the next election, in 1999,would be a different matter. "I expect to win," said the onceand possibly future president, and his smile was, again, as broadand as toothy as anything you would see on the great, gray-greenLimpopo River.  <p> Even if electoral resurrection isn't just around the cornerfor him, the transition to majority rule has still worked outbetter than de Klerk and the whites could have imagined fiveyears ago. The ANC has rejected socialism, the PAC has renouncedviolence, the transitional constitution enshrines minority rights,and the need for a favorable business climate in the countryprovides the white minority with an ironclad guarantee that thegovernment won't redistribute wealth or do anything else thatwould frighten off skittish investors. White South Africans --most of whom grew up fearing an apocalyptic racial struggle thatwould send them into the sea -- have come out remarkably well.  <p> Now it's the black politicians, the victors, who look beleaguered.Walter Sisulu, the ANC's deputy president, is the leading figurein the ANC after Mandela. After a lifetime of struggle, Sisuluhas gone from political prisoner to founding father. But whilethe gentle, grandfatherly Sisulu looks far younger than his 82years, he seemed worried and tired when he spoke to me. In alow, almost mournful tone of voice, he cataloged the economicwoes the new regime faces.  <p> When Sisulu and Mandela went to prison early in the 1960s, theythought of their liberation movement as part of a worldwide uprisingby oppressed peoples against the capitalist order. The SouthAfrican Communist party was their closest domestic politicalally; the bright promise of an African road to socialism beckonedon the horizon, and Fidel Castro was the ANC's comrade-in-arms. <p> Today communism has been revealed as a moral and economic disaster,African socialism is a sick joke, and Fidel Castro seems lesslike the wave of the future than the last of the dinosaurs. <p> Events in the rest of Africa were much on Sisulu's mind whenwe met. "We can learn from the mistakes of others," he said."We have not changed, but we have developed." In prison, he andhis comrades collected newspapers from the rubbish bins and readabout the collapse of African socialism. They drew their ownconclusions.  <p> Just as 30 years of race warchanged the way whites weigh thefuture, so has the last generation changed the perspective ofSouth Africa's blacks. African history has discredited the one-partystate, the socialist model of development, and other theoriesthat these men and women once believed. For example, socialistexperimentation has wrecked Zimbabwe's economy, forcing the currentradical Mugabe regime to undertake painful economic reforms throughoutthe '80s. Now Zimbabwe is a little bit like an African versionof Eastern Europe: The stores are full, but many people haveno money to spend. Zimbabwe still pays lip service to socialistvalues -- newspapers refer to people as "Comrade" rather than"Mr." and "Mrs." -- but even the American embassy praises thegovernment's commitment to IMF-inspired reforms.   <p> "We took the initiative on discussions for political change,"said Sisulu, "not the government." Whites had learned that theycould never win the race war; blacks learned that they couldn'twin it quickly. White-ruled South Africa was capable of mountingformidable resistance for many years, and the country, when theinevitable black victory came, would be in ruins. The bittertruth, one realized by the ANC, was that a peace settlement confirmingwhite economic dominance in South Africa, and cementing SouthAfrica into the world capitalist system, was the best availabledeal for South Africa's blacks as well as for its whites.   <p> If you're looking for a radicalized country where race countsfor more than anything, South Africa will prove a grave disappointment.One night I went to what I thought would be a citadel of radical-chicpolitical correctness -- a movie theater in a ritzy Johannesburgsuburb hosting the first gay and lesbian film festival in SouthAfrican history. I struck up a conversation with a thin blackdrag queen who told me he belonged to Gays and Lesbians of theWitwatersrand, or GLOW, an organization founded by activistswho thought that South African lesbian and gay groups weren'tradical enough.   <p> "So who did you vote for in the last election?" I asked.   <p> "I voted for de Klerk," he said. "South Africa needs a strongopposition. If everybody voted for the ANC, we would have a one-partystate and that wouldn't be good for democracy."   <p>   <p> There are 27 million nonwhites in South Africa out of a totalpopulation of about 33 million: 23 million blacks, 3.4 million"colored" people of mixed ancestry, and 1 million South Africancitizens of Indian origin. All of them suffered discriminationunder apartheid, but their political response to its end hasbeen determined not just by race but by a more complex calculus.For instance, in the Cape, the mixed-race "colored" voters largelysupported the Nationalist party against the Reverend Alan Boesakand the ANC. The result is that the western Cape, under apartheidconsidered the most liberal part of South Africa, is one of twoprovinces not ruled by the ANC.  <p> "In the first place, you have to understand that the Cape coloredswere afraid of the ANC," Ron Morris, a radical colored writerfor the respected Cape Times -- and an ANC supporter -- toldme at a seedy but hip restaurant in a colored area of Cape Town.Under apartheid, coloreds had certain privileges in the Cape.They were afraid that an ANC victory would mean affirmative actionfor blacks and discrimination against coloreds.   <p> But race didn't totally explain the vote. "Even my own mothervoted against the ANC," Morris said. "Religion," he added, shakinghis head.  <p> Boesak, the local ANC leader, had been involved in an unpleasantdivorce and had then married a white woman. "The women on theCape don't approve," said Morris. "People just didn't trust himanymore."   <p> South Africa's politics seem to be flowing against the maincurrents of our century. Race, tribe, nation, and class: Theseare the building blocks of Western political theory and practice.Communism marched under the banner of class war, race war belongedto Hitler and the old white South Africa, nationalism is creatingcharnel houses in Bosnia, and tribalism has led to mass murderin Rwanda. South Africa, like the rest of the world, is dividedalong these lines.   <p> But an alternative to the grim politics of race, class, nation,and tribe is sometimes visible in South Africa. I'm not surewhat to call it. The best word for it might be patriotism: aloyalty to a common homeland and to the other people who livethere, regardless of their race, tribe, or class. In most ofAfrica, the boundaries of countries do not coincide with ethnicdivisions. Tribes, some of which are large enough to be considerednations if they were found in Europe, are divided among one ormore countries; in many nations a dominant tribe controls thestate for the benefit of a minority of the citizens.   <p> This is how the old South Africa worked. The white tribe ofAfrikaans speakers controlled the government for its own benefitand tried to play divide-and-rule with the other tribes.   <p> The ANC believed in a different vision. The many peoples ofSouth Africa could share a common political future and citizenshipwhile retaining their own cultural traditions or maybe createa new multiracial South African culture and identity. This societywould be something like the multiracial, multicultural UnitedStates. Before I visited South Africa, it never even occurredto me to ask whether a society like this could evolve in SouthAfrica. I had seen the violence on television. The ANC's visionwas a pipe dream.  <p> But I saw the potential in this dream one day as clouds of smokebillowed over downtown Johannesburg. As winter winds whippedthe flames from an out-of-control holocaust in a warehouse fullof chemicals, I watched the integrated fire and rescue teams.As two firemen were hoisted to pour water onto the flames, Isaw that one was white and one was black. The police at the scenewere racially mixed; the doctor leading the emergency medicalteam was of Indian origin.  <p> "I came back to this country two years ago," the doctor said."Before that, I was working in Egypt. There was no place forme here. Some of my classmates in medical school are practicingin the U.S. now, and they write to me saying that I should gothere. But I can't. This is where I belong. This is where I amneeded." Then somebody called him, and he went to direct thewhite technicians who served under him.   <p> This potential South Africa will not be born easily. Many ofSouth Africa's tribes -- white, colored, and black -- are stillat war with each other and with the idea of a multicultural nation.The Zulus seem the most profoundly alienated. But even here thereare hopeful signs. Many younger Zulus are urbanized and see themselvesas South Africans first and Zulus second.  <p> For a country on the brink of civil war just a few months ago,South Africa was oddly peaceful during my visit. Even the continuingviolence in the townships was economic, not political -- battlestook place between criminal gangs rather than political factions.From white and black, rich and poor, I heard the same things:South Africa must improve the living standards of its poorestcitizens, but it cannot risk its future with dangerous economicexperiments. Whites are resigned to seeing a higher proportionof spending go to black schools; blacks don't expect miraclesovernight. But conditions in the camps and black homelands areso bad that it will be easy to make big improvements. Familieswho used to walk 60 kilometers to a health clinic will only haveto walk 30 -- and the clinic will be better supplied when theyget there. Millions of blacks no longer live in fear of midnightpolice raids. Whites don't have conscription; blacks don't havepass laws. Even if the economy doesn't improve soon, alreadymany people are better off than they were.  <p> South Africa has an asset the rest of the world doesn't understand-- the determination of its races and tribes to work together.Let me repeat a story told to me by some black intellectualsfrom Johannesburg. Shortly after his inauguration, Nelson Mandelawent to a rugby game. Rugby is as white a sport in South Africaas hockey is in the United States. The band played both of SouthAfrica's national anthems. Mandela sang "Die Stem van Suid Afrika,"the anthem of the old white regime. Then the band struck up "NkosiSikelel' i-Afrika," the beautiful Xhosa hymn that translatesas "God Bless Africa." The crowd did its best, which wasn't verygood. With humor Mandela scolded them. They would have to dobetter. If he could sing their song, they would have to singhis. The overwhelmingly white crowd cheered him. Afterward, SouthAfrican newspapers reported, the national rugby team was busypracticing the new anthem. It wanted to be ready for its nextpublic appearance.  <p>--------------- <p>Walter Mead is a contributing editor of Worth.  <p>  <hr>  <p>Copyright 1994 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership.

Worth magazine/Experts<p>FAIRNESS IN CLOSED-END FUNDS
Does your stock-fund manager serve more than one master?  If so, you and your investment might be secondary priorities.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>Do the managers of closed-end funds provide the same caliber of performance to the small, individual investors in their funds that they do to their institutional or private clients?<p>We wondered about this because equal treatment and fairness are important when it comes to maintaining investor confidence in the capital markets. All investors -- large and small -- should be treated with an even hand.<p>This isn't just good business practice; it's the law. John Heine at the Securities and Exchange Commission says,"If all clients are not treated fairly, that would be a violation of an advisor's fiduciary responsibility." Fund managers who run a single portfolio, of course, have no such conflict. For better or worse, their investors get the same result. When a money manager serves several masters, achieving equal treatment can be a tricky matter. An example: A manager who runs a closed-end growth-stock fund while managing private growth-stock accounts.<p>To find out whether this practice is cause for concern, Worth examined the returns of funds whose managers do investment-oriented moonlighting on the side. What we found wasn't reassuring.<p>We began by isolating managers who run closed-end funds and also manage private or institutional accounts. This meant excluding Baker Fentress and Bergstrom Capital, whose managers stick to a single portfolio. We also removed managers of funds whose investment objectives did not match those of their private clients.<p>Why limit our study to closed-end funds? Because these investment tools have been growing in popularity. Morningstar reports closed-end fund assets of $75 billion last year, 12 times 1985's level. <p>Another reason we stuck to closed-end funds: Their value doesn't fluctuate with inflows of new capital or outflows from redemptions, as with open-end funds. Assessing the NAV of a closed-end fund gives a clearer view of a manager's skills. <p>We also wondered whether it was right to worry about the accountability of closed-end fund managers, especially in comparison with the operators of open-end funds. Open-end funds are always looking for new money -- they're paid on the basis of assets under management -- and the best way to attract fresh cash is with good returns. Poor returns can result in lost business for open-end funds.<p>This is not quite the case in closed-end funds, whose managers are not beating the bushes for new money on the strength of their returns. They sell a fixed number of shares to the public, usually through a brokerage, which then trade on an exchange. Though closed-end fund managers earn more fees if a fund's shares increase in value -- they are also paid as a percentage of assets under management -- they don't have to worry about not being able to raise money from new clients. Neither must they fret about having cash to meet shareholder redemptions. If you want out of a closed-end fund, you sell your shares to another investor, not back to the fund. <p>To be sure that our study compared apples to apples, we limited our focus to managers whose private accounts and closed-end funds have identical objectives as reported in Morningstar and Nelson's Directory of Investment Managers. For example, we compared the returns of the <a name="FUND:MGISX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MGISX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Grenfell Smallcap Fund</b></a>, with $67 million in assets, to the composite performance of Morgan Grenfell Capital Management's $763 million in small-cap managed accounts. Both seek long-term capital appreciation through investments in small-cap companies; their ten largest stock holdings were identical.<p>When we had completed our selection process, we were left with eight closed-end funds. Our list in place, we then turned to see how their managers performed -- both for the fund and for their private accounts. We used compounded average annual returns for one-, three-, and five-year holding periods that ended December 1993.<p>What we found was that of the eight funds, four were either fairly consistent or even outperformed their managers' other accounts. These were Charles Allmon Trust, run by veteran fund manager Charles Allmon; Blue Chip Value Fund, run by Denver Investment Advisers; Morgan Grenfell Smallcap Fund, managed by Robert Kern; and <a name="FUND:RYVFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/RYVFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Royce Value Fund</b></a>, managed by Charles Royce and Thomas Ebright. Royce and Allmon consistently beat their managers' private results.<p>The four remaining funds, <a name="FUND:GABEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/GABEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gabelli Equity Trust Fund</b></a>, <a name="FUND:JGFAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JGFAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Jundt Growth Fund</b></a>, Z-Seven Fund, and <a name="FUND:ZAPAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ZAPAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Zweig Fund</b></a>, reported returns that lagged the composite performance of the managers' other accounts. Disparities ranged from a low of around 12 percent in the Gabelli Equity Trust to 3,000 percent in the Zweig Fund. Each lagged in at least two of three periods. <p>What explains the disparities? There are a number of possibilities; only a fund manager knows which ones apply to him. One source suggested that investment managers may hype returns in their managed accounts. Still, such practices aren't kosher; any manager who did so would eventually end up with some pretty angry clients. <p>Another possible explanation: The managers of the closed-end funds were hampered by trading restrictions necessary to retain their tax-qualified status. For example, closed-end fund managers must follow what is called the short-short rule, which states that gains in fund holdings cannot be taken before three months have elapsed from the time of purchase. Also, the custodial and administrative costs of running a closed-end fund may be a bit higher than those of private accounts.<p>Yet if any of these explanations holds water, then why did four of the funds we studied not succumb to these difficulties?<p>When we asked the fund managers to explain the discrepancies, most of them turned to the "apples and oranges" defense, that all portfolios are different. Maybe so, but the top holdings in three of the four laggard funds exactly mirrored the top holdings in the managers' composite accounts, according to Nelson's and Morningstar. In the fourth fund, no stocks were identified. <p>James Jundt, of Jundt Associates, says,"I think you're talking about numbers that aren't meaningful. One or two percent around a composite are what I call noise." Noise or not, in 1992, his fund lagged his private accounts by almost half. <p>Closed-end funds cannot engage in hedging practices, such as short-selling, which private money managers may. But hedging is uncommon among the managers in our list. According to Nelson's, only Zweig International Managers uses hedging. This may explain part of the gap in the returns, but it's unlikely that hedging alone gives the private accounts gains so far above those in the fund. <p>There's reason for concern here. Why? Because there's no escaping the fact that managers have more incentives to outperform markets in their private accounts than they do in their funds. If they do well for existing institutional clients, they'll find it much easier to snare new ones. What's more, fees earned on private accounts can exceed fees for running a closed-end fund. <p>Some advisors get up to 20 percent of realized gains in their clients' accounts if they beat the market by a set amount. Zweig International Managers, for instance, earns 1 percent annually on private accounts, plus an incentive of 18.5 percent of net new profits earned quarterly. In its fund, Zweig earns 1 percent.<p>We wonder what happens when a manager gets his hands on some shares of a hot IPO. Fund managers usually get around 10 percent of the shares they ask for, so how are these goodies divvied up? How are any big winners or big losers allocated among their clients?<p>"We are very careful about this; we try to keep our accounts in balance at all times," says Charles Allmon, whose fund is an outperformer. "Our in-house ethics committee meets quarterly to discuss it." Of performance inconsistency, he says,"I wouldn't want to embarrass my board of directors by showing up with something like that."<p>Discrepancies in a fund manager's returns should raise some eyebrows. If you're an investor in one of these funds, it may not be reason enough to get out, particularly if you've been content with your returns. But it is something to watch.<p>Investors who own shares in or are considering buying a closed-end fund should ask whether the management firm runs other portfolios. Compare how the firm gets paid on those portfolios with fees earned on the closed-end fund. Ask also whether past returns in the fund and private accounts are consistent and request documentation of this. Think twice about paying a premium for a fund whose returns lag its manager's other portfolios. Recently the Gabelli, Z-Seven, and Zweig funds all carried premiums. Inconsistency in a fund manager is not worth paying for.<p>Gretchen Morgenson is the executive editor of Worth.<p><p>

Success stories obscure the facts:  Most Eastern Europeans now alive will not reach Western standards of living. Ever. <p>By Walter Mead<p>History is back in Eastern Europe -- and it's hungry. When you walk the streets of Warsaw, as I did recently, Western goods beam from the stores; crowds of shoppers share the streets with Western cars. Beguiled by the spectacle, I found that for hours at a time I could convince myself that Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe would one day soon join the economically developed West.<p>But then, sadly, a bit of history would remind me that this vision of the future is not inevitable; in fact, it's extremely unlikely. It's hard to forget history for long in Warsaw: The city still bears the scars of its past. The Nazis bombed Warsaw in 1939 and razed it five years later. Rebuilt by a poor and struggling communist regime not noted for its architectural taste or its deft touch in city planning, Warsaw today sits uneasily in the shadow of past wars. <p>For a while, the excitement of the transition from communism let Poles ignore that shadow. But people here and across much of the rest of Eastern Europe have by now settled into a new routine of democracy and market economics, and life for most Poles is hard. Unlike Prague, a city that already seems to be part of the West, or Berlin, where the clash of Eastern and Western ideas and cultures is creating a new and dynamic urban culture, Warsaw, like Sofia, Kiev, and Bratislava, seems relegated to the second or third tier of European cities: a backwater -- again. <p>The past and the questions of the past haunted the dozen political and security analysts who gathered this summer in a restored castle just north of Warsaw. The question that preoccupied us was an old one: Why is Eastern Europe so different from the West? Baron Sigismund von Herberstein, ambassador from the Emperor Frederick III to the Russian court from 1517 through 1526, asked the same question more than 400 years ago as he pondered the differences between Russia and the West. "I do not know if it is the character of the Russian people that has created such dictators, or if the dictators themselves have given this character to the nation," mused the Baron. <p>In the 20th century both the communists and Western economists have said, change the regime, and national character will change. Bad economic conditions created bad social and political conditions. Fix the Russian and East European economies, and the East would become a utopia. <p>Of course, the economies that the communists wanted to fix were the primitive pseudocapitalist ones that characterized Russia and the rest of Eastern Europe in 1917. The Western experts, in contrast, felt at the end of the Cold War that what needed to be fixed were the command economies created by Lenin and Stalin. Fix Eastern Europe's communist economies according to free-market principles, and Russia and all of Eastern Europe would quickly turn into normal -- that is to say Western -- European societies. Lenin's mistake hadn't been to think that he could remake his society with an economic blueprint; he had just picked the wrong blueprint. <p>This belief -- I would call it a delusion -- helped to shape the foreign policies of both the Bush and the hapless Clinton administrations. It's easy to understand the attraction of this vision. Western economics would turn Eastern Europe into an extension of Western Europe and expand the group of affluent European democracies into the Eurasian heartland. That in turn would tilt the global balance of power irreversibly in favor of Western values and policies. Peaceable and prosperous democracies stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok would encircle the northern hemisphere and guarantee global stability. Both administrations expected a new world order to emerge from the collapse of European communism. <p>Now that some of the dust created by the fall of the Berlin Wall has settled, however, it seems that the best indicator of current and future economic performance in Eastern Europe remains past political and economic performance. It's now clear that the future will be more like the past than almost anyone thought in the heady rush of the downfall of communism. <p>Take, for example, what was once Czechoslovakia. That country, and especially the territory of the Czechs, was widely considered the most modern and democratic of these countries before the World Wars -- and so it is today. In the new Czech Republic, Czechs, freed of the burden of the more backward Slovaks, speak confidently of a future in which they see no military threats to their security and only temporary obstacles to their prosperity. As long as Germany remains democratic and Western Europe is prosperous, say the Czechs, they have nothing to worry about. They are right. <p>Their Eastern neighbors, however, look into the future and see -- with alarm -- their past. Poland desperately wants to join the two clubs of Western Europe -- the European Economic Union and NATO. It will, however, be years before Poland is ready for either one, and meanwhile the Russian bear is stirring. Belarus, a Slavic country that occupies the territory between Poland and Russia, is on the verge of reintegrating with Russia. That event would put Russian troops once more on Poland's borders.<p>The Polish economy is also a prisoner of its past. Poland's small farmers were the hard core of resistance to communism; their unity and their Catholic faith enabled them to resist collectivization. An unfettered free market would doom these politically influential farmers: Their "two hectares and a mule" farms can never compete with agribusiness in Western Europe. A program of agricultural investment would probably produce prosperity for some farmers, but others would be forced off the land -- a process familiar from our own history. But unless Poland improves the efficiency of its agricultural sector, productivity and incomes will remain low. Although the Polish economy is, at long last, beginning to grow once again, wages -- approximately $300 a month including earnings in the underground economy -- are extremely low. Most of the population now living cannot expect to reach Western standards of living. Ever. The politics of the past and the economics of the future pull in opposite directions. Care to bet which will be stronger?<p>Farther south, the Balkan countries, where the Ottoman Empire persisted into the 19th century, are even more heavily weighted down by their past. The consequences are most tragically evident in the wars now raging in the former Yugoslav republics, but in countries like Bulgaria and Romania, tense interethnic relations between aggrieved minorities and traditional ruling groups promise generations of violence. In this region most governments have been simultaneously authoritarian, incompetent, and corrupt. <p>Within the former Soviet Union, conditions are even worse. Ukraine and Moldova lack the ethnic cohesion and economic base for national independence. The trans-Caucasian former Soviet Republics -- Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan -- have reverted to the clan feuding that dominated their history until the imposition of Russian rule in the 19th century. As Russia's experiment with democracy dissolves into a morass of anarchy and crime, it seems inevitable that sooner or later the Russian people will demand the strong leadership of -- at best -- a modern Peter the Great or -- at worst -- a new Ivan the Terrible. <p>This shouldn't have surprised anybody in the West, least of all the conservatives who claim to understand the role of tradition in modern society. Unfortunately, we fell victim to our own cold-war propaganda. We compared France with Bulgaria and simple-mindedly attributed the differences to the nature of communism and capitalism. <p>This was a mistake. Bulgaria was much poorer than France long before the Red Army reached it; Russia was backward and primitive before Lenin was born; the Balkans were considered Europe's most backward region when Karl Marx was eating teething biscuits. More than the Iron Curtain divided Eastern and Western Europe.<p>Let's look at some numbers. Currency fluctuations and the unreliability of old statistics make it difficult to compare the gross domestic products of European economies before the Second World War, but some indicators can give us an idea of the relative levels of development in prewar, precommunist Europe. By 1938, the United States was producing 1,156.2 kilowatt hours of electricity per person per year and had 0.24 motor vehicles per person on the roads. Britain and France, respectively, were producing 0.85 and 0.51 kilowatt hours of electricity per person, and Britain had 0.06 motor vehicles per person on the road. Infant mortality in the United States was 47 per 1,000 live births for whites and 79 for blacks; it was 53 in Britain and 70 in France. <p>Now look at the East. In 1938, Russia produced 0.27 kilowatt hours of electricity per person. Infant mortality was 155 per 1,000 in 1928. Romania, still at that time a capitalist country, produced 0.06 kilowatt hours of electricity per person and had 0.002 motor vehicles per person on the road. Infant mortality was 183 per 1,000. <p>If anything, many Eastern European countries gained on the West during much of the period of communist rule. According to the 1992 National Economic Report of the President, Eastern Europe's centrally planned economies grew 2.0 percent faster than Western Europe's from 1971 to 1975. Even as late as 1985, the Soviet Union was outperforming the European Community. From 1950 to 1975, electricity generation grew 309 percent in France and 282 percent in the United States, compared with 703 percent in the USSR, 690 percent in Poland and 2,015 percent in Romania. <p>This doesn't mean communism was working or that these countries would have ever passed the West under communist rule, but it should help us focus on the real issue. Eastern Europe's real problem isn't that it was communist but that it is and was underdeveloped. Some Eastern Europeans may have nuclear weapons, but much of Eastern Europe is in the Third World and is likely to stay there for decades to come. <p>Again, the numbers are sobering. In 1992, the per capita gross domestic product in Poland was $1,882.39, in France $22,150.76, and in the United States $23,678.54. Take the best-case assumption: that Poland can grow as fast as Thailand -- one of the world's fastest-growing capitalist economies -- while the West will continue to see the slow growth of the past ten years. This would mean that Poland's per capita gross domestic product would grow at 5.8 percent per year, while the U.S. would grow at 2.5 percent and France would grow at 2.2 percent. Under these assumptions, Poland would achieve parity with France in 2064 and with the United States in 2072. In 2050, Poland would still have a per capita gross domestic product that was only 50 percent of the U.S. level. <p>Russia is even worse off. Assuming the Russian economy bottoms this year and starts to grow like Thailand's, Russia can expect parity with the United States in 2132. <p>Remember, this is a best-case scenario. Most of these countries will grow more slowly than Thailand, and some of them may not grow at all. Political instability in parts of the East could slow economic growth and establish a vicious cycle: no political stability without economic prosperity, no economic prosperity without foreign investment, but no foreign investment without political stability. These cycles are depressingly common in international life. <p>The lesson of Eastern Europe is sad but important: The future is rooted in the past. No economic reforms and no paper constitutions can cancel out the effects of centuries of conflict, culture, and tradition. This is the lesson that conservatives ought to be teaching and that liberals ought to be learning. It is a sad commentary on the intellectual and political life of the West that at this critical moment in world history we seem to have forgotten it -- just like the Bolsheviks.

How to buy country funds that are normally off-limits.<p>By Manjeet Kripalani<p>American investors have been pouring money into emerging markets, buying up country-fund shares as quickly as American brokerages can print them. But there may be even better places to stash your overseas investment cash. Foreign-issued mutual funds, not registered for sale in the U.S., often are undervalued and have higher returns and lower costs than their American counterparts. <p>Although these funds are supposed to be off-limits to investors in the States, they are by no means impossible to buy. In addition to their lower costs and, in some cases, higher returns, overseas funds offer stateside investors pure plays on developing countries that they wouldn't otherwise have access to. <p>Case in point: Vietnam. Despite the recent lifting of the U.S. embargo against Vietnam, there is not one SEC-registered Vietnam fund available. American retail investors, technically speaking, cannot directly partake of the country's economic promise. <p>Meanwhile, a London investor can buy Beta Vietnam Fund, of Ireland and Vietnam Fund Ltd., of Hong Kong. These funds trade at high premiums to net asset value -- Beta Vietnam at a 45 percent premium and Vietnam Fund at 65 percent over NAV -- and are expensive considering that Vietnam has no stock exchange and few private corporations. But they do allow investors to get in on the ground floor of a country ready to develop economically.<p>Want to invest in Korea? U.S. investors can choose from just three funds -- Korea Fund, Korea Equity Fund, and Korean Investment Fund. All trade at high premiums, averaging 20 percent, 12 percent, and 11 percent respectively, at mid-year on the New York Stock Exchange. Good luck.<p>Non-U.S. investors have 14 other Korea funds to choose from. The Clemente Emerging Growth Fund, on the London Stock Exchange, trades at a discount of 10 percent. Daehan Korea Trust shares are trading at their NAV. <p>Big premiums on U.S.-issued country funds are the result of limited offerings and heavy taxes on offshore investments. "In London, investors get six times as much choice on country funds," says Eric Roseman, editor of Impartial Global Mutual Fund Investor in Montreal. "The 467 U.K.-listed country funds are trading at an average 8 percent discount to net asset value, versus the 76 U.S. country funds that are trading flat or at a 0.5 percent premium." <p>One reason it's tricky for U.S. investors to buy offshore funds is that the Investment Company Act of 1940 prohibits offshore funds from soliciting business here. That means these outfits can't send offerings to a U.S. address unless it's a private placement, and those are usually limited to institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals. Offshore funds also decline checks from U.S. citizens, so investors must have an offshore bank account, hold property overseas, or be expatriates. In the last case, they must sell the fund when they come home.<p>It is the IRS, however, that keeps most American investors out of these funds. Most offshore country funds qualify as passive foreign investment companies, according to the Internal Revenue Code. Unlike U.S. funds, which distribute capital gains and income to shareholders every year, offshore funds make distributions only when investors exit. So after ten years, an investor is likely to be stranded with huge taxable gains. Because taxes haven't been paid annually on the unrealized gains, the IRS charges interest on the taxes owed and penalties for late payment. It also taxes the gain as ordinary income, at a much higher rate than that of a long-term capital gain. If there is a loss, it cannot be offset against investment gains.<p>All this is enough to put even the most determined investor off the whole idea of investing in an offshore fund. Except that the funds are, according to Harvey Fireman, partner of mutual fund taxation at Ernst & Young, "a really tremendous investment that will make up for the tax liability."<p>Both the IRS and the SEC can be gotten around. Ian Wilson of Micropal, a global-fund tracker in London and Boston, says, "With a little bit of work, you can get enhanced returns, an interesting portfolio, and stay ahead of the game." If you don't want to give up your citizenship, the best way to invest in offshore country funds is through a tax-qualified retirement plan, like a 401(K) plan. Joel Adler of the New York law firm Sutherland, Asbill and Brennan has been legal counsel for numerous offshore funds. Last year, he invested in the Siam Fund and the Malacca Fund (both managed by Indosuez and traded in London) through his retirement plan and received a 100 percent return on his money. By being in a 401(K), he skirts the tax on ordinary income.<p>If you buy one of these funds, be prepared to do some extra bookkeeping. Funds familiar with U.S. tax law will break down income and distribution on an annual basis and issue a pro forma statement. This way, if you buy a fund outside of a tax-deferred account, you pay the usual capital gains tax and avoid IRS interest and penalty costs. If the offshore fund does not provide this service, save yourself a headache and get a good accountant, impute annual income and gains on your portfolio, and pay taxes on it.<p>You can buy shares in open-end funds directly through the management company that issues them, or you can buy both open- and closed-end funds through private overseas banks that can be nominated to hold the shares in trust for foreign investors. For example, Royal Trust Bank in Vienna or Bank von Ernst in Bern, Switzerland, will act as nominees for a minimum investment of $15,000 and $40,000, respectively.<p>U.S. brokerages offer no facilities for American investors to buy offshore country funds. But for a minimum $10,000 investment, U.S. investors can deal directly with overseas brokers like Olliff & Partners in London, experts in closed-end country funds. U.S. brokers charge an average 5 percent transaction fee above the fund's management fee for country funds available in the U.S. Orlando, Florida-based International Assets Advisory Corp. charges average commissions of 2.75 percent for offshore funds; brokers like Olliff charge a 1 percent commission.<p>Another way to participate in offshore investment is through a bank or broker in the country you're interested in. An open-end Mexican stock fund, Accival, returned 37 percent in the last 12 months, much better than the popular Mexico Fund, listed on the NYSE, which gained 28 percent. To buy Accival shares, American investors can set up an account with the U.S. arm of Banamex, the Mexican bank that manages and distributes the fund. These funds typically levy a load of around 1.5 percent but incur no local capital gains tax. Unless you put the shares in a 401(K), you can't escape the IRS, which regards this as an offshore investment to be taxed accordingly.<p>Since offshore funds cannot solicit business in the U.S., how can you find out about them? For $119, you could subscribe to the Impartial Global Mutual Fund Investor, which monitors offshore funds' performances and provides bimonthly price and NAV updates. Better still, benefit from a good relationship with your broker and have him help with your homework. <p>The hurdle is getting hold of a prospectus of a fund you like, as it cannot be sent to a U.S. address. A friend overseas could receive it in your name, then send it to you. Or your foreign bank or broker can mail it to you.<p><p><p>

						<p>By Manjeet Kripalani<p>It seems like a terrific, timely idea: a new forum for listing Asian stocks so that North American investors can buy into Pacific Rim markets more easily. But when the innovator is the notorious Vancouver Stock Exchange, investors should beware.<p>Canada's government has been studying proposals to rein in the freewheeling VSE, where too many listees are famous for being -- to put it tactfully -- of questionable investment value. As a result, the VSE's new Asian Board of Exchange, set to open this summer, is getting something of a cold eye from Canadian regulators. Says Dean Holley, superintendent of brokers for the British Columbia Securities Commission: "We don't know whether this will be the last resort for every scoundrel in Hong Kong and the Far East."<p>Well, what kind of companies have applied to list on the Asian Board? The VSE won't give a full accounting, but so far there seem to be few heavy hitters. For instance, there's a $3 million Vancouver-based telecommunications concern that wants to buy a Chinese cement company. And there's a taxi company that operates 150 cabs in China and wants to expand into minibuses and gas stations.<p>In fact, the Asian Board may prove most attractive to companies that can't get listed in Hong Kong or other Pacific Rim exchanges with stringent entry requirements. The VSE's standards also are less demanding than rival North American exchanges. The fee to list on the Asian Board, for example, is $2,400. By contrast, foreign companies pay $18,000 for a listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange -- and $100,000 for the New York Stock Exchange.<p>The VSE's Asian Board requires compliance with Canadian or international accounting standards. But it also promises to be "responsive to the special circumstances of substantial Asian companies." With such an accommodating stance, low entry requirements, and British Columbia's cheap legal fees, the VSE believes its Asian Board can act as "an extension of the Chinese market," says VSE vice president John Boddie.<p>Regulator Holley, however, frets that the Asian Board could worsen the VSE's cowboy reputation. He warns that investors playing on the Asian Board should be "sophisticated, well-advised investors who appreciate risk." A first step toward such sophistication: When you're pitched the next great Asian investment, remember to ask where it's listed.<p><p>

						The Quest: To Turn $100,000 Into $10 Million ... In Siberia<p>By Curtis Hartman<p>It's snowing, the temperature is minus 27 degrees celsius, and sunrise has yet to come to Moscow as John Boynton steps out of his hotel and into a cab on this February morning. The 28-year-old president of Diomedes Inc. is headed for the airport and Aeroflot Flight 209, due to depart at ten o'clock for the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk. The cab driver peers silently through a defrosted half-moon on the icy windshield as he punches the accelerator. The view outside is bleak: block after squat block without billboard, neon sign, or lighted storefront. Here and there, small groups of workers shiver patiently in lines at the bus stands. The cab weaves around cars abandoned in the snowy streets, then passes though miles of gigantic flats laid out in concentric rings.<p>Boynton is so full of adrenaline he can hardly sit still in the rattling cab. He flew in from Boston only last night, but he's been up for hours already, bundled in his long underwear against the cold, planning, making notes, strategizing an assault on the frontiers of capitalism. For more than four years, he and his Moscow-based partner and high school best friend, Robert Stubblebine, have been on an elusive quest: to strike it rich in Russia's bewildering free-market economy. Already, the two aspiring carpetbaggers have pursued more than a dozen schemes in post-Soviet Russia, but so far they've had only limited success. They've sold used cars and auto parts, run a marketing consulting firm, sourced walnuts for Ben & Jerry's ice cream, and traded in rugs, tungsten, bee venom, and vodka. They've had to cope with Russian privatization and the start of reform, an attempted coup, an attempted putsch, and the defeat of reform. Their biggest success to date involves the sale of U.S.-made computers. But hawking technology has been anything but a bonanza; it's paid just enough to keep alive hope of a big score just around the corner. <p>Boynton is convinced the frozen reaches of the east will yield the long-awaited breakthrough. He and Stubblebine will be boarding a creaky Aeroflot jet (just weeks prior to their trip, an Aeroflot plane crashed in Siberia, killing all 120 passengers) and flying into deepest, coldest Siberia. Novokuznetsk, today a decaying industrial town, was once the industrial heart of the Soviet empire. If Russia is to rise again as an economic player of any importance, towns like Novokuznetsk must be reborn. And Boynton and Stubblebine figure that to do that Russians will need some basic heavy equipment -- like forklifts and snowplows. <p>Boynton gets to the airport before his partner. Inside the Aeroflot terminal, there are no other foreigners in sight, but the walls of the transit halls are covered with small advertising stickers for such companies as Unimex Computers, Texas Pipe and Supply, and Conroe Taxidermy.<p>By 9:30, when Stubblebine arrives -- just a half-hour before the flight -- the room is filling with smoking men in fur hats, all of them Russians. Stubblebine hasn't had a full night's sleep in a week, and his exhaustion shows on his face. His baby son, Nicholas, has been sick, and he and his Russian wife, Masha, have taken turns getting up to soothe him. Still, Stubblebine is nearly as wired as Boynton. While Boynton has lined up dealership agreements with American equipment suppliers from Diomedes' Boston office, Stubblebine has been mining his contacts from his outpost in Moscow: old computer customers from the Urals to the Baltics and computer sales agents from Siberia to the Ukraine. He hopes they can open the doors that lead to heavy-equipment customers. They've already taken a few modest orders: $250,000 worth of snowplows for an oil company in the Urals and $2,050,000 worth of forklifts to a Siberian mine. They've also just obtained a loan for $50,000 from some U.S. investors, with another $50,000 promised.<p>All that's left is the hard part: finding a customer who can buy into a multimillion-dollar deal in a country that is essentially bankrupt.<p><p>In 1991, former ambassador Robert Strauss said that if he were a younger man with a $100,000 stake, he'd come to Russia and turn it into $10 million. Back then, before the reformers failed and the economy collapsed, that might have been a reasonable notion. Russia was a market that appeared primed for Western capitalism. Strauss thought nervy Americans would sweep in and make deals right and left. Oil, gas, minerals, and timber were waiting to be extracted. An educated workforce was desperate for jobs. <p>Today, everything in Russia is up for grabs, and the rules keep changing. The country is in the midst of a revolution, a depression, and a gold rush -- all at the same time. The language is notoriously difficult to learn. Trustworthy business partners are scarce, and the Mafia is pervasive. Due diligence in the new Russia is far more complicated than simply looking at a balance sheet. An investor needs a personal intelligence apparatus to figure out which companies have enough money or potential to be worth pursuit. <p>Joking back and forth in the airport transit lounge, Boynton and Stubblebine look like an incongruous pair. Dressed in a bright red CB Sports parka, a monogrammed Lands' End bag at his side, Boynton has the chipper, displaced look of a newly arrived exchange student.  Stubblebine is harder to place; not Russian, obviously, he's often mistaken for a prosperous Latvian. The two friends grew up in Concord, Massachusetts, and discovered Moscow together on a high school class trip in 1983. Boynton traded some of their shirts, his sneakers, and his Walkman for fur hats and rubles, and cut loose on the Red Arrow overnight train to Leningrad, drinking vodka mixed with Tang and dancing in the aisles in a sheet. <p>In 1988, Stubblebine returned to Moscow to study at the Pushkin Institute during his senior year at Williams College. That year, he fell in love. Over his parents' objections, he married Masha nine months later in one of the old Soviet wedding halls .<p>Stubblebine lost $1,000 on his first business deal in Russia. It involved swapping $23,000 worth of pumpkin seeds with a German company for American computers. Despite the financial setback, he was immediately hooked on the challenges of deal-making in a country with no money, no commercial law, and no experience with capitalism. When his business started to take off, with first-year sales over $900,000 and margins between 20 percent and 30 percent, he asked his old friend Boynton to handle the supply end. Two years out of Harvard and still stuck in his father's real estate office, Boynton jumped at the partnership idea, maxing out his credit cards for a stake. They called their company Diomedes, after the two islands in the Bering Strait -- one Russian, one American -- just two miles apart, and wrote out a four-page business plan. "We were so naive," Boynton laughs today. "We didn't have a real niche or any strategy. We just thought we were smart and aggressive."<p>Boynton thought they had a winner in 1991 when some of their customers started asking for used cars. Stubblebine worked out the contracts while Boynton trooped to auto auctions all over the East Coast, snapping up late-model Ford Escorts. Diomedes shipped 200 cars to Leningrad and had another 400 to 600 in the pipeline. But then disaster struck. The letter of credit from Diomedes' main customer reached the company's Soviet bank on August 21, which just happened to be the day that tanks rolled through Moscow's streets in the attempted coup against President Mikhail Gorbachev. When the gunfire stopped, the bank and Boynton's and Stubblebine's profit had disappeared, along with the Soviet system. <p>Next, Stubblebine uncovered a Russian metal factory hidden outside of Moscow, a former defense supplier that could make high-quality stainless steel. Boynton negotiated a deal to supply Farberware, a Bronx cookware and small-appliance company, with bottoms for its frying pans -- 2 million pounds of stainless steel discs a year at $1.50 a pound with a 15 percent margin. The deal would have earned Diomedes $450,000 a year in profit.<p>It took months to arrange; Diomedes even flew the Russian plant managers over to New York to meet Peter Cameron, Farberware's chief executive officer, and cement the transaction over dinner at Manhattan's Russian Tea Room. But then, just as the Russian factory was about to begin production, its supply of nickel mysteriously vanished.<p>Politics thwarted Diomedes' biggest potential deal, an export-import swap of $5 million in forklifts for $6 million in copper that took most of 1993 to arrange. The company signed a contract with a huge Russian mining operation north of the Arctic Circle, then lined up financing from a U.S. lender, found a copper buyer in Rotterdam, and ordered 100 customized forklifts from Toyota. But then the Russian who signed the contract ended up on the wrong side of a power struggle over control of the mine. Diomedes almost sank as a result. The partnership was out of money, and Toyota insisted the company take delivery of 23 forklifts that already had been manufactured.<p>Russell Johnson, a Moscow-based Commerce Department official, estimates that some 500 U.S. companies have at least a modest presence in Russia. But not many Americans cross Stubblebine and Boynton's path. Americans "are too conservative and not as willing to take risks as the Europeans and the Orientals," Stubblebine says. Large U.S. consumer companies have blanketed the city with advertising for cat food and Uncle Ben's rice, and McDonald's is booming, now expanded to three outlets. But the expected bonanza in oil, gas, and timber has yet to materialize. <p>"You can't say yet when the country will finally stabilize; it may not be until 2010," Boynton says. "Nowhere else in the world can little guys with no-name companies like Diomedes come over and deal with the major players. We've come close on deals that could have made us a million dollars at one time. If I were working for some big company in the States, I would have job security, but I wouldn't have that chance."<p><p>Boynton's wife was worried when he left Boston; she'd read the newspaper stories about Aeroflot safety standards and all its crashes in Siberia. So he is glad she can't see what happens when their plane is finally called and all 120 passengers rush outside together. The runway is unplowed. The tires are bald. No one has deiced the plane. "Someday these guys are going to need airport plows," Boynton says happily as the crowd shoves up the slippery metal staircase.<p>"At least they're showing us which plane to get on," Stubblebine replies. "The last time I flew to Siberia, I had to go from plane to plane, yelling up to the cockpit, asking which one was going where." <p>The aircraft is jammed, walls smudged, carpets torn up, and seat belts broken or missing. "Cozy, isn't it?" Boynton jokes as Stubblebine tries to force his six feet, seven inches into 12 inches of leg space. Beer cans are popped and vodka bottles screwed open after takeoff, and the narrow aisle fills with drinkers fighting their way back to the bathrooms, past the smokers, who cram together in a blue haze in front of the toilets. But Stubblebine and Boynton work, sipping mineral water from plastic cups, reviewing papers, and making plans. Siberia is immense: four hours flying over four time zones and 2,000 miles of snow and forest and tundra to go just halfway across. <p><p>Boynton's first glimpse of Novokuznetsk is majestic: a giant construction crane, towering three stories over the airport hangar, silhouetted against the sunset. But the reality, Stubblebine tells him, is more mundane. Last year the area's major industries banded together to build an international airport, pledging dollars and rubles to a Yugoslav concern for the construction. The dollars disappeared into dozens of pockets, the rubles lost their value, and Yugoslavia dissolved; now the crane sits idle, sheathed in ice.<p>In the glory days, when the city was still called Stalinsk, the surrounding hills were the heart of the Soviet empire's industrial might, site of two of the nation's largest steel mills, and near the biggest coal mines and iron-ore deposits in the world. The rails for the Moscow metro were made here, as were the armor for the tanks that rolled into Berlin at the end of World War II and the construction rods for the Soviet missile silos. <p>Vladimir Kissel, the partners' 47-year-old Russian technical advisor, is waiting for them at the airport gate -- impatiently. A welcome dinner for "important visiting delegations" is scheduled to start in an hour and is part of a trade show they have come to attend. Their presence is absolutely required. Kissel is a former Diomedes computer customer who is now a part-time Diomedes employee. Still officially a lab director at Moscow's Institute of Steel and Alloys, he has friends and former colleagues throughout the industry. <p>Kissel had arrived in Novokuznetsk a day early to finalize meetings and to hire a car. Although crime in the provinces isn't yet as bad as it is in Moscow, Kissel has assured them their driver will be carrying a gun. <p>The Evening of Getting Acquainted, the trade show's kickoff event, is well underway. A dozen Russian men in their 50s and 60s line one side of a long table, while on the other side sit members of visiting delegations, including a man from a German construction company, a French business consultant, and an Italian financial advisor. The two young Americans and Kissel sit at the end of the long table, which is awash in platters of red caviar on brown bread, deviled eggs, beets, pickles, herring, cold chicken, kielbasa, and cheese. <p>This is a formal affair: The vodka is 90 proof, tumblers turned bottoms up with each toast. One by one the Russian officials get up and welcome their foreign guests in the endless exhortatory style learned over years of party congresses. Then it is the guests' turn. Stubblebine alone speaks without a translator, introducing Boynton as "the president of Diomedes, who has come to this occasion of the trade fair all the way from Boston."<p>Finally, the organizer gets up, steadying himself on his chair as he calls for order. "I want to apologize," Vladimir Tabatchnikov, the show's director general, says. "There were supposed to be more important people with us tonight, but they weren't able to travel here because of the current economic conditions." He concludes, however, in pep rally fashion: "Let us make Novokuznetsk a NovoPittsburgh! Or a NovoNew York! Or a NovoLondon!"<p>"It's all such grandiose bullshit," Stubblebine says quietly as the organizer sits down, apparently overcome by emotion. "And we'll have to listen to it 13 more times for each potential sale."<p>"It's just like Rotary," Boynton says.<p>The next morning's breakfast is a cardiologist's delight: sausage, cheese, potatoes and chicken in gravy, and pancakes stuffed with sour cottage cheese. The bill for the meal is 22,000 rubles --  under $14 -- cheap by Moscow standards, where prices are higher than in New York, but a good gauge of Russian inflation. In 1989, breakfast would have cost less than $1, and 22,000 rubles would have bought a Russian-made car. <p>Zapsib, today's sales call, looks like a hot prospect. The largest steel factory in Novokuznetsk, it was privatized two years ago and is Russia's major supplier of construction rebar. It is even exporting, modestly, and the mill is running on all three shifts. <p>Until two years ago, Russian purchasing was centralized in Moscow, where officials would decide each year how many forklifts the country needed and who should get them. Today, with central planning dead, equipment manufacturers have no way of finding who needs or uses their products, while Russian factories, newly privatized, have to learn how to find and negotiate for equipment. <p>Boynton and Stubblebine have discovered that, until 1992, most of Russia's forklifts and lift trucks were imported from Bulgaria, some 100,000 units annually. These were cheap machines that rarely lasted more than a year. Plus, Bulgaria is now going through its own convulsions, and forklift production has fallen below 15,000 units annually, so the potential for others to win business appears huge. Boynton had looked for machines to sell that would be durable enough to cope with the Russian climate. Diomedes was already, inadvertently, a Toyota agent. Taylor Machine Works, a $95 million manufacturer in Louisville, Mississippi, gave the partners exclusive rights to market its 10- to 70-ton lift trucks, list price starting at $60,000, plus transportation. Boynton also worked out a similar arrangement with Clark Material Handling in Lexington, Kentucky, which makes less expensive one- to six-ton lift machines. <p>To find buyers, meanwhile, Stubblebine relies on telex, sending off 400 messages to identify 20 prospects, a Russian variant of direct mail. There are no phone books, no switchboards at most companies, no way of knowing if mail gets through. Zapsib is still a bureaucracy, requiring Stubblebine to obtain approval from six levels of hierarchy. He has been climbing this ladder since a meeting last summer with a Zapsib purchasing official. Today's call on Gennady Arykov, Zapsib's deputy general manager, is his first face-to-face contact with a decision maker.<p>Russians have been ambivalent about Western merchants since the days of Ivan the Terrible, and are particularly wary of carpetbaggers today. They're unfamiliar with the idea of outside investors earning a return, sensitive to their own relative weakness, and quick to take affront. Stubblebine and Boynton are young; they'll have to win Gennady Arykov's trust and convince him they have his long-term best interests at heart. Boynton brings a more concrete agenda. He wants information. Concepts like return on investment and projected earnings are new to the Russians; most don't have those kinds of numbers, don't know how to find them, and wouldn't share them if they did. But Boynton needs at least a few facts to figure out whether or not a deal can work. <p>As they drive into Zapsib, Boynton imagines Pittsburgh 25 years ago. The complex spreads over 19 square miles, 35,000 workers at 81 plants, seven coke ovens, three open-hearth furnaces, five converters, four rolling mills, and a wire factory, vertically integrated and apparently self-contained. Before 1989, Zapsib's only concern was meeting Moscow's production quotas; today, with privatization of the steel industry nearly 80 percent complete, its managers have to find their own raw materials and paying customers. That's hard, with 90 percent of the enterprises in Russia functionally bankrupt. Steel output has dropped 40 percent in the last four years, while the cost of industrywide modernization has risen from an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion. <p>What is to be done, they ask in Moscow: keep the plants afloat with subsidies, risking even higher inflation and the specter of political unrest, or let most of them die, leaving many more millions newly unemployed and the specter of even worse unrest? As far as Boynton is concerned, it doesn't matter: Zapsib could be one of the few survivors, and a potential customer, under either scenario. He needs to know what is happening today. What is Zapsib's annual investment plan? Are forklifts part of it? And, most important, how does Zapsib expect to pay?<p>Gennady Arykov surprises Boynton and Stubblebine. They'd expected a Soviet-era apparatchik, unpolished and secretive, but the deputy general manager is glad to talk numbers. With his open smile, tailored suit, and Rolex, he could pass for a senior American executive. His office is done in Italian leather with a laser printer, fax, two phones, and a TV, along with a radio broadcasting the plant's daily production report. "Everything is running smoothly, except the bread factory," he tells them. It hasn't yet gotten the flour it was promised and has shut down. <p>Stubblebine outlines Diomedes's history and describes the Taylor and Clark forklifts they have come to sell. "We have a few proposals we want to discuss with you, freely and frankly," he concludes. "But first we'd like to understand what problems you have with your business."<p>The Quest: To Turn $100,000 Into $10 Million ... In Siberia<p>By Curtis Hartman<p>It's snowing, the temperature is minus 27 degrees celsius, and sunrise has yet to come to Moscow as John Boynton steps out of his hotel and into a cab on this February morning. The 28-year-old president of Diomedes Inc. is headed for the airport and Aeroflot Flight 209, due to depart at ten o'clock for the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk. The cab driver peers silently through a defrosted half-moon on the icy windshield as he punches the accelerator. The view outside is bleak: block after squat block without billboard, neon sign, or lighted storefront. Here and there, small groups of workers shiver patiently in lines at the bus stands. The cab weaves around cars abandoned in the snowy streets, then passes though miles of gigantic flats laid out in concentric rings.<p>Boynton is so full of adrenaline he can hardly sit still in the rattling cab. He flew in from Boston only last night, but he's been up for hours already, bundled in his long underwear against the cold, planning, making notes, strategizing an assault on the frontiers of capitalism. For more than four years, he and his Moscow-based partner and high school best friend, Robert Stubblebine, have been on an elusive quest: to strike it rich in Russia's bewildering free-market economy. Already, the two aspiring carpetbaggers have pursued more than a dozen schemes in post-Soviet Russia, but so far they've had only limited success. They've sold used cars and auto parts, run a marketing consulting firm, sourced walnuts for Ben & Jerry's ice cream, and traded in rugs, tungsten, bee venom, and vodka. They've had to cope with Russian privatization and the start of reform, an attempted coup, an attempted putsch, and the defeat of reform. Their biggest success to date involves the sale of U.S.-made computers. But hawking technology has been anything but a bonanza; it's paid just enough to keep alive hope of a big score just around the corner. <p>Boynton is convinced the frozen reaches of the east will yield the long-awaited breakthrough. He and Stubblebine will be boarding a creaky Aeroflot jet (just weeks prior to their trip, an Aeroflot plane crashed in Siberia, killing all 120 passengers) and flying into deepest, coldest Siberia. Novokuznetsk, today a decaying industrial town, was once the industrial heart of the Soviet empire. If Russia is to rise again as an economic player of any importance, towns like Novokuznetsk must be reborn. And Boynton and Stubblebine figure that to do that Russians will need some basic heavy equipment -- like forklifts and snowplows. <p>Boynton gets to the airport before his partner. Inside the Aeroflot terminal, there are no other foreigners in sight, but the walls of the transit halls are covered with small advertising stickers for such companies as Unimex Computers, Texas Pipe and Supply, and Conroe Taxidermy.<p>By 9:30, when Stubblebine arrives -- just a half-hour before the flight -- the room is filling with smoking men in fur hats, all of them Russians. Stubblebine hasn't had a full night's sleep in a week, and his exhaustion shows on his face. His baby son, Nicholas, has been sick, and he and his Russian wife, Masha, have taken turns getting up to soothe him. Still, Stubblebine is nearly as wired as Boynton. While Boynton has lined up dealership agreements with American equipment suppliers from Diomedes' Boston office, Stubblebine has been mining his contacts from his outpost in Moscow: old computer customers from the Urals to the Baltics and computer sales agents from Siberia to the Ukraine. He hopes they can open the doors that lead to heavy-equipment customers. They've already taken a few modest orders: $250,000 worth of snowplows for an oil company in the Urals and $2,050,000 worth of forklifts to a Siberian mine. They've also just obtained a loan for $50,000 from some U.S. investors, with another $50,000 promised.<p>All that's left is the hard part: finding a customer who can buy into a multimillion-dollar deal in a country that is essentially bankrupt.<p><p>In 1991, former ambassador Robert Strauss said that if he were a younger man with a $100,000 stake, he'd come to Russia and turn it into $10 million. Back then, before the reformers failed and the economy collapsed, that might have been a reasonable notion. Russia was a market that appeared primed for Western capitalism. Strauss thought nervy Americans would sweep in and make deals right and left. Oil, gas, minerals, and timber were waiting to be extracted. An educated workforce was desperate for jobs. <p>Today, everything in Russia is up for grabs, and the rules keep changing. The country is in the midst of a revolution, a depression, and a gold rush -- all at the same time. The language is notoriously difficult to learn. Trustworthy business partners are scarce, and the Mafia is pervasive. Due diligence in the new Russia is far more complicated than simply looking at a balance sheet. An investor needs a personal intelligence apparatus to figure out which companies have enough money or potential to be worth pursuit. <p>Joking back and forth in the airport transit lounge, Boynton and Stubblebine look like an incongruous pair. Dressed in a bright red CB Sports parka, a monogrammed Lands' End bag at his side, Boynton has the chipper, displaced look of a newly arrived exchange student.  Stubblebine is harder to place; not Russian, obviously, he's often mistaken for a prosperous Latvian. The two friends grew up in Concord, Massachusetts, and discovered Moscow together on a high school class trip in 1983. Boynton traded some of their shirts, his sneakers, and his Walkman for fur hats and rubles, and cut loose on the Red Arrow overnight train to Leningrad, drinking vodka mixed with Tang and dancing in the aisles in a sheet. <p>In 1988, Stubblebine returned to Moscow to study at the Pushkin Institute during his senior year at Williams College. That year, he fell in love. Over his parents' objections, he married Masha nine months later in one of the old Soviet wedding halls .<p>Stubblebine lost $1,000 on his first business deal in Russia. It involved swapping $23,000 worth of pumpkin seeds with a German company for American computers. Despite the financial setback, he was immediately hooked on the challenges of deal-making in a country with no money, no commercial law, and no experience with capitalism. When his business started to take off, with first-year sales over $900,000 and margins between 20 percent and 30 percent, he asked his old friend Boynton to handle the supply end.

His office is done in Italian leather with a laser printer, fax, two phones, and a TV, along with a radio broadcasting the plant's daily production report. "Everything is running smoothly, except the bread factory," he tells them. It hasn't yet gotten the flour it was promised and has shut down. <p>Stubblebine outlines Diomedes's history and describes the Taylor and Clark forklifts they have come to sell. "We have a few proposals we want to discuss with you, freely and frankly," he concludes. "But first we'd like to understand what problems you have with your business."<p>

The sudden visibility of discount stores signals a major shift in Japan's economic and political balance of power.<p>By Gregory J. Millman<p>Where years of U.S. jawboning and a score of trade missions have failed, the deep, painful, and shocking Japanese recession has succeeded. Two years of economic turmoil have done more to open Japan to imports than two decades of U.S. pressure. And that's good news both for those who watch U.S. exports and those who worry about the long-term health of the world economy.<p>But this recession is accelerating a microeconomic revolution that will do far more than change Japan's trade balance. It's producing a Japanese consumer startlingly sensitive to prices. New companies, practicing U.S.-style discounting, are grabbing a larger and larger share of the market. As some old-line companies shrink into insignificance, the financial relationships that have kept the Liberal Democratic Party in power have begun to erode, and the unquestioned Japanese consensus on public and private spending is being questioned. The next economic upturn will reveal a profoundly and unpredictably different Japan.<p>The pain that has produced this change is clearly visible on the streets of Tokyo. Sanya, a grimy, gray quarter of Tokyo, is the shock absorber of Japan's economy. Here, just beyond the district that houses the burakumin, Japan's caste of untouchables, the depth of the country's two-year-old recession can be measured in the milling numbers of directionless men waiting in loose queues on street corners for construction contractors who don't come anymore.<p>The scene is a common one in the third world or even in the inner cities of the United States, but shocking after a decade in which prosperity seemed assured in Japan. From a small friary next door to a safe house belonging to Japan's feared gangsters, the yakuza, Brother Nathaniel of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity helps serve a free hot meal every Saturday. About 300 men begin to line up in the snowy alleyway hours before the doors open. The number of men living on the streets has doubled here in the past year, Brother Nathaniel says, and they are getting younger.<p>Outside of Sanya, the effects of the country's  recession are more subtle but just as powerful. A young man leaving Tokyo on an early-evening train says he works for an air-cargo company and he used to get home at 9 p.m. Now he gets home at 7. The company cut his hours and his pay to cope with the decline in business.<p>Companies aren't spending like they used to. Everyone remarks how easy it is right now to get a taxi at night in downtown Tokyo. In the good old days, that was impossible - companies had booked them all for drinking parties. Now, at lunch hour and in the evenings, in plastic-roofed noodle stalls and tempura stands under the railroad tracks, suit-and-tie-wearing salarymen eat standing up and pay out of their own pockets. During the boom years, they lounged in posh restaurants on the company tab. "Consumption has gone completely grunge," grumbles Peter Tasker, a Tokyo-based analyst at investment banker Kleinwort Benson.<p>Women's magazines that used to feature dream shopping trips to Paris now advise their readers how to dress stylishly on a budget. Yoshinoya Beef Bowl, a clean, no-frills eatery where a huge bowl of beef and rice costs only 680 yen ($6.40), is thriving. Skylark, a Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) company, expanded down-market from its already inexpensive Skylark restaurants to the Gusto chain, which offers even more inexpensive fare. Investors obviously endorse the strategy - Skylark shares outperformed the TSE average by 65 percent in 1993.<p>Nowhere is the change more obvious than at Kawachiya, a liquor discounter that sells imports like Jack Daniel's for less than half of what department stores charge. "The price is great," says Tatsuo Kishi, a vice president at <a name="NYSE:CMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10322"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chase Manhattan Bank</b></a>'s Tokyo branch. But before the recession, low prices didn't matter. "The Kawachiya store in my neighborhood used to be empty," says Kishi, "but nowadays it's always packed." <p>For decades, would-be exporters to Japan have complained that the complicated distribution system shuts foreign products out of the retail market no matter what their price. The Japanese consumer paid more for almost everything - Japanese-manufactured spark plugs sell for $2.82 in Japan and $1.16 in the U.S.; a U.S.-made electric shaver sells for $90.14 in Japan and just $44.95 in the U.S. Thanks to the recession, that system is crumbling. In January, one evening news program in Tokyo ran a lengthy report on a novel phenomenon: the discount store. Reporters interviewed delighted consumers pushing full shopping carts under big yellow sale signs.<p>The Robespierre of this price revolution is Goro Aoyama, president of Aoyama Trading. Aoyama started out building small roadside stores in the 1980s, selling suits to suburban salarymen for as little at 30,000 yen ($283). By 1993, Aoyama was selling 10 million suits a year - that's one out of ten suits sold in Japan. Although Aoyama sells at lower prices than department stores, he gets higher margins - more than 50 percent. The average department store is lucky to get 20 percent. <p>Aoyama's secrets are commonplace in U.S. retailing. Aoyama imports a quarter of the suits he sells. He has factories locked into exclusive supply contracts, cutting out several layers of middlemen. The company's stock price has nearly quintupled since 1989. <p>End runs around the traditional supply-and-distribution system have helped make a success of companies besides Aoyama, says Hirokazu Ishii, a retail analyst at Nomura Research International. Shimamura sells basic women's underwear cheap. Senshukai is a catalog retailer of upmarket women's wear. Shimamura outperformed the Tokyo Stock Exchange Index by nearly 23 percent last year; Senshukai beat the index by 57 percent.<p>There's more to life than clothes, of course. There's cars. "One of my best recommendations is Autobacs Seven," says Kaori Hasegawa, Salomon Brothers vice president for equity research in Tokyo. Autobacs undersells its competitors on everything auto-related, from oil changes to computerized navigation systems.<p>Hasegawa also likes Tsutsumi Jewelry, a small company sold over-the-counter. Tsutsumi imports gold and gemstones directly from India. Drawn in by super bargains like earrings for merely 480 yen a pair ($4.52), Tsutsumi's customers spend an average of 30,000 yen ($283) each. "It's the kind of place where I'd shop for myself, my mom, or my sister," says Hasegawa. <p>Like many affluent young Japanese women, Hasegawa used to fly to Hawaii once a year and stock up on cosmetics. The savings on a year's supply made the trip a bargain - for example, a European perfume that cost $57 in the U.S. cost $81 in Japan. Now the trip would be more difficult to justify. The liquor retailer Kawachiya has begun going head to head with Shiseido, Japan's leading cosmetics manufacturer, by selling cosmetics for less than the manufacturer's recommended retail price. <p>The price wars are creating new opportunities for foreign brands, as control shifts from manufacturers to retailers. Traditionally, manufacturers were able to control prices by cutting off supplies to retailers who undercut the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Demand was usually greater than supply. The recession reversed the supply-demand equation. Meanwhile, the stronger yen made imports a better bargain for consumers.<p>Although some optimists expect a turnaround in Japan's economic statistics by year end, no one expects a living, breathing recovery for at least a year or two. Professor Takaaki Wakasugi of Tokyo University thinks it might be another six years before the economic problems are over. And the microeconomic revolution won't end when the economy eventually turns.<p>The new discount stores are just the most visible signs of a profound shift in the balance of power in Japan. Japanese consumers are voting with their wallets against a system that charges them too much. They aspire to the higher standard of living that many of them have seen in their travels, and they're willing to flex their economic muscle to achieve it.<p>It will take time. Don't expect TV news reports tomorrow of consumers storming the Diet, Japan's parliament, with demands for cheap rice and thick Angus steaks. Japan's microeconomic revolution will be more like a protracted guerrilla campaign that gathers strength on the economic periphery before laying siege to the central seats of power. In some cases - food is the best example - price will still be second to national security. Many Japanese still remember that President Nixon embargoed soybeans and shudder to think what would happen if a Japan dependent on food imports faced a similar embargo on rice.<p>But the old consensus in which consumers accepted overpriced goods and undersized houses as the cost of prosperity is crumbling. That consensus worked for the same reason any compromise works: Everyone got something. Farmers and manufacturers had protection, politicians had votes, and consumers had jobs. Now the recession is dealing Japan's workers out. They have less to gain from the compromise, and they are rejecting it both when they shop and when they vote.<p>Last year's electoral defeat of the Liberal Democratic Party shook up the carefully balanced structure of compromise but did not demolish it. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa may be committed to deregulation, but the bureaucrats and the interest groups the regulations protect are still fighting hard to keep their special protections. As the recession grinds on, they will argue that this is no time for the government to relax protection.<p>Consumers will ultimately decide this debate. This group is the new face at the table of power in Japan, and it doesn't share the interests of the established players. The long-term health and success of big companies aren't so important to people who are losing what they thought were lifetime jobs at those companies. Retirees in rapidly graying Japan know that the strong yen makes it harder for Japanese companies to compete, but they also know that it makes their pensions go further.<p>Consumers can cast two ballots for change: one at the checkout counter and another at the voting booth. They are throwing away an old distribution system by not buying from it and old politicians by not voting for them.<p>Viewed this way, the long-term success of the microeconomic revolution seems almost assured. There will be a new economic organization, and in that new organization consumers will have the right to decide how much quality they want and for what price. That won't be good news for all U.S. exporters - only for those who can win a fair fight.

						<p>West is best among the world's phone companies<p>By Derrick Niederman<p>Way off the spreadsheets that most securities analysts use, and way off the New York Stock Exchange too, there's an intriguing emerging-market telephone speculation called Telebras. It's the Brazilian telephone company. Telebras and western-hemisphere telephone stocks in general now seem much more attractive as investments, or speculations, than those in the Pacific Basin.<p>That's a conclusion reached by ranking telephone companies using two measurements. One is the number of telephone lines in service per 100 residents--let's call it teledensity. The other is the market capitalization of the company divided by the number of installed lines. The lower the teledensity, the greater a market's potential for growth. The greater the market cap per line, the greater the probability that investors are hyping the potential.<p>With around 8 telephone lines for every 100 people, Mexico seems to be one of the least developed markets around. But similar low rates of market penetration also apply to Brazil, Chile, and Argentina. China has less than one line per 100 residents.<p>These figures correlate roughly with per capita incomes. To realize their potential, the telephone companies need economies with solid production gains and rising incomes. When Telefonos de Mexico was listed on the New York Stock Exchange three years ago, Mexico's teledensity was 6.6 percent. Since then, a stronger economy with lower inflation has stimulated the telephone business, and teledensity has increased by 21 percent. In response, Telmex shares have more than tripled.<p>Shrewd investors should look for either low prices per line, representing a reasonable price for the business, or a low teledensity, representing potential. It would be unrealistic to expect both, simply because the fewer the lines already installed the greater the capital investment per line. Looking at conventional price-to-earnings ratios helps complete the profile.<p>Such measures suggest that U.S. investors should stick to their part of the world. Valuations for Asian telecommunications companies are much more frothy than their western counterparts. Hong Kong Telecommunications is a comparatively expensive stock, valued at $7,300 per installed line, nearly 20 times expected 1994 earnings. That doesn't suggest much near-term price growth. Hong Kong Telecom's desirability as a long-term holding depends on its success in mainland China. As of last year, China accounted for 47 percent of Hong Kong Telecom's international traffic.<p>By comparison, Telefonos de Mexico still looks good. While its capitalization relative to installed lines is no bargain, its profit margins are high and its price-to-earnings ratio appealing. Telmex shares have been trading at less than ten times expected 1994 earnings of $7 a share; the stock has dropped to $63, down from its 52-week high of around $76. Telmex's margins will shrink in 1997, when it loses its long-distance monopoly in Mexico. But one investment firm believes it will remain the sole supplier of local phone services.<p>Telefonica de Espana also looks like a buy at its current market valuation, just over ten times expected 1994 earnings, $973 per installed line. Through an investment in Telefonica Internacional, the company has large interests in Latin America: 8 percent of the Argentine phone company, 43 percent of Chile's, 6.4 percent of Venezuela's, and 79 percent of Puerto Rico's. Those holdings account for nearly one quarter of Telefonica de Espana's market capitalization, which means that the price investors pay for the Spanish franchise is even cheaper than it appears.<p>For the truly adventurous, there's Telebras. With its stock trading at about $1,300 per installed line, and just seven lines per 100 people, Telebras is one of the cheapest phone stocks around, statistically speaking. Of course there are negatives; otherwise the stock wouldn't be so cheap. Illiquidity and high inflation, with an associated currency risk, come quickly to mind. Yet it could continue to grow, and grow profitably, for years to come.<p><p><p>

Why one of the hottest markets looks undervalued<p>By Liliana Nealon<p>Recent downdrafts in Brazilian stocks present nervy investors with an interesting opportunity. Any decline in prices on Bovespa, Sao Paolo's volatile stock exchange, looks to some investors like the beginning of a bear market in Brazil. After all, investors raked in gains of 111 percent in these stocks last year and another 27 percent in the first ten weeks of this year. Even so, the Brazilian stock market is by no means the world's most overvalued. It is, in fact, undervalued, if measured against other international bourses. <p>Most companies in the Bovespa trade at about 75 percent of their book values. Compare this to the S&P 500, which currently trades at more than three times book value. Price-to-earnings ratios today average 20 in Brazil. Even though that number is rising, it remains lower than the p/e's in many other emerging markets; it's just under the U.S.'s average of 21. Price - to - cash-flow ratios in Brazilian equities are less than 8 on average, compared with ratios as high as 27 for other emerging markets and 11 in the U.S. <p>American investors have obviously discovered Brazil. Net purchases of Brazilian equities by U.S. investors amounted to some $1.4 billion in the first nine months of 1993, according to the investment firm of S. G. Warburg.  Also during that period, Americans purchased stocks worth 1.4 percent of Brazil's total stock market capitalization.  <p>The cloud on the horizon in Brazil is inflation, the country's biggest and most persistent problem. Since 1987, inflation in Brazil has increased more than 800 percent annually; it's currently running at around 40 percent per month. <p>"I would not know what it would be like to live without inflation," says Nami Tavares Neneas, senior investment analyst at Banco Tendencia in Sao Paolo. Indeed, Brazilians are masters at adapting and adjusting to inflation, indexing, and keeping ahead of rising prices. But inflation takes its toll on the business environment, creating high interest rates and currency concerns as well as uncertainty over future product pricing. <p>The country's privatization and economic plans, however, have raised investors' confidence in Brazil. The first part of the country's economic-stabilization plan only recently passed Brazil's congress. It includes a temporary Brazilian currency - indexed to the U.S. dollar - known as the URV, which was created in early March. Once the currency is stabilized, new and beneficial debt agreements with the international community should follow. <p>A further improvement in Brazil's economic situation will come as a result of the privatization of around ten government-owned companies this year. These deals will provide much-needed cash for the government and should create additional investment opportunities for investors, both foreign and domestic. The Brazilian economy should grow more than 8 percent this year. <p>Between 1959 and 1980, Brazil experienced strong economic growth, but then the economy, weighed down by hyperinflation, began to falter. Per capita GDP in 1992 was actually 9 percent lower than in 1980.<p>Now that Brazil's economy appears back on track, can investors capitalize on the nation's turnaround? Besides the highly publicized Brazil Fund and the Brazilian Equity Fund, investors are limited to a handful of American depositary receipts (receipts for shares of foreign-based corporations, traded on U.S. exchanges) that are not too closely watched or researched by the U.S. investment community.  <p>That means investors must do much of their own legwork. One idea: Look into future Brazilian privatizations that may result in U.S. - listed ADRs. Upcoming privatizations are likely to include electric-utility and telecommunications companies. Auto, textiles, electronics, and steel companies are particularly promising because many of them are prepared technically and financially to meet increasing demand for their goods.<p>For example, Cia Siderurgica Nacional, known as CSN, is the largest steel company in Latin America in terms of production; it was privatized last April. According to research from Banco Tendencia, strong earnings expectations, an improving financial condition, a diversified product base, a strong competitive position, and export growth are some of the reasons to expect solid performance from CSN in 1994. Its shares recently traded around $34.50 over the counter. <p>Other stocks to consider include Cemig, the electric utility in the state of Minas Gerais, the second largest state in Brazil in terms of GNP contribution and population. Cemig recently traded at around $26.50, 76 percent of book value. <p>Petrobras Distribuidora PN, an oil and energy distributor, is another company investors should watch for. The market leader in oil-derivatives distribution, Petrobras is planning to issue an ADR later this year. It has solid financials and has been trading in Brazil recently at ten times its 1994 forecasted earnings.  <p>Fits and starts notwithstanding, the Brazilian market should maintain its strength throughout 1994. But the Bovespa is not for the faint of heart: Like a good steamy samba, the market is sexy but unpredictably spasmodic.<p><p><p>

Pictures from a revolution: All over China, a thousand markets bloom as a billion consumers build the world's next great  economy.<p>By Richard Bernstein<p>Mao's mausoleum on a shopping bag? For someone who lived in China in the early 1980s, it is the irresistible emblem of change. Back then, with great uncertainty, the country was starting its lurch toward a market economy. From his vast, kitschy home in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, the embalmed Great Helmsman glowered disapprovingly as China tried to consign his anticommercial puritanism to the past.<p>Now this forbidding image has been transformed to a design motif, a selling tool for the new consumer culture. Truly, Maoism is dead.
The measure of change is in the details. Only a few years ago, foreign residents of Beijing delighted at the first shoots of a budding capitalist China. It was a visual experience above all. A riot of colorful silk began replacing the drab gray-blue uniforms. Women perched in long rows under archaic hair dryers, getting perms in state-run beauty parlors.<p>Such everyday matters struck heavy hammer blows to the self-abnegation preached by Mao. In Beijing 14 years ago, the government caused a sensation by allowing the first family-run private restaurant to open. Until then, dining out for most Chinese meant visiting a grimy public enterprise to partake of standardized grease. Many of the country's greatest chefs, meanwhile, had been cashiered during the Cultural Revolution for embodying the bourgeois sin of eating well. <p>In the street, yearnings became palpable. Another thrill in those days was to be found in the basement of the National Minorities Palace. There, for a time, the more daring of China's young people came to dance in a discotheque sometimes frequented by foreigners. Plainclothes police stood in the shadows, watching as a primitive cultural exchange played out without official sanction.<p>More earthshaking, the first free markets in nearly 25 years were approved. Suddenly peasants appeared in the cities with the kind of fresh produce that had been available only to foreigners and the Communist Party elite--and then only in the hard-currency shop. Quick, colorful trade exploded to fill the psychic gap felt by a population that had stood for years in long, sad lines at state outlets.
It was all monitored and controlled by the state, of course. And it is still. Nevertheless, this new nation of spenders, 1.2 billion strong, has emerged as the fastest-growing venue for foreign investment in the world. In 1992, nearly $12 billion flowed into China--more than in the three previous years combined. The 116 companies listed on the Shanghai stock exchange, authorized only four years ago, are now capitalized at $24 billion.<p>Cities that hadn't changed in half a century are suddenly the centers of a nationwide construction boom. And the hot core of the new capitalism is a former peasant village on the Hong Kong border: Shenzhen, once a somnolent place of mud-brick homes and rice paddies.<p>The transformed Shenzhen is still a semiforeign realm; ordinary Chinese folks can't go there without a special pass. But amid its ranks of high-rise towers and modern plants producing circuit boards is a vision of what China is about to become. The message is of remarkable hidden power: This muscular metropolis grew from nothing in just 15 years.<p>Even outside the special zones, China is building its new economic engine--a huge consumer class. Phalanxes of Avon ladies are descending on doorsteps around the country. Parents are stocking up on Gerber baby food, made in Shenzhen. The ban on owning private cars has been lifted; Chinese families troll in Polish-made Fiats or, for the powerful and newly wealthy, Mercedes-Benzes.<p>For anyone who knew the old China, there is a miracle in all this--a miracle beyond even the recent proclamation from Deng Xiaoping, who just five years ago sent tanks into Tiananmen Square, that change could be coming even faster. It's the sight of Mao, who once made a nation tremble, on a shopping bag.  <p><p>

Managed funds may have an edge in tough times<p>By Robert N. Veres<p>During the ten-year bull market that began in 1982, a balanced portfolio of blue-chip stocks consistently offered better returns than two thirds of all equity-fund managers (fewer than a third of whom beat the S&P 500 index). This trend caused a lot of investors to bypass active managers altogether, and either invest in index funds, to match what the markets offered, or pick individual stocks. Even the old dartboard tactic made more sense than paying hefty fees for fund management. <p>The market climate that investors face today, however, calls for a different approach. Either do more homework, or find somebody to do it for you. For one thing, small-company stocks have outperformed large ones over the last two years (the Russell 2000 index was up 17 percent for 1993), placing a premium on the ability to locate successful companies from among a wider array of issues. At the same time, blue-chip companies that were once considered too big to fail weren't fast or flexible enough to compete in the 1990s markets. In recent years, <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> all fell on hard times and were forced to restructure. Finally, international investing has grown dramatically. U.S. stocks no longer make up a majority of the world's equities--or of the world's best investment opportunities. <p>These are trends that reward investors who pore over annual reports and talk frequently to management and who are conversant in the accounting principles of offshore locales. Which, of course, is exactly where fund managers have an advantage. These are folks with access to big research departments and communications pipelines to company management. For instance, Peter Van Dyke, the manager of T. Rowe Price's <a name="FUND:PRSIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Spectrum Income</b></a> and <a name="FUND:PRSGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Spectrum Growth</b></a> funds, receives over 20 reports each day on markets, companies, and economic factors (of those, he admits to carefully reading 8 to 10) and another 10 to 15 faxes from various sources around the world both inside the company and outside. <p>At T. Rowe Price, there are 50 analysts (29 for equity and 21 for bonds) who cover specific sectors, industries, and companies and who are available to Van Dyke for additional reports, formal opinions, or just impromptu brainstorming sessions. And the firm receives reports from some 100 analysts around the world in offices from Hong Kong to India to Tokyo. "People forget that even traditional domestic-growth funds are allowed to have up to 25 percent of their assets invested internationally," says Ron Roge, a financial planner in Centereach, New York. <p>Already, the performance figures are bearing out the importance of these advantages. Last year, nearly 70 percent of all equity funds outperformed the S&P 500. That's a sharp turnaround from 1989, when only 20.4 percent of equity funds beat the blue-chip indices. <p>The market also has gotten tougher for bond investors. Putting money into certificates of deposit or other short-term instruments is unattractive. At the same time, interest rates have grown more volatile, and there's more low-grade paper around. That means bonds now jump around almost as much as stocks, and investors have to venture beyond the obvious investments in order to get any kind of return at all. <p>The safest way to navigate through this fixed-income jungle may be to let more than a single manager lead the way. One option would be to pick good managers in several categories: one for intermediate governments, another for high-grade corporates, and still another for unrated corporates (junk). These sectors seem to take turns offering the best risk/return characteristics. So with all three covered, investors can stabilize the bond side of their portfolio.<p>The bottom line: Markets are becoming increasingly complicated and increasingly dangerous for the part-time investor. This, too, is probably no more than a turn of the cycle; five or ten years from now, we'll probably be hearing a lot about the neglected virtues of CDs and blue chips.<p>With a lot of research, individuals can ferret out the future <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>s and <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>s from the small-cap crowd, locate investment opportunities on the Eurasian continent, or determine which unrated corporate paper is a diamond in the rough. But for most investors, the dartboard won't be as effective as it was in the past.<p><p>

A strategy that combines growth and value investing<p>By Robert N. Veres<p>The management styles of stock mutual funds break down into two broad camps--growth investing and value investing--that periodically seem to fall into and out of favor. When the economy was healthy back from 1983 to 1986, value stocks (and value managers) outperformed their growth-oriented colleagues. But during the recession, growth stocks tended to outperform the market. And with the recovery, value stocks have taken the lead again. Says John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, a Chicago-based mutual fundtracking service, "They give you better returns at different times." <p>Growth managers buy stocks of healthy companies with a history of increasing earnings, on the theory that as the company grows, so too will the price of its stock. Value managers buy companies whose stock is selling below its real value, either because of a recent setback, poor earnings, or a combination of factors, hoping these companies will eventually rebound. Says Stephen Gibson, director of national retail marketing at the Boston-based mutual fund giant Putnam Investments, "A growth manager is trying to have big up years and outperform the market during its bull runs. Value managers, by and large, build their performance by outperforming on the downside of the market."<p>It takes a little research to determine whether a fund takes a growth or value approach. Growth managers will tend to own stocks that are selling at a higher price-to-earnings ratio than the market average, on the theory that future earnings will be even higher. For the same reason, the growth fund's average earnings growth will be higher than the market. A good example is the <a name="FUND:BEONX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BEONX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Berger 100</b></a> fund. According to the latest data available from Morningstar, Berger's stocks are selling at about 37 times earnings on average, nearly twice as high as the current market averages. Berger is paying over eight times the current book value of the companies it buys, which is more than twice as high as the S&P 500 norm, and five-year earnings growth is up around 35 percent--five times as high as the average stock.<p>Value managers, in contrast, tend to keep their price-to-earnings ratios much lower. And, since their goal is to buy a dollar's worth of company as cheaply as possible, their price-to-book value will be low as well. One of the better value funds over the last ten years, Mutual Shares, currently has an average price-to-earnings ratio almost exactly equal to the market, a price-to-book ratio at 2.2 (40 percent below the market averages), and five-year earnings growth around 5 percent, which is below the market as well.<p>In some cases, investors might want to emphasize either value or growth in their portfolios. Young investors with a lot of time to build a nest egg might be more comfortable with a growth-oriented style. Investors in a high tax bracket might also prefer to invest with a growth orientation because most of the return is coming in the form of capital gains (28 percent maximum federal tax rate) rather than dividends (39.6 percent maximum rate). On the other side, conservative investors or those with shorter time horizons might prefer the protection that value funds offer during market downturns. <p>Some investors, of course, try to guess which style will be on top in the near future and buy those funds. But the better financial advisors have tended to blend both styles into the same portfolio as a way of increasing returns while limiting losses. A simple approach for investors with a large enough portfolio is to divide the equity portion equally between a top growth and a top value fund. The result will be a portfolio with fewer ups and downs.<p>The most convenient way to create a mixed growth and value portfolio would be, of course, to find a mutual fund that blends the two styles. For some reason, fund companies have been reluctant to take this approach. One notable exception is the <a name="FUND:LSSCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LSSCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Loomis Sayles Small Cap</b></a> fund. Half of its cash inflow is invested in growth stocks selected by manager Barbara Friedman, while the other half is picked according to manager Jeff Petherick's value orientation. Both managers look for companies with high insider ownership and dominance of a market niche, and both tend to favor smaller companies over corporate giants. But while Petherick pays between 11 and 13 times projected earnings for a 15 percent annual growth rate, Friedman will buy price-to-earnings multiples half again as high as the market, looking for 20 to 35 percent earnings growth per year. "The intent," says Friedman, "was to reduce the normally high risk in a small-cap fund and at the same time get the high returns."<p>The result is a fund with an average price-to-earnings ratio almost exactly equal to the S&P 500, but an earnings growth rate of over three times the market average. This approach beat the S&P 500 by 5.5 percent in 1992--the fund's first full year of operation--and Friedman and Petherick were comfortably ahead of the indexes again in 1993.<p>Nobody knows whether growth or value will be the dominant theme for the next few years, but with one foot in both camps, whichever way it goes, you're bound to get some good news.<p> <p><p>

						What Americans don't understand about the chaos convulsing modern Russia<p>By Walter Mead<p>Trapped inside the rebellion that rocked moscow last fall, I had a splendid opportunity to ponder the economics of Russia today. My view of the meltdown was front and center. Barricades went up on the road outside my hotel. Tractor trailers, three deep, blocked the street against the terrorist squads that were attacking City Hall. A radio announcer reading a list of closed Metro stations, roads, and other facilities sounded like an American deejay announcing school cancellations for snow in Duluth. I couldn't even call Delta Airlines to confirm my flight; the building housing Delta's office had been hit by gunfire and a stray shell. <p>Some Russian friends and I walked along the Garden Ring Road, picking our way across barricades and around bonfires. At the Tass building, troops in ski masks and camouflage outfits waved machine guns at us and shouted something in Russian. We left. <p>The cafes--what few there are--were all closed. No <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a>, no Pizza Hut. As we wandered the streets looking for something to eat, a machine gun started up some distance away. The gunfire came closer. Victory celebrations? A firefight? Who knew? <p>Rarely has a moment in history been as closely watched as the rebellion in Moscow. Now that I am home, I am struck by the gap between Russia as it actually is and Russia as the Western press describes it. <p>The discrepancy is rooted in the fact that Westerners mistakenly assume Russia to be "in transition" to something like the world we know, to the type of democratic capitalist society that characterizes the West. In every Russian crisis, Western observers try to differentiate between the good guys (the "reformers" and "democrats") and the bad guys ("hard-liners"), who want to keep Russia poor and authoritarian to preserve their own power. We use the same yardstick to measure policy proposals: The good guys favor "market reforms"; the bad guys oppose them. If the good guys win, Russia will take the capitalist road to Western prosperity. Like Belgium, only bigger. <p>This beautiful and inspiring morality play unfortunately has little to do with Russian realities. Russia is a wilder and more dangerous country than it appears on TV; economically, culturally, and psychologically it is more remote from Western Europe than most Americans suspect. Beneath its thin veneer of franchise restaurants, Russia remains unique. Dostoyevsky, not Dan Rather, should report the news from this front.<p>To understand Russia, we must see it as it is, not as we wish it to be. Russia is the last feudal society in Europe, and it has never really known capitalism. In the last half of the 19th century, czarist reformers attempted to lay the groundwork for capitalism. But faced with the competition of more advanced countries and the shocks of World War I, Russia's nascent capitalism collapsed. The Communists marched backward into what one can only call industrial feudalism. <p>As a result, the Communist boss of a Soviet factory had more in common with the barons of medieval Europe than with Western factory managers. Managers of collective farms exploited peasants precisely as czarist nobility exploited the serfs. All property in the industrial feudal society was owned by the state. Where medieval barons received temporary ownership of manors and fields in exchange for service and loyalty to the king, Russian commissars and managers received factories in return for loyalty and service to the state.<p>Social relations in Russia are still shaped by medieval patterns of domination and submission that flourished under feudalism. The humblest clerk in the sleaziest hotel identifies with authority; her work takes precedence over you, the humble petitioner who stands before her desk, waiting for assistance. But if you manage to impress on her (or him) that you represent an even greater authority, arrogance changes to cringing humility instantly. <p>Another manifestation of the heritage of feudalism: Russians put their faith in and give their loyalty to people more than institutions and to institutions more than abstractions. Any authority in Russia is considered unreasonable and unjust--but it is evaded, not opposed. The manager gives orders; rather than dissent, the employees disobey. Russian institutions are more arbitrary and weaker than those in the West: more arbitrary because they answer to the logic of power more than justice, weaker because the habit of lawbreaking is universal. <p>Recent events in Russia are playing out a common feudal scenario: the struggle for succession when the king dies without leaving a strong successor. The struggle between Boris Yeltsin and Alexander Rutskoi was a classic battle for the throne. The powerful regional barons took advantage of the rivalry to fortify their own positions and trade their support for concessions. Now that Yeltsin has defeated Rutskoi, he faces a long and difficult struggle to force Russia's feudal lords to accept his leadership.<p>The feudal struggle for power masks a much deeper social change: Russia's second attempt to move from feudalism to capitalism. Ironically enough, Karl Marx described this process best. He called it "primitive accumulation"--the process by which would-be capitalists acquire the capital that allows them to build fortunes and enterprises. Five years ago, virtually everything valuable in Russia was owned by the state. Today, everything is to be privatized, but the ownership process is unequal. Some Russians have ended up owning factories and natural resources; most will come out of the process owning little more than their skins. <p>The rich are getting richer and the poor poorer. This is the bottom line in Russia today, and the goal of Western intervention is to accelerate this process. Some people have lost everything. At anti-Yeltsin demonstrations I was surrounded by elderly ladies who have nothing to live on but their pensions and savings--both made worthless by Russia's inflation. They screamed their anger in my face, pointed to their worn-out shoes and tattered coats, and denounced Boris Yeltsin and his Western allies for deliberately reducing them to poverty after a lifetime of toil. They have a point. <p>I also met businessmen. Some were more than shady--they were outright thugs busily building commercial empires through violence and intimidation. Others were as honest as is possible under Russian conditions; that is, they routinely evade tax laws that would be ruinous if enforced, and they do most of their work in the twilight zone of a legal system that is disorderly, illogical, unjust, and unclear. Everybody knows that Russian business today is a free-for-all, but the private sector has very little to do with business as we know it in the West. Memo to Harvard M.B.A.s: Stay home. <p>Every factory, every apartment, every farm, every oil field in Russia is up for grabs. Dividing the spoils drives Russian politics. The local authorities want to divvy up all the state property in the neighborhood so they can give it to their friends. This brings them into conflict with the city authorities, who want to do the same thing on a citywide basis. Regional authorities want to override the city authorities, and the national government wants to control the whole process. <p>Losers in the struggle try to overturn the system by making demagogic appeals to the people. That these appeals work at all proves that for Russia, the center has not held. Five years ago, the country had the most centralized government of any major power. Today, whole regions of Russia are trying to go their own way. The Soviet state had four powerful centralizing institutions: the party, the government bureaucracy, the economic mechanism of planning and control, and the armed forces. All today are weak, dead, or dying. <p>The party is essentially dead. Its brighter members have gone off to enrich themselves in the privatization wars. Dimmer members grumble about the decline of all things Soviet and read mimeographed leaflets about Yeltsin's alleged ties to international Judaism. <p>The government bureaucracy isn't dead, but its loyalties have split. Russia's bureaucrats are no longer wealthy members of a privileged elite; their incomes have fallen, and they can no longer impose their decrees on local authorities. In fact, many government officials depend on regional authorities for salaries and perks. <p>The state economic machine is extinct. Planners in Moscow, who once set prices for the whole country, can't even maintain accurate statistics about Russia's GDP. <p>That leaves the armed forces, whose decisive though tardy intervention enabled Yeltsin to destroy his parliamentary opponents in October. But don't assume that Russia's army is strong or united enough to maintain order. <p>In Vladivostok, the headquarters of Russia's proud Pacific fleet, I spoke with Russian officers, cadets, and sailors. Their stories were appalling. Ships are rusting in the harbor, and maneuvers are canceled for lack of fuel. Sailors' wives and children complained of deepening poverty. Some said wages were three months overdue. <p>Former soldiers and civilian observers tell similar horror stories. Nobody really knows whether Russia's soldiers would obey their officers in an emergency; many and perhaps most would refuse to shoot on command. <p>Analysts looking at these problems divide into optimistic and pessimistic schools. The optimists believe the present process of disintegration will end when primitive accumulation creates a new capitalist class. These capitalists will need a strong, effective national government to guard their property and, like their counterparts abroad, will prefer at least a facade of democracy and legality for their actions. <p>Pessimists think that primitive accumulation will fail and that Russia will lapse back into something like feudalism. Some believe fiefdoms will emerge whose rulers will pay little more than lip service to the "national" government in far-off Moscow. An even bleaker view suggests that Russian nationalism will supply the ideological cement for a new powerful central government: feudalism again. Russia's nationalists will organize a new authoritarianism and again parcel out industrial and political fiefdoms to those who agree to serve the state. <p>Few if any Russians I encountered in my month of travel through Siberia and into Moscow shared the view so common in the West that a few economic reforms and a couple of elections are all that stand between Russia and the kind of peaceful democratic life that we all take for granted. Fasten your seat belts, ladies and gentlemen: The road ahead will be bumpy. <p>Walter Mead is a senior counselor at the World Policy Institute at the New School in New York City.<p>

						 <p>By John Rothchild<p>After years of trying to influence latin americans to become more like us (the Good Neighbor Policy, the Alliance for Progress, etc.), it's now obvious that we've become a lot more like them. There are signs of this everywhere:<p>We can't drink the water. this predicament has sneaked up on us. For decades, gringos in Latin America have survived on <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> and beer. Now gringos in the United States are surviving on Coca-Cola, Evian, Perrier, and beer. This has been very bullish for the bottled-water industry, which now does $1.23 billion in annual sales in U.S. supermarkets alone. We've gotten so sold on the trendiness of bottled water that we tend to overlook the reason we're drinking it--we don't trust what comes out of the tap. <p>We live behind barricades. In Latin America they put a wall around every house, and in the United States we put walls around entire subdivisions, but the idea is the same: to put up one more obstacle to the invading hordes. Our executives practice kidnap avoidance, a traditional Latin American folk art. We've also adopted bars on the windows, home-surveillance equipment, and if we can afford them, private security guards. This is quite a time for the home- and personal-protection industry, which now does $3.5 billion in annual sales.<p>We're hooked on their drugs. this makes us equal partners. The drug business is the most successful example of how free trade and interhemispheric cooperation can provide jobs and stimulate both economies. The price of cocaine has come down from the yuppie level to the point that the poorest consumer finds it affordable. The delivery system is a model of efficiency. It's run like <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>.<p>Meanwhile, the prices of pharmaceuticals have soared, and these are legal and regulated by the government. So maybe we ought to legalize cocaine and outlaw heart pills.<p>We've fallen in love with the lottery. in South America, they've been in love with lotteries for decades. There the tickets are sold on street corners, which is more sensible than selling them in stores the way we do. It's hard to buy toothpaste when you're caught behind 20 gamblers in the cash-register line.<p>There are lotteries in 36 states and casino gambling in 28, including casinos on 68 Indian reservations in 24 states. Add that to the horses, the dogs, jai alai, off-track betting, Las Vegas bookmaking, and offshore betting on cruise ships. Altogether, the wagering business has grown at 10 percent a year since 1982--faster than computers, faster than health care, faster even than lawyers, who have been increasing at 3.5 percent a year. <p>In 1992 alone, U.S. residents placed $330 billion worth of legal bets. In terms of this total handle, we're risking the annual Pentagon budget. The end result is that we lost $30 billion to the gaming establishments. Add to this the estimated $30 billion in illegal bets, and our domestic gambling habit exceeds the global sales of <a name="NYSE:MOB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11006"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mobil</b></a>, which ranks sixth on the Fortune 500 list of companies.<p>Our government is the world leader in heavy borrowing, taking its cue from the Latin American governments. The difference, so far, is that we pay back our loans. Since the 19th century, Latin American governments have made a regular habit of suckering billions out of U.S. banks. The routine is as follows: The banks lend, the governments default, the banks stop lending, the governments promise never to default again, the banks start lending, the governments default. It happened twice in the 1800s, once in the 1930s, and again in the 1970s, and by the same clockwork, the next sucker cycle will begin in 2010, after the lenders have forgotten the last.<p>Along the way, we've learned more about borrowing than Latin American governments have learned about repaying, so one of these days, maybe we'll be defaulting on their banks.<p>More and more of us are living beyond our means, imitating those Latin American governments. In 1992, 900,000 individuals filed for personal bankruptcy in the U.S. This was a modern record.<p>More of our companies, too, are living and then dying beyond their means. In several cities, the skyline is a deadbeat's graveyard. <p>Dallas has the Bank One Center, built by the now insolvent MBank and later foreclosed on, and the InterFirst building, headquarters of InterFirst Bank, which merged with another bank before the new entity failed.<p>The creditors foreclosed on San Antonio's tallest office building, NBC Bank Plaza, and the owners of the tallest building in Indiana, Bank One Center Tower of Indianapolis, had to scramble to avoid foreclosure. The three tallest buildings in Miami--CenTrust, Southeast Bank, and the Intercontinental Hotel--were tied up in bankruptcies. Everywhere you look, there's red ink in the sunset.<p>We are no longer shocked by tales of corruption.The S&L swindles did us in. Ten thousand bank-fraud cases, many of which will never be brought to trial, have shorted our outrage circuits.<p>We're parking more of our money abroad in foreign stocks and bonds. Pension funds and institutions are buying foreign equities in record numbers. While it may be sensible to diversify, too much investing abroad can rob a country of its development capital.<p>That's long been the story in Latin America: The rich have stayed rich by sending their money to Europe or the United States. Money that has gone into condos in Miami and bank accounts in Switzerland could have been put to work at home. People who find safe havens abroad may be less inclined to get involved in their own country's problems.<p>We have an underground economy (cash under the table, barter, etc.) that is growing faster than our aboveground economy. By current estimates, it may be as much as 10 percent of the official GDP.<p>We have replaced america first with Me First.This is less out of selfishness than out of cynicism. We no longer trust the government that is asking us to do the sacrificing. Latin Americans have felt this way since the breakup with Spain.<p>This brings us to the North American Free Trade Agreement and all the U.S. factories that are relocating on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. When U.S. workers begin to cross the border in a southerly direction, looking for jobs, we'll know that we've become fully Latin Americanized.<p>Contributing editor John Rothchild is the author of Going for Broke (Penguin/Viking), the story of financier Robert Campeau.

TeleBank, the new name for Arlington, Virginia's 60-year-old Metropolitan Bank, has become the first totally branchless bank doing business nationwide. Customers perform all transactions by phone, working with live representatives who are on call from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. TeleBank uses some of the savings from eliminating brick and mortar and tellers to pay higher yields on CDs and money-market accounts: The rate as of June 27 on TeleBank's money-market account (4.93 percent for balances above $2,500) was almost twice the national average. And one-year CD rates (5.59 percent) were about 70 basis points better than average. Accounts are FDIC insured up to $100,000 and include ATM cards, but check-writing privileges are limited to three free checks a month (800-638-2265).<p>ADVICE ON THE CHEAP 
The Vanguard Group is now applying the low-cost philosophy behind its mutual funds to investment advice (800-523-1154). For $500, clients can have an in-house specialist (with certification as a chartered financial planner or the equivalent) do a onetime assessment of their finances and recommend one of seven asset-allocation models as well as suggest which funds to buy. T. Rowe Price has plans to start a similar program in 1997 for clients with at least $100,000 to invest.<p>FINANCIAL JOTTINGS
The PSE Tech 100 Index Portfolio Fund, launched in June by Principal Preservation (West Bend, Wisconsin), tracks the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index with price-weighted exposure to 100 companies. One catch: a 4.5 percent sales charge (800-826-4600).... Brian Kelly, former manager of Invesco's highly regarded Balanced Fund, has moved to Founders to run its Balanced and Blue Chip Funds (800-525-2440).... Mortgage REITs outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index in May with a total return of 6.53 percent versus 2.58 percent.<p><p><p>

						Some investors are simply beyond mutual funds. Don't you love these old-fashioned types?<p>If you've mastered the VCR, are obsessive about taking antioxidants, and no longer send snail mail, you probably think of yourself as a 1990s kind of person. But look at your investment portfolio. Do you see what I see? Stocks? Individual stocks? Well then, your portfolio is a throwback. Buying individual stocks is an ancient ritual that investors were forced to practice before one of the all-time great financial inventions: stock mutual funds. <p>Of course, this ancient ritual still has its supporters. Especially the advice swamis who scream at you from financial publications -- "The 10 Top Stocks to Buy Now!" That's mindless hype, pure and simple. But there are also more thoughtful swamis who take the higher ground. They argue that individual stocks belong in small-investor portfolios because there is virtue in the practice of buying equities itself. Here are the main points of their case. <p>Taxes: With individual stocks you can take your gains and losses when you want to, and you can make sure that all your gains are long-term gains. In fact, you can hold on to your stocks until death releases your grip, never realizing any gains and never paying any taxes. With mutual funds, however, you have no discretion over the timing; many capital gains are short term and thus subject to higher taxes (as shareholders in the <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity Magellan Fund</b></a> found out in May, when the fund declared a big distribution from its sale of technology stocks). <p>Costs: With stocks, there are only two transaction costs -- when you buy and when you sell. Mutual funds, on the other hand, involve yearly costs of fees and expenses, some of which can be quite high. <p>Image: For one thing, it's considered more macho and thus more satisfying to drop the names of your stocks around the watercooler, as in "I just bought 100 shares of Macro-Zip-Micro-Tech at $3 a share, and it's already up 50 cents -- man, this little baby is hot." For another, it's more fun to pick stocks; there is undoubtedly a flush of knowing pleasure from buying Macro-Zip-Micro-Tech that buying shares in a mutual fund can't deliver. <p>Performance: This is mostly a negative argument; it runs that since most mutual funds regularly underperform the market you are better off with individually selected stocks. (There is also a component of raw greed, the belief that one lucky pick will put you on Paradise Island for the rest of your life.) Also, champions of stock picking like to point to what they call the highly specialized and profound knowledge that the amateur develops from his or her daily experience. This, they say, gives just about anyone the ability to identify companies with good potential.<p>Those are the arguments for individual stocks, and each is half right. But consider now the other half, which favors mutual-fund investing.<p>Taxes: You could, instead, invest in stock-market index funds, which are very tax efficient. Indeed, tax bills are minimal, because stocks in an index fund are rarely traded. <p>Costs: Stocks have the advantage in only the starkest cases, such as with an infrequently traded equity portfolio versus an expensive mutual fund. But in-and-out costs, even at a discount broker, can be very pricey, especially if you trade actively. On the other hand, it's possible to find a low-expense mutual fund without extra marketing, sales, and exit charges. For example, <a name="FUND:VTSMX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VTSMX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard's Index Trust Total Stock Market Portfolio fund</b></a> (which mirrors the market as a whole) will cost you 0.22 percent a year.<p>Image: Excitement over stock picking and gabbing about it are usually just the beginning of the story. What follows is having to drag around a bunch of dogs whose provenance eventually becomes a mystery to you. And then there's a deeper image problem -- being called an amateur. In 1992, according to the New York Stock Exchange, 24 percent of the people who held equities owned only one. Consider what William Silber, professor of finance and economics at New York University, says about those who hold less than the market portfolio (an index fund): "The reason why people buy one or two stocks has nothing to do with investing. It's for cocktail-party conversation." <p>Performance: Nobody knows how small investors do on average -- whether, as a group, they tend to outperform or underperform the market in any year. A reasonable judgment -- and the best face -- is that risk-adjusted returns for small investors as a group mirror the market because they hold the market in aggregate and thus their pattern of returns is similar. In other words, some investors will do better than the market, some will do worse, and the more diversified the portfolio, the closer it will come to hitting the market return.<p>At least that's a theory. In practice, however, mutual funds have one crucial advantage over individual investors: Transaction costs are a fraction of those faced by individuals. Thus, after costs are subtracted, it's reasonable to assume that mutual funds have higher risk-adjusted returns than do individual investors.<p>Also, in practice, just as there are individual investors who beat the market year after year, there are fund managers who log sensational returns over the long haul. Since performance records of mutual funds are readily accessible, it is easier to fasten onto one of those stars than to try to pick star stocks.<p>As for the "capitalize on your expertise" school of thought, well, maybe. But ultimately, your expertise is only as good as the returns it affords. And as John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors, points out, this type of thinking can easily turn into what he calls product investing: "You go to a restaurant and love the product, so you buy the company," he explains. "But good products do not translate into good stocks." <p>(If the performance question worries you, there is a remedy: Buy a stock-market index fund and get guaranteed market performance. You won't do better than the market -- but by golly, you won't do worse, either.)<p>Simply put, the standard reasons for preferring individual stocks over mutual funds are hardly compelling. And they pale even more when compared with the benefits afforded by mutual-fund 
investing. Consider these other factors.<p>Instant, cheap diversification: This is no small matter. Diversification is a way of reducing risk without reducing return. By conservative estimates, it takes 50 to 100 individual stocks to diversify a stock portfolio. Figure on spending almost a million bucks. Even if you cleave to the less strict rule of 30 stocks to diversify, it'll still cost you several hundred thousand dollars. But buy into the average mutual fund for a fraction of that money and -- presto -- you have a portfolio of a hundred stocks. <p>By the same token, mutual funds can also provide a way to focus your portfolio. If you like to market-time the business cycle, for example, you can rotate your money from sector fund to sector fund while maintaining a well-diversified position within sectors.<p>A no-fuss, cheap way into foreign markets: If you want to buy individual shares in foreign firms, then you usually have to buy something called an American depositary receipt, which represents the ownership of such securities. The banks that issue these receipts charge a small fee, which is taken out of the dividend payment, and ADRs typically trade with a slightly wider spread than stocks. But buying shares in an international-stock mutual fund will provide you with a much simpler entre and -- again -- instant and cheap diversification.<p>(There is, however, one bogus argument in favor of mutual funds that bears mentioning: the professional-manager idea that, for a small fee, you get a highly trained, plugged-in, workaholic stock picker. Maybe. But whatever the attributes of this professional manager, he or she is only as good as his or her numbers.)<p>In sum, those dollars that keep flooding into stock mutual funds are not dumb money. Mutual funds may not be as thrilling as individual stocks, but if you consider the two crucial categories of investment -- risk and return -- they represent a quantum leap. For risk, mutual funds offer even the smallest investors a no-brain way to diversify their portfolios. For return, you're better off in a mutual fund where performance is helped by lower transaction costs.<p>Be there or be square.<p>

						Morningstar has prevailed on the printed page, but Value Line has stolen the lead in software<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Morningstar is probably more famous among investors than most of the 7,000 mutual funds it rates. The Chicago-based company's star rankings, from one to five, are ubiquitous in fund ads. The opinions of analysts who write for its flagship publication, Morningstar Mutual Funds, are de rigueur in any article that evaluates a fund.<p>This makes it all the more surprising that Morningstar is facing a serious challenge in its core business of providing fund information to investors. At the moment, while Morningstar's print publication clearly remains on top, its software program has dropped to second best. Value Line's Fund Analyzer now offers investors better tools at about half the price.<p>The battle between Morningstar (800-735-0700) and Value Line (800-284-7607) began in 1993 when the latter, a New York company well known for its Value Line Investment Survey, which profiles individual companies, launched The Value Line Mutual Fund Survey to evaluate individual funds. Morningstar wasn't pleased. In March 1994, the company alleged that Value Line had plagiarized the synopses of a fund's strategy prepared by Morningstar's analysts. "That was a little surprising given that Morningstar's flagship product is so thoroughly predicated on a format" that Value Line has used for its stock profiles since 1931, says Stephen Savage, Value Line's director of mutual-fund research.<p>Morningstar first staked its claim as a fund rater in 1984, when founder Joe Mansueto, then a 27-year-old stock analyst at a fund advisory firm and now Morningstar CEO, began publishing a quarterly Mutual Fund Sourcebook out of his apartment on the North Side of Chicago. The field was wide open. The only potential rival, Lipper Analytical Services, stuck with the more lucrative market for institutional investors.<p>Value Line could have entered the fray then but instead chose to stay on the sidelines. For one thing, Value Line itself owns a small family of funds, so tracking funds could appear to be a conflict of interest. For another, the market was quite small: As late as 1990, Morningstar had fewer than 10,000 subscribers. "The size of the market didn't justify our entry until the early 1990s," says Savage. But by that time, Morningstar already ruled the field. "They've secured the market on the print side," concedes Savage.<p>It's not surprising that Value Line hasn't really been able to dent Morningstar's dominance in the print market. Despite strikingly similar publications, Morningstar produces a superior product in crucial areas.<p>Both companies' newsletters -- Morningstar Mutual Funds, with a circulation of 27,682 and an annual subscription rate of $425, and The Value Line Mutual Fund Survey, with 5,000 readers and an annual price of $295 -- present important data on performance: trailing 3-, 6-, and 12-month returns and 3-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year annualized returns. Both publications rank each fund according to risk and return, and describe each fund in a written synopsis accompanied by graphs and tables of data, such as asset size, fees, and portfolio holdings.<p>But Morningstar gives the reader sharper tools for dissecting a fund. For starters, it lists quarter-by-quarter returns for the past five years of a fund's life. "Looking at quarterly figures helps you to better understand the fund's performance pattern," says Paul Greenwood, senior research analyst at Frank Russell Co., an investment consulting firm in Tacoma, Washington.<p>Although both newsletters compare every fund's performance with the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index of big blue-chip companies, Morningstar also measures each fund's trailing returns against a more specific benchmark -- such as the Russell 2000 Index for small-company funds -- that more closely parallels each fund's investment style. Both newsletters provide boxes showing the investment style of a fund -- whether it invests mostly in small, medium, or large companies and whether it has a growth or value orientation, or a blend of the two. But Morningstar goes a step further with a style box for each year of a fund's history going back to 1985. This chronology allows investors to see if the manager has shifted strategies over time.<p>Unable to defeat Morningstar on the print battlefield, Value Line has shifted the contest to new terrain: the burgeoning market for mutual-fund software. "This is the real growth area," says Value Line's Savage. And this has indeed turned into Morningstar's Achilles' heel.<p>Morningstar actually created the opening that Value Line is now trying to exploit when it upgraded its software from products that used the aging DOS interface to a Windows product called Principia. "Over the last few years, as we heard from users, we were tugged in two directions," says Morningstar's Mansueto. "Individual investors wanted one thing, and professionals wanted something else." Morningstar aimed Principia at financial professionals and priced the complete program with all its modules at $795 a year, significantly more expensive than the DOS version and well above the $395 annual price tag for Value Line's Fund Analyzer. "Principia is too high priced for what they offer relative to Fund Analyzer," says John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors.<p>Both software products provide the standard data that investors can find in the newsletters, such as annualized returns, objective, rank, risk, and more -- but the programs also give users the ability to manipulate this data, a serious advantage over either print version. For example, users can create bar charts to compare the risk and return of any two funds or screen the universe of funds for, say, all no-load funds with a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 15 (Morningstar covers more than 7,000 funds, while Value Line currently offers 5,000).<p>But Fund Analyzer is not just less expensive than Morningstar's Principia. It also provides weekly data updates (downloaded on-line) -- as opposed to Principia's monthly updates (via software sent by mail) -- is a bit easier to use, and offers several more-powerful features. For example, on Fund Analyzer's screen, eight windows beneath the toolbox icons call up specific fund comparisons. One pulls up graphs comparing price performance; another, pie charts showing asset allocations. Principia users must click on a specific fund and navigate a menu to retrieve the same information. But even then, Fund Analyzer offers more kinds of graphs than Principia.<p>Fund Analyzer combines all its features in one integrated program. It lists top portfolio holdings for up to 3,200 funds and a 400-word strategy analysis for each of 1,550 funds. It also allows users to print out a page exactly as it appears in the newsletter and create a hypothetical portfolio.<p>The basic program for Morningstar's Principia, which costs the same $395 a year as Fund Analyzer, provides none of these features. To print out a newsletter-page facsimile or get fund analyses and top holdings, users must buy Principia Electronic Binder. Investors who want to run hypothetical portfolios need Portfolio Developer, due out in June. Yet a fourth program, Principia Advanced Analytics, with data for advanced users, is scheduled for release in late 1996. The whole package costs $795.<p>Morningstar CEO Mansueto defends Principia and its cost, claiming that his offerings "will be the best package out there -- and often the best products carry premium prices." Nonetheless, Morningstar isn't about to let Value Line steal its user base of individual investors, either. Ascent, a scaled-down version of Principia tailored for individuals, is due out in May for $195 a year. From a test version of Ascent provided by Morningstar, it's clear that the program, though less expensive than Value Line's product, is also much more limited. Users can't compare standard deviation of fund 
returns, for example, because Ascent rates risk only by labeling funds "average," "above average," or "below average." Ascent provides no written analysis of fund strategy or list of top portfolio holdings and offers only three kinds of graphs.<p>Value Line has already launched its answer to Ascent, the No-Load Analyzer, which costs $149 a year with monthly updates. But the fight is still in its early rounds. The future clearly holds a lot more counterpunching. Ultimately, the hands-down winner will be the individual investor.<p><p>SIDEBAR: TAKING THEIR SHARE OF THE PIE
The names of these companies may be unfamiliar, but investors use their data on mutual funds every day<p>The battle between Value Line and Morningstar may be generating most of the noise, but other companies are quietly fighting for their share of the data turf, too. Although Lipper Analytical Services, Micropal, and CDA/Wiesenberger primarily sell their fund information to institutional investors, each also provides data to a surprisingly large number of individual investors.<p>For example, most of the mutual-fund returns that investors see in their daily papers come from Lipper Analytical Services, based in Summit, New Jersey. Lipper, which dominated the mutual-fund-data industry before Morningstar seized the initiative, distributes performance data via the Associated Press news service to many papers, including The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p>  <p>WHEN IS A FUND WORTH ITS FEE? <p>Investors in the most expensive large-cap growth funds pay high fees for low returns  <p> By Andrew Gluck  <p> Investors in <a name="FUND:VEIPX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VEIPX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard Equity-Income Fund</b></a> pay the Vanguard Group 0.45 percent of the value of their portfolio every year for running that fund. Investors in <a name="FUND:SBABX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SBABX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SunAmerica Balanced Assets Fund B</b></a> pay their management company 2.12 percent annuallyalmost five times as much. What do investors in the more expensive fund get for their money? Certainly not higher returns. Over the five years ended December 31, 1995, the Vanguard fund returned 16.23 percent annually and the SunAmerica fund just 13.54 percent.  <p> Most investors ignore expenses when they choose a mutual fund. Fees are deducted from a fund's assets before earnings are distributed to shareholders, so investors never write checks to pay for the accountants, lawyers, bookkeepers, toll-free telephone services, and other annual operating expenses. Further obfuscating the matter, the costs are expressed as a percentage of the total assets of the fund. With the average stock fund among the 883 that Worth rated last November showing an expense ratio of just1.33 percent, the charge can seem too small to worry about. <p> But that average disguises incredible variation. The cheapest fund in that universe charges just 0.17 percent a year in expenses; the most expensive soaks investors for 8.9 percent annually. Many studies, most recently one by Burton Malkiel, the author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street, have shown that, in general, there is no connection between the amount investors pay in expenses and the returns they receive.  <p> But a Worth study that compared equity-fund expenses and performance over the past five years at the cheapest and most expensive funds found that, at the extremes in two major fund categories, investors aren't getting nothing in exchange for high fees: They actually receive lower performance. Among the large-cap growth and large-cap value funds that charge the most in expenses and those that chargethe least, performance is directly connected to fees. We discovered that in these two categories the returns on the cheapest 10 percent of mutual funds were higher than the returns on the most expensive10 percent. "Investors often pay Cadillac prices for a Yugo," says Charles Trzcinka, a finance professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo and a former senior economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission.   <p> For our study, we divided the 883 funds evaluated in our 1995 mutual-fund issue into five styles: large-cap growth, large-capvalue, small-cap growth, small-cap value, and global. We then ranked the funds in each style based on their expense ratio and broke that ranking into ten groups, or deciles, ranging from most expensive to least. For instance, the 130 small-cap growth funds were divided into deciles containing 13 funds each, with the lowest-expense funds in the first decile and the highest-expense funds falling into the tenth decile. Then we averaged the expense ratios and five-year annualized returns of each decile and looked for a pattern in the relationship between fees and performance. <p> We eliminated two style categories off the bat. Among global funds, we found no orderly rise or fall in returns as expenses increased. Another style, small-cap value, contained too few candidates: With just 28 funds in this category, the deciles were too small to allow a meaningful judgment.  <p> But the study clearly showed that investors who pay high expenses for funds that purchase large-cap growth stocks don't get their money's worth. The 44 large-company growth funds in the priciest10 percent of this style showed an average expense ratio of 2.35 percent and an average return of 13.83 percent a year from 1991 to 1995. But the cheapest large-company growth funds, the lowest-cost decile in this category, had an average expense ratio of 0.58 percent and a return of 16.06 percent annually.  <p> That average difference in yearly returns of 2.23 percentage points may not sound like much, but it certainly adds up overtime. Someone who invests $25,000 today and earns 13.83 percent annually would have $91,308 after ten years versus $110,858 foran investor earning 16.06 percent a year.   <p> Why are high expenses so detrimental to total return in this category? The market for large-cap growth stocks is relatively ecient and very limited in size, theorizes Jeffrey Keil, anassistant vice president at Lipper Analytical Services in Denver,which provided the data for this study. "In the large-cap- growth universe, a lot of players are chasing a group of about 600 stocks."With almost all other things being equal, Keil says, the difference in expenses is often what makes one large-cap growth fund perform better than another.  <p> But the results for small-company growth funds seem to show that in a less ecient part of the market higher expense ratios may be linked to higher returns. Despite their extremely high 2.3 percent average-annual-expense ratio, the highest-priced small-company growth funds outperformed the cheapest small-company growth funds by about 1.21 percentage points a year, or 21.34 versus 20.13. Some of the best-performing small-company growth funds of the past five years are among the 14 most expensive, including Kaufmann Fund, which sports a 28.6 percent annual returnand a 2.29 percent expense ratio, and <a name="FUND:MEGBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MEGBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MFS Emerging Growth Fund B</b></a>, with a 30.51 percent annual return and a 2.08 percent expense ratio.  <p> "That makes sense," according to fund-industry consultant GeoffBobroff. "With small-cap growth funds, investment selection is much bigger." A small-company fund manager has 3,000 to 4,000 stocks to choose froma much larger universe than that available to a large-company fund manager. In addition, Wall Street an-alyststend to give small companies a lot less scrutiny than they give large-cap stocks such as <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>. That means there are more undiscovered gems among small companies to ferret out.  <p> A fund's total expenses include fees for accounting, shareholder services, and other ongoing operating costs. But the management feethe largest component of a fund's expense ratiois what the adviser gets paid for picking stocks and deciding when to sell them. To find out if small-cap-growth-fund managers are putting investors' money to work researching stocks or simply pocketing higher fees, we ranked the funds in this style group based solely on management fees.  <p> It turns out that it's better to buy small-company growth funds that are spending more on picking stocks than those funds that are skimping on their research and analysis. The cheapest 26 funds, the bottom two deciles, returned an average of 18.75 percent annually.   <p> But the 26 small-cap growth funds that spent the most on their managers gained an average of 20.87 percent annually, 2.12 percentage points more per year than the cheapest funds. Expensive small-cap growth funds can be worth the price.  <p> Large-cap value funds showed a more complicated pattern. Like funds in the large-cap growth category, the 10 percent of large-cap value funds with the lowest expenses outperformed the 10 percent charging the highest fees, with returns of 15.36 percent versus 14.92 percent.  <p><p>

						Buying yesterday's hotshots is a bet that the market will love the same kind of stock two years in a row.<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Resist Temptation. Every year many mutual-fund investors rush out to add the previous year's rockets to their portfolios. The urge is especially strong after a year such as 1995, when the <a name="FUND:ACAPX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACAPX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Alger Capital Appreciation Fund</b></a> , the best-performing diversified equity fund, recorded a total return of 78.57 percent. There's even a credible-sounding strategy that makes the rounds at times like these: On January 1, buy the top ten no-load diversified stock funds from the previous year and hold them until December 31. Then sell them and buy the top ten funds from the year just ended. The returns are supposed to be amazing.<p>Don't do it. Over the past ten years, the returns from that strategy trail those an investor would have earned by simply sticking with the <a name="FUND:VFINX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VFINX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard Index 500 fund</b></a>, which mirrors the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index. Worse yet, 1996 looks like an especially dangerous time to pursue yesterday's hotshot funds.<p>To test the top-ten strategy, we used the Morningstar Mutual Funds On Disc database of 6,877 funds. To avoid burdening the top ten with sales fees, we looked only at true no-load funds. We also screened out sector and international funds because, while they often dominate the top ten, they come with so much risk that no investor should build a portfolio solely from these types of funds. Finally, we excluded funds that, in the year the strategy recommended buying them, were available only to institutional investors, were closed to new accounts, or restricted purchase or sale. <p>Then, for each year, we ranked the funds by their one-year returns and bought the top ten. So on January 1, 1986, for example, we purchased the top ten performers of 1985. On January 1, 1987, we sold those funds and bought the top ten of 1986. We repeated this tactic every year until 1995, when we bought the top ten funds of 1994. At the end of December, we calculated our ten-year return.<p>While the outcome of this strategy wasn't terrible, it wasn't particularly good, either. This approach showed a total return of 277 percent cumulatively compared with 300 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index. That lower return came with more risk, too. As measured by standard deviation, the S&P 500 had an average annual risk of 14.6 percent, compared with 15.9 percent for the funds in the top-ten portfolio. (All performance data assume that the top-ten strategy is carried out in a tax-deferred retirement account. The tax inefficiency of such a heavily traded portfolio would otherwise put it even further behind the S&P.)<p>Why does this strategy stop? Not because it picks funds that are doomed to failure. For instance, the 1992 portfolio included long-term winners such as <a name="FUND:BEONX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BEONX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Berger 100</b></a>, <a name="FUND:TWCUX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/TWCUX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>20th Century Ultra Investors</b></a>, and <a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus</b></a> Twenty. The 1990 portfolio included 20th Century Vista Investors, <a name="FUND:RSCOX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/RSCOX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Robertson Stephens Emerging Growth</b></a>, and <a name="FUND:FRINX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FRINX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Founders Growth.</b></a>
But one year's winner tended to be the next year's loser__or at least mediocre performer. In 1991, the top ten funds had an average return of 84.3 percent, nearly triple the 30.48 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's 500. But in 1992, those same funds underperformed the market, earning 3.74 percent versus 7.62 percent for the S&P 500. This pattern recurs. The top ten funds of 1989 returned 45.1 percent, trouncing the 31.68 percent performance of the S&P 500. In 1990, the same funds were a disappointment, losing 4.49 percent versus a 3.12 percent loss for the S&P 500.<p>The strategy doesn't fail just because stock pickers inevitably come back to the pack. In fact, by buying last year's hottest funds, an investor isn't betting that specific fund managers will keep their hot hands. Instead, the investor following this strategy is hoping that the investment style most favored by the market in the previous year will remain favored in the current year. (Or that the top ten fund managers will accurately forecast which investment style will perform best over the next 12 months and switch to it.) The strategy is too linked to style, concludes money manager Jeffrey Mortimer of Higgins Associates in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<p>Take 1987. That year the Russell 2000, a small-company stock index, declined 8.8 percent. The S&P/BARRA index of large-company growth stocks gained 6.5 percent. The top ten for that year included just one small-company stock fund.<p>But the hot style of 1987 proved unlucky in 1988, when the market rewarded a different approach. The small-capitalization stocks in the Russell 2000 outperformed large-company stocks, returning 24.9 percent versus 12 percent in the large-company growth stocks. Unfortunately, the 1988 top-ten portfolio, loaded with 1987's winners, was invested almost totally in large-cap growth stocks. The 1988 portfolio, while increasing in value by 13.54 percent, underperformed the Russell 2000 and the 16.6 percent return on the Standard & Poor's 500.<p>The pattern repeated itself the next year. The portfolio for 1989 reected the strong small-company performance of 1988. So five of the funds in the 1989 portfolio were small-company or aggressive-growth funds. But in 1989 large-company growth was the best-performing category. The large-company growth index returned 36.4 percent and the Russell 2000 just 16.2 percent. The 1989 portfolio returned 24.41 percent, lagging the 31.68 percent gain of the S&P 500. 
"Mutual funds go through streaks and slumps, like sports teams," says David Kudish, president of Stratford Advisory Group in Chicago. "It's not because a fund manager was smart and became stupid." It's because a style stops leading the market.<p>For example, "when cellular, cable TV, computer chips, and other technology stocks do very well, then growth-style managers do well," says Kudish. "When the economy is coming out of a malaise, industrial companies and cyclicals such as autos and transportation stocks tend to do well, and value managers do well."<p>The top-ten strategy, says Nola Williams, senior investment strategist at Frank Russell Companies in Tacoma, Washington, "goes against the buy-low-and-sell-high approach. It's more like buy high and bet it will go higher." <p>A stock investor would not adopt a strategy of buying the ten stocks that had the biggest gains in the previous year for his current year's portfolio, says Ronald Kahn, director of research at BARRA, a Berkeley, California, investment consulting firm. The failure of the top-ten strategy to outperform "tells you that looking at past-performance numbers alone isn't enough," says Kahn. (There is, however, an effective strategy that involves buying the Dow Jones Industrials stocks with the highest dividend yields each year. See "Opportunities" on page 116.)<p>In fact, looking only at past performance can lead an investor seriously astray. "Because the extreme winners are volatile funds, their propensity to repeat isn't that strong," says Roger Ibbotson, a Yale University professor and founder of the consulting firm Ibbotson Associates in Chicago. The big winners tend to be funds that not only practice an extreme style but that also get lucky when that style dominates the year. Of course, those funds are also likely to underperform when their style loses favor.<p>Ibbotson says investors will do better by eschewing the extremes. "I've suggested that perhaps you buy funds performing in the 90th percentile [the top 10 percent of all funds] rather than the very best ones__to avoid the volatile, very best performing funds."<p>How will the top-ten strategy play out in 1996? Probably not very well, in part because winning funds are now struggling to juggle a pile of new money from investors. The top ten of 1995 included such funds as <a name="FUND:WAAEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/WAAEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wasatch Mid-Cap</b></a>, whose assets shot from $1.2 million to $131 million last year, and Robertson Stephens Value + Growth, whose assets soared from $132 million to $1.3 billion. Much of the top ten's average 53.25 percent return as of December 31, 1995, was also built on two sectors, technology and finance, which turned downward even before the end of the year. For the last quarter of 1995, the large-company stocks of the Dow Jones Industrials thoroughly trounced these sectors. After the 1995 top ten's amazing run-up driven by a narrow range of stocks, investors chasing last year's hot funds could be courting disaster this year.<p>
OPPORTUNITIES: EMI STOCK KEEPS ON TRUCKIN'
Looking for growth in a down-and-out industry? Too many truckers and not enough freight have driven trucking-company stocks off the road. But analysts expect some of the scrappy companies that survive this industry recession__many of which are poised to grow by acquiring ailing rivals__to soar as supply and demand come back into balance in the second half of the year. These companies use innovative strategies for delivering goods within tight deadlines, catering to the just-in-time inventory-management techniques adopted by big retailers and manufacturers. With companies such as <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a> and DuPont increasingly farming out these services and using fewer trucking outfits for more jobs, there's lots of upside for companies that deliver.__Pamela J.

Worth magazine/Features<p>THEY CALL THIS SERVICE?<p>By William P. Barrett<p>Face it: we'd all like our mutual funds to double in value about, oh, every year or so. When they don't, however, it's at least some comfort to be treated with respect by your fund family. With that in mind, Worth investigated how well the top 20 companies perform in three areas of customer service: requests for documents, clarity of account statements, and responses to investors' questions over the phone.<p>
PAPER TRAIL<p>Just after Thanksgiving, a Worth reporter called each family's published toll-free number, identified specific funds, and asked that three documents about each be sent to a home address: the current prospectus, the current statement of additional information (SAI), and the latest semi-annual report.<p>As the mail arrived, the reporter logged in each document. Prospectuses and SAIs older than a year without recent amendments were considered nonresponsive, as were semi-annual reports more than eight months old. The overall results were underwhelming. Only 54 percent of the requested documents arrived. Just one mutual-fund family, Twentieth Century, provided 100 percent of the solicited material. Next in line were Franklin (93 percent), American (92 percent), Fidelity (88 percent), Van Kampen (86 percent), Oppenheimer (82 percent), and Putnam (77 percent). <p>Seven families__IDS, Janus, <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, T. Rowe Price, Kemper, Smith Barney, and Dreyfus__didn't come close to meeting our requests. And AIM, Dean Witter, and MFS sent nothing at all. An AIM spokesman said the telephone worker at its Houston headquarters who had taken our call abruptly resigned that very day without processing the order. An apologetic MFS said it could find no record of our request. Dean Witter offered no explanation.<p>
SECRET CODE<p>Account statements sometimes read like coded messages sent behind enemy lines. To judge how well each fund family presents its information, we developed a list of 21 possible characteristics or items of information__easy-to-understand language, cost basis, percentage breakouts of holdings, among others__and then obtained actual account statements.<p>Our winner: Dean Witter, whose mutual-fund statement, which is also used in its brokerage business, was the only one that met well over half our requirements, including the estimated yield and income of each holding as well as the actual change in total account value since the last statement. (For most of the others, an investor would have to do the math using a previous statement.)<p>In second place was Kemper, the only family that furnished total-return information for individual holdings. A close third: Scudder, whose statement was one of just three that calculated the original or average cost basis for each position, which can be useful in determining tax consequences. <p>Three companies shared last place: American, Franklin, and Van Kampen, the last of which sent us two sets of forms, one dating back prior to a 1994 merger.<p>
POP QUIZ<p>This was the fun part. most of the fund families spend a lot of time training people to answer questions over the phone from customers__even really dumb questions. So we created a list of nine utterly basic queries. We then dialed up company sales representatives__and fired away. We counted "I don't know'' as wrong, but otherwise graded fairly generously.<p>Our quiz included the following: What's the difference between yield and total return? What's the difference between a Treasury bond and a Treasury bill? What's the difference between a long-term capital gain and a short-term capital gain? What's a repurchase agreement?<p>For each family we also picked one fund and asked: What's the maximum sales load? Is there a deferred load if you pay the maximum load? Can this fund use put or call options?<p>The results: Better than one out of every five of our really dumb questions produced a really dumb answer. Dreyfus telephone rep Jeff Lang was the only one to answer all nine of our queries correctly. He didn't even hesitate when asked if a certain Dreyfus fund uses puts or calls: "Yes, they all use them.'' (Nine of the 20 families got this wrong.)<p>Four firms tied for second with eight correct answers: American, Franklin, Putnam, and Scudder.<p>The Fidelity rep thought T-bills could have maturities of up to two years (instead of one). The Kemper rep thought an SAI was "the latest quarterly update.'' The AIM agent thought the breakpoint between long- and short-term capital gains was six months instead of one year. The Van Kampen rep said he "wasn't familiar'' with repurchase agreements, which are sales of securities__often by fixed-income funds__to be repurchased at a specific time and price. A Janus person said yield and total return "are basically the same.'' Several reps offered a more-or-less accurate definition of total return, but couldn't coherently explain how it differed from yield.<p>All 20 knew their own maximum sales charges and deferred loads. But five couldn't provide the portfolio turnover rate__the percent of fund holdings sold in a year, which affects fund expenses__which usually appears in the prospectus or semi-annual report. And 11 stumbled on the T-bill/T-bond distinction. To a person they were polite and patient. But there were a lot of long pauses, we were frequently put on hold, and several times the line went dead.<p>

						March 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> RATING THE FUND FAMILIES <p>The first-ever ratings of the top 20 mutual fund companies  <p> By Jim Jubak and William P. Barrett  <p> You know the names: Dreyfus, Fidelity, Putnam, Janus, Scudder,T. Rowe Price, and the others. But do you know what lies behind them? Do you know how one mutual-fund family differs from thenext?  <p> We felt a little uncertain on this subject ourselves, and whenwe embarked on this survey, we quickly found out we had lotsof company. Even fund-family CEOs became tongue-tied when pepperedwith questions about what distinguished their own operationsfrom the rest of the pack.  <p> The focus in the mutual-fund industry has always been on individualfunds and their managers, such as Jeffrey Vinik at Fidelity Magellanor James P. Craig at Janus Fund. The companies behind the fundshave remained largely anonymous, though significant differencesexist among themin everything from investment strategy to theresources devoted to research. Cynics might say this obscurityallows mutual-fund salespeople to say what their potential customerswant to hear. Is Company X aggressive? Sure. Are its funds safeinvestments? Absolutely.  <p> The truth is that no single company does everything perfectly,or with the same degree of commitment. Some concentrate on conservativeinvestors; others seek risk takers. Some do well in equities,and others in fixed-income markets. These are distinctions prudentinvestors should know about before deciding where to put theirmoney. The problem has been that, to our knowledge, no one hasever surveyed the fund industry in this way.   <p> Our solution: compile the first-ever ratings of the 20 largestfund families in the U.S., helping investors identify the firmswhose style and record match their needs, while also giving thema reality check to use when reading a fund family's literatureor listening to a salesperson extol its infinite virtues.   <p> We based our lineup on total stock and bond assets under managementat each company (excluding money-market funds), as measured byMorningstar, the Chicago-based fund-analysis company. The listranges from 1st-place Fidelity Investments ($269 billion in assets)to 20th-place Janus Group ($23 billion).   <p> (Capital Publishing Limited Partnership, Worth's parent company,is a unit of FMR Corp., which also owns Fidelity. Fidelity, however,has no connection with or influence over Worth's editorial content.) <p> To conduct our research, we dispatched a team of reporters totalk to people at each company, as well as to the leading specialistsin the field. Only Dean Witter refused our requests for information;the other 19 fund families were fully cooperative. The 20 individualprofiles on the following pages are the fruit of this effort.  <p> Naturally, we took a hard look at the numbers, starting withyear-end 1995 performance data from the six top equity funds(based on total assets) and the six top bond funds at each company.(Janus, with four bond funds, was the one family that had fewerthan six in a category.) Limiting our investigation to a dozen funds at each company, we felt, helped level the playing field between the very biggest companies on our list and all the others.(Even so, the 240 funds we measured account for an impressive$769 billion in assets.)  <p> Using total-return figures from Morningstar, we then separatelyranked each company for the performance of its stock and bondfunds over the most recent one-, three-, five-, and ten-yearperiods. These rankings are contained in the tables that accompanyeach fund profile. Overall, the number-one performer in equitieswas the Houston-based AIM family. Smith Barney came out on topin bonds.  <p> Keep in mind that our survey represents a contest among industryleadersthe 20 largest fund families. A ranking as low as 20in any category, therefore, doesn't necessarily constitute apoor showing in the context of the $2.7 trillion universe of6,900-plus mutual funds.  <p> To discover which companies pursue performance most aggressively,we looked at portfolio turnover and average price-to-earningsratios for each family's equity funds. This means our aggressivenessrating for stock trading mirrors a family's investing stylehowrapidly it moves in and out of the marketalong with its willingnessto chase high-priced stocks. Market timers and momentum playersgenerally run portfolios full of stocks with high p/e ratios;conservative outfits, the reverse.  <p> On the bond side, we looked at the five-year standard deviation(essentially, how often performance varied from the norm). Forbond funds, standard deviation is a good measure of a portfoliomanager's willingness to assume risk in the pursuit of high yields. <p> As might be expected, Vanguardthe king of index fundsliesin the cellar in aggressiveness for both equities and bonds.The bottom of the equity list is dominated by the traditionallyconservative wire houses, the big brokerages with hundreds ofoffices. Prudential is 15th (due to its mix of utility and equityincome funds), Merrill is 16th, and Smith Barney is 18th. Franklin,at 19th, is even more conservative. We didn't expect this, because,among its six equity funds we measured, four were foreign funds,and overseas investing tends to increase risk. Still, the Franklinforeign funds have extremely low portfolio turnover; their managersare very patient investors.   <p> We assessed stability by measuring the average tenure of fundmanagers at each family. In the case of team-managed funds, weused the most senior manager. This gave a significant advantageto Capital Research, which relies on the team approach for virtuallyall of its American funds. But it also made Merrill Lynch's third-placerank all the more impressive, given its heavy reliance on individualmanagers. Fund families in the midst of substantial change, suchas Kemper and Prudential, bring up the rear, as do Fidelitydueto its pressure-cooker environmentand Janus, which has beenrapidly starting new funds.  <p> Lastly, we ranked the fund families based on how much they chargetheir customers, dividing the average maximum sales charge (firstfor bonds and then for equities) by five (to simulate the averagefive-year holding period) and then adding the result to the averageexpense ratio for each category. The wire houses tend to clusternear the bottom of this listmeaning they are expensive placesto do business. MFS also shows up as pricey. Fidelity and Dreyfus,meanwhile, were cheaper than we expected.   <p> We knew from the beginning that low-cost Vanguard was likelyto lead in this category, but we were still surprised by itsmargin of victory.   <p> To compute an overall rating for every fund family, we tabulatedthe rankings in each category. These results were decisiveandreinforced by more subjective factors (customer service, diversityof fund offerings, and management strength) uncovered in ourbroad reporting efforts. The four companies with the best combinationof rankingsAIM, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price (No. 1 overall), andVanguardearned our top $$$$$ rating. The worstDean Witter,Dreyfus, Franklin, and Prudentialgot only one $.  <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - -   <p> <a name="FUND:AAGFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/AAGFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AIM</b></a>  <p> Founded in 1976, the Aim family of Funds is the youngest companyamong our top 20and acts like it. Its fund managers favor thehigh-octane thrills of momentum investing. The strategy: Buystock in companies expected to post a string of sharply improvedquarterly earnings; pay a premium price if necessary, and holdon until the first sign of a setback; then cut and run. "If there'san earnings disappointment, we will move in seconds," says CharlesT. Bauer, AIM's co-founder and chief executive. "History tellsus that one disappointment is likely to be followed by one ortwo more."  <p> This strategy may make conservative investors uncomfortable,and when the market is declining, it may not even serve thosewho like to take risks. But AIM is very good at what it does,and its aggressive strategy has been well suited to the risingDow Jones Industrial Average of the past several years. It hasthe best overall equity performance numbers of any company onour list. The firm is also moving to protect itself against marketdownturns by broadening the products it sells through outsidebrokers.   <p> Stocks remain AIM's strength. It purchased most of CIGNA's lineupof fixed-income and equity funds in 1992, but 85 percent of itsoverall portfolio assets remain invested in equities. The 76-year-oldBauer may retire by year's end. His job will likely go to RobertH. Graham, who is 49. Don't expect major changes; Graham is alongtime Bauer confidant.   <p>  <p></wam-co FUND:AADBX>AMERICAN</b></a>  <p> Capital Research & Management, the Los Angelesbased parentof American Funds Group, rests its faith in the virtue of diversificationtothe point of applying this basic investing tenet to the managementstructure of its funds. Under Capital's "multiple-portfolio counselor"system, no single person bears sole responsibility for a mutualfund. Instead, managers run one or more subsidiary portfolios;an average of five of these portfolios, in turn, compose eachfund. A section of every fund is also controlled by the company'sresearch department, a practice largely unheard of elsewherein the industry. But Capital's research department is far fromordinary. With an annual budget of $75 million, it's one of thelargest in the business.  <p> Capital's managers favor long-term, value-oriented investingand shun risk. They emphasize stocks that have low price-to-earningsratios or that appear to be undervalued for other reasons. Thisstrategy has produced an enviable track record. The steady performanceof Capital's funds in tough or deteriorating markets is a strength.  <p> Capital's two largest fundsInvestment Company of America andWashington Mutual Investorscurrently rank second and third intotal assets behind Fidelity's Magellan fund. Investors who seekto preserve wealth will be happier with Capital than those whoexpect lofty returns. The company sells its American Fund lineupthrough outside brokers.  <p>  <p><a name="FUND:DWIVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/DWIVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>DEAN WITTER</b></a>  <p> It may be true that mutual-fund investors today are better informedand more focused on bottom-line results than ever before. ButNew Yorkbased Dean Witter InterCapital, a unit of Dean Witter,proves that mediocrity still sells, given a well-known brandname and a hard-driving force of commissioned salespeopleinits case, a network of more than 8,500 in-house retail brokers.The fund products peddled by this wire house share attributesonly a spendthrift could enjoy: lackluster performance, stiffloads, and high expenses.   <p> Despite the poor numbers, though, Dean Witter has more thantripled its equity assets under management in the past five years,excluding investment gains, according to Kanon Bloch Carr, aBoston-based fund-analysis company. No wonder it was the lastmajor wire house to discontinue the practice of paying its brokershigher commissions on in-house brands. And no wonder this wasthe only mutual-fund family that refused our requests for interviewsand information. Investors might consider taking their moneyelsewhereat least until Dean Witter demonstrates it is as seriousabout performance as it is about sales.  <p>  <p><a name="FUND:DREVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/DREVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>DREYFUS </b></a> <p> Dreyfus Group, which is based in New York, owns one of the mostwidely recognized trademarks in the fund business: the shaggylion that appears in its television commercials. Exactly whatlies behind this regal symbol is uncertain.   <p> Reputations today are fixed in the stars that appear regularlyin magazine and newspaper rankings of top-performing funds. Consideringits size and number of fund offerings, however, Dreyfus has beenconspicuously absent from these lists. Indeed, of the 20 fundfamilies we looked at, it has the worst overall performance ratings. <p> The firm has recognizedand acknowledgedits shortcomings. "Wehaven't told our story well, and we haven't always had a storyto tell," says Christopher M. Condron, president of the firm.In August 1994, Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank bought Dreyfus andinstalled a new management team, headed by Condron. After arrivingin May, Stephen Canter, the fund family's first chief investmentofficer, divided his fund managers into five teamsgrowth, value,small-cap, international, and growth-and-income. He also institutedwhat he calls "quality-control loops" to ensure that funds adhereto specific investment disciplines.   <p> Revitalizing Dreyfus may take time. Its primary strength isits money-market operation, with $40 billion under management.But its equity funds have been among the few that haven't benefitedfrom the huge influx of investor cash in recent years. Four yearsago, the flagship Dreyfus Fund had $2.9 billion in assets; todayit has just $2.6 billion.  <p>  <p><a name="FUND:FFIDX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FFIDX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>FIDELITY</b></a>  <p> Our rankings place Fidelity Investments well below par for theperformance of its biggest equity and bond funds in 1995a surprise,given the firm's historic strength in these areas.  <p> Still, when it comes to size, clout, and resources, this Boston-basedcompany is tough to beat. It currently manages 84 percent moreassets than its nearest rival, Vanguard Group, and is one ofonly a few companies on our list whose calls can move markets.  <p> Fidelity's corporate culture emphasizes the survival of thefittest. The company compensates its fund managers handsomelyand supports them with lavish research and gee-whiz computersystems. But it also pits them against one another in gladiatorialcombat, creating a high-stress environment that results in above-averagefund-manager turnover.  <p> "Our philosophy is to give them every tool and then measurethem by their results," says Roger Servison, executive vice president.Hotshots move up to larger funds; laggards take their bottlesof Tagamet with them out the door. The result is an aggressivestock-picking operationone of the best in the business. Thecompany is also strong in high-yield bonds and convertible securities(which have given a big boost to its growth-and-income funds),but its methods haven't worked as well in overseas and emergingmarkets. The company, which runs one of the most effective telephone-salesand service organizations in the business, generally receiveshigh marks from customers.  <p>  <p><a name="FUND:FIARX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FIARX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>FRANKLIN </b></a> <p> Municipal-bond funds are the specialty of the Franklin TempletonGroup. Its fixed-income managers focus on the things that count.When Orange County, California, filed for bankruptcy in late1994, Franklin's California Tax-Free Income fundits biggestportfolio, with $13 billion in assetswas one of the few of itstype that didn't get hit. Known for painstaking research, theFranklin muni operation wields a big stick; municipalities oftenask it to preview the structure of new issues before they arebrought to market. The muni group emphasizes current income asopposed to total return; it prefers to buy and hold.  <p> When it comes to mainstream equity and bond funds, however,Franklin's performance has been mediocre. "We try to create fundsthat don't surprise investors," explains vice president GregJohnson, the son of Charles B. Johnson, Franklin Templeton'schief executive for nearly four decades.   <p> Unfortunately, this apparently applies to surprises on the upsideas well. Franklin's equity managers tend to be a timid bunch,sticking with tried-and-true investment principles. This hascost them dearly in the can't-miss market of the past severalyears.  <p> Franklin did get a boost with the purchase of Sir John Templeton's$21 billion family of global-stock funds in 1992. Since then,shrewd promotionplus increased investor enthusiasm for internationalmarketshas helped to nearly triple the Templeton assets. TheJohnsons have also had the good sense to avoid meddling withthe Templeton managers.  <p>  <p><a name="FUND:IBLUX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/IBLUX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IDS</b></a>  <p> IDS Mutual Fund Group, a Minneapolis-based unit of AmericanExpress, sells its  <p>mutual-fund offerings through the 8,000 financial planners employedby its corporate parent. The AMEX horde also peddles insurance,variable annuities, and uninsured certificates of depositsothe IDS funds must compete for attention.  <p> As a fund family, IDS deliberately avoids innovation. At best,says Jim Punch, vice president for client services, "we liketo be an early follower." IDS also spends little on marketingand promotion. But it does support a good-sized research department,with 50 analysts and an unlimited travel allowance for interviewswith company managements. "We get out and kick the tires a lot,"says G.Michael Kennedy, director of research and a restaurant-industryanalyst. "I even steal menus."  <p> The company's conservative approach has served it best in thefixed-income arena; its bond funds performed second-best overallon our list. "We run our bond funds on a total-return basis,"says Fred Quirsfeld, senior portfolio manager. "We don't lookfor the highest current income because historically that approachunderperforms a total-return strategy."  <p> IDS stock funds, though, have been laggards. The company's $2.6billion Managed Retirement A fund, for instance, fell behindthe Standard &Poor's 500 Stock Index last year because a heftychunk of its holdings were invested in an odd mix of foreignsecurities and cyclical stocks. Similar problems afflicted the$2 billion Stock A fund and the $1.5 billion Equity Value B fund. <p>  <p><a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>JANUS </b></a> <p> Janus Group is the smallest outfit on our list in more waysthan one: The Denver-based company manages $23 billion in mutual-fundassets with 11 fund managers and 24 analysts. Perhaps nowhereis more money managed by fewer people. This may make Janus aworkaholic tribe, but it also enables the entire investment staffto gather once a day to swap ideas.  <p> Company founder Thomas Bailey likes to hire youth. "You geta highly energetic workforce," he says. Bailey himself is 58twodecades older than most of his senior employees.  <p> In the mid-1980s, Bailey turned the stock-picking operationover to Jim Craig and Tom Marsico, two managers with a demonstratedknack for identifying companies with accelerating earnings. Ingeneral, Janus managers rely heavily on in-house technical analysisand computer screens to identify promising picks, but don't buya stock unless they've met with the company's management.   <p> Janus funds have reasonably good long-term records. But thisis an aggressive outfit that is willing to take risks and shellout premium prices for stocks (its equity funds have higher overallprice-to-earnings ratios than those of any other major fund family),so its results should be even better than they are.  <p> The flagship Janus Fund, which at $12.3 billion accounts formore than half of the company's assets, stumbled early last year.Its portfolio was invested at an abnormally low 60 percent instocks at the start of 1995, so it missed part of the year'sbig surge in the market.   <p>  <p><a name="FUND:KADAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/KADAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>KEMPER </b></a> <p> Chicago-based Kemper Funds, purchased earlier this year by ZurichInsurance Group, trades on its expertise in fixed-income investingand its reputation as a plainspoken Midwestern money manager.Says Stephen Timbers, president of Kemper Financial Services(which will change its name to Zurich Kemper Investments on March1), "We like to think of ourselves as smart but not glitzy." <p> Kemper's glitz quotient rose last year, though, when it acquiredthe three-fund, $74 million mutual-fund operation run by notedcontrarian and value-style investor David Dreman. It also raidedAlliance Capital Management to hire Steven Reynolds as chiefinvestment officer. Reynolds promptly instituted a new in-houseritual under which fund managers challenge one another's picks.  <p> "Research is our major strength," says Reynolds. "We're alsogetting better at using market psychology and volatility to ouradvantage." For example, when Home Depot was trading in the mid-30slast October, the company's funds sharply increased their holdings.When the stock then rose to $48 in December, Kemper cut its position. <p> Reynolds says Kemper uses a proprietary computer model to aidits investment decision-making. He says that last September themodel warned that technology stocks were nearing a peak. So thecompany's growth funds cut their technology holdings in halfwellin advance of the high-tech sell-off that began later in theyear.   <p> "We never use cash as a risk adjuster, the way other funds do,"says Reynolds. "Instead, we alter the mix of stocks."  <p>  <p><a name="FUND:MAAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MAAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MERRILL LYNCH</b></a>  <p> Of the major wire-house firms, Merrill Lynch Group has arguablythe best mutual-fund operation. Arthur Zeikel, the longtime bossof Merrill Lynch's Princeton, New Jerseybased fund operations,sets clear benchmarks for his managers and rewards them for performance.  <p> Each Merrill Lynch fund has a lead manager and one or two researchassistants. There's no centralized research department, no governinginvestment committee, and no staff economist. There is also noformula to the company's spadework: Some managers get out tosee companies firsthand; others don't. Zeikel is the author ofseveral textbooks on investing, but says he resists any temptationto micromanage. "I don't care if they use tea leaves or chartsor fundamental research," he says. "The autonomy our managershave is unique."  <p> The Merrill Lynch investment approach is generally conservativeand risk-averse"We want to limit the anxiety level," says Zeikel.He's loath to do anything that might compromise the Merrill Lynchname. He says this is also why the fund group doesn't pursuevolatile sector funds or single-country funds.  <p>  <p><a name="FUND:MFALX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MFALX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MFS</b></a>  <p> Back in 1924, the MFS family of funds gave birth to the U.S.'sfirst mutual fund. Given the historic ups and downs of the mutual-fundbusiness, the mere longevity of this company is an accomplishmentof sorts. Of course, in the intervening years, MFS also has beenpassed by 18 other fund families in total assets.   <p> Today, it's a solid concern owned by Sun Life Assurance of Canada.MFS offers a broad base of funds, a number of which have someof the longest track records around. Standouts include the EmergingGrowth B fund, which has achieved average annual returns of justover 30 percent during the past five years.  <p> The Boston-based MFS is a collegial, cooperative place, unlikecrosstown rival Fidelity. Annual bonuses are based not only onperformance but also on how often managers contribute good ideasto other funds. "We have one of the best team atmospheres inthe world," says MFS president Jeff Shames.  <p> The equity-fund managers in this shop tend to be long-term players.It's rare that an MFS portfolio includes more than 5 percentcash. The primary objective, according to Shames, is to pickstocks that will rise the most in a surging market and fall theleast in a declining market.   <p> The fund managers generally pay little attention to such macroconsiderations as the outlook for the economy, the markets, orthe U.S. presidential elections. Instead, the emphasis at MFSis on fundamental corporate analysis. "We learn more about theeconomy from talking with companies than any economist couldever tell us," says Shames. MFS has 30 full-time analysts. Eachis assigned to cover two or three industries and keep tabs onan average of 40 companies in which MFS funds own a stake. Inkeeping with the company's team approach, each analyst worksfor the fund group as whole, not for individual managers.   <p>  <p><a name="FUND:OPPFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/OPPFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>OPPENHEIMER </b></a> <p> "We're the Ford Explorer of mutual-fund companies," says JonFossel, Oppenheimer Funds' chairman. "It's not the fastest vehiclearound, but it can take you where you are going in any kind ofweather."   <p> Fossel emphasizes the importance of outperforming comparablemutual fundsand compensates his managers accordingly. He doesn't,however, believe in shooting for the highest possible returns.In his view, the added gains aren't worth the added risksparticularlyfor a company such as Oppenheimer, which has a conservative,older clientele. As a result, the Oppenheimer name rarely appearson annual lists of top performers. But it also rarely shows upamong the industry laggards.  <p> The one exception to this rule used to be Oppenheimer's MainStreet Income & Growth Fund, an extraordinary, anything-goesfund run by star manager John Wallace. Wallace, however, leftlast summer in a messy split to join Robertson Stephens. Fosselhimself may also leave soon. Defeated in a bid for the U.S. Congressin 1982, he has recently hinted that he'll make another stabat politics.  <p> In the meantime, Oppenheimer remains one of the most accessibleand customer-oriented organizations in the fund business. Fossel,who answers his own phone, says Oppenheimer employees constantlyhear the comment "You're really friendly. You don't seem likeyou're from New York City."   <p>  <p><a name="FUND:PFCAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PFCAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PRUDENTIAL </b></a> <p> President Richard Redeker arrived in 1993 to find almost nothinggoing right  <p>at Prudential Mutual Funds. The product line was nondescriptand performing no better than average. The parent company wasawash in ugly publicity from a scandal involving the sale ofbillions of dollars of limited-partnership interests.   <p> Many of the problems with the family's mutual fundslike thosewith the limited partnershipsresulted from Prudential's 1981purchase of brokerage firm Bache Securities. After the purchase,Prudential began adding new funds to feed the Bache brokeragesystem, but the fundssuch as the Short-Term Global Income Fund,which played on a temporary fad for international money-marketfundswere driven by brokers' demands for salable gimmicks. Theresult was a motley collection of offerings that had little connectionto one another and that made little sense to investors.  <p> Redeker has pared the lineupphasing out single-state muni funds,for example, while adding othersin an attempt to give Prudentiala more rational product line. At the same time, he's hired sometop managers from other firms, including bond manager BarbaraKenworthy from Dreyfus and international guru Dan Duane fromFirst Investors. Late last year, the company, which had beenlacking a single aggressive growth fund, launched the JennisonFund, managed by Jennison Associates, a separate unit of Prudentialwith a strong history as an institutional money manager.  <p> Still, the firm has a long way to go. Despite a vast lineup,there still isn't a superstar fund in the house, and few areabove average. The company's biggest offering, the $4.1 billionPrudential Utility Fund, ranks in the bottom quarter of its peergroup over the past five years because of a so far unsuccessfulstrategy that gives up traditionally high yields for capitalappreciation.  <p>  <p><a name="FUND:PAMBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PAMBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PUTNAM </b></a> <p> In 1830, a Boston judge created the famous "prudent-man rule,"granting fiduciaries considerable discretion to act for theirclients. The judge's name: Samuel Putnam. More than a centurylater, great-great-grandson George Putnam founded Putnam Investmentswith the country's first "balanced" mutual fund, investing inboth stocks and bonds. In 1970, George Putnam's descendants soldtheir sleepy, still-modest business to Marsh & McLennan, thepublicly held New York insurance brokerage. Putnam Mutual Fundshas been on a tear ever since.  <p> The company is still just average in the fixed-income arena,but its group of equity funds is the only one on our list whoserankings approach those of AIM. The credit goes to Lawrence J.Lasser, a blunt, demanding leader who joined Putnam as an analystand rose to become chief executive in 1981. He has overseen Putnam'smarketing, emphasizing aggressive stock-market performance andestablishing a national brand name.   <p> Lasser has extracted above-average results for most of Putnam'sequity funds without a star-manager system. Indeed, Lasser hatesstars, and a number of Putnam funds are now run by teams. Theflagship Voyager fund, for instance, is controlled by three people,each assigned to stocks in different categories. Putnam is hierarchical:Thinking "outside the box" is a no-no.  <p>  <p><a name="FUND:SCBAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SCBAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SCUDDER </b></a> <p> Scudder funds launched the first no- load mutual fund in 1928,and in 1953 opened the first U.S.-based mutual fund to investinternationally. Nonetheless, this firm has a surprisingly lowprofile among U.S. investors. Maybe that's because its research-intensiveinvesting style produces solid results but rarely earns any ofthe family's funds a top rating.   <p> Scudder seems to revel in anonymity, eschewing the star-managersystem in favor of collective management. "They're very privateand low-key," says Louis Harvey of Dalbar, a Boston publisherof financial-services market research. "They manage their fundsthe same way."  <p> Unlike other fund companies, where an analyst's position isoften a stepping-stone to portfolio manager, Scudder views its67 research slots as lifelong careers. The company's two-prongedapproach divides researchers into two categories: country analystsand industry analysts.  <p> Mutual-fund consultants describe Scudder as old-line and conservative.But this view is not shared by Dudley Ladd, Scudder's co-chairman:"Are we conservative investors? We would say no," he says. "Somefunds are specifically positioned as conservative, but we alsohave some very aggressive funds, particularly in the internationalareas."  <p> Ladd seems to have a point: The conservative Growth & Incomefund is Scudder's best-rated U.S. equity fund. On the high-riskside, though, Scudder also opened the first U.S. funds to investexclusively in Latin America (1992) and Korea (1984).  <p>  <p><a name="FUND:ARMGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ARMGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SMITH BARNEY </b></a> <p> "Gray hair in the investment business isn't a bad thing," saysJessica Bibliowicz, executive vice president of Smith BarneyMutual Funds, a unit of the Travelers Group.

"The strategy is to get on basetryto hit a single, if not get a walk. But don't strike out," Lippersays.  <p> For her part, Bibliowicz vows that Smith Barney "isn't goingto be a typical wire-house operation."

Few investors fully appreciatethis. Most know of Vanguard Group's dedication to low fees (atan average of 0.3 percent, Vanguard's expense ratios are thelowest in the industry by a wide margin). And they probably knowthat Vanguard is the leading proponent of passively managed indexfunds. The flagship Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio, the country'sfourth-largest stock fund, with $15 billion, was designed toduplicate the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and over fiveyears has trailed it by less than 0.2 percent, an achievementmost actively managed mutual funds can't match.   <p> But few investors know that Vanguard is the only fund companyset up like a nonprofit organization, the result of a falling-outin 1974 between founder John Bogle and the top management ofa predecessor organization. That means customers, in effect,own the management company and don't have to pad someone else'sprofits or pay corporate income taxes. "We are a mutual mutualfund," says chief executive John Brennan.  <p> Vanguard contracts out the management of the majority of itsnon-index equity funds, such as the $13.5 billion Vanguard/Windsorfund, to independent managers. Wellington Management's John Neff,who used a value-investing style to beat markets for 31 years,ran the Windsor fund until the end of last year, when he retired.His successor is longtime assistant Charles Freeman. "A lot ofmanagers call on us," says Brennan, "but we hire only two tothree a year. Last year we hired two." About $80 billion of Vanguard's$180 billion assets are now managed by outsiders.   <p>  <p><a name="FUND:ACSTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACSTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>VAN KAMPEN</wam-co>  <p> The six largest equity funds managed by Van Kampen AmericanCapital bested our field in 1995with an average return of 36percent.

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> HOW TO ADOPT A NEWBORN FUND <p>The best rewards often come from mutual funds that have yet to prove themselves. The key is knowing how to pick them.  <p> By Andrew Gluck  <p> New or relatively young mutual funds are phantoms to many professionals who advise investors. Requiring data that only an established track record can provide, they won't recommend a fund that hasn't been around for at least five years. Although Morningstar Mutual Funds will follow a fund from inception, it won't bestow a star ranking for three years, and Worth requires a five-year cutoff for its rating system.   <p> The tenure restrictions aren't necessarily bad, given that there are thousands of well-established funds and lack of choice is hardly a major complaint among investors these days. Nevertheless, they do mean that tantalizing opportunities can slip through the cracks--including funds with top-flight managers already at the controls. Investors who spot such opportunities can earn big rewards.  <p> How to do it? The key is knowing that managers can have established track records even when their funds don't.   <p> Two notable examples are Donald Yacktman and Louis Navellier. Although both managers have enviable records as investors and are admired among their peers, the funds they manage haven't been around long enough to pop up on most tables that rate funds.  <p> Yacktman established his credentials working as the manager of a fund called <a name="FUND:SLASX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SLASX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Selected American Shares</b></a>, now located in Sante Fe and managed by Selected/Venture Advisors. From 1983 to 1992, he logged an estimable 17.8 percent annual return, a performance that prompted Morningstar to name him Manager of the Year in1991. In 1992, however, Yacktman suddenly disappeared from the charts--not because his star had plummeted but because he had struck out on his own. He had launched the fledgling and track recordless <a name="FUND:YACKX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/YACKX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Yacktman Fund</b></a>, a venture that has since proved to be another solid performer. (The Chicago-based Yacktman Fund was up 24 percent through the first nine months of 1995.)  <p> Navellier started his mutual fund--the <a name="FUND:NASCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NASCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Navellier Aggressive Small Cap Growth Fund</b></a>--in April 1994. This was no novice operation, either. For ten years, Navellier had been recording average annual returns of close to 20 percent as a manager of private money in Incline Village, Nevada. He also had become one of the best-known financial newsletter writers in the country, topping the ten-year performance list for August 1995 in the Hulbert Fincancial Digest. So it was far from a surprise when Navellier's new fund recorded a 65 percent return during the 12 months ended last September.  <p> In such cases, "you don't need five years of observation," says Donald Trone of Callan Associates in San Francisco, one of the nation's largest investment consulting firms.   <p> Trone does recommend waiting a year to see how well a new fund gets out of the blocks, noting that Yacktman's fund lost 6.6 percent in 1993, its first full year. Investors also need to recognize that some fund-manager transitions are likely to be smoother than others. A manager who jumps from investing in Treasurys to junk bonds, for instance, could be asking for a rough time. On the other hand, a manager who moves from a mid-cap fund to small caps, or from small to micro caps, would probably represent a fairly safe bet.  <p> Roy Komack, a fee-only adviser in Natick, Massachusetts, says he is recommending that his clients invest in a five-month-old fund called <a name="FUND:WMICX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/WMICX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wasatch Micro-Cap</b></a>. Why? Because his favorite small-cap fund, <a name="FUND:WAAEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/WAAEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wasatch Aggressive Equity Fund</b></a>, closed to new investors on July 15. He feels confident that the new fund will employ the same bottom-up, fast-growth strategy practiced so successfully over time by Sam Stewart, founder of Wasatch, which is based in Salt Lake City.  <p> Securities regulators don't allow mutual funds to advertise a manager's record from handling private money or from running another fund, but investors can obtain such information simply by calling a fund and asking for it. Investors can also ask for the manager's rsum and a list of institutional clients to learn more about the manager's skills. The data is most likely to be reliable if it has been audited by an independent accounting firm or if it complies with standards set by the Association for Investment Management and Research in Charlottesville, Virginia.  <p> Yacktman Fund (800-525-8258) <p>Navellier Aggressive Small Cap Growth (800-887-8671) <p>Wasatch Micro-Cap (800-345-7460).  <p>

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Cover   <p> MINIMUMS COME DOWN TO EARTH  <p> By Manjeet Kripalani  <p> Imagine this: You read about the management expertise of a fund run by California-based PIMCO. The returns are terrific. You rush to buy into the fund, to live happily ever after. But this is just a fairy tale, for the fund you love has a minimum investment of $1 million; what's more, it's available only to institutional investors.  <p> Weep no more. Thanks to discount broker Jack White and the fund supermarkets of <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a> and Fidelity, some institutional funds with high minimums are now available at much lower minimums to retail investors. It's not that the higher-minimum players have relented; it's simply that they now choose to regard the broker rather than the retail investor as the client. The broker meets the minimum by combining small parcels. Everybody benefits: the fund company and broker get more money and clients; the individual investor gets a wider-range of funds. Some of Federated Investors' institutional funds, normally offered at a minimum of $25,000, are available through Schwab and Fidelity for $1,000. PIMCO's institutional funds, which normally carry $1 million minimums, can be had through Jack White for $25,000. Three Invesco funds that normally carry $1 million minimums can be had through Fidelity for a $2,500 starter.  <p> For the fund groups, it's a matter of survival. "Federated participates because of those over 4,000 investment advisors who clear through Schwab and maintain over $40 billion in custody through them,"says John Fisher, head of institutional investments at Federated."We don't care about retail investors; we care about those investment advisors."  <p> All right, so that's not the warmest welcome a small investor ever got. As long as they'll take a check. <p>

November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Cover   <p> IS BIGGER BETTER--AND FOR WHOM?  <p> By Jonathan Butler  <p> The number of mutual funds keeps climbing. According to the Investment Company Institute in Washington, D.C., there were 5,642 funds at the end of July, up more than 5 percent from the 5,357 at the end of 1994.  <p> But fewer and fewer companies own that growing multitude of funds. While the banks have been stealing the headlines with their high-profile megamergers, the mutual-fund industry has also been consolidating at a rapid pace. Some mergers--like New England Investment Companies' purchase of the Oakmark Funds--have involved household names, while others--such as ARM Financial buying SBM Co. and <a name="NASD:NSFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=46031"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Northstar</b></a> teaming up with <a name="NYSE:ADV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10038"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Advest</b></a>--have involved lesser-known players. Through the first seven months of this year, there were 17 deals in which a fund company either merged or was acquired, according to the newsletter Fund Action. By comparison, there were only 19 such deals in all of 1994.  <p> The companies are looking to get three things from greater size: economies of scale, new products, and new channels of distribution. These goals are not, you'll notice, primarily about the investor.(Nor do you see many companies pass on the savings from economies of scale in the form of lower fees.)  <p> And sometimes investors are caught in a crunch--particularly investors who have been picking the right funds. After a merger, for example, funds with similar investment objectives are often combined. This has the effect of burying the performance record of the weaker fund, since the surviving fund will generally assume whichever track record is better (as well as the name of the better-performing fund, if possible). Investors in the poorer-performing fund can't complain: They get new management. But investors in the better-performing fund are stuck with whatever portfolio baggage came with the poor performer and can be hurt long-term by the inflexibility of a larger asset base.  <p><p>

 A FUND SELECTION SYSTEM THAT WORKS 
<p>
Here's how we picked five stock funds with the best prospects<p>
<p>
 By Jim Jubak  
<p>
 Last year, we set out to build a better system for picking mutual
funds. Our goal was to devise a rational, defensible method for
selecting equity funds--one that would take the roulette wheel
out of the equation. Predictability was our primary focus. What
we wanted, more than anything, was to find out which of the better-performing
equity funds were merely lucky and which possessed the strategies
and skills to provide investors with a true edge. No other selection
method we know of does this.  
<p>
 So how did our picks fare? Not too shabbily--especially considering
our conservative approach.  
<p>
 The four U.S. stock funds we highlighted last year averaged
a total return of 23.1 percent for the 12 months ended August
31, outdistancing the performance of the broad market as measured
by the Russell 3000 stock index. Each of our four domestic picks
also beat the average for its peer group--ranging from Mutual
Beacon (1.47 percentage points above the average large-cap value
fund) to Heartland Value (10.96 percentage points above the average
small-cap value fund).  
<p>
 The lone disappointment was our 1994 selection for best global
equity fund: Warburg Pincus International Equities, which fell
4.32 percent. Although most global and international funds posted
negative results during our measurement period, we expected better
from this pick. (See "Last Year's Picks")  
<p>
 Still, even with Warburg as part of the mix, we continue to
feel sanguine about the prospects for our 1994 choices. Why?
Because our focus, from the beginning, has been on the long term.
And in that context, one year's worth of results only means so
much, good or bad.  
<p>
 All told, the system we devised last year worked the way we
wanted it to, selecting a diversified group of top-notch, reliable
performers. Sure, it would have been nice to have singled out
the Seligman Communications and Information fund a year ago.
It clobbered our picks, rising 91.5 percent through August 31.
But even if we had picked Seligman last year, we wouldn't recommend
it again now.  
<p>
 Funds that achieve No. 1 status in any given year rarely turn
out to be consistent performers over time. In fact, a lofty ranking
based on performance alone may be a sign of an extreme and therefore
risky investment style. The best funds (including Fidelity's
Magellan when it was run by Peter Lynch) rarely hit No. 1 in
any single year. Our system attempts to identify consistent performers--funds
worth hanging on to year in and year out.   
<p>
 Any investor who has been in the game for a while knows how
much damage a poor market can do to one's patience and resolve.
But strong markets like this year's can also be tricky. Invariably,
some investments rack up eye-popping numbers. Even if your holdings
are doing well, it's tempting to abandon a carefully laid strategy
and chase after these bottle rockets--only to arrive just as
they begin to fizzle.  
<p>
 Of course, it's still important to test even long-range predictions
against the most recent data. So we gave our methodology the
once-over using a computer analysis program called Stastica.
We used this program, developed by StatSoft Inc., to evaluate
the correlation between the rankings of the 777 equity funds
we looked at in 1994 and their actual performance over the following
year. Based on this test, we elected to make only minor adjustments
to our selection system for 1995.  
<p>
 To begin this year's process, we once again asked Morningstar
Inc. to supply us with raw data. This year's information included
two new categories: the earnings growth rate for each fund's
portfolio and the percentage of each portfolio invested outside
the U.S. Our in-house research team filled holes in the Morningstar
numbers and double-checked 25,000 bits of data. A total of 883
equity funds met our minimum listing requirements of a five-year
track record and assets totaling at least $25 million.   
<p>
 Analyst Kevin Maloney at Frank Russell Co. helped direct our
listings of U.S. equity funds into a matrix of four groups: large-cap
value funds, large-cap growth funds, small-cap value funds, and
small-cap growth funds. (Cap in this context refers to the median
market capitalization of the stocks in an equity fund's portfolio.
It is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number
of shares outstanding.) High cap numbers mean that a fund invests
primarily in large corporations. We designated a fund as large
cap if its median market capitalization was over $1.5 billion.
Small-cap funds fall below that level.   
<p>
 We then split each of these two groups based on their investment
style: Does a fund lean toward selecting stocks based on their
potential growth or based on intrinsic value? The yardstick we
used was the median price-to-book ratio (the relationship between
the price of a stock and its underlying asset value). Among large-cap
funds, a median price-to-book ratio above 2.87 put a fund into
our growth category; anything below went into value. For small-cap
funds, we used a median price-to-book ratio of 2.29 as the dividing
line.  
<p>
 Our fifth category, global funds, covers only those funds that
invest at least 40 percent of their assets outside the U.S. <p>
<p>
 To us, these five categories represent an effective way for
investors to diversify their equity portfolios--balancing large-cap
funds against small-cap, value against growth, and domestic funds
against those that invest around the globe.  
<p>
 After we grouped the funds, we began the process of identifying
the best fund in each category based on scores in three areas:
performance, risk, and predictability. We started with performance,
taking the five-year total return of each fund, subtracting the
impact of front-end sales charges, and then ranking the result
against the fund's peers. Our tables, beginning on page 127,
list this score, as well as each fund's raw one-, three-, and
five-year returns and the fund's performance against a benchmark
index. Four Russell indexes served this purpose for the U.S.
funds. We pitted the global funds against one of two Morgan Stanley
Capital International indexes: the Europe, Australasia, and Far
East index (EAFE) for funds with more than 75 percent of their
assets outside the U.S., and the World index for funds that combined
major holdings inside the U.S. with substantial overseas investments.
The split benchmark was new to our calculations this year, but
necessary, we felt, because the U.S. market had so outperformed
the rest of the world. That meant that global funds, which mix
U.S. and overseas stocks, substantially outperformed foreign
funds, limited by their charters to overseas stocks. (The EAFE
index returned 0.79 percent for the 12 months; the World index
scored a 8.78 percent return.)  
<p>
 Next, we looked at risk. Here we focused on three different
measurements of fund characteristics: standard deviation, which
shows the degree of variance in a fund's performance over time;
beta, a measure of a fund's volatility in relation to the entire
stock market; and turnover, a measure of how actively a fund's
portfolio is traded by its manager. We like each of these three
because none of them pogo-stick in sync with the market. This
year, we also decided to factor a fund's load and expenses into
our risk assessment. That's because we wanted to reflect a simple
reality of mutual-fund management: High sales charges and fees
put additional pressure on fund managers to justify high premiums.
After completing the risk measurements, we again compared each
fund with its peers. The final risk rating appears in our listings,
with 100 representing the lowest level of risk.  
<p>
 Our predictor rating, a feature found in no other ranking system,
provides an assessment of how likely a fund is to repeat its
performance in the future. To derive this score, we first checked
the tenure of a fund's manager during the five-year study period.
A new manager might be better or worse than the one responsible
for the fund's track record, but there's certainly no way to
divine which. Our predictor rating also considers the growth
of a fund's net assets from 1992 to 1995, on the theory that
it is harder to manage a rapidly growing fund. In the current
market, we also worry about funds that must invest lots of new
cash at high prices. Finally, we compared each fund's current
beta and price-to-book ratios with those ratios three years ago.
Big changes could signal shifts in a fund's style. This year,
we concluded that while movements in price-to-book and beta ratios
are important indicators for all funds, they aren't as significant
for growth funds as for value funds. To reflect this, we slightly
modified our formula for calculating the predictor rating for
each type of fund.  
<p>
 Our final overall rating, expressed by dollar signs, combines
the risk, return, and predictor results into one score--$ for
laggards to $$$$$ for the very best, based on our objectives.
Only the top 5 percent of the funds in each category is deemed
worthy of our $$$$$ rating.  
<p>
 Readers should keep in mind that the criteria we use embody
an intentional bias. Our rating system, for instance, tends to
penalize sector funds, because they are more risky and less predictable
than other types. Our reasoning: Sector funds, which normally
invest in a single industry, aren't well-suited to a portfolio
of only four or five funds. Instead they are meant to track a
fairly narrow segment of the market. They appeal either to people
with specialized knowledge of an industry or to investors who
already hold broadly diversified portfolios and are looking for
some extra return.  
<p>
 Our system is designed to produce a balanced portfolio, and
we think the adjustments we've made in our method this year should
yield even better results for investors  in the future. They
are intended to help push the investment styles in our portfolio
further apart, improving diversification.  
<p>
 For example, on the small-cap end of the portfolio, our top
growth fund, T. Rowe Price New Horizons, is substantially different
from our top value pick, T. Rowe Price Small Cap. The growth
fund shows a beta of 1.2--indicating a volatility above that
of the entire market--while the value fund's beta is just 0.62.
The median annual earnings growth rate of the stocks in the portfolio
of the growth fund is nearly 30 percent; the median growth rate
of the stocks in the value fund's portfolio is 13.4 percent.
As investors might expect from those numbers, the price-to-earnings
ratio of the growth fund is almost 33. In the value fund it's
just 19.1.  
<p>
 The two top large-cap funds present an even more dissimilar
picture. Mutual Qualified, the pick of the value funds, has a
beta of 0.8 and a standard deviation of 2.1. Its median stock
shows earnings growth of a scant 3.8 percent a year--and carries
a price-to-earnings ratio of just 16.7. Growth fund Harbor Capital
Appreciation shows an above-market beta of 1.3 and a standard
deviation of 3.6 (reflecting a higher rate of variability in
its performance). The median stock in the portfolio has earnings
growth of almost 23 percent annually and has a p/e ratio of 27.<p>
<p>
 Of course, though we wanted the changes in our system to make
it easier to diversify, we didn't want to end up simply adding
high-risk funds to our portfolio. So we compared these growth
funds with their peers by examining some of their basic characteristics.
Harbor Capital Appreciation, for example, was certainly riskier
than the average large-cap growth fund, which showed a beta of
0.93 and a standard deviation of 2.73. But it wasn't the riskiest
in the category--it trailed well behind such highflyers as Seligman
Communications and Information (beta 1.57). T. Rowe Price New
Horizons didn't make the top of the risk charts in the small-cap
growth category either--it finished behind 26 other funds with
higher betas,  including earnings-driven bellwethers such as
Twentieth Century Vista Investors (beta 1.47).  
<p>
 Actually, in analyzing the five funds that wound up as our top
picks, we found only one surprise: Founders Worldwide Growth,
a global fund with substantial U.S. investments (almost 38 percent,
according to Morningstar). Founders had to overcome a matchup
with the higher World index, which includes U.S. and foreign
stocks, while some of its peers had only to best the EAFE index.
Frankly, we didn't expect a fund facing that kind of handicap
(on a five-year basis the difference between the World and the
EAFE Index is about 2.9 percent annually) to rise to the top.
But there's no arguing with Founders' numbers. Over the past
five years the fund has returned more with less risk than any
other fund in its class. And that--finding the best mix of high
reward and low risk for the long haul--is what our fund selection
method is all about.  
<p><p>
<p>
LAST YEAR'S PICKS: A RECAP  
<p>
 All five of our 1994 fund picks fell slightly in this year's
ratings--not because they didn't perform well, but because investors
smothered them with affection. Heartland Value Fund, our top
choice for small-cap value fund last year, demonstrates just
how difficult it is for even a great fund to stay on top. In
1995 Heartland kept up the performance that earned it our top
$$$$$ rating in 1994. The fund returned 25.63 percent for the
12 months ended August 31, 1995--and yet still dropped a rank
to $$$$ in this year's list. How come? Despite closing its doors
to new investors in July 1995, Heartland grew to $1.05 billion
in assets, up from $261 million last year and just $35.7 million
in 1992. As a result, the number of stocks in its portfolio leapt
from 48 in 1990 to 244 in early 1995, according to Morningstar.
Price-to-earnings ratios and price-to-book ratios both rose as
well.  
<p>
 Ditto for Wasatch Aggressive Equity, our top small-cap growth
fund. Its 29.30 percent total return for the 12 months actually
bettered the fund's average annual return for the last five years.
But climbing assets--up to $293.7 million from $39.4 million
in just one year--lowered the fund's risk and reliability ratings.
Manager Samuel Stewart closed the doors to money from new investors
on July 15.  
<p>
 Both of last year's top large-cap choices, Fidelity Disciplined
Equity and Mutual Beacon, performed almost exactly as predicted--yet
still lost just enough ground to earn $$$$ ratings. Fidelity
Disciplined Equity returned 21.59 percent, beating the average
large-cap growth fund by 2.46 percentage points, but its assets
about doubled. That, plus a big increase in the median price-to-book
ratio of stocks in its portfolio--up to 4.66 from 2.77 three
years ago--hurt the fund's reliability rating. Last year's large-cap
value choice, Mutual Beacon, sported a favorable risk rating
that offset a slight lag in performance. But surging assets this
year lowered its risk score.  
<p>
 Even Warburg Pincus International Equity Fund Common Shares
fell in our ratings. This happened more because of an influx
of investors (more than doubling its assets) than because of
lagging performance. Manager Richard King's heavy weighting in
Japan--about a quarter of the fund's stock portfolio in May 1995--certainly
dragged down return, but the fund still scored in the 93rd percentile
overall, barely missing the $$$$$ category.

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Cover Story  <p> SO MUCH FOR ECONOMIES OF SCALE  <p> By Andrew Gluck  <p> The mutual fund boom has been a bust when it comes to lowering expenses for investors. More than 1,700 new mutual funds have been launched in the past 18 months, but competition hasn't forced funds to slash costs to attract investors. Nor has the tremendous influx of money into the industry. Just the opposite.   <p> According to data from Lipper Analytical Services, there are six times more funds now than in 1985 and assets have grown fivefold, from $466 billion to $2.35 trillion. But the median expense ratio of the 5,632 mutual funds that have reported a full fiscal year of operations is 96 basis points, Lipper data show, up from 91 basis points in 1990 and 87 basis points in 1985. So far this year, it's gotten worse, with the median expense ratio rising by 6 basis points over 1994. All retail categories--from equity to fixed-income funds--show expenses creeping up.  <p> Even the largest funds, which have swelled in assets the most over the past ten years, have not passed on any savings from economies of scale. According to Lipper, the median expense ratio of the nation's ten largest funds is 69 basis points, up from 57 basis points ten years ago.  <p> Fund expenses go to pay lawyers's fees, commissions to transfer agents,  directors' fees, the salaries of telephone representatives, and other costs of running a fund company. But the biggest component of the expense ratio is the fee an advisor gets for managing the fund's securities. The next largest expense is often the12-b1 fee levied by some broker-sold funds to defray marketing costs and to give brokers an annual stipend for looking after a customer's investment. With nearly half of funds launched over the past 18 months carrying 12b-1 distribution charges, the picture isn't likely to improve anytime soon.  <p> Charles Trzcinka, a finance professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, has studied mutual fund expenses and says fund companies have been able to avoid cutting fees because consumers are confused. "The only other consumer product where this happens is medicine," Trzcinka says. "It's because knowing you have a better mutual fund is about the same as knowing whether you have a good surgeon."  <p><p>

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Cover Story  <p> BEST SMALL-CAP VALUE FUND: <a name="FUND:PRSVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. ROWE PRICE SMALL CAP VALUE</b></a> <p>The key to the least-researched market segment? Preston Athey likes his companies very small and not very exciting.  <p> By Andrew Gluck  <p> When Preston Athey began managing the T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value Fund four years ago, it was an average performer with just $45 million in assets. "T. Rowe wasn't earning enough on the fund to pay my salary," Athey says. Small Cap Value now has assets of more than $750 million and is the most efficient of the nation's 342 small-company stock funds: No small-cap fund has been less volatile over the last five years (it's been only two thirds as volatile as the average fund in the sector) and delivered as much return. Small Cap Value has averaged a 15.6 percent gain annually in the period.   <p> Athey buys micro-caps, stocks with a capitalization no larger than $250 million. The fund's median market capitalization is just $116 million--1/38th the size of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. Not only won't Athey buy a company with a market cap of more than $250 million, he won't hold onto a company, even a good company, when its capitalization gets above $500 million.  <p> Academic studies have shown that micro-caps offer the most rewards over long periods, but it's a difficult segment of the market to operate in. The stocks are expensive to trade, because brokers charge fat spreads to make up for the low volume. The small capitalization creates liquidity risks for big investors. And the companies get little or no coverage from Wall Street anlaysts.   <p> So Athey spends a quarter of his time visiting companies--100 in the past year. He limits commissions by being a long-term investor, averaging a 21 percent turnover rate, less than a third the rate of the average stock fund. And he reduces liquidity risk and diversifies investment risk by holding 175 companies. <p> That's a lot of legwork, but Athey has help. A T. Rowe analyst spends 50 percent of his time on the fund and is responsible for 30 stocks in the portfolio. Athey tracks about 45 stocks, and the rest of the portfolio ideas and research are generated by T. Rowe Price's pool of 25 analysts.  <p> This is a completely bottom-up strategy: Judgment rules and quantitative screens don't decide what gets into the portfolio."If you're going to own stocks for a long time, you better know what you own because some stocks deserve to be cheap," says Athey. "Some companies are abysmally managed and some are in dying industries. If you just buy off a computer screen, you'll buy stocks that will be cheap forever."  <p> Athey believes he minimizes risk by buying companies that he is pleased to call boring. "The beauty of my kind of investingis that you don't have to kick these tires that often," he says."I'm not investing in semiconductor companies, and I don't live or die by some analyst changing his earnings. These stocks seldom fall out of bed."  <p> Take the fund's largest holding, <a name="NASD:ELRC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13294"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Electro Rent</b></a>, which leases computers and other electronics to Fortune 500 companies. "How exciting is it to rent personal computers to businesses?" asks Athey. "We're not talking rocket science or digital telephone or the hottest toy for kids. But management makes money, and they buy their stock back and grow the earnings." Athey's Dow Jones News/Retrieval screen says no analysts have issued earnings estimates on Electro Rent and none are listed as following the company. Small Cap Value owns 7.3 percent of the company, and Electro Rent has gained 73 percent in the past year.  <p> Athey often adds a touch of contrarianism to his disciplined value approach. "When the rest of the world hates it, that's when I get interested," he says. Athey's evaluation of <a name="NYSE:TRR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12364"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TRC Companies</b></a> is an example of how he sees stocks. TRC is a tiny ($50 million market capitalization) environmental engineering company that studies air-pollution emissions for utilities and other industries. In 1992, investors were willing to pay 2.7 times more for a dollar of sales at TRC than they were for a dollar of sales of the S&P 400 index of mid-cap stocks, and TRC stock hit an all-time high of $17. It's now trading at about $8, which means the market is paying just 0.6 times as much for a dollar of TRC sales as for a dollar of S&P 400 sales. Earnings at the company have grown for seven consecutive quarters, and two top managers recently purchased about $500,000 of their company's stock. "I've been buying it all year," says Athey. "Nobody cares about it; it's totally out of favor."  <p> Athey joined T. Rowe in 1978 as an analyst and managed small-cap growth funds for pension accounts before taking charge of Small Cap Value. Along the way he became one of those fortunate people who can claim to have bought stock in Warren Buffett--in <a name="NYSE:BRK.A"></a><b>Berkshire Hathaway</b>, that is--as early as 1980. Investing for himself, Athey paid $325 a share for Buffett's company; it now sells for about $29,000. He still follows Buffett's lead where he can, but his own fund is by far the largest regular investment he makes. <p> Small Cap Value was closed to new investors in March 1993 after assets rose to $404 million, and it didn't reopen until last January. It's now at $750 million in assets, and new cash is flowing in so rapidly that Athey has put 5 percent of the fund's assets into Russell 2000 futures, which provides market exposure without costing a lot, and has another 15 percent in cash. "To the extent cash comes in faster than I can prudently put it to work, I am willing to put it into futures and leave it in cash," he says. Based on the fund's history, it's safe to assume that unless market conditions change, the fund is likely to close again to new investors soon.  <p> Athey contends that the bull market is on its last legs, but this is often when small stocks perform best. "If I believe the market will do reasonably well between now and the presidential election," he says, "then I feel very confident that small-capstocks will do even better."  <p>  <p>T.

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Cover   <p> BEST SMALL-CAP GROWTH FUND: <a name="FUND:PRNHX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRNHX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. ROWE PRICE NEW HORIZONS</b></a>  <p>What is this small-company fund doing with so many large companies in its portfolio? Proving Jack LaPorte right, primarily.  <p> By Jonathan Butler  <p> There's a reason this small- cap fund is full of big companies: Jack Laporte bought 'em small, and they just won't stop growing. <p> In other words, things are working according to plan for Laporte and T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, the $2.5 billion fund he's managed for eight years. For the year to date through September15, New Horizons was up 45.1 percent, over 14 percentage points better than the Russell 2000 growth index. Over the past five years, he has racked up annualized returns of 24 percent, versus the Russell's 17 percent.  <p> Laporte focuses primarily on earnings, looking for new small companies (defined for his purposes as those with market capitalizations between $50 million and $500 million) that can grow at 30 percent or better over five years or more. He's not obsessive about a company's valuation. "If a company's growing at an above-average rate, unless it's selling at a ludicrous level, we'll want too own it," he says. For example, last March he added to his position in <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b> when it was trading in the high 30s, despite the fact that T. Rowe expected this to represent a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 60. Laporte believed in America Online's ability to maintain its high growth rates over the long haul. As of September15, the stock was trading at $66.   <p> Laporte's portfolio strategy combines discipline with experimentation. Though New Horizons holds roughly 280 stocks, the three largest holdings--<a name="NASD:PAYX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14388"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Paychex</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:CU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12858"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CUC International</b></a>, and <a name="AMEX:VIA"></a><b>Viacom</b>--make up roughly10 percent of the fund. Another 20 or so names take up 1 to 2 percent of the portfolio each. The remaining 70 percent of the fund comprises 250-odd names.  <p> These small positions allow Laporte to learn about the new companies better by giving him the access to managements. And with a personal"multiple six-figure" position in the fund, Laporte has incentive to keep up with all the names.   <p> Despite the large number of stocks, the fund has an annual turnover rate of just 44 percent, less than half that of the average small-company growth fund. This is in part because Laporte doesn't necessarily bail out when a company outgrows the small-cap designation. "I do not automatically sell a stock when its capitalization hits some arbitrary number, like a billion dollars," he says. "That's a real inhibitor of performance." More than 60 companies in the fund now have capitalizations of over $1 billion.  <p> According to T. Rowe Price, the median size of companies held by New Horizons is $350 million, well within the bounds of the typical small-company description. The fund-research company Morningstar, however, asserts that this measure underemphasizes the impact on performance of the top holdings. According to Morningstar,the dollar-weighted median gives a more accurate picture of the size of the median company: $1.16 billion.  <p> Laporte calls himself a bottom-up investor, meaning he picks each stock based on its own story with little regard for economic trends. The one macroeconomic view he does subscribe to is that the small-company universe performs in five- to seven-year cycles. The current cycle, in which small caps have easily outpaced larger stocks, began in October 1990, but Laporte thinks small caps still have a ways to go. What gives him such confidence is the level of New Horizons' relative price-to-earnings ratio. This proprietary indicator, which is computed by dividing the New Horizons p/e ratio by that of the S&P 500 stock index and isused by just about everyone who invests in small stocks, givesa picture of how cheap or expensive small stocks are versus larger stocks. When the ratio gets down to 1, as it did most recently in 1990, small stocks are very cheap and the cycle is likely to turn upward. When the ratio nears 2, it is a sign that small stocks are expensive and are running out of gas.  <p> The relative p/e is rising--it was 1.34 on June 30 and up to1.40 by mid-September. Though Laporte doesn't think it will get as high as 2 this cycle, he is confident that it will get above1.5 before turning. Even if it does turn soon, Laporte's strategy won't change drastically. "I don't think investors own New Horizons to have me be a market timer," he says.  <p> With Laporte's reluctance to invest according to a macroeconomic view, the only real indication of his outlook is his cash position. For the past five years, the fund has held an average of 5 percent cash. This number was at 6 percent at the end of June, at which point Laporte lowered the fund's position in technology 2 percentage points to 21 percent because he thought the sector was looking "a little frothy." With new money pouring in as well, he's up to a relatively cautious 9 percent. There's not much further to go, either: He promises not to exceed 10 percent, even in the worst market environment.  <p> T.

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Cover  <p> BEST LARGE-CAP VALUE FUND: <a name="FUND:MQIFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MQIFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MUTUAL QUALIFIED</b></a> <p>Well, if it isn't Michael Price again, this time with a fund that makes the most of bankruptcies and--especially in 1995--mergers  <p> By Manjeet Kripalani  <p> Michael Price smiled all day on August 28, the day <a name="NYSE:CMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10322"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chase Manhattan</b></a> announced its merger with <a name="NASD:CHFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12961"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chemical Bank</b></a>. His big stakes in Chase and Chemical had just become bigger: Profits for shareholders in his Mutual Series Inc. funds were pushed up to a cumulative $400 million.  <p> The strategy, and its success, were vintage Price--put money into stocks in merger or bankruptcy situations, and then wait for them to make you rich. But in this case he was even more involved: He sits on the Chase board of directors.  <p> Price's aggressive approach has taken him to the top of our charts in the large-cap value category for the second straight year--and has earned him some controversy along the way. In 1994 Price's <a name="FUND:BEGRX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BEGRX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mutual Beacon Fund</b></a> was one of our five top picks; this year it's a sister fund, Mutual Qualified, with $2.56 billion in assets.  <p> One of the keys to his approach is consistency. Price, 44, has doggedly adhered to the investing principles of his guru and former partner, the late Max Heine of the firm Herzog, Heine & Geduld. Heine made money from investing in bankruptcies, and so has Price. "Combine 8 percent bankruptcies, 22 percent cash,and 10 percent [merger and acquisition] deals with 60 percentin cheap stocks--that's my calculation," he says. As an added bonus, the fortunes of bankruptcy stocks aren't usually tied to general market conditions, so their presence helps insulate the fund from the market's swings, both down and up.  <p> Insulated? Mutual Qualified has kept up with the rising market,jumping 25 percent through September 15 of this year. "That's atypical," Price says. He attributes the gains to the spurt of merger and spin-off action in 1995. In addition to the Chase-Chemical deal, Price made money on <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a> when it spun off Allstate and also benefited from Seagram when the company purchased MCA. He likes <a name="NYSE:VO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41797"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Seagram</b></a> better now that it owns MCA--"it's more interesting"--and thinks the $36 stock could be worth $50. He also looks for the stock of the combined Chase-Chemical entity to rise further,bringing even more profits from his investments in those banks.(Incidentally, Price acquired his shares in Chemical throught he company's previous merger with Manufacturers Hanover.)  <p> One interesting element in Price's strategy is the high cash allocation. It makes sense when you consider that Mutual Qualified was closed to investors from 1989 to 1994. Since it reopened, $1 million to $3 million has been flowing in daily. Because Price does most of his shopping when the market is down, much of the cash has been piling up during the current rally. But not all of it: "I'm finding things to buy from day to day," Price says."Not a lot, but a few. We're putting the money to work."  <p> Assisting Price in that process is a team of 15 research analysts who crunch numbers and scrutinize companies' accounting. Price describes himself as "very balance-sheet oriented." He believes in conservative accounting, looks for hidden assets and liabilities,and doesn't care about quarterly earnings at all.   <p> Price does care about the quality of a company's management. On any given day, as many as 12 members of the Mutual Series staff are on the road, visiting corporations to find out which are well-run. "Bad management can make you a good buy, because there can be a turn around situation there," Price says.  <p> Price is on the board of several companies, including Chase, causing some to label him an activist investor and raising the specter of conflicting interests. But Price is unrepentant. "With my investing approach, sometimes you help value get realized,"he says. "You suggest to management that they should spin off some operations." He pauses, then adds: "They're always constructive suggestions."  <p> Mutual Qualified isn't limited to bargains in the U.S. The fundholds 12 percent of its assets in foreign stocks, and in February Price will open an office in London. He says the move isn't an attempt to diversify by nation or any other measure; he simply wants to cast his bargain-hunting net wider. "We don't buy industries or countries," he says. "We're company-specific. We look for the same things as with U.S. stocks, but because it's foreign, we'll want it cheaper." For instance, Price bought Dutch confectioner Van Melle at a price-to-earnings ratio of 10 at a time when Hershey was trading at a multiple of 25. (Van Melle produces, among other candies, Mentos mints.) The fund also has positions in such European giants as <a name="NYSE:PHG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41823"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philips</b></a>, Bayer, Nestle, and Ciba Geigy.  <p> Picking stocks to buy isn't that hard, Price says. Knowing when to sell--well, that's another story. "Oh, God," he says, "we make so many mistakes." He laments the number of occasions on which he's sold early, such as last year, when he unloaded his holdings in <a name="NYSE:UAL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11520"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>UAL Corp.</b></a> at around $100 a share. Now the stock trades at $170.  <p> But despite the occasional missed opportunity, Price has plenty to crow about. Mutual Series, which he launched in 1989 after buying out the remainder of his partnership with Max Heine from Heine's estate, now runs five funds. The company manages nearly $13 billion in assets, up from $8 billion last year. And Price--whose largest personal investments are tied up in Mutual Series funds--seems to be enjoying himself to boot. Managing the funds, he says, gives him "the freedom of being creative."   <p> After years of consistent growth, Price knows there's no magic path to profits. Instead, he praises the virtues of simply doing critical investment homework. "I read the paper every day to see what's cheap," he says. He is also reluctant to predict the market's future direction and careful to avoid sounding cocky. A bull market like this one "makes everyone a genius," he says."They make mistakes but don't notice because the market's saving them."  <p>  <p>MUTUAL QUALIFIED  <p> Net assets: $2.6 billion <p>Median price-to-earnings ratio: 16.7 <p>Median earnings growth rate: 3.8% <p>Beta: 0.8 <p>Standard deviation: 2.1 <p>Top five holdings: Chase, US West, Sunbeam-Oster, ITT, Tenet Healthcare <p>Best year: 1983, up 34.5 % <p>Worst year: 1990, down 10.1% <p>Manager tenure: 15 years <p>Minimum initial investment: $1,000 <p>Load: No load, no 12b-1 fee <p>Phone number: 800-553-3014  <p><p>

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Cover  <p> BEST LARGE-CAP GROWTH FUND: HARBOR CAPITAL APPRECIATION
The point, says Spiros Segalas, is not that he buys technology stocks--it's that he picks the right ones for the right reasons <p> By Ken Kurson  <p> Spiros Segalas likes to keep things simple. "I don't believe in derivatives," he says. "I don't believe in hedging. I don't believe in a lot of these esoteric techniques."   <p> He likes to share the credit. "Quite honestly," he says, "I've surrounded myself with some very, very bright people. I may be a better people picker than a stock picker."  <p> And he likes technology. A lot. Through confident, aggressive buying in the tech sector, <a name="FUND:HACAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HACAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Harbor Capital Appreciation</b></a>, which Segalas has managed since 1990, has gained an average of 22.7 percent annually for the past five years, outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index every year. (For 1995, the fund was up 40 percent through September 15.) Forty-two percent of Harbor Capital Appreciation is invested in technology, and seven of the fund's top ten holdings are tech stocks.  <p> Of course, technology has been this year's go-go sector, and to some investors that suggests it will soon be the worst place to have money. If you own a company for the right reasons, Segalas says, that's the wrong way to think. He believes that many investors miss the crucial distinctions between solid blue chips and high-flying start-ups.  <p> "People are quite concerned about technology companies these days," Segalas says. "But the only rap I see is that they're up a lot. But the earnings are up a lot, too. I look at our holdings, and the price-to-earnings ratios on our estimates look very, very reasonable, even though the stocks have done quite well. Where you're getting a lot of the speculation is in some of the smaller companies that haven't been in business more than a few years. Internet-type companies. In fact, some of those stocks are out of sight, and I'm sure there's going to be a correction there. People say technology,' and they throw everything in there."  <p> A life-long New Yorker, Segalas came upon his love of stocks in an unlikely manner. His father, a Greek immigrant who owned a general contracting business, would often finance his clients' purchases of building materials. The elder Segalas would post a mishmash of stock certificates as collateral, and it fell to Spiros, who was then in high school, to track the daily close of his father's securities.   <p> Joining the family business, however, was another story. "My father was a very bottom-line, hard-nosed guy, and I had no aptitude for that kind of business," Segalas says. "Here I thought I was a hot shot Princeton graduate, naval officer, and he had me sweeping floors and driving lumber to jobs."  <p> Segalas's interest in stocks resurfaced when a gamble with his college graduation money paid off. "RJ Reynolds was coming out with a filtered cigarette--and it's ironic because I've never smoked in my life--so I put the $1,000 in RJR," Segalas says."The stock went way up, and I said, Hey, I kind of like this.'"It was just the first example of a technological breakthrough working for him.  <p> His favorite companies in his favorite sector? "I look at <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a>,"he says enthusiastically, "and I think this company could show better than 20 percent earnings gain. They're in an explosive part of the marketplace--wireless communication--and the whole world seems to want more of it. It's very reasonably priced. The same thing's true of <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>. My largest holding is <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a>. The stock's up a lot this year. Yet, our estimate puts [HP's price-to-earnings ratio] at something like 14.7 for 1996. Here's a company I think can grow 20 percent, selling at a discount multiple to the market. Can it have a correction? Sure, because it's up a lot this year, but the multiple doesn't disturb me that much."  <p> Harbor Capital Appreciation has more than quadrupled in size in the past 12 months, to $900 million in assets, but Segalas has kept the fund fully invested and says he's had no trouble finding good companies to buy. He is at pains to portray himself as strict bottom-up investor--one who buys a company based on its merits, not any belief about its sector or the broader market. He says the best companies happen to be in technology because it's "the only industry that's a declining-cost industry," a factor that "can only broaden the market for its products."  <p> Because of the fund's 14 percent exposure to foreign stocks and its large technology holdings, Morningstar has flagged Harbor for its volatility, which is about 26 percent greater than that of the S&P 500. That places it just inside the riskiest quartile of large-cap funds. Segalas acknowledges this aspect of his fund but argues that the reasonable valuations of the companies in his portfolio make it well worth the risk. He's certainly putting his money where his mouth is: a sizable piece of his own portfolio, as well as money for his four children and five grandchildren, are in the fund he manages.   <p> Many of Harbor Capital Appreciation's best plays have involved ultramodern companies whose strengths have been revealed through old-fashioned due diligence. Perhaps the best example is a German software company called SAP-Systeme. The company came to Segalas's attention when Harbor's biggest holding, Hewlett-Packard, began using SAP software. "I sat down with SAP and listened to this management, and I said, Wow, I want to own this one,'" Segalas says. "I just thought these guys are so smart and so with it and the market is so large and I think this company could grow 40 percent a year, maybe for some time to come. Now this is a for-real company, a billion dollars in sales. But if I hadn't met that management, I probably would have disregarded it." The stock rose 50 percent in the three months after Segalas bought it in mid-1995.  <p> To be sure, Segalas has endured his share of mistakes. Harbor's exposure to foreign stocks is high for a large-cap growth fund, and the fund took a body blow when Segalas failed to anticipate the devaluation of the Mexican peso last year. Other companies, such as the American carpet marker Shaw Industries, simply proved disappointing, so Segalas sold and moved on, in the way a manager with more than 30 years of experience is able to.  <p> Segalas sees little reason for pessimism over the next several years. "The reason I like the market, the key to it," he says,"is inflation and interest rates. I think we've seen the peak in profit gains. They'll continue to grow, albeit at a somewhat slower rate. So profits are not going to be the catalyst here as they were last year. Last year, the S&P 500 had a better than 23 percent increase in profits. That's slowing down; it has to. The reason I'm comfortable with the environment here is that I see the economy slowing but not heading toward a recession. As a result, we don't have to fight the Federal Reserve, which always causes problems when it's in the mood to tighten."  <p>  <p>HARBOR CAPITAL APPRECIATION  <p> Net assets: $785.2 million <p>Median price-to-earnings ratio: 27.3 <p>Median earnings growth rate: 22.8% <p>Beta: 1.3 <p>Standard deviation: 3.6 <p>Top five holdings: Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Motorola, <a name="NASD:CSCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13494"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cisco Systems</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:LSI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13932"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>LSI Logic</b></a> <p>Best year: 1991, up 54.8%  <p>Worst year: 1990, down 1.8% <p>Manager tenure: 5 years <p>Minimum initial investment: $2,000 <p>Load: No load, no 12b-1 fee <p>Phone number: 800-422-1050 <p>

						In Michael Gerding's line of work, there's no substitute formiles traveled, questions asked, and numbers double-checked <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> This might not match your picture of a top-of-the-world international investor, but Michael Gerding works in Denver, carries his research reports in an Eddie Bauer satchel, and leaves the office whenever he can to go fly-fishing. He's handy with a fishing metaphor ("Not only do you have to be in the right creek," he notes about stock picking, "you have to know where to direct your fly.") and is generally as down-to-earth a guy as ever managed $200 million.  <p> On the other hand, Gerding does grill management at no fewer than 300 companies in at least ten countries every year. At age33 he is in his sixth year as manager of <a name="FUND:FWWGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FWWGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Founders Worldwide Growth Fund</b></a>, which through September 15 turned in a brisk 20 percent total return for 1995--"crushing," as Gerding notes, the benchmark Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index, which stood at 12 percent. Since Gerding took the reins in May of 1990, Founders Worldwide Growth has returned an annual average of 14.6 percent. Investors have rewarded this performance by pouring $100 million into the fund in 1995 alone.  <p> Gerding (who was profiled as an up-and-comer in last month's Worth) has a straightforward investing philosophy: It's the company, not the country, that matters. "A lot of funds are making conscious country bets, and we just don't do that," he says. He looks for companies whose earnings will grow faster than the earnings of other companies worldwide in that industry; faster than other companies within that country; and faster than the company's own price-to-earnings ratio. His particular affection is for "companies that are trying harder to be No. 1, because I want to grab an emerging brand name."   <p> He got one in Polygram, which he first noticed in 1986 while working as an international fund manager at a Dallas bank. The Dutch company (owned at the time by Philips, N.V.) was toiling away in the quiet waters of the music industry as a classical-music label. In late 1990, not long after coming to Founders Worldwide, Gerding put 1 percent of the fund's money into Polygram, which was then trading at around $20. Soon after, the company decided to update its image. It bought out the Motown and Island labels, then signed new artists such as the Cranberries. Today, Polygramis the No. 1 recording label in the world and trades at about $65.  <p> Gerding's international travels occupy up to two and a half months of his year. Wherever he goes, he behaves like a roving proletariat, eating at fast-food outlets, talking to locals, and all the while checking the country's local market for success stories.   <p> He also checks the government's stories, because he rarely trusts official numbers. A recent study by Credit Lyonnais supports him in this: The study found that statistics from foreign governments on their emerging economies are often a farrago of confusion.What's more, most governments don't adhere to a strict schedule of monthly or quarterly publication dates--in fact, they often release data that is a year old.  <p> A couple of classic examples of bad information have come from Mexico recently. In June 1994, the Mexican government claimed to have $17 billion in monetary reserves. By December it turned out the real figure was $6 billion--before the peso was so famously devalued and the economy so famously swooned. In the second quarter of 1995, Mexican officials were estimating gross domestic product would be down 5 percent. But Gerding remained skeptical, so he paid a trip to 30 firms in Mexico. "What the Mexican companies told me didn't jibe with what the government was saying," he says. "For example, we met with a retailer whose sales were down 15 percent from the month before. Those are monumental numbers. "Mexico's second quarter GDP was down 10.5 percent.  <p> When he visits a company, Gerding likes to see evidence that company officials have a lot personally at stake--that they'll feel it financially if the company's stock takes a hit. He expects investors in his fund to hold him to the same standard; half his money is in Worldwide Growth. "If it's good enough for shareholders," he says, "it's good enough for me."  <p> Like most managers, Gerding has had his share of investing nightmares. In 1991, he put about half of a percent of the assets of Worldwide Growth into Pollypeck, a British conglomerate that owned a host of businesses, including Delmonte Fruit. Pollypeck eventually filed for bankruptcy. "The Pollypeck stock just blew up," Gerding remembers with a groan. "As a fund manager, I hated the fact that I missed its problems. I felt I had done everything right and still got nailed big."   <p> Trying to do everything right takes a ton of work. Gerding begins his day at 6:30 in the morning, when he checks up on the world through Bridge Quote System and Bloomberg's news service. He then scours The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times, and spends an hour talking on the phone to a cabal of Wall Street brokers and analysts as well as stockpickers at Deutsche bank in Germany and CCF in France and even small local brokers in the countries he visits. He finishes off his day by rifling through as many as 50 research reports and interrogating his two research analysts for ideas.  <p> If investors are uneasy about Worldwide Growth, it's likely to be because of the relatively small number of stocks the fund holds and the relatively small market values of the stocks. Gerding does own some big name brands, including <a name="NASD:TOYOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41889"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toyota</b></a> and Nestle, but the fund's companies have a median market value of roughly $3 billion--about half the median for other global funds. And it holds just 70 stocks, not many for this field.  <p> So why should investors give him their money? He doesn't answer that challenge with a fishing metaphor. "Because we've proven ourselves," he says firmly. "It's been me, the same guy who's put the numbers on the board for the last five years. And it will be me, hopefully, running the fund for a long damn time." <p>  <p>FOUNDERS WORLDWIDE GROWTH  <p> Net assets: $201 million <p>Median price-to-earnings ratio: 27.6 <p>Median earnings growth rate: 22.9% <p>Beta: 1.0 <p>Standard deviation: 3.4 <p>Top five holdings: <a name="NYSE:NOK.A"></a><b>Nokia</b>, Wolters Kluwer, S.A.P.

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>ODDBALL FUNDS THAT MAKE SENSE<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Oddballs may be socially maladroit and sartorially bizarre, but when it comes to mutual funds, weird can be beautiful.<p>So-called oddball funds, whose performance doesn't correlate with U.S. markets and which fit no established category, can boost portfolio returns and lower risks. Professional portfolio managers recommend that investors diversify with one or two, but few do.<p>"If you lined up a thousand people and measured their portfolios, you would see a concentration in large-company growth funds and in bond funds," says Lynn Hopewell, an investment advisor who manages fund portfolios for individuals with the Monitor Group in Falls Church, Virginia.<p>Mike Kresh, a principal at the Medford, New York, firm Snyder Kresh Financial Services, says the vast majority of people who come into his office for the first time own "well-advertised, mainstream mutual funds that get a lot of attention in the press and are in the public eye." Kresh thinks most people don't take the time, or don't have the skill, to hunt for oddball gems. "Unless you're a fairly sophisticated investor," he says, "you won't look for four-leaf clovers."<p>Mainstream fund categories, of course, are the core of any sensible portfolio (see "A Good Word for the Class System"), and no fund, however singular, can insulate an investor from a severe market downturn. But placing up to 30 percent of a portfolio in three to five oddballs will smooth the road to respectable returns. And a mere 10 percent allocation in one or two such funds will improve the ten-year performance of most portfolios. <p>Oddballs spread risk because they don't closely track the widely watched stock, bond, and foreign market indexes that most funds resemble. "The Holy Grail of portfolio design is to find noncorrelated asset classes," says Hopewell. "If you have a fund that is not correlated with the other funds in a portfolio, it will squeeze the risk out of that portfolio."<p>We asked investment advisors to name their favorite oddballs--funds that over the next five years are likely to lower the risk of an investor's portfolio, add some return, or both. Here are their picks.<p><a name="FUND:GAMNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/GAMNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>GAM INTERNATIONAL</b></a><p>GAM International is almost certain to add a risk-return pattern unlike any other fund because it bears little resemblance even to other foreign-stock funds. The fund's charter could not be much less restrictive, requiring only that at least 65 percent of fund assets be placed in at least three countries. It must mainly buy foreign equities, but it can also move heavily into investment-grade foreign bonds. In fact, as of March 31, it invested 47 percent of its assets in bonds, 34 percent in cash, just 11 percent in stocks, and the rest in convertibles and other securities.<p>"The manager can go anywhere in the world looking for opportunities, and he has a track record for wandering into the right places," says Jeffrey Mortimer, vice president of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, investment advisory firm Higgins Associates.<p>GAM International manager John R. Horseman's contrarian tilt leads to big bets in unlikely places. He recently landed 31 percent of fund assets in German bonds, his analysis bucking the fears of many that a hike in interest rates would bash deutsche bonds. GAM has been right most of the time over the last decade, providing investors with a 23 percent average annual return over that period.<p>Not bad for a true oddball. Consider the fund's R2, a measure from 1 to 100 of how closely a fund correlates to a particular benchmark index. GAM's five-year average versus the Standard & Poor's 500 is a mere 6. Moreover, GAM International comes no closer than a 46 R2 to any foreign-stock index. The 337 foreign-stock funds tracked by Morningstar average an R2 of 76 against foreign- stock indexes.<p>Jeffrey Mortimer calls this fund an "aggressive oddball" and a "sleeper" because, despite its $286.9 million in assets as of June 30, "no one has ever heard of it." The fund is just right for a growth investor, says Mortimer, adding that its growing asset base and consistent performance ensure it won't remain anonymous much longer. <p>Not all of GAM's big bets have succeeded. After soaring 80 percent in 1993, the fund plunged 10 percent in 1994 before briskly rising 22 percent so far this year.<p><a name="FUND:CSRSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CSRSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>COHEN & STEERS REALTY SHARES </b></a> <p>Among real estate investment managers, the team of Martin Cohen and Robert Steers has a good reputation. But it's not just as a sector play that Cohen &Steers Realty Shares appeals to Eliot Williams of The Williams Investment Counselors, a Windsor, Connecticut, manager of fund portfolios for wealthy investors.<p>"Not only is real estate an independent asset class, but it's been on a downward drift in the last five years and has been reappraised in the marketplace, and it's now more fairly valued than it was ten years ago," says Williams. "So for diversification and return reasons, this fund is attractive for a portfolio." He believes Cohen & Steers would fit well with an income or growth portfolio.<p>The fund started in July 1991, but even with just four full years of performance data, its oddball status is evident. In 1992, it gained 20 percent, more than double the S&P 500, and it gained 18.8 percent in 1993--8.7 percentage points more than the S&P 500. In 1994, when 80 percent of the 4,764 stock and bond funds with track records for the full year lost money, Cohen & Steers gained 8.3 percent.<p>One caveat: Williams says that an investor should take a pass on this fund if more than 70 percent of his or her net worth is tied up in a residence and/or vacation home. These investors already have enough real estate exposure in their portfolios. <p><a name="FUND:VAITX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VAITX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>VANGUARD EMERGING MARKETS PORTFOLIO </b></a> <p>Emerging (also known on the Street as submerging) markets climbed 72 percent in 1993, according to Morningstar, but sharply rising interest rates in the U.S. induced investors to bring their money home. Then came the Mexican peso crisis, followed by the Japanese earthquake.<p>As liquidity evaporated, emerging-markets funds went on a year-and-a-half-long nosedive. The second largest fund in this category, the $1.4 billion Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund, plunged 18 percent last year and was down another 13.8 percent at one point earlier this year.<p>Still, Eliot Williams says owning an emerging-markets fund in the coming decade will bring diversification and growth to a portfolio. Investing exclusively in the developed world, Williams says, "is not enough."<p>"We will see above-average growth in emerging markets," predicts Williams, "and more and more institutional investors will be heading into these markets and recognizing their legitimacy over the next ten years."<p>Through the rest of the decade, less developed countries are expected to grow at twice the rate of developed countries, according to Vanguard International Equity Index Fund sales literature. This index fund buys a total of 300 stocks in 12 different LDCs, including Turkey, Mexico, Thailand, and Indonesia.<p>LDC economies are in different stages of development and are growing at different rates. So their stock markets don't move in sync with equity markets in developed countries or with one another.<p>"The stock markets of these countries over any short period of time are most influenced by flows of funds primarily from outsiders," Williams says. "Over the longer period, the fundamentals will win out, and the investment community will increasingly allocate modest amounts to these markets and lift their prices. For those who can tolerate some risk, it's attractive."<p>The Vanguard fund was basically flat for the 12 months ended May 31. But the fund only started up in May 1994, so its track record does not mean much. The 60 basis point expense ratio (a fee for management and operating costs) is less than a third of the average of its peer group, making it the cheapest way to play the emerging markets.<p><a name="FUND:MERFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MERFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MERGER FUND</b></a><p>The only mutual fund investing exclusively in deal stocks--corporate mergers, takeovers, and capital restructurings--Merger Fund would provide a good fit with an income-oriented or growth-stock portfolio.<p>After the terms of a takeover are announced, the share price of a takeover target often rises, but it usually trades below the price an acquirer proposes to pay, because of the chance the deal will fail. Merger Fund buys the target company before the deal is done. The strategy, known as risk arbitrage, exploits the difference between the deal price and the pre-takeover stock price.<p>The fund is a true oddball, with virtually no correlation with any of the 13 stock indexes against which Morningstar matches stock funds. Merger Fund has an R2 of 1 in relation to the S&P 500, one of the lowest of any of the 1,400 stock funds tracked by Morningstar.<p>As a result, Merger Fund has been only about half as volatile as the S&P 500 stock index over the last five years, according to data from Morningstar, but it has delivered 81 percent of the S&P's returns--an average of 9.8 percent annually. "It is extremely efficient," says Mortimer.<p><a name="FUND:FCVSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FCVSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>FIDELITY CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES FUND</b></a><p>Convertibles are a hybrid of stocks and bonds (see "Convertibles from the Top Down"). While their prices don't run in the opposite direction of stocks and bonds, they do behave differently and can smooth out a fund portfolio's returns.<p>Convertible securities return a higher dividend yield than growth stocks. According to Andre Ratkai, a chartered financial analyst in Denver managing about $20 million in fund portfolios, the dividends cushion a portfolio when the stock market drifts downward. "The fat dividend tends to limit downside risk," he says.<p>Convertibles are generally issued by small- and medium-sized growth companies. Firms of this size favor convertibles--securities that pay regular interest, like bonds--because they offer investors slightly lower interest rates, in return for which the convertibles can be converted into stock. This metamorphosis is triggered by a rising stock price. <p>Also, convertibles are unsecured debts--so they don't have to be paid back if the company happens to go belly-up, nor do they encumber a balance sheet. Investors are usually willing to pay for convertibility because it allows them to profit from a stock run-up, which is not a possibility with straight bonds.<p>The securities are usually most attractive when medium-sized and small companies are posting the largest share gains on the stock market. And that's where we've been most of the year.<p>Ratkai expects small-cap companies to outperform blue chips over the next five years because they remain cheap by historical standards. Since 1961, whenever the price-to-earnings ratio on the <a name="FUND:PRSVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund</b></a>, a small-cap stock fund, has grown to double the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 index of blue chips, large companies have begun to outperform small ones. Right now, Ratkai says, the price-to-earnings level on the New Horizons fund versus the S&P 500 is about 1.3 to 1--up from a low of about 1 to 1 in 1990. So the small caps still have a long way to go in their cycle versus the large caps.<p>A portfolio holding equal investments in the Vanguard Index 500 (which mimics the S&P 500), the Vanguard Index Small Capitalization Stock Fund, and the Vanguard International Equity Fund for the last five years has a five-year standard deviation (a measure of a fund's volatility) of 12.1 and a 10.4 percent average annual return. Add the Fidelity Convertible Securities Fund to the portfolio and put 25 percent of the assets in the four funds, and the portfolio's standard deviation falls to 11.2 percent and its annual average returns rise to 11 percent.<p>
A GOOD WORD FOR THE CLASS SYSTEM STYLE
Oddball funds should supplement, but not replace, the portfolio diversity gained by dividing fund holdings among six basic asset classes<p>Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that portfolio diversification--spreading bets across a broad spectrum of stock and bond mutual funds--is the most prudent and efficient investment strategy.<p>Stock funds fall into five categories: large-growth companies, small-growth companies, large undervalued companies, small undervalued companies, and foreign stocks. The sixth class of assets is bond funds. Most advisors recommend short-term bond funds because short-term bonds usually hold up well during downturns in the stock market, buffering the volatility of the stock funds.<p>"Once you get these different asset classes in your portfolio, you get some real diversification," says Lynn Hopewell. Going beyond the basics and adding oddball funds is likely to cut risk and boost long-term returns still more.<p>While portfolio diversification means giving up on trying to handicap which market will go up or down the most in any given time span, it lowers the chances of a loss and smooths out overall returns.   --A.G.<p>
ODDBALL DEMO<p>Jeffrey Mortimer, vice president of Higgins Associates, constructed a $100,000 portfolio using GAM International to illustrate how oddballs can help a fund investor. A growth investor who five years ago invested 50 percent of his money in T. Rowe Price Equity-Income Fund, 25 percent in <a name="FUND:BRWIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BRWIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Brandywine Fund</b></a>, and 25 percent in <a name="FUND:MUTHX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MUTHX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mutual Shares Fund</b></a> would have had an average annual return of 13.6 percent and a standard deviation of 10.48 (standard deviation measures a fund's volatility based on its historical returns).<p>However, if that investor took $25,000 from the low-risk T. Rowe Price Equity-Income Fund and invested it in the more volatile GAM International, the portfolio's standard deviation drops to 10.43 and the average annual return rises more than a percentage point, to 14.8 percent. Interestingly, GAM International's standard deviation is higher than any of the other three funds in the portfolio, but adding it lowers the portfolio's overall standard deviation.<p>The fund carries a fairly steep 5 percent load, but it may be available as a no-load through institutions that make investments of $500,000 or more. Mortimer suggests looking into placing it in a tax-deferred retirement account because of its history of generating large capital gains. The fund gets a five-star rating from Morningstar.   --A.G.<p><p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> BIRTH OF A FUND <p>John Wakeman was sharp enough, at age 31, to be given control of  
a risky new fund. and he's realistic enough, at age 32, to know he can't relax for a minute.   <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald   <p> "I come to work scared every day," says John Wakeman, a man with 26 million reasons to feel exactly that way.  <p> Twenty-six million and counting. Obsessively. A year ago Wakeman was an equity analyst at the Baltimore-based mutual fund company T. Rowe Price. Now, at 32, he's the manager of Price's seven-month-old <a name="FUND:PRCOX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRCOX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Capital Opportunity Fund</b></a>. Last November he took control of $2 million in Price seed money. As of late April, he had attracted and earned another $24 million. The net asset value, or price per share, of his fund had risen 19 percent. He's hot. So of course he's scared.  <p> T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity is one of 1,844 mutual funds born last year, and history confirms the suspicion that not all of them can make it. Wakeman knows that his fast start is no kind of guarantee. His bosses know it, too. And, though they might prefer not to believe it, so do his investors. Here's the story of how one young manager got his fund started which is very much the story of how he intends to keep it going.  <p> John Wakeman was on the right bus at the right time. It was October 1993, and the bus was headed toward a gaming conference in Las Vegas. Wakeman's seat mate was Jack Laporte, president of T. Rowe Price's equity division and manager of its <a name="FUND:PRNHX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRNHX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New Horizons Fund</b></a>. At the time, Wakeman, a frenetic, obsessive worker with a face and voice like a young Andy Rooney, was primarily an analyst specializing in the leisure industry. But he was also managing a $5 million private account for T. Rowe Price, and making a bit of a reputation doing it.  <p> Wakeman realized it wasn't every day a lowly analyst has a senior company official, one who can sanction new fund ideas, trapped on a bus. He quickly made his pitch. "I said to Jack, A concentrated stock-picking fund seems like a good idea,' " Wakeman says. "I've been managing one like it for over a year now. We've always talked about an aggressive-growth fund that would leverage all of our research capabilities. What do you think of a mutual fund that would capture the best ideas of all of our funds?' "  <p> Laporte said simply, "Let's do it."  <p> That didn't exactly mean "Let's do it," but it did mean Wakeman and his idea would be taken seriously. T. Rowe Price is the fifth largest no-load fund company and the 14th largest fund company overall, with about 1.5 million shareholders and $57.8 billion under management in 71 funds. Its retirement-plan clientele prefers no-load funds, and management values above all the company's reputation for a cautious, no-baloney approach to investing. "We don't want fad funds," growls George Collins, T. Rowe Price's chief executive officer.  <p> But T. Rowe Price is also a company in which a young man with a good track record and a strong idea can get a hearing. Since Collins, a former air-force commander and semi-pro baseball catcher, took over the company in 1984, he has been at pains to ensure that. "We don't have a single strategist or investment guru who sets the pace for management of the funds," Collins says. "We don't want a lot of sameness thinking."  <p> Fund ideas float up from all quarters of the company. One of Collins's early moves was to dump the formal committee that approved new funds. Back then, the company may have gotten one idea out in five years. Collins put into place an informal but powerful executive committee comprising four like-minded people. They met, and still meet, twice a week to talk about new fund ideas."We don't use macroeconomic, scientific analysis," says Collins. "Today, the approval process for new funds has a much shorter turnaround time." Since Collins took over, T. Rowe Price has introduced 60 new funds.  <p>  <p>Six months after his bus ride with Jack Laporte, Wakeman received approval to write a formal proposal for the fund. How did the company conclude that its young analyst, who joined the company straight out of the University of Wisconsin business school and had never even seen a bear market, was qualified to become a manager? "Wakeman won it because he proved to us he could pick stocks as a research analyst," says James Kennedy, T. Rowe Price's chief equity research director.  <p> Company records show that from mid-1990 to mid-1993, Wakeman's buy and sell recommendations outperformed the indexes for the industry groups he researched by an average of 7 percentage points. Over that three-year period, Wakeman earned well over $100 million for the T. Rowe Price mutual fund shareholders. He was also 
the No. 1 research analyst three years straight for an in-house mock equity fund. Finally, Wakeman had served on the advisory committee of three very successful equity funds.  <p> Wakeman's first act as manager-designee was to write a memo to Ken Rutherford, assistant director of investment services, proposing a fund that would take large, aggressive positions in stocks. He wanted to invest in just 30 to 50 stocks quite a bit fewer than most equity-fund managers carry. "Warren Buffet towns just nine stocks," Wakeman says. "I really want to dig into ideas, get my hands around them, and own them big. I can't dig into and know 100 stocks."  <p> T. Rowe Price policy dictates that every proposed new fund meet three criteria: It must have investment merit; the company must have the expertise to manage it; and it must benefit both shareholders and the company. In early September, the management committee concluded that the fund described in Wakeman's memo met these standards. The proposal was approved.  <p> In mid-September, Rutherford, along with company lawyers, members of the marketing department, and a team of copywriters, quizzed Wakeman on his vision of the fund what its holdings would be, how aggressive it would be. Then Rutherford and Wakeman huddled with communications director Jane White to write the prospectus, the document that contains federally required disclosure information about the fund.   <p> The prospectus, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the end of September, said the Capital Opportunity Fund would require the standard T. Rowe minimum $2,500 initial investment and carry no load. It could invest up to 10 percent of its assets in derivatives and up to 20 percent in foreign securities. Most of the rest would go toward domestic growth and value stocks. Investors would read on nearly every page that the fund was highly risky.  <p> Meanwhile, Rutherford and Ronae Brock, the company's marketing manager for equity funds, roughed out a marketing plan, deciding the key selling point would be flexibility, "that [the fund] can invest in any industry, any size company, foreign or domestic, "says Rutherford. The SEC gave its approval in mid-November, and the fund was launched on November 30, with T. Rowe Price's standard $2 million in seed money from company coffers.   <p> T. Rowe Price began stuffing advertising supplements touting the new offering into shareholder statement mailings. The company then placed advertisements in niche magazines such as Better Investing and Personal Investing News, as well as mainstream financial magazines and newspapers. Brock hired a direct-mail broker in Atlanta to send the offering to the 170,000 readers of the magazine Individual Investor and the 16,000 readers of Today's Investor. The cost for the entire launch came to roughly$150,000 to $200,000, low by industry standards but about average for T. Rowe Price.  <p> Then they waited. Was anybody out there?  <p>  <p>At first it was hard to tell. By the end of 1994, just 50 investors had plunked down a total of $400,000 into the fund. Then there turn began to raise the fund's profile, and Capital Opportunity took off. By March 17, Wakeman's fund had $20 million in assets and 2,233 investors with more than half of the fund's assets coming from other T. Rowe Price funds. The average account size was $9,000. Clearly, investors were chasing after the fund's early return. The return is chasing John Wakeman.  <p> On a typical day, Wakeman arrives at his office at 6:30 a.m. to scour five newspapers. He then skims the Dow Jones and Bloomberg databases on his computer, plus between 25 and 50 research reports on the company's electronic "bluesheet," a Lotus program that carries in-house and Wall Street research reports. "I also get calls from <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> and Goldman Sachs analysts who are touting a certain stock," he says. Wakeman spends seven to ten days each month visiting companies and attending conferences or trade shows. Executives from five to ten companies a day visit T. Rowe Price headquarters to tout their firms' virtues.  <p> Wakeman is emphatic about what moves him as an investor. He is biased, he says, "toward a management team that has experience and a track record, which I find out about from the company's proxy statements, 10k's, and annual reports. I want to know everything about their ownership. And I definitely want their incentive and compensation structures, which includes options, stock ownership, salary, and bonuses, tied to the company's cash flow and earnings. If they screw it up, I want to know, do they get hurt, too?" <p> The final weapon at his disposal is his colleagues. Wakeman spends three to four hours a day talking to other fund managers. He regularly badgers Price's 26 research analysts for ideas. His old department, he says, is nothing less than a "gold mine." <p> Gold mines do have their risks. The department recently directed him toward, and then steered him away from, a catastrophic stock pick: <a name="NYSE:EX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16278"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Exide Corp.</b></a>, a Michigan company founded by Thomas Edison that makes and sells batteries for cars and boats worldwide. The stock had been a Wall Street favorite since going public in late 1993, and it shot from $20 per share to $56 by year-end1994. Near the end of January 1995, when the stock dipped to $48, an analyst brought the stock to Wakeman's attention and suggested he take a look. Wakeman started researching it. But another analyst, William Stromberg, talked Wakeman out of the stock in early March. Stromberg warned that the company could have earnings problems because of the warm weather being experienced throughout the Northeast.  <p> Stromberg was right: North America had the second warmest winter on record, and Europe experienced its warmest winter in 400 years. Batteries weren't dying, customers weren't buying, and Exide's earnings fell below expectations. "Now it could lose a lot of money, and I may buy it when it settles in the $30 range," Wakeman says.  <p> Wakeman's best pick so far has been <a name="NASD:ADBE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12518"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Adobe Systems</b></a>, a Silicon Valley graphics software company that he bought at $30 in December. "The stock looked cheap to us," Wakeman says. "At that time, it was selling at 17 times earnings, which is not expensive for technology stocks, which usually sell at 20 times earnings."By late April the stock was trading at $50.  <p> Wakeman has needed the success with Adobe to balance his worst pick: retailer <a name="NYSE:DH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10440"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dayton Hudson</b></a>. In early January, Wakeman invested $850,000 in the company. "But Christmas was bad," he says, shaking his head. "And the first quarter went soft again because consumer spending was down." By mid-March, Dayton Hudson had fallen off its perch in the low 80s to settle in the high 60s.  <p> It was a crucible for Wakeman; he literally wrings his hands as he describes it. "I thought at first, managing a fund is going to be great when it's working well," he says. "But when the big stocks blow up, how will I deal with it? Managing a new fund sounds really neat on paper, but once I get in the real world, how am I going to do?"  <p> He won't, he hopes, give in to what he knows is his biggest flaw as an investor. "I tend to overanalyze," he says. "Fund managers, like everyone else, now face information overload, and analysis can lead to paralysis. Sometimes I sit here and look at information about a stock and don't move on it." Last December, for example, Wakeman missed out on the <a name="NASD:APOL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apollo Group</b></a>, an online education and testing service that was trading at $12. Since he wanted more information on it, he never got around to buying it. "It went to $25 in my face within three months," he recalls with a grimace. "Good move, John."   <p>  <p>Wakeman routinely returns home around 8 p.m. after a last round of debates with his fellow fund managers. Then he works a couple hours more. "We're not well diversified in our personal life," he says with a smile.  <p> To wind down, Wakeman listens to the BBC and Radio Free Europe on one of his four shortwave radios. He also keeps a police scanner in his office so he can listen to the police and fire frequencies. "He's naturally curious," says his wife, Barbara, who's 28 and works in T. Rowe Price's institutional client-services division. "He's an information junkie." "Obviously it's one of those quality versus quantity issues," he says. "But she's used to it, she puts up with it."  <p> "I understand it," says Barbara. "Since I'm involved in the industry, and I don't expect him at home more often."  <p> It's an odd life John Wakeman has earned for himself. Ethical issues are never far from his mind. "In this business ethics slide by," he says. "That frustrates me, because I have pretty high morals." But ultimately, he's a fund manager, he'll consider himself a success in life if he makes a ton of money. T. Rowe Price doesn't have superstar managers, and there's probably no place for one in the corporate culture but what would George Collins want John Wakeman to strive for other than to get rich?" I want to have a billion-dollar fund," Wakeman says. "There are very few managers that manage billion-dollar products. If I build a big fund, it would be a win-win for everybody, both T. Rowe Price and the shareholder."  <p> He knows he'll have to get tougher. New funds at T. Rowe Price don't get prefer ential allocations of rising stocks and hot new issues, but Wakeman says he knows he's competing against funds that do. One small-cap fund manager told Wakeman at an institutional conference in 1990 that he was up 180 percent, "which was four times what any other fund was doing, because he packed his fund with every IPO the company got a hold of in a three-year period." <p> "A lot of these fund managers are athletes," Wakeman says. "Now that they're too old and out of shape, they're taking that aggression and they're trying to beat each other picking stocks. Instead of looking up box scores, they'll pull up each other's net asset values every night in the paper."  <p> Wakeman is still getting used to his higher profile. And to the amount of money his own and especially other people's he has put on the line. "When my fund's NAV started showing up in The Wall Street Journal's mutual fund tables in March, that's when it hit me," he says, his voice nervously breaking. "I said to myself, There it is, John, this is the real world.' Everyday I can only think of this page. I tell everyone, if you don't love the intensity and competition, get out, because it will bury you."   <p>  <p>Once a fund is started at T. Rowe Price, company chieftains leave portfolio managers alone. "Each manager is an entrepreneur, and we expect them to perform," says James Kennedy. "Wakeman's the guy who's running it daily. I'm not going to tell him he can or can't do a certain trade." However, each and every trade is broadcast daily on the T. Rowe Price computer network, so the four-person executive committee can watch Wakeman's trades closely. If they don't like his picks, the committee "plays devil's advocate with him," says Kennedy, a committee member. "We'll go in and debate his ideas."  <p> Collins and the management committee will exert more control on a fund, or even yank the fund manager, for any one of three key reasons: if a fund's performance starts to slip, if the investing patterns go haywire, or if the manager strays too far from the fund's charter. "We are religious about staying with the charter of our funds," says Kennedy.   <p> At their annual evaluation, fund managers must answer three questions. First, how did they help clients make money? Second, how did they help the company make money? And third, because the company strongly values collegiality, which other funds did they help? "If I see one idea goes into one fund but didn't go into more portfolios, I'll bring it up in their evaluations," says Kennedy. If the fund managers have slipped in any of these three key areas, their bonuses will be docked by up to 30 percent. <p> So far, Collins and other Price executives have kept mum about Wakeman's performance, but he knows he's being watched. "I think they're happy it's off to a good start, but they realize it's an aggressive product," he says. "There's not a lot of fanfare. I would expect to hear nothing from them, because they told me what to do and I'm going to do it. We're not out there high-fiving each other."  <p> The job is changing too much for that. Wakeman is now learning how to invest a lot of money a different job from investing relatively little. "When small funds start, you tend to put your best ideas in there first because you want it to work well," Wakeman says."As the fund gets larger, it's not as mobile and flexible. Now I may only need to buy 1,000 shares. As the fund gets larger, I'll need to buy 30,000, which is hard to find from any company." <p> It used to be a custom at T. Rowe Price to break out a cake whenever a fund passed $100 million in asset size. So far, 40 funds have surpassed that mark, but lately the cake knife has been stashed management now waits for their funds to hit $150 million. Wakeman can't wait to eat his slice. "I'm always nervous," he says. "How can I not be? My wife says I should celebrate everyday I have a good day. But it's so hard to enjoy the highs because the lows are very, very low. I worry for the investors. Hopefully, in a couple years, I'll really take care of them."   <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - -   <p> they grow up fast <p>The ten fastest-starting mutual funds of the 1990s  <p> Fund   Date of  Assets after  Current Description <p>   launch first year  assets*  <p>   <p> <a name="FUND:FDEGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FDEGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity</b></a>  12/28/90 $724.3 $700.7 Large- & small-Emerging Growth     cap U.S.growth         companies    <p><a name="FUND:PRARX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRARX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T.

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Cover  <p> NEW FUND MANIA! <p>Investors now have more than 7,500 mutual funds to choose from. Every day, several new ones are created. Is the fund industry picking up speed or running off the rails?   <p> By Manjeet Kripalani  <p> Financial maternity wards are full up these days. In the last 12 months, they've been delivering new mutual funds at the rate of three and a half a day. There were 1,844 newborns last year, up from 1,405 in 1993.  <p> Nearly one in three American investors now owns at least one mutual fund, creating an enormous and still-growing pot of gold, one worth $2.3 trillion based on the assets currently under management. The start-ups, of course, need capture only a tiny share of this pot to succeed.  <p> The new offerings aren't coming just from Fidelity, Vanguard, and the other industry powerhouses. Regulatory changes and the advent of discount brokerages in the mold of <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab & Co.</b></a> have simplified the registration, approval, and marketing process, making it easier for everyone, banks, insurance companies,financial advisors, exportfolio managers to invent their own funds. There are now more than 550 companies in the business. <p> Among the big fund families, determined both to maintain dominance by increasing their assets and to retain existing clients, new funds often represent attempts to create an exclusive investment niche or to ensure that the competition doesn't have one. A 1994 Goldman, Sachs study on the mutual fund industry reports that the number of fund categories had increased 50 percent in the prior eight years. This has only encouraged the creation of new funds, as a single successful idea is likely to trigger a flood of copycats. More than 120 new asset-allocation funds, for instance, followed Fidelity's launch of the first such fund in 1988.  <p> As of the end of March, the number of U.S. funds stood at 7,631, of which 4,783 were started in the first half of the 1990s, according to Lipper Analytical Services. The market is crowded and competitive, yet there appears to be no end in sight.  <p> These days, says Jeffrey Nachman, a vice president at  Dreyfus, a fund family has no choice other than to be a "financial supermarket" to satisfy the customer.  <p> When it comes to marketing and promoting new funds, deep-pocketed outfits like Fidelity, Dreyfus, and Vanguard enjoy a huge advantage over their smaller rivals. They have higher name recognition, more credibility, and clout with brokers, who earn commissions from selling big funds' products. And they spare no expense. <p> According to Lou Harvey of Dalbar, Inc., a Boston-based research firm specializing in financial services, to create the legal entity, including federal and state registration and legal fees, it costs a relatively modest $250,000. The big money is spent over months or several years on phone banks, direct mail, online notices, newspaper advertisements, and marketing to brokerages. These costs, says Harvey, can run anywhere from $2 million to $5 million per launch, sometimes more for industry leaders. <p> Smaller companies and stand-alone funds may spend as little as $150,000 to create a fund, with perhaps another $100,000 to set up the basic infrastructure for operating it, says Arthur Don, an attorney at the Chicago firm of D'Ancona & Pflaum, which advises new funds. Small operations also try to carve out clearly defined niches, especially ones the big fund families might ignore. The <a name="FUND:PARNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PARNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Parnassus Fund</b></a>, founded by Jerome Dodson in 1985 to invest in socially responsible companies, such as <a name="NYSE:CUM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10423"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cummins Engine</b></a>, <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:IAD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10786"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Inland Steel</b></a>, is one notable example.  <p> Rather than advertise in pricey national financial publications, Dodson says, he invested $6,000 in a page in an environmental magazine. As of March 31, his fund had average annual returns of 18.5 percent for the past five years, compared with 11.4 percent for the S&P and 11.0 for the average growth fund. It has $208 million under management.  <p> Another case in point: Donald Yacktman, formerly manager of Kemper Securities' <a name="FUND:SLASX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SLASX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Selected American Shares</b></a> fund, started the no-load equity growth <a name="FUND:YACKX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/YACKX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Yacktman Fund</b></a> in 1992 with $150,000. Today it has about $550 million under management.  <p> "We spent peanuts," Yacktman says. "A few thousand for access to a public relations wire service, $10,000 on printing prospectuses, $30,000 on lawyers' fees."   <p> Yacktman succeeded where many have failed because, he believes, the manager sells the fund. "It's the person at the throttle," he says. Yacktman, named 1991 Portfolio Manager of the Year by Morningstar, Inc., also received good notices in the financial press. That prominence helped pull in $29 million in the first two months.   <p> To survive in this game, small operations like Yacktman's need $30 million to $40 million in the first year to be viable. According to last year's Goldman Sachs report, a new fund from a large family must hold assets of $75 million to $125 million on an ongoing basis to break even. Typically, if it doesn't reach that level in three to five years, it will be merged into an established fund.   <p> One reason start-up costs vary wildly is that every fund family goes about it in a different way. Some firms incubate funds, pilot-testing their ideas for six months to two years before their debut. Incubation, done only with equity funds, is intended to minimize failures and create a track record, making the fund easier to sell.  <p> Incubating funds invest only between $100,000 and $1 million, but they are the genuine article, registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those that do well are brought into the world; those that don't, never see the light of day.  <p> Putnam and Fidelity incubate their funds, and the practice has worked well for them, but only a big firm can afford to do it. Incubation has helped popularize a form of computer modeling called back-testing.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>RUNNING THE RIGHTS FUND RISKS<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Even if you invest in good mutual funds, you don't necessarily have a good mutual fund portfolio. Consider two investors. One made equal investments in <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity Magellan</b></a>, <a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund</b></a>, <a name="FUND:PVOYX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PVOYX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Putnam Voyager</b></a>, and <a name="FUND:TEMWX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/TEMWX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Templeton World</b></a>--well-known funds rated between three and five stars by Morningstar Mutual Funds and three and five $'s by Worth. The portfolio gained an average of 8.24 percent annually over the five-year period ended December 31, 1994, while taking slightly more risk than the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, which rose an annual average 8.69 percent over the same period. <p>Our other investor bought equal amounts in several smaller funds: American Capital Emerging Growth, <a name="FUND:MERFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MERFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merger Fund</b></a>, <a name="FUND:PEQUX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PEQUX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Putnam Global Growth</b></a>, and <a name="FUND:FDESX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FDESX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity Destiny I</b></a>. This portfolio took less risk than the S&P 500 but gained an average 8.74 percent annually over the same period.<p>How could one portfolio take less risk than another yet produce a higher return? The answer: Diversification. If some funds zig when the others zag, the whole portfolio can be less risky than any of the parts.<p>That's the central idea behind Modern Portfolio Theory, regarded as among 20th-century finance's most important analytical tools. While MPT relies on mathematical formulas, you don't need to know calculus to understand and apply its basic concepts. MPT statistics on 1,300 funds are listed in Morningstar's reports, which can be found in most libraries.<p>MPT grew out of a notion put forward in a 1952 doctoral dissertation by Harry M. Markowitz, a 25-year-old graduate student at the University of Chicago. Markowitz, who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1990 with William F. Sharpe and Merton H. Miller, showed that you could quantify risk as an element in returns and that diversifying lowers risk.<p>Risk can be measured in any number of ways. One of them is called beta (one measure used to assess the relative risks of the two portfolios above). It shows a security's volatility relative to the market. Historically, a fund with a beta of 1 goes up and down in concert with the Standard & Poor's 500. A fund that has a beta of 0.5 can be expected to go up or down, in percentage terms, half as much as the S&P 500. In our opening example, the fund portfolio that gained 8.24 percent a year had a beta of 1.08, while the more diverse portfolio that gained 8.74 percent had a beta of 0.89.<p>The four funds in the higher-risk portfolio are too much like the S&P 500, which means a lack of diversity. One clue to this was that the betas of the funds--ranging from 0.94 to 1.31, three of them within 10 percent of the S&P beta of 1--are too close to the index. The betas on the lower-risk portfolio range from 0.21 to 1.36, and none are within 10 percent of the S&P 500 beta. But beta spreads, while useful for assessing a portfolio, aren't reasonable measures of diversity. <p>"The only way you get diversification is by buying classes of assets that have good performance and bad performance at similar times," says Edwin Elton of New York University's Stern School of Business and the co-author of Modern Portfolio Theory and Investment Analysis. Elton says a diversified fund portfolio can be created by investing in each of six basic asset classes. Stock funds fall into five classes: growth, value, large capitalization, small capitalization, and international. All bond funds, excluding those investing in high-yield, or junk, issues produce the same diversification in a portfolio, so Elton considers them a single asset class.<p>How much an investor allocates to each asset class depends a lot on age and risk tolerance, Elton says. Investors in their early 20s should overweight toward more volatile growth-stock funds. Someone 10 years from retirement should start shifting an additional 10 percent or 20 percent of fund assets into less volatile, income-producing bond funds. "Fine-tuning diversification isn't nearly as important as having diversification," says Elton.<p>So how does the average investor know which funds belong to what asset class? To create the low-risk portfolio that gained 8.74 percent annually versus the 8.69 percent on the S&P 500, money manager Jeffrey Mortimer of Higgins Associates in Cambridge, Massachusetts, began by scouring Morningstar data for an MPT statistic known as R2. "R2 is a good tool for making sure you have investments in different asset classes," he says.<p>R2 shows what percentage of a fund's return is explained by movements in a market index. For instance, Fidelity Magellan has a 90.61 R2 in relation to the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, according to Morningstar data. That means the index explains 90 percent of Magellan's returns. <p>Magellan, Voyager, Janus, and Templeton World all have high R2 versus the S&P 500, compared with other funds in their asset clases, and that was this portfolio's shortcoming. It had too many eggs in one basket. So Mortimer, whose firm manages $150 million in mutual fund portfolios, found funds with the highest R2 against indexes other than the S&P 500.<p>Morningstar now compares every stock fund it rates with 13 different market indexes--plus the S&P 500. The index against which a fund has the highest R2 is the "best fit" index. For instance, Putnam Global Growth has just a 33 R2 versus the S&P 500, but its R2 is 85 versus the <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a> Europe Australia Southeast Asia index.<p>Investing in funds with the highest R2 to different indexes gives an investor purer plays on different asset classes, which makes the portfolio more efficient from a risk-reward standpoint. Morningstar's best-fit indexes unfortunately don't offer direct proxies for two of Elton's classes--value and growth equity funds. To find a reliable substitute for value, Mortimer's firm searches for equity income funds whose investing style is highlighted in the "value" section of Morningstar's "style box." Similarly, he looks for funds with an aggressive-growth or growth objective and then refers to the style box to make sure the growth section is highlighted.<p>To pick the best fund in each asset class, you still must analyze consistency of return, investing style, expenses, turnover, and all the other factors underlying a fund's performance. But you can make decisions easier by using the simple technique explained in "Plotting Out Your Risks and Rewards." It gives a good indication of how efficient a fund is at balancing risk and reward. <p>As a proxy for risk, use your fund's standard deviation, a measure of risk that can be used with any kind of fund, from equity to fixed income. That's because unlike beta, it measures fund volatility not against a market index, but against the fund's own performance history. <p>Standard deviation shows how much a fund's returns vary from its average return; a high standard deviation equals high volatility. The riskier of our two model portfolios had the much higher standard deviation. <p>Statistically, a fund's return will come in above or below its standard deviation 68 percent of the time. Doubling a fund's standard deviation shows the range of returns that can be expected from that fund 95 percent of the time. <p>An example: <a name="FUND:PTNAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PTNAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PIMCO Total Return Fund</b></a>-Institutional Shares, which is rated five stars by Morningstar, has a three-year average annual return of 7.19 percent and a standard deviation of 4.41 percent. So 95 percent of the time, this fund's annual return should range from a loss of 1.63 percent to a 16.01 percent profit. Used judiciously, MPT techniques are an important tool in achieving diversification, the biggest piece in the investment jigsaw puzzle. <p>---------------------------------------<p>PLOTTING OUT YOUR RISKS AND REWARDS<p>Are your funds performing as well as they should? Arnold Langsen, a retired professor of finance at University of California at Hayward and the editor of Prudence and Performance Newsletter in Danville, California, says individual investors can find out by gauging the risk and return of a group of funds by plotting them on a scattergram. <p>A pencil, a sheet of graph paper, a ruler, and the readily available Morningstar mutual fund statistics are all you need to plot your own scattergram and get a visual representation of the relative efficiency of your group of funds in balancing risks and rewards. First, look up your funds' three-year average annual returns in Morningstar Mutual Funds. Also jot down the funds' standard deviation. Next, on a piece of graph paper, draw a horizontal and a vertical axis. Mark them off as shown at right, extending both axes as far as necessary to accommodate your funds. Then, draw a vertical axis and mark off every five boxes from zero to 40. Mark the vertical axis "annual returns," and the horizontal axis "standard deviation." Plot each of the funds you own.<p>The result may surprise you. "What people often find when they do this exercise is that they're investing in two funds with the same objective and style, but one of them is taking half the risk to get the same returns," says Langsen.<p><a name="FUND:VFINX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VFINX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>The Vanguard Index 500 fund</b></a>, with a three-year average annual return of 8.61 percent through February 28, 1995, and a standard deviation of 8.10, is our benchmark, or "bogey," as it closely tracks the action of the Standard & Poor's 500. When comparing a group of funds with the same investment objective, you may also want to plot the return and standard deviation of the average fund within that sector of funds. These numbers are also in Morningstar.<p>Of the five growth and income funds charted here, it's clear that Paine Webber Dividend Growth A, which gained an average 0.9 percent annually over the past three years, has not adequately rewarded investors for their risks compared with the Vanguard Index 500, which gained 8.61 percent annually while running less risk than the PaineWebber fund. Another revealing observation: <a name="FUND:GATEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/GATEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gateway Index Plus</b></a>, an index fund that hedges risk with stock options, took roughly half the risk of the Vanguard Index 500 over the past three years but posted an average gain just 1.79 percent less.<p>Whether an investment in <a name="FUND:BEGRX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BEGRX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mutual Beacon</b></a> or <a name="FUND:MSIGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MSIGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oppenheimer Main Street Income and Growth A</b></a> is more efficent is a little more difficult to visualize. Oppenheimer Main Street has gotten higher returns but has taken more than twice the risk. Since the winner of this matchup is hard to see, simply divide a fund's return by its standard deviation to find its risk/reward ratio. Mutual Beacon has a 2.56 risk/reward ratio, far better than Oppenheimer Main Street's 1.35. This is a simplified version of an MPT statistic known as a Sharpe ratio. <p><p><p>

With so many mutual funds to choose from, it can be tough to decide which are best for you. That's why Worth screened a total of 777 funds to compile our annual performance ratings for Novembers cover story. Our report tells you which funds came out on top.<p>---------------<br>
<br>
Introduction<br>

By John Koten<p>Jonathan Swift once observed that "There is nothing in this world constant, but inconstancy." This view will draw few arguments from mutual fund investors in 1994. Jostled by a jittery market, the value of the average stock fund has risen, fallen, and then jumped back up again. Unsettling, to say the least. But the gyrations are likely to continue, as we've pointed out more than once in Worth. Now more than ever, investors need to make wise choices. <p>This guide should help. We begin by examining the risks inherent in today's market -- and then show what you can do to make sure your funds are reasonably safe. (See "Best Funds: The Forecast For Risk" further down in this file.)<p>Next, we explain how not to pick mutual funds (by relying solely on past-performance numbers). (See "Best Funds: Why Past Isn't Prologue" further down in this file.)<p>We also take you through the methodology we use to evaluate funds -- a breakthrough system that looks at risk level, performance against a benchmark, and an entirely new measurement that focuses on predictability. (See "Best Funds: How We Picked Them" further down in this file.)<p>Information on our top five choices (see "Best Funds: Best Of The Best - LIST") and a list of 47 funds that received our $$$$$ rating (see "Best Funds: Top-Rated Funds - LIST") complete our package.

Equity funds may actually be safer investments now than they were a few years ago. Still, it  pays to know the signs of danger.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>A decade of enviable returns in stock funds lulled many investors into believing there was only one risk associated with these investments -- the risk of being left behind. Who could chance missing out on the stellar performance these funds were sure to provide? By contrast, the microscopic yields of money market funds and certificates of deposit appeared a much greater threat to capital formation. <p>Not anymore. As investors in bond funds and aggressive stock funds found out earlier this year, risks are very much evident in mutual funds. Declining net asset values have prompted previously complacent investors to wonder: What are the risks inherent in my stock mutual fund? Are there hidden perils lurking in my equity-fund holdings? Do stock funds carry greater or fewer risks today than they did five years ago?<p>Contrary to the shrill stories that have appeared recently in the press about mounting risks in mutual funds, equity funds are probably safer now than they were five years ago. One reason: Most highflying stocks have had their wings clipped this year, reducing most funds' exposure to overvalued securities. Managers who still own and believe in these stocks have been able to buy more shares cheaper, reducing average costs of ownership. <p>A second reason: Although the major market averages have been adrift, corporate earnings have escalated. This means most funds now hold stocks with slightly lower price-to-earnings ratios, making them less risky than before.<p>Third, equity funds are more diversified today. Robert Markman, a Minneapolis money manager who advises clients on mutual funds, says, "Funds went into international investing, which, if anything, reduced risk." <p>Equity-fund investors worried about potential time bombs in their portfolios should keep in mind, too, that most of this year's hair-raising fund losses were recorded in bond, not stock, funds. Although it might seem a good assumption that greater risks in bond-fund portfolios mean similarly higher risks in stock funds, this simply isn't true. <p>What decimated many bond funds was a reliance on exotic fixed-income securities -- hatched by Wall Street wizards -- known as derivatives. When interest rates rose, this exotica was almost impossible to get out of and even harder to value. Some bond funds are still sitting with their derivative holdings, waiting for the market to come back. They could be waiting for some time.<p>Equity-fund managers, however, don't need to stoop to such tactics. In their game, stock-picking prowess alone can vault a manager to the top of the class. "Derivatives are strictly on the bond side," says Jonathan Teall of Lipper Analytical Services.<p>This is not to say that equity funds in today's environment are totally safe. There is one very real risk associated with an investment in a stock fund right now: market risk.<p>Market risk is the risk that an investor will be caught owning a broad spectrum of stocks that only decline in value. Or that the overall markets will go down and take all stocks with them. Market risk remains a concern because current market valuations, though lower than they were at the start of the year, are still high by historical standards.<p>Consider the ratio of stock prices to corporate earnings, a classic yardstick. During the last 45 years, the median price-to-earnings ratio on the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been 14.6. The current ratio is 20.8. What about dividend yields? The median for DJIA stocks for the past 45 years is 4.06 percent. Lately, these stocks have yielded 2.69 percent. <p>Two other key statistics tell the same story. The 45-year median ratio of market value to book value -- a measure of a company's stock price to its assets -- is 1.59. The current measure is 3.51. This means investors are paying an average three-plus times book value to buy the Dow industrials, double the historical rate.<p>Some analysts also wonder whether the market hasn't gotten ahead of itself recently. From 1926 to 1990, stocks averaged a 10 percent annual return to investors. Since 1991, though, returns have averaged 13 percent. This suggests that stocks' growth may slow, or even drop, to bring them in line with history. Clearly, market risk is an issue for investors today. But short of selling all stock holdings, there's no way to eliminate it. There is, however, much that can be done to reduce exposure to market risk. First, investors should assess exactly how much risk is currently in their portfolios. Only then can one determine vulnerability to a market swoon and whether adjustments are needed.<p>Market risk is not equally perilous to all investors. Those investing their money for a very long-term goal -- for a retirement 30 years hence, say -- have less to worry about in a market decline than investors who are trying to meet a short-term goal. Over the long run, stocks should rebound in line with historic growth rates. But to someone investing to pay for a 15-year-old's college education, market risk can be dangerous. <p>To pinpoint your exposure to market risk, delve into the portfolios of your funds. Is a manager a prudent steward or a reckless daredevil? To find out, check:<p>-> THE FUND'S AVERAGE PRICE-TO-EARNINGS RATIO. Because stock prices have fallen in relation to corporate earnings this year, funds that still hold a lot of stocks with high price-to-earnings ratios are effectively taking on greater market risk than funds with few such stocks. <p>When looking up the average for your fund, make sure you compare it with those of funds in a similar investment category. Value-oriented funds, for instance, generally tend to hold stocks with lower P/E ratios than growth funds do. But value funds aren't necessarily the safer of the two. The tipoff occurs when one value fund carries a much higher P/E ratio than other value funds.<p>Also consider comparing your fund's average P/E with that of the market index that best represents the fund's holdings: the S&P 500 if it's a large-capitalization stock fund or the Russell 2000 if it's a small-cap fund.<p>-> THE AVERAGE PRICE-TO-BOOK RATIO. A stock that trades near the book value of its assets is generally safer than one that trades at some multiple of that valuation. <p>Which type does your fund prefer? If you own ABT Emerging Growth fund, the average price-to-book ratio is almost 6. But if you own Alliance Quasar fund, the price-to-book ratio is 2.6. All else being equal, Alliance is the safer of the two funds.<p>-> PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. Aggressive concentration in one sector of the stock market suggests higher risk. Thomson Opportunity fund, for instance, currently has 45 percent of its portfolio invested in technology stocks -- a bet that this area of the economy will outperform all others. Although Thomson's wager could eventually prove a good one, its strategy is relatively perilous. <p>-> OBSCURE STOCK HOLDINGS. Another tipoff to outsize market risk is a fund that invests in little-known securities. Whenever the market encounters turbulence, investors typically flee smaller stocks for blue chips. A fund heavily into no-name stocks might find it hard to exit these shares without huge losses.<p>Check the contents of your fund's portfolio by asking for a copy of the fund's latest annual report. If you can't find some of the fund's largest holdings printed in the major stock market tables, it means you've got some serious market risk.<p>-> RISK HISTORY. Has the fund's style changed? Movement in any of the four categories above may be significant. A fund manager who has become more aggressive buying pricier stocks or investing more heavily in a single industry could be headed for a fall.<p>-> THE ESCAPE PLAN. Read the latest quarterly report and see what the plans are for market upheaval. Is the fund prepared to move out of equities and into cash if things get rough? A manager with a strategy for a bad market is better able to respond when one hits. <p>Gauging the risk in your holdings is useful only if you have ascertained how much risk you feel comfortable with. David Tice, a Dallas money manager who pens Behind the Numbers, an investment report, says, "If [people] have invested their savings substantially into an equity fund over the past two years, they should understand the risk. They should be willing to lose 30 percent over the next 12 months."<p>That's not a prediction about 1995. It's a reminder that large short-term losses are always possible. If you can't live with the risk, don't invest in equities. Use Tice's number to assess your financial state and your nerves. <p>Here's another way to think about risk. Assume stocks return an average of 10 percent a year, a gain your fund mirrors. Annual fees and expenses of around 1.25 percent drop your return to around 8.75 percent. Now consider that three-year, risk-free Treasury notes currently yield 6.67 percent. Do you want to take on substantial market risk to earn an extra 2 percent a year? <p>Of course, earning 10 percent in stocks is no guarantee, either. It is simply an average return over a 64-year period.<p>Money manager Markman believes fund investors are largely unaware of the risks they're taking. "People have loaded up with aggressive funds," he says. "Eighty percent have no idea how much they can lose."<p>Market risk in stock funds may not seem as treacherous as risks in derivatives that decimated bond funds this year. But market risk is nothing to sneeze at. While some investors roll with market punches, other investors cannot. Which investor are you?

Last year's numbers won't get you very far when it comes to picking the right funds.<p>By Gary Hector<p>Mutual funds are like a box of chocolates: You never know what you're going to get. Or so it must seem to investors who buy a highflying fund just in time to see it nose-dive. Of course, advertisements do nothing to discourage this approach -- they talk incessantly about recent returns. Many of the fund rankings published in magazines and newspapers do the same.<p>As a strategy, though, favoring funds based on past performance is highly suspect. What works in the handicapping of football teams and racehorses comes up short in the markets. All things being equal, a mutual fund that did well last year isn't any more likely to turn in an inspired performance in the future than one that did poorly. <p>"No analysis of the past, no matter how painstaking, assures future superiority," says John Bogle in the book Bogle on Mutual Funds. He knows whereof he speaks; Bogle is the chairman of the Vanguard Group, one of the nation's largest fund companies.<p>The predominant influence on most equity funds, of course, is the rise and fall of the market itself. Studies using a technical formula called R2 have determined that, over time, the general movement of stock prices accounts for about 80 percent of the performance of most funds. When a fund diverges sharply from the market's performance, the difference can usually be explained by the fund's investment strategy. Essentially, this is a matter of a fund being in the right segment of the market at the right time. A fund that invests in small companies will outdo the market when small-cap stocks are hot. Funds investing in companies with low price-to-earnings ratios and high dividends will outpace the market when value companies are in vogue. <p>But these differences tend to even out. In the long run, most equity funds earn a return close to the average for all stocks. The range of performance among funds narrows dramatically the longer the funds operate. Funds that do well for a few years eventually begin to underperform, bringing their long-term results back in line with those of other funds. This process is known as regression to the mean.<p>The long-term tendency of funds to cluster around some average level of performance also suggests that it may even be hazardous to buy last year's hot property. Take the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund, which did extremely well in 1993. It rose nearly 82 percent, not tops among international funds but still a very impressive result. An investor who jumped on this fund's bandwagon late in 1993 was in for a big shock during this year's first half. In a tough period for overseas funds, Emerging Markets fell nearly 20 percent -- dead last in performance in the category of general international funds.<p>Should this investor now race to sell? Not necessarily.<p>Suppose, for a moment, that the thousands of funds currently in existence were all placed squarely in the hands of random chance. Under this scenario, the performance distribution for all funds would, over time, grow to resemble a bell curve -- with the vast majority of the funds clustered around the median and a diminishing number stretched toward the high and low ends of the scale.<p>To academics and others who have studied mutual funds, it's no coincidence that the real-world chart of fund performance almost perfectly fits this hypothetical pattern. As long ago as 1968, the Journal of Finance published a classic study of mutual funds. After examining industry results over a 20-year period, the study concluded that individual fund performance was no better than mere random chance might predict.<p>People have been trying to poke holes in that conclusion ever since, but without success. From time to time, a fund manager gains fame for appearing to turn the theory on its head. The manager racks up big gains year after year. The critics say the streak could end at any time, but it doesn't. It goes on and on. <p>The fund manager, of course, hasn't really beaten the laws of mathematics at all. With more than 4,000 mutual funds, there are bound to be a few spectacular performers at any given time. The fund manager may indeed be a gifted stock picker, and some percentage of his or her results may be the result of those gifts. But for a fund to perform at the very top of the heap also requires a large measure of good fortune. The markets are simply too efficient to allow anyone much of an edge. <p>The problem comes in forecasting which fund managers will maintain their good fortune and which are about to begin their regression to the mean. At any given moment, probability theory suggests the odds are 50-50 that either could occur.<p>What about the former laggard that emerges from nowhere to beat all the favorites? Or what about the brilliant manager who simply has suffered a lot of bad luck? Certainly past performance wouldn't help to identify either of these cases. Nor would any of the currently devised yardsticks of fund performance and investment styles -- beta, standard deviation, and the like. No one has come up with a system that can reliably identify the funds that will top next year's ratings.<p>This is not to say that some of these measurement tools aren't useful when it comes to picking funds. Nor does it mean that a fund manager can't make smart choices that will provide an edge for his or her investors over time. But it does mean that spectacular performance in the markets requires a great deal of luck. Recognizing this, a rational investor will try to select funds that instead offer reasonable odds of either keeping up with or modestly beating the market indexes. This is the approach that we take at Worth.<p>If fate grins and turns a solid choice into a rocket ship, of course, then so much the better. <p>Despite overwhelming evidence of its limitations, past performance continues to play a prominent role in the choices that most fund investors make. Although this is mostly true of investors in search of a potential winner, it's also become common for cautious-minded folks: They look at how various funds did in down markets to gauge whether their choices are safe. <p>"The usefulness of track records is taken for granted by most participants in the investment industry," writes William Goetzmann and Roger Ibbotson in a recent study of mutual fund behavior. Goetzmann, an assistant professor of finance at the Columbia Graduate School of Business, and Ibbotson, a professor at the Yale School of Management, add, "For most [fund] clients, questions about the money manager's record are among the first questions asked."<p>We did some tests ourselves on the predictive ability of past performance. Using Alexander Steele's Mutual Fund Expert software program, we studied the performance of the top growth funds during each of the last five years. We selected the ten funds with the top annual performance record in each year, including both growth and aggressive-growth funds to ensure there was no bias toward large or small companies. Then we tracked the performance of these funds in the years after they made the top ten. <p>What did we find? The funds that made the top ten in 1990 did no better than the average growth or aggressive-growth fund the following year. Half of 1990's top-ten growth funds actually placed in the bottom third of the category in 1991. Of 1991's top ten funds, half beat the markets the following year and half didn't.<p>After the first year, performance deteriorated steadily. By 1993, for instance, only one of 1990's top ten beat the markets -- and that fund came in 125th out of the 444 funds included in the Steele program for that year. The worst ranked 437th. In the first half of 1994, none of the 1990 winners beat the markets.<p>We also found that it doesn't help for investors to look at longer track records. Selecting funds by looking at three-year or five-year horizons -- with no consideration of any other factors -- produces the same sort of results as looking solely at one-year performance records. "If you have two managers with equal skills," says Ken Gregory, editor of the newsletter No-Load Fund Analyst, "which of them will do better in the next five years doesn't have much to do with the last five years."<p>The bull market of recent years has shielded investors from this reality. Most funds did pretty well during the market's run-up, so the vast majority of investors scored gains whether they picked goods funds or not. Maybe their star performer didn't remain a star, but at least they didn't lose money.<p>More recently, however, the markets have been less forgiving, and most funds no longer generate spectacular returns. In this climate, the penalty for making a poor choice is likely to be more harsh.<p>The smartest investors won't be obsessed with catching a ride with the next Peter Lynch or John Neff. They'll be looking for consistency rather than spectacular performance. Our fund ratings will help get these investors started. <p>We claim only to have identified funds that are most likely to beat certain market benchmarks year in and year out. Given the risks of any other approach, we believe this is what a smart investor should be looking for.

Gary Hector is a contributing writer for Worth.<p><p>How We Picked Them
Our method rates funds based on three key measures: risk, predictability, and performance against a  benchmark. First make smart picks. Then combine  them in an effective portfolio.<p>By Jim Jubak<p>It's ironic that mutual funds are supposed to make investing easier -- because there is certainly nothing simple about deciding which ones to buy. In some ways (but not all) it's easier to pick and choose among stocks. There are fewer of them, and there's more to distinguish one company's shares from another's. With stocks, a potential investor can examine the quality of a company's balance sheet, the savvy of its management, the workability of its business strategy, and the prospects for its industry. These are substantive matters that lend themselves to productive research. In contrast, mutual funds offer a much hazier set of attributes. <p>We've already explained how misleading fund track records can be (see "Best Funds: Why Past Isn't Prologue" earlier in this file). But there's also considerable debate on the significance of the manager's role, as well as on the predictive value of beta and standard deviation -- especially either of these viewed alone. Anyone who has spent a lot of time trying to figure out why one growth fund might be better than another knows just how frustrating the task can be. Consulting the stars doesn't help. Neither does voodoo.<p>We set out to cut through this murk and devise a rational, defensible system for selecting equity funds. We didn't delude ourselves into thinking that we could pick next year's number-one performer. We knew that would be either fruitless or dishonest. So we focused on a more reasonable goal: identifying funds that have consistently beaten their peers in the past and that display concrete evidence of being able to repeat this performance. What we wanted, more than anything, was a system that would provide some sense of a fund's predictability. Specifically, we wanted to know which of the better-performing equity funds were merely lucky and which possessed the systems and skills to provide a true edge for their shareholders.<p>Modest as this goal may seem on the surface, accomplishing it actually would represent something of a breakthrough in fund analysis. So far as we know, no one out there has really done it yet, despite various public pronouncements to the contrary. <p>Our focus was on developing a system that would provide solid medium- and long-term results. Given recent increases in interest rates -- and the resulting improvement in returns offered by fixed-income instruments -- we assumed few of our readers would still be interested in buying equity funds for short-term purposes (less than five years). At the moment, the risks of equity funds outweigh their potential advantages as short-term investments.<p>To begin our quest, we asked Morningstar Inc. to provide us with complete data on every equity fund with at least a five-year track record and no less than $25 million in assets. Then we filled holes in the numbers and updated important statistics such as average price-to-earnings ratios and manager tenure. In the end, we collected more than 20,000 pieces of data for 777 funds. We loaded these statistics into a spreadsheet of our own design and enlisted the aid of a computer analyst to help us manipulate the numbers.<p>One thing we knew we wanted to look for right off the bat: Funds that displayed a consistent approach to investing. Mutual fund managers such as Tom Frank of Dreyfus New Leaders talked to us at great length about this key attribute. Dreyfus, for instance, hires an outside advisory firm for the sole purpose of providing the company with feedback on whether its funds invest consistently. <p>That made good sense to us when we thought about what factors produce the performance record of any fund. Above all, mutual fund results are influenced by the movement of the stock market -- not the individual buy-and-sell decisions of fund managers. When the market goes up, most funds do better. When it goes down, they do worse. Simple as that.<p>Funds with certain investment styles also benefit from cyclical changes in the types of stocks that are driving the market. When small-cap growth stocks are red hot, for instance, funds that invest disproportionately in these securities soar along with them. Such strategies are normally defined in a fund's charter; managers don't get to pick and choose. So there's no sense rewarding funds that just happen to be in the right place at the right time.<p>This meant that to find the best and most consistent funds, we had to be able to eliminate market factors. We wanted funds that do better than average because their managers actually contribute something to the fund's performance. Solution: Pit equity funds with like investment strategies against one another. <p>In recent years, the mutual fund industry has made a show of this by dividing the universe of funds into a seemingly infinite number of style groups. This allows investors to compare the performance of a particular fund against peers who presumably all rise and fall with the market in similar fashion.<p>The industry's sectors are so narrowly defined, however, that we wonder about the true motive behind it all. It could be that the fund companies just want as many opportunities as possible to win number-one rankings in different categories. All the better for their advertising efforts.<p>But not necessarily helpful for investors, who are then faced with an extra step in the fund-selection process -- before considering which funds to buy, they must first decide which of the myriad fund groups to focus on. This is useless, we think.<p>We decided to go back to the drawing board and chalk out our own fund categories, holding the number to no more than five. Ken Gregory editor of the No Load Fund Analyst newsletter in Orinda, California, and Paul Greenwood, senior research analyst for U.S. equities at the Frank Russell Co., helped us split U.S. equity funds into a matrix of four groups, defined by whether they invest primarily in large companies or small companies and whether they look for value or growth in stocks. We called a large-cap fund one that generally invests in stocks with a median market capitalization of at least $1.03 billion -- the same definition Russell currently uses. Small-cap funds were those that generally invest in anything smaller. We used price-to-book ratios (the relationship between the price of a stock and its underlying asset value) to separate value and growth funds. Once we decided on the right groupings for our U.S. funds (small-cap growth, small-cap value, large-cap growth, and large-cap value), we added a fifth category, global funds, to include funds that invest at least 40 percent of their assets in foreign securities.<p>The next step was comparing the returns of our 777 funds to an appropriate stock index. We used four Russell-designed indexes as benchmarks for the U.S. funds, and the Morgan Stanley Europe, Australia and the Far East index for global funds. Then, we subtracted the performance of the appropriate index from each fund's one-, three-, and five-year returns.<p>But we also needed a single rating number for returns that we could plug into a final overall score for our fund evaluations. For this purpose, we took the five-year figures and deducted the impact of each fund's front-end sales charges. We felt this gave us a number that best reflected the true returns each fund provided its investors.<p>Presumably, the more risks a fund takes, the lower the odds that it will be able to repeat its performance in the future. So we wanted to know what sort of gambles funds had taken to achieve their levels of performance. After looking over many of the current popular formulas for evaluating risk, however, we felt unsatisfied. Most of them simply look at how many down quarters a fund has had and how severe these drops were. In other words, they try to judge future risk based simply on the fund's past performance. We wanted something better. The risk model we designed relies on three different measurements of fund characteristics that don't bounce around with the market: standard deviation, a way of looking at past performance that examines the degree of variance in a fund's performance over time; beta, a measure of a fund's volatility in relation to the entire stock market; and turnover, a measure of how actively a manager trades his portfolio. Again, we compared each fund with those in its peer group. The final result was a rating from 1 to 100, with 100 representing the lowest possible level of risk. <p>We also used our spreadsheet to calculate a separate predictability rating for each fund, a feature found in no other ranking system. To do this, we looked at changes in fund managers during the five-year study period -- a new manager might be better or worse than the one responsible for the fund's track record, but there's no way to know which outcome is the more likely. We also investigated a fund's growth in net assets from 1991 to 1994. Excessive growth would cause us to worry about the fund manager's ability to manage the additional cash while maintaining the investment style that had served the fund well in the past. We also compared each fund's current average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios to past ratios to determine the types of stocks it purchased over time. And we also looked at loads and expenses, knowing that high charges tend to reduce performance. In combination, these characteristics gave us the ingredients for a new rating, which we called the predictor.<p>As an overall rating for each fund, we combined the return, risk, and predictor numbers into one score, which we then translated into dollar-sign ratings, from $ for laggards to $$$$$ for the very best. Only 5 percent of the 777 funds scored a top rating.<p>Once we were finished, we conducted a number of seat-of-the-pants tests to evaluate our results. Would we feel comfortable buying the funds that ranked high on our list? Were these managers we knew and trusted? How did our results compare with those of other fund-ranking systems? To the extent that there were any apparent anomalies, we wanted to know the reason.<p>Certainly there were some surprises. Some well-regarded funds, such as Fidelity Magellan, received only a $$$ rating (ranking it in the middle 40 percent of the fund universe). In Magellan's case, this happened despite a relatively high return rating of 86. When we looked closer, however, we saw that a middle-of-the-road risk rating and a low predictor had pushed Magellan down in the final rankings. The predictor had detected a change in the fund's p/e ratio -- to 21.74 from 17.12 in 1991 -- and also took into account the fund's change in managers. Our score was fair.<p>The case of SteinRoe Prime Equities shows exactly how our predictor worked. The fund would have rated a top $$$$$ on the basis of an 80 return rating and a 79 risk rating, except that its longtime manager Ralph Segall left to start another fund this year. That lowered the fund's predictor rating to 18 and gave the fund an overall rating of $$$$. Or take the case of another highly regarded fund, Crabbe Huson Special Equities. The fund's extremely high return rating of 94 couldn't carry the fund above $$$ because of its poor risk rating (reflecting an above-average standard deviation) and a low predictor (a result of the fund's rapid asset growth).<p>Finally, we tested our system by examining each fund that scored $$$$$ to come up with our choices for the five best funds (see "Best Funds: Best Of The Best - LIST" further down in this file).

These five funds came out tops among the 777 we examined.<p>Our annual survey of mutual funds screened a total of 777 different funds. Of those, only 47 received our top rating of $$$$$ (see "Best Funds: Top-Rated Funds - LIST" further down in this file).<p>We then delved into each fund that scored $$$$$, conducting an in-depth analysis of performance charts and fund statistics to see if our screening had missed anything. We ended up picking the two best funds in each of five groups and dispatching a team of reporters to interview the managers. After reviewing the results, we selected the five best funds, which are listed below.<p>A portfolio of these five would be balanced for style, hedged against risk, and, best of all, likely to deliver better-than-market returns to an investor.

Starting with statistics from Morningstar, we calculated three exclusive ratings: return against a benchmark, risk level, and predictability.<p>We then assigned each of the 777 funds an overall Worth rating that combined the return, risk, and predictor scores into a single ranking, from $ to $$$$$. (For a complete description of how we assigned ratings, see "Best Funds: How We Picked Them.")<p>Only the very best funds received a $$$$$ rating -- we gave that rating to the top 5 percent in each of the return, risk, and predictor categories.

						October 1994 
Worth magazine/Advisor<p>BANK FUNDS HIT AN ETHICAL SNAG
Some banks are in hot water over mutual fund sales.<p>By Elizabeth MacDonald<p>At first, the explosive growth of the mutual fund industry was bad news for banks -- depositors fled in droves to the newly popular instruments. Then the banks came up with a way to fight back: They'd sell their own mutual funds. <p>Yet allegations have surfaced that, in the battle to retain depositors, some banks may have acted too aggressively. A series of recent lawsuits filed by disgruntled investors and former bank employees allege a host of ethical and legal infractions committed by certain bank brokers, including the payment of kickbacks to bank tellers for referrals. While there is no indication that these practices are widespread among the 3,500 or so banks that sell their 1,700 house-brand funds, the lawsuits illustrate potential conflicts that didn't exist until banks started selling their own mutual funds.<p>A lawsuit filed June 21 in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida, by former NationsBank broker David Cray illuminates the issues. Cray alleges that NationsBank's two-year old brokerage, NationsSecurities, a 50-50 partnership between NationsBank, the country's fourth-largest bank, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Dean Witter Financial Services, used misleading sales tactics, violated securities laws, and breached depositors' privacy rights when selling funds. <p>Cray's suit says that after he outlined his allegations in a June 1994 letter to bank management, Cray, a broker for 16 years, was fired. On July 27, two former NationsSecurities brokers -- Catherine Hovis and Robert Lewis -- joined Cray in a separate arbitration suit charging similar violations. The brokers are each demanding $20 million in compensatory damages, plus $500 million total in punitive damages. <p>Furthermore, on June 23, three NationsSecurities investors filed a class-action suit against the bank in U.S. District Court in Tampa, charging the same state and federal securities law violations. NationsBank says it "vigorously denies these claims."<p>However, in late July, 18 former and current brokers also filed arbitration claims against NationsSecurities with the National Association of Securities Dealers in New York for its "illegal commission-sharing arrangement." The brokers' suit says that when tellers referred a customer to them, the brokers were required to split their commissions with the tellers, in violation of SEC and NASD rules, which say unregistered dealers are not qualified to give investment advice. The bank's official reply: "We can state unequivocally that NationsSecurities is a professional brokerage firm dedicated to meeting the needs of consumers through more than 600 account executives in nine states and the District of Columbia."<p>According to Cray's lawsuit, the bank's alleged missteps, begin with its training methods, which encourage bank tellers to tip off fund salesmen to activities of big depositors, possibly violating a customer's right to privacy. Cray, who has since started up Cray Financial Group in Safety Harbor, Florida, charges, "It was popular for the bank to train tellers to inform [brokers] immediately when a sizable deposit was made." In addition, Cray says NationsSecurities brokers gained access to confidential customer-account information without their clients' consent, including "the types of investments held by each NationsBank customer, the maturity dates of certificates of deposit, the dates and times of deposits and withdrawals, the identities of joint-account holders, and addresses, telephone numbers, ages, and incomes of the customers." <p>Armed with this information, Cray says, brokers stalked clients. "One day a depositor plunked $300,000 into a savings account at the branch," he recalls. "By the time he got home from the bank, there was a message on his answering machine from a NationsSecurities broker." <p>Cray explains how the bank's referral system operated. "In order to keep their jobs and even win prizes, customer-service representatives got one point for every new NationsSecurities account they referred to brokers. Employees who racked up the most points, typically 100 or more in a quarter, won televisions or trips to Acapulco, the Cayman Islands, or the Caribbean."<p>Furthermore, the complaint claims, NationsSecurities brokers were discouraged from selling non-NationsBank and non-Dean Witter funds with the threat of reduced commissions. For example, on a $100,000 new account placed with an outside equity fund, the bank would rake in 3.25 percent of the purchase amount in gross commissions. According to the bank's scoring system, on an external fund, it would pay a broker 18 percent of that $3,250, or $585. If the broker instead sold the bank's equity income fund, "which doesn't have an established track and isn't rated by Morningstar," says Cray, the bank would get $5,000 and pay brokers up to 25 percent of that amount, or $1,250. Cray also claims depositors often had no clue that these funds carried back-end loads (dubbed "early withdrawal penalties," a term used for CDs), since such charges accrue only when the funds are cashed out. <p>Leilani Demint and her 27-year-old autistic son, Edward Ringwald, of St. Petersburg, Florida, are two investors who claim they succumbed to NationsBank's aggressive selling. Last year, NationsSecurities placed $70,000 of Demint's CD and savings-account money in a 6 percent Dean Witter U.S. Government Securities trust and a 7 percent Putnam bond fund. The two funds had 5 to 6 percent back-end loads, described to her as "early withdrawal penalties." "I would never have put my money in a mutual fund or a securities trust. I was told it was going into a savings bond and that my principal was safe," says Demint. She lost $6,000, and is now a plaintiff in the class-action suit. <p>NationsBank isn't alone in facing angry depositors. On June 28, Richard C. Hilton, a real estate investor, filed a $60,000 lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Tampa charging Barnett Bank with "breach of fiduciary duty," "[breach of] financial privacy," and "wanton, willful, and malicious" actions. Hilton's suit says in May 1993 a Barnett banker shared his confidential money market-account information with Barnett Securities. Soon after, a Barnett broker made a sales pitch, which Hilton resisted. <p>The broker, says Hilton, took his $60,000 money market balance "without [his] full knowledge and fully informed authorization or consent" and stuck that amount into a bond fund. Hilton later lost $3,400. After learning that his new investment was not insured and that he had been charged a sales commission, Hilton tried to get his principal back, but the bank allegedly refused to reimburse him. Barnett Bank says in an official statement: "Customers buying mutual funds through Barnett are required to sign forms clearly stating that these investments are not federally insured" and that it "found [Hilton's] allegations to be without merit." <p>Mutual funds have a strong appeal for banks partly because of the fees the banks can charge. Besides sales commissions, annual fees pour in whether investors are buying or not. Perhaps because bank funds' average expense ratio of 0.84 percent lags the typical fund's ratio of 1.16 percent, bankers pulled in $274 million in charges in 1993, up from $150 million in 1992, according to Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. <p>Bankers "are also interested in maintaining an account relationship," says Lipper. "They don't want to see those accounts walk down the street to a broker."<p>If you like the idea of one-stop financial shopping at your neighborhood bank, protect yourself. Stick with funds that have existed for at least five years, in both up and down markets, and have historically outperformed the average in their category. This may be tough, however, since many bank funds are two years old or less. <p>Ask the bank broker for reports from independent rating firms. If he doesn't have them, he's ill-informed, so head for the exit.<p>Compare a bank fund's fees with those of similar funds. Many bank funds are freighted with back-end loads. Stay clear of deferred charges that surpass these averages: 3.9 percent for growth funds, 5.0 percent for growth and income funds, and 4.3 percent on balanced funds. If the fund carries a front-end load, don't pay more than 4.3 percent.<p>Finally, don't put all your money in one bank fund. "Test drive the bank fund first," says Lipper. "Invest 10 to 20 percent of your money, then see how it performs." <p><p>

Will the dollar continue to juice returns? Probably not. <p>By Liliana Nealon<p>In 1985, when the dollar was hitting a historic high against the world's major currencies, investors in the United States decided to venture out into the world's equity markets. Their timing was impeccable.<p>Since then, the dollar has lost about 50 percent of its value against the European currencies and the yen, giving international investors a double bang for their buck. Yet few international-fund owners realize how much of their overseas portfolio's returns are the result of a falling dollar. Now is a good time to remember that investing in foreign equity and bond mutual funds is really a two-part investment: a bet on the underlying asset and another bet on the currency in which the investment is domiciled.<p>The currency portion can be substantial. Consider the performance of <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a>'s Europe, Australia, and Far East (EAFE) index, the foreign benchmark for most U.S. investors. According to research conducted by Virginia Parker of Ferrell Capital Management in Greenwich, Connecticut, close to 65 percent of the return of the EAFE index since 1986 has been attributable to currency fluctuations. Parker says it is not unusual to find that in any given year, half or more of EAFE returns are due to currency alone and not to the returns of the underlying assets.<p>This doesn't mean investors should abandon international funds. Economic and business cycles peak and trough at different times in different countries, and the only way to capitalize on these cycles is to be invested in the countries in which they occur when they occur. Several studies have shown that over time a portfolio with a good mix of international holdings will outperform a portfolio invested solely in domestic holdings. <p>But now more than ever, it's crucial for investors to know just how big a role gyrating currencies can have on a fund's return. That's because it's unlikely that investors in foreign markets will continue to reap currency gains at a level anything like the last five years. And if the dollar stabilizes or begins to rise in value, investors will face the possibility of currency losses. <p>Consider this result of the declining dollar: During the period from 1970 to 1990, $1 invested in Japanese equities returned over $39. But about $24, or 61 percent, of that return was due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar. Similarly, an investor who bought a German equity portfolio worth 100,000 deutsche marks at the dollar's high against the mark in February 1985 would have paid $28,965. At today's exchange rates, without any appreciation or depreciation of the underlying assets, that portfolio would be worth $60,500, a return of more than 100 percent. Smoke and mirrors? Derivatives with hidden losses? None of the above: Simply a dollar in steep decline against the deutsche mark. <p>The dollar has fallen since 1985 partly because of the drop in U.S. interest rates and partly because of the large supply of dollars held abroad. The dollar was also grossly overvalued in 1985, which prompted massive dollar selling by the world's central banks as they sought to defend their own currencies. Now the greenback is at historic lows against the yen. Against European currencies, the dollar has been in so steep a tailspin that the Federal Reserve Board and other central banks recently bought dollars to prop up the currency. The administration's efforts to prop up the dollar may not fuel much of a rally in the currency. And it's quite possible the dollar will slide even further. But it is highly unlikely that the greenback will fall as far as it did in the 1980s.<p>A stagnant or rising dollar can very easily mean diminished returns for investors in overseas portfolios. Since U.S. fund managers did not venture into the world of global investing until the mid-'80s, the beginning of the dollar bear market, they have little or no experience managing portfolios in dollar bull moves. Ezra Zask, president of Ezra Zask Associates, a fund-management and consulting firm in Norfolk, Connecticut, says that about two thirds of U.S. international fund managers do not hedge their currency risk. While this passive approach may have been a boon to returns in this period of dollar weakness, it will have the opposite effect if the dollar turns around. "Look for managers who take a more active role in hedging their portfolios," recommends Zask. "Avoid the more passive, no-hedge policy managers."<p>Keep in mind, too, that emerging-market funds are usually at full currency risk, particularly because of the danger of currency devaluation.<p><p>

Net asset value is no guarantee. Sometimes it's simply management's best guess, and sometimes management is wrong.<p>By Gerald Perritt<p>If you're like most mutual fund investors, you check the progress of your investments once or twice a week in the business pages. You head straight for the NAV -- or net asset value -- column and quickly calculate how much your net worth has risen or fallen since you last checked.<p>But investors in open-ended mutual funds are sorely mistaken if they believe that all funds' NAV listings are just as reliable as closing prices on the New York or American stock exchanges. The fact is, the determination of a fund's net asset value can be much more subjective and malleable than most investors know. What you see may not be what you'd get if you were to sell your shares. <p>The soundness of a fund's NAV depends on a couple of things: the method used by fund management to price lesser-known securities and the ease with which those securities can be sold, or liquidity. <p>Few investors realize how much leeway a fund's management has when it comes to valuing lesser-known securities. Similarly, few realize how large a role liquidity plays in their fund's valuation. With thinly traded securities, there's no telling what price a fund manager's sell order will fetch if it disrupts the market in that security. An illiquid security, if sold, could very likely trade at a price much lower than its value in the prospectus.<p>Daily share prices of open-ended funds are determined, in most instances, by the value of the funds' holdings at the close of a day's trading. Net asset value is calculated by adding the value of all the securities held in a fund, including cash and other assets, subtracting liabilities, and dividing the remainder by the number of shares outstanding. Since these are the prices used for share purchases and redemptions, mutual fund managers take great pains to assure they are statistically correct. <p>Each security that trades daily on a national stock or bond exchange and is held by a fund is valued at the last sale price. Those are the easy ones. Securities that don't trade during the course of a business day are trickier; they're valued at the mean between the then-current closing bid and offer prices. Less liquid securities are the toughest of all. These are valued "at a fair value determined in good faith by the board of directors." <p>Should you be worried that your fund's net asset value may be subject to interpretation by management? Not if you own a fund that trades shares of big, public companies or highly liquid securities, such as Treasurys. These markets can absorb large buy and sell orders without incurring much, if any, disruption.<p>But investors in several other types of funds -- particularly those that invest in municipal bonds, thinly traded over-the-counter stocks, and emerging overseas markets -- should be aware that their holdings' values may not be all that they seem. <p>This point is worth making now, given the markets' negative reaction to rising interest rates. As large numbers of investors race to exit mutual funds, managers are forced to liquidate their holdings. Without a lot of buyers on hand to even out supply and demand, prices decline, sometimes severely. Net asset values in funds holding less-liquid securities are most vulnerable.<p>Such liquidity troubles have creamed fund investors before. Back in 1989 and 1990, junk-bond funds took it on the chin when the liquidity in that market all but dried up. This was largely the result of the demise of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the biggest junk-bond underwriter and market maker. As junk-bond prices began to fall, investors headed for the door. With the major market maker basically out of business, fund managers had to sell their bonds into a woefully illiquid market. This drove already depressed prices down further, and the snowball started rolling. <p>How bad did it get? Through the first nine months of 1990, not one of the 20 high-yield funds I studied had a return in the plus column. The investment objective of all 20 funds was to earn high income. The best any of them did during the period was a loss of 1.8 percent, turned in by the <a name="FUND:OPPHX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/OPPHX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oppenheimer High Yield Fund</b></a>. Compared with the others, Oppenheimer's results were standout: <a name="FUND:ABUSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ABUSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Alliance's Bond Fund High Yield Portfolio</b></a> lost 15.6 percent, <a name="FUND:MHITX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MHITX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MFS Lifetime High Income Fund</b></a> was down 11.9 percent, and Pacific Horizon High Yield Bond Fund lost 13.7 percent. <p>Junk bonds came roaring back to life a few years later. But the example illustrates what can happen to the net asset values of funds when liquidity in a market disappears or when sellers far outnumber buyers. <p>Today the worry is that few fund shareholders realize to what extent their funds may hold securities that are not exceedingly liquid. We're not talking exotic securities here. Neither are we talking about the increasing numbers of funds that invest in illiquid private placements (see "Easy In, Uneasy Out," Worth, December/January 1994). <p>Municipal bonds, small-cap stocks, and emerging-market equities have all become wildly popular with investors in recent years. There are now 185 international stock funds available to investors, up from 100 three years ago. Aggressive growth funds that invest in small-cap stocks, one of which I have run since 1988, have exploded in number recently, from 186 to 233 since 1990. Municipal-bond funds have also been on a tear: According to a report by Moody's Investors Service, there are 1,027 tax-exempt funds available to investors today, up from 208 in 1984. Thirty-two billion dollars flowed into these funds in the first nine months of 1993, a 54 percent gain over the same period in 1992.<p>Unfortunately, all three areas are ripe for liquidity problems, which could translate into unpleasant NAV surprises for fundholders.<p>Take thinly traded over-the-counter stocks, for instance. Again, stocks and bonds that rarely trade are valued at the average of their bid price -- what you'd get if you sold -- and offer or asked price -- what you'd pay to buy. But this methodology can produce highly misleading fund NAVs. In early March, before the market started to trade down, I priced my small-cap fund's shares two ways -- based on then-current bid and offer prices. Pricing at the bid -- the only side of the market a seller is concerned about -- caused the NAV to decline by 1.5 percent. Pricing it at the offer raised its price by 1.9 percent. That's a 3.4 percent spread -- a sizable swing -- between existing bid and offer prices. And that spread was calculated on a typical day in the markets, not during a market break.<p>There's another reason investors in funds holding obscure OTC stocks should be concerned about what their shares might fetch. Market makers in these types of securities usually limit the size of the orders they will accept for execution. An OTC dealer is obligated to accept no more than a 100-share order at the bid or offer price. Putting out an order to sell 50,000 or 100,000 shares -- both typical fund holdings -- would cause current bids to plunge.<p>Even when markets are calm, OTC stocks trade with more volatility than other stocks. A story in Forbes last August compared the average trade-to-trade percentage price changes on stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and Nasdaq during the course of one month. Prices changed, from trade to trade, on average 0.5 percent on the New York, 1.1 percent on the Amex, and almost 2 percent on Nasdaq. <p>Many shareholders found out about the disruption that results when you sell into an illiquid market during the stock crash of 1987. Over-the-counter market makers, under extreme stress from heavy selling, walked away from their bids. <p>Buyers, believe it or not, also found a hostile environment during the market meltdown. The fund manager of a smallish Noddings Convertible securities limited partnership tried to buy some thinly traded convertible bonds when the market was tanking, only to have the offer prices substantially increased before his orders could be filled. <p>Such stories show that many bids and asks on the OTC market were bogus. And fund-share prices based on these quotations were bogus as well. <p>Of course, certain funds have more to worry about than others when it comes time to sell. Funds holding bushels of stocks that trade infrequently will find themselves in hot water if faced with mass redemptions. <p>One fund holding large numbers of obscure or thinly traded stocks is the Transamerica Capital Growth Fund, previously the Capital Appreciation Fund. Transamerica has returned almost 19 percent since its inception in 1985, but it lost almost 5 percent in the first quarter of this year. The fund's June 1993 annual prospectus showed that 28.6 percent of its $84 million in assets were securities too obscure to be listed in a recent Standard & Poor's stock guide. By contrast, in the <a name="FUND:ALSCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ALSCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Alger Small Capitalization Portfolio</b></a>, another small-company fund, 3 percent of its assets could not be found in the S&P guide. <p>Not being listed in the S&P guide doesn't mean a company isn't worth owning, but it does mean that its shares trade much less actively and are therefore less liquid than those of other companies that are listed by S&P. <p>Municipal bonds also present liquidity problems. These bonds are rarely traded; historically they've been sold to investors as very long-term holds, to be put away in the lockbox. Thus, the difference between their bid prices and their asked prices tend to be wide. With wide spreads, it's all the more likely that the actual price to buy or sell a block of bonds will be significantly different from the quotation supplied to figure NAV.<p>To try to minimize the huge spreads, some municipal-bond issuers are listing their bonds on the New York Stock Exchange. But these listings will be limited to only higher-quality issues. <p>"Fund portfolio prices may be distorted," Moody's analyst Stephen Schoepke warns, "because the market is too thin to obtain a representative range of price bids." Investors recently got a taste of how distorted prices of municipal bonds can get. For the month of March, Vanguard's long-term insured municipal-bond fund declined 4.5 percent; its intermediate-term muni funds dropped 2.1 percent. As interest rates increase further, more losses will result. As Schoepke says, "Mutual funds may not have adequate information to accurately price their portfolios."<p>Investors' blooming love affairs with emerging-market stocks also raise liquidity concerns. First of all, these markets lack the regulatory and surveillance sophistication of U.S. markets. Thus the possibility of price manipulation is high. But more important, most equity markets in developing nations are so tiny that minor changes in investor sentiment can send share prices reeling. <p>For example, the entire market capitalization of the Indian stock market is roughly $72 billion. But the assets held by just two offshore, open-end funds that invest in Indian stocks -- the India Opportunities Fund and the Indian Investment Co. fund -- total almost $500 million. When the managers running those funds want to dump shares, they're going to have trouble drumming up buyers. <p>What about the so-called "other" securities that can find their way into fund portfolios? Valuing these is a real crapshoot. The fund's board of directors has sole discretion to set the security's price for NAV purposes. Although the directors are charged with determining a "fair value in good faith," there are few guidelines for establishing such mechanisms. If no secondary market exists for a security, fund managers may set the price where they wish. <p>To protect yourself from unpleasant NAV surprises, consult your fund's most recent prospectus. If it is a small-cap or aggressive-growth fund, check the holdings for companies whose names you recognize. If the unknowns -- loosely defined as stocks that don't show up in an S&P stock guide -- total 10 percent or more of the portfolio, your fund may have liquidity problems.<p>As for municipal-bond and emerging-market funds, liquidity issues are a fact of life. Just don't bank on your net asset value being stable when the fund is faced with throngs of sellers. <p>It would be helpful to investors if fund managers created a way of measuring a fund's liquidity and then published it in their prospectuses. But this won't likely happen unless we have a big break in stock or bond markets. <p>During fair and orderly markets, there's little cause for liquidity concerns -- the price of one transaction should give you a reasonable estimate of the price of the next. But when markets are disorderly, your mutual fund investments may not be worth what you think.

When morgage lenders battle over market share, home buyers find great deals.<p>By Andrew Feinberg<p>Ready! Aim! Fire! The mortgage industry is going to war, and it's a fight that will benefit consumers. Examples: In the 12 states in which it operates, customers of Home Savings of America can now put down as little as 5 percent on a $300,000 mortgage, and Home Savings will waive the normally required mortgage insurance. Its rates start as low as 6.6 percent.<p>In Greenbrae, California, a mortgage lender recently offered a broker at Pacific Guarantee Mortgage a rebate of one full point--that's 1 percent of the mortgage loan amount, or $2,000 on a $200,000 loan--to get the firm's business. Other lenders have offered rebates of a quarter point to a half point.<p>In Fairfax, Virginia, George Mason Bank is offering home-equity credit lines at prime minus half a point for a line of $50,000 or more. The annual rate: 5.5 percent on owner-occupied homes.<p>Wait a second... Aren't these developments contrary to the recent news about rising interest rates?<p>Well, yes, they are. Back on October 15, 1993, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was just 6.83 percent, according to HSH Associates of Butler, New Jersey, which tracks mortgage rates nationally. By March 18, the rate was 7.85 percent, and the prognosis is for more of the same. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages will be 8.1 percent by the end of the year, predicts David Lereah, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association.<p>Yet at the same time, mortgage lenders have stepped up efforts to gain, or hold on to, market share. They know that rising rates inevitably will slow new financings and bring an end to the boom that saw more than 10 million mortgages refinanced in 1992 and 1993. So they are striking back with a sale just in time for spring, the traditional peak of the home-buying season.<p>Unlike the deals that got the savings and loans into trouble in the 1980s, the mortgage industry this time around is trying to practice restraint. Thus, most of the bargains that lenders are offering focus on upfront terms rather than on cutting interest rates on 30-year loans. Lenders are stretching out payments and reducing the amount buyers must put down --in some cases, to zero. Lenders have slashed introductory rates and then slashed them again. Points, the cost of getting a new mortgage, have in many cases disappeared. <p>Comparing all the new packages is time consuming, but certainly worth the effort. The skirmishing in the mortgage industry has also given borrowers more leverage. "Today's consumer is much more in the driver's seat than he has been in recent years," says Keith Gumbinger, an analyst with HSH Associates. "Especially if you have triple-A credit, you should ask, 'What can you do for me that's better?' Play one lender off against another. Realize that six months ago, there were 500 people at the lender's door ready to write contracts, and now there are only four or five."<p>Before plunging into the complicated task of comparing mortgage options, buyers should keep a few things in mind about the state of today's real estate market. Yes, home-sales activity has picked up, but clearly, housing prices haven't yet run away from would-be buyers. So there's reason for patience. Nationwide, the median price of existing homes rose just 3 percent last year, to $106,800. The median cost of a new home crept up 3.7 percent to $126,000. Prices will move up another 3.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in 1994, predicts Lereah.<p>Of course, national numbers don't always apply. In hot markets like Richland/Kennewickasco, Washington (up 21 percent in 1993); Green Bay, Wisconsin (up 11.8 percent); Salt Lake City/Ogden (up 11 percent); and Boise, Idaho (up 10 percent), it may seem as if prices are leaping 3 percent a month. In Los Angeles (down 7.1 percent in 1993); Orange County, California (down 6 percent); and Hartford, Connecticut (down 4.1 percent), the bottom, apparently, hasn't yet been glimpsed.<p>A potential borrower who hasn't been in the market for a decade faces a bewildering array of new mortgage sources. For example, in 1987 the U.S. survived with only 7,500 mortgage brokers. By the end of 1993 there were 18,000. And in contrast to ten years ago, the industry is a lot less local. In 1984, S&Ls, by and large small local lenders, controlled 53.5 percent of all mortgage lending for one- to four-unit properties. But their share eroded to 19 percent by the end of 1993. Aggressive mortgage bankers, such as Countrywide Funding, which often operate on a national rather than local scale, now control 52 percent of the overall mortgage market. All those lenders mean that no market is too small for cutthroat competition.<p>"I was surprised how badly the lenders seemed to want my business," says a Maryland man who recently closed on a new home. He shouldn't have been; the battle lines are clearly visible--especially in realtors' offices.<p>"Every week now, 50 different lenders try to call on me," says Joan Reilly, manager of Coldwell Banker Realty Pros in Potomac, Maryland. "They're getting more aggressive about offering gourmet lunches, setting up cocktail parties, or just stopping by to drop off food."<p>And, of course, cheap money. "If Countrywide notices on a certain day of the month that we haven't done our normal amount of volume, they'll be on the phone saying, 'We miss your business,' and offering rebates," says Bob da Costa, president of Indian River Mortgage, a Vero Beach, Florida, lender. <p>Smart home buyers should take advantage of all this. "These days," says John Lucas, vice president with ARCS Mortgage, a Bank of New York company headquartered in Calabasas, California, "everything is negotiable." But everything is much more negotiable with some lenders. Generally speaking, it's easier to wheel and deal with mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers than with large banks and S&Ls.<p>Adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, are a place, however, where S&Ls are likely to be aggressive. Surviving S&Ls see rising rates and the end of the refinancing frenzy as their best chance to regain market share for ARMs, traditionally their strongest product. Adjustable mortgage rates are likely to stay artificially low this year, and the spread between adjustable and fixed mortgage rates has widened by an average of more than three eighths of a percentage point. <p>Borrowers looking for a bargain on rates might also check out home-equity loans. During 1992-93, home-equity lending lost market share to refinancings. In response, lenders have actually dropped home-equity rates. Instead of offering credit lines at the once prevailing rate of prime plus one and a half percentage points, many lenders are now dangling lines at prime.<p>The industry has also introduced a crop of exotic mortgage options designed to pull in business without cutting profit margins too severely. Some of these may actually be great opportunities for specific home buyers.<p>For example, a 40-year mortgage, a product just reintroduced in many markets, makes a home slightly more affordable in the short term by reducing the monthly mortgage payment. But the added cost over the life of the loan makes sense only for buyers who don't plan on staying put long and need the extra cash flow now. The monthly payment on a $200,000, 30-year, 7.75 percent fixed-rate mortgage is $1,433. For a 40-year deal it's $1,353. Over the life of a 40-year mortgage, however, the home buyer will pay $133,000 more. <p>Borrowers who want to keep their monthly payments down might also consider another alternative, the delayed first-adjustment ARM. These can lower the initial interest rate by 0.375 to 0.5 percentage points. Then, after a specified period, the fixed rate on this mortgage becomes adjustable. For example, a borrower might pay a fixed jumbo mortgage rate of 7.375 percent for ten years, after which the interest rate becomes adjustable at one-year intervals. On a $275,000 loan, using this alternative (called a ten-one because it looks like a fixed mortgage for ten years and then becomes an adjustable-rate mortgage with a rate that changes once a year) could save $13,800 over the first ten years--a great deal for a home buyer who can predict when the family will be moving on to another house.<p>A no-equity refinancing is another option that may be a good deal for the millions of homeowners who have the worst of both worlds: a high-rate mortgage and a house that has declined in value. Many of these homeowners lack the 20 percent equity stake traditionally required to refinance.<p>No-equity refinancings cost about one point more than prevailing 30-year rates, and while refinancing at 8.75 percent isn't everyone's idea of a great offer, it might be a godsend for people stuck with higher-rate mortgages.<p>Interest rates aren't the only rates that matter. Income taxes need to get factored into any decision about how big a mortgage to take, how little to put down, and what rate is best. Rising income-tax rates mean that carrying tax-deductible debt, such as a mortgage, costs less than it did last year. Making a somewhat smaller down payment makes sense, since the value of the mortgage deduction is greater this year. A buyer can actually afford a little more house because of changes in the tax code. Those same changes slightly diminish the appeal of 10-, 15-, and 20-year mortgages. But the tax code still hasn't made a 40-year mortgage a good deal for most home buyers. <p>No matter how how many numbers you've crunched, don't forget to check out the lender. Doing business with an obscure outfit offering a seemingly miraculous package may be asking for trouble. One quick way to check on a lender is to call your state banking department to find out about any recent complaints. (Checking out a mortgage broker is more difficult in the 13 states that don't require a broker to obtain a license.) Once the lender survives this initial screen, ask for the names and phone numbers of satisfied clients. Then roll up your sleeves and get ready to drive a hard bargain.<p><p>

Individuals can now join up with pension-fund honchos.<p>By Robert N. Veres<p>Companies that manage money for large institutional investors have begun to create mutual fund portfolios for individuals. Now the little guy can get the expertise once available only to large corporate pension plans. <p>So goes the slick marketing pitch. Should you buy into it? <p>There are a couple of reasons why it might actually make sense to put some of your money with a manager who's pension-fund oriented. Investors looking for stability, low cost structures, and solid, middle-of-the-road performance might find satisfaction in a fund run by a pension-fund manager.<p>Why? Well, partly because folks who oversee pension funds achieve more stability in their returns than those who run mutual funds that expand and contract with the mood swings of the investing herd. And large pension plans typically get their assets managed for less than 0.5 percent of the money under management; compare this to 1 percent or more for most equity funds. Some, but not all, institutional managers charge lower fees to retail clients.<p>Most pension-fund managers develop an expertise by which they are known in the institutional world. Their retail mutual funds should reflect this focus - a nice change from the typical mutual fund family's we-offer-everything philosophy.<p>There are a couple of mutual funds run by pension-fund managers that retail investors might consider. Clipper Fund, managed by Pacific Financial Research (310-247-3939) in Beverly Hills, California, is one - minimum investment is $5,000. PFR currently manages around $2.5 billion worth of institutional assets, specializing in finding undervalued stocks with what might be called a contrarian eye. The Clipper Fund, PFR's largest retail portfolio, has shown the kind of stability that is prized in the institutional world. Clipper has never ranked in the bottom 25 percent of all growth funds and spent only one year in the bottom third. It has gained an average of 13 percent annually during the past four years. Clipper's expenses are higher than those of pension funds but about average for mutual funds, ranging from 1.12 percent to 1.17 percent of assets since 1989.<p>Another institutional manager turned retailer is Dimensional Fund Advisors (310-395-8005) in Santa Monica, California. Retail investors can buy shares in DFA mutual funds through financial advisors who can pool the assets of several clients to reach DFA's $50,000 minimum investment. DFA runs about $10 billion; its forte is specialized indexes. For instance, one of DFA's 16 retail funds, the U.S. 9-10 Small Portfolio, owns every NYSE-listed company that falls in the lowest 10 percent of market capitalization, plus Nasdaq and American Stock Exchange companies that are just as small or smaller. DFA's 6-10 Small Portfolio buys stocks in the bottom half of market capitalization.<p>Buying every stock that meets narrow criteria like these saddles investors with some losers, but it also ensures that portfolios mirror the performance of the larger group as a whole. This is not always achieved in traditional mutual funds. For instance, the median market capitalization of stocks in the DFA 9-10 portfolio is $66 million - truly small capitalization. Compare this to the average in many other so-called small-cap funds: hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars. <p>Another benefit of DFA funds: Like other index funds, their expenses are low, less than 0.7 percent of assets. Most small-cap funds run up expenses of 1.3 percent a year and higher. DFA offers international funds in stocks and bonds; single-country small-cap funds in Japan, the U.K., and Germany; small- and large-cap value portfolios invested in U.S. stocks; and three slices of the domestic bond pie. Where else can you buy a portfolio of small Japanese stocks for expenses that run to only 0.88 percent of assets a year?<p>Be cautioned: Such specialized portfolios can still be volatile. In 1987, for example, when U.S. investors were reeling from the market crash, the DFA Japanese Small Company portfolio showed a total return of 87.47 percent. Later, when the Japanese market tanked, the fund went with it, recording losses of 33.3 percent and 26.1 percent in 1990 and 1992, respectively, placing it at the bottom of the rankings made by Morningstar,  the mutual fund - rating service, for each of those years. <p><p><p>

Finally, strategies for selling get some attention <p>By Jim Melloan<p>The topic of when to sell a mutual fund has been given nowhere near the amount of ink as when to buy one. But the subject is slowly coming to the forefront of public consciousness as more investors conclude that "buy and hold" might not be the wisdom of the ages after all. <p>Just as there are a variety of theories on when and which funds to buy, so are there numerous strategies for selling. To some specialists in this area, maintaining a predetermined structure of asset allocation is paramount. As H. Lynn Hopewell, a financial planner in Falls Church, Virginia, puts it, "We know that by combining different kinds of asset classes we reduce risk. So if one fund suddenly comes to dominate the portfolio because it's done so well, to stick with it would be to increase the risk of the portfolio substantially."That, of course, is the opposite of what investors are trying to do. So, says Hopewell, "Always control for risk--sell off those suckers and get your portfolio back into balance."<p>Then there's Jay Schabacker, editor of the Mutual Fund Investing newsletter, who says he's never been that precise on his allocations. He also says that his thoughts on proper diversification change fairly often anyway. His advice is "Never sell a winner unless it looks like it's not going to become a continuing winner." It's certainly hard to dispute that counsel, vague though it may be. <p>Daniel Weiner, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, suggests that investors should stick with whatever style they're comfortable with. But he also cautions that selling off hot performers too often will result in a lot of taxable gains that are not offset with losses. Annual adjustments to rebalance a portfolio should be sufficient, Weiner believes.<p>Some of the most important considerations for selling a fund have to do with the changing needs and feelings of the investor. Someone approaching retirement may wish to sell aggressive funds and put the money into more conservative investments. Sometimes it's time to sell a fund simply because you need the cash--to buy a house, say. Taxes can provide another motive. Sheldon Jacobs, publisher of the No-Load Fund Investor, points out that taking a loss on a fund and switching to another can let the government share in the loss by providing an income-tax deduction. And it may be appropriate occasionally to correct for past overzealousness. Weiner cites the case of the investor who is starting to lose sleep over that stalled or sinking emerging-markets fund he excitedly bought a year ago in the midst of a meteoric rise. It may have been too aggressive an investment for him in the first place and not worth the continuous nail-biting. Readers have also written Weiner concerning their 18-fund portfolios. A number that high, he tells them, is more appropriate for a basket of stocks than a portfolio of mutual funds. It almost certainly indicates unnecessary duplication of asset classes, which means it's time to simplify. <p>Then there are times when it's necessary to react to changes in performance, personnel, or the overall economy. Experts are nearly unanimous in warning against selling a fund based on as few as one or two down quarters. The pros further agree that comparisons with benchmarks like the S&P 500 index are less valid than comparisons with other funds in the same asset class. If a fund goes for a whole year underperforming its brethren with similar objectives, it's time to "start scratching your head and find out why," says Hopewell. The consensus is that two full years of inferior performance are enough to force a switch. Also, reports Jacobs, net redemptions "are almost always symptomatic of serious problems."<p>Another consideration: Is your fund still playing its original role in your portfolio? A fund may undergo a metamorphosis into something with a style or objectives different from those for which it was originally bought. For example, a successful small-cap fund may find itself with more assets than it can prudently invest in small-cap companies and so turn into what's really a mid-cap fund. <p>Or something more radical may be going on, such as a wholesale move from utilities into health care. Then it's time to perk up and decide whether you want to get back to a fund that represents your intended asset class. Here your investment personality will come into play again: While Hopewell advocates getting rid of a fund that is "no longer behaving like it's supposed to," Schabacker says, "Sometimes I want a fund to change if this world is changing. The funds that don't change their style I don't think will do very well."<p>A change in managers deserves attention, too. Sometimes a new manager has been groomed by his predecessor and will carry on with similar objectives and a smooth transition; other times a novice or someone with radically different views will take the helm. Whatever the signals, it's usually okay to give the new manager a little time. Says Jacobs, "You want to see what the new person does. Even if the new person is incompetent, it takes him a while to screw it up."<p>Everyday nuisance-type problems, like late or inaccurate statements or dividend checks, may be a sign of overall incompetence at a firm and provide sufficient cause to switch. Differences in expense ratios are generally too piddling to worry about except in the lowest-yielding funds, such as money market or tax-free bond funds. "I'm looking at Fidelity Pacific Basin, which has a 1.8 percent expense ratio, on average [over the past three years]," says Schabacker. "So what? Because of the economic activity, they're going to make 20 to 30 percent. Expense ratios are not the buy or sell decision makers." <p>Finally, there's the economy--where you think it's going--and whether you want to be more active. Most experts agree that trying to time the stock market makes little sense. Jumping in and out as an investor rarely pays off. But that doesn't mean investors can't be more aggressive when the future looks bright, and more conservative when things look a little dim. Pros like Schabacker counsel investors to "get to know how the economy and inflation affect future markets, and you'll be a winner." Over time, though, the most reliable strategy is to stick with a solidly diversified portfolio, secure in the knowledge that, as Hopewell puts it, "every dog will have its day."<p><p>

Buying a newly built house today requires an ally<p>By Margaret Opsata<p>The term caveat emptor couldn't apply more to any class of consumer than to the people who build their own homes. "A crew of misfits, ex-felons, and drunkards labored on alternate Tuesdays to build our house while we stood by in horror," wrote Alan and Denise Fields in a book about the home they built in Monument, Colorado, in 1991. Adds George Birmingham Jr., a home inspector in Durham, North Carolina: "Probably 75 percent of homes built today are built badly." <p>The flight from quality in new-home construction places buyers in a precarious position these days. They're not only making the biggest investment of their lives, but they're also entrusting their family's comfort and safety to people who may not care as much as they should. "Thirty years ago, contractors had strict standards and put their reputation on the line with each house," says Birmingham. "Nowadays, many just subcontract the whole thing out and never look back." <p>But there's a way people building a new home can protect themselves: Hire an expert to sit on your side of the table. Independent inspectors can help homeowners avoid some of the most prevalent problems. These include shoddy work (improper site grading, incorrect installation of materials), ignorance of local building codes (walls too thin, stair clearances too low), and outright fraud. "Contractors substitute cheaper products all the time in places where the owner can't see them," says Peter Hollander, director of operations at the Portland, Maine, office of Criterium Engineers, a national home-inspection firm. A home buyer who pays for a moisture barrier in the exterior walls, for example, may get only felt paper, or nothing. Who's to know once the siding is up? <p>Homeowners need someone with a solid construction and engineering background but without ties to anyone involved with building the home to visit the site at key times: after the lot is graded, before the foundation is poured, after the rough framing is done, and after each subcontractor has finished. Most inspectors who provide this service charge $100 to $200 per visit, a cheap price to pay for peace of mind.<p>Some builders bar independent inspectors from their sites, while others try to influence the buyer's choice of whom to hire. Even those who say they are willing to work with an inspector of the owner's choosing sometimes "forget" to mention that the foundation is ready to be poured or the framing is done until the construction covers over the work. (Some contractors even try to convince home buyers to rely on the construction insurance. But since policies are bought and paid for by the builders, insurers have little incentive to see problems from the homeowner's side. "Some insurers deny practically every claim," Hollander says.) <p>Consequently, it's wise to engage the inspector before signing any construction contract or even making the final choice of a builder. "As a protection, spell out in the contract when inspections are to occur and the penalty each time your inspector is not notified," Hollander says. It's also not a bad idea to require the builder to get the inspector's approval before proceeding to the next level of construction.<p>Creating the right incentives can also help manage the contractor. Builders who offer financing usually have arranged with a lender to give them access to construction funds without "bothering" the buyers. "I have seen several builders draw out the money but never do any work," says Birmingham. Rather than financing through the builder, buyers should arrange their own construction loans so they can control when the contractor is paid. But controlling the purse strings provides little security if the buyers have no idea whether the work has been done properly. They still need an independent inspector in their corner, advising them when the builder deserves to be paid.<p><p><p>

						 <p>They can boost returns or serve as a hedging tool <p>By Robert W. Casey<p>The best-performing mutual fund? Odds are this quarter, like most quarters, it will turn out be a sector fund.<p>The worst one? Probably another sector fund. Maybe even one that was a stellar performer a few quarters back.<p>And that's the knock on these funds. Critics see them as a collection of shooting stars, rocketing to the top of the charts one quarter, plummeting the next. On average, sector funds seem to go nowhere. So why take the risk?<p>Let's acknowledge right here that sector funds are not CDs. Most are set up as nondiversified investment companies, meaning that they can__and often do__put more than 5 percent of their portfolios in one stock. They also concentrate on a single industry or economic sector. If it tanks, so does the fund. The result: A double dose of risk that's simply not appropriate as a stand-alone investment.<p>But what if you already have a well-diversified portfolio? In that case, sector investing can add horsepower to your returns. "It's essentially more juice for your dollar," says Ken Enright, portfolio manager for MFS Managed Sectors, a fund that rotates among a handful of promising sectors. They also can be used as a hedging tool.
Sector funds have been around for years, but sector investing came of age in 1981 when Fidelity introduced the first batch of its Select funds at the dawn of the bull market. Since then, the number of sector funds has mushroomed to a recent total of 176, with about $45 billion in assets, according to Morningstar Inc., the mutual fundtracking service.<p>While the sector-fund ranks always include big winners and big losers, investors on average have done well by them recently. For example, the average return for the domestic sector funds tracked by Morningstar was 28.8 percent for the year ending December 3, 1993. Compare this to a 7.8 percent return for the S&P 500.<p>How can you make sector investing work for you? Alfred M. Waddell, an investment advisor in Memphis, watches for sectors that start to perform better than the rest of the market, then looks for fundamental factors that will sustain the trend. He saw these factors in 1991 in regional banks. "If the Federal Reserve was going to get the economy healthy again, it had to get the banks healthy first," says Waddell. "We thought the regional-bank funds would continue to benefit from that trend and they did."<p>When you find an attractive sector, don't assume that every fund in that sector will perform similarly. For example, health care funds will perform differently depending on the relative weight they give to pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and medical-delivery stocks. Another example is utility funds. You might buy one expecting a good yield only to discover that the fund goes for growth by emphasizing telecommunications utility stocks. "There's a tendency to think of sector funds as homogeneous," says Don Phillips, publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds. "If utilities is in the name, it must be the same as any other utilities fund. But that's not true at all."<p>Before investing in a sector fund, think about how long you'll want to hold it. There's no reason, for example, why a high-quality energy fund such as Vanguard Specialized Energy might not make a good buy-and-hold investment. Yet sector investments are widely viewed as cyclical in nature. That's because the stocks of many industry sectors tend to rise and fall as investors anticipate the expansion and contraction of the economy. <p>Perhaps most importantly, consider how a sector fund will complement your investment portfolio. "The challenge for many investors in the '80s was how to analyze and select one fund," says Phillips. "But for people who already have a couple of funds in their portfolios, the question now is what to add to make it a better mix. And that's where sector funds can fit in very nicely."<p>A small investment in a technology sector fund, for example, can boost your return, says Phillips. On the other hand, adding exposure to sectors that do not move in sync with the market, such as gold or real estate, can reduce overall portfolio risk. "Funds that perhaps you wouldn't want to hold in isolation can be a great addition to an already diversified portfolio," he says.<p><p><p><p>

If you've lost money on your home, don't sell it<p>By Margaret Opsata<p>Uncle sam doesn't like people who lose money on their homes. And homeowners who don't realize it can end up digging themselves an even deeper hole. "People shouldn't think of residential real estate as an investment," says Kyn Dellinger, president of Bay Area Tax Consultants in San Bruno, California, "because the Internal Revenue Service doesn't view it that way." <p>When a homeowner makes money on the sale of a home, there's no problem. The profit is treated as a capital gain, just like any other investment and is taxed at 28 percent rather than at the owner's individual tax rate, which usually is higher. What's more, a home seller can usually avoid paying any tax at all by rolling the sale proceeds into a new home within two years or by taking a residential capital-gains exclusion (up to $125,000) available to everyone over 55. <p>Losers, however, are treated very differently. When a stock or bond is sold for less than it originally cost, an investor can use that loss to offset other investment income. But when a home sells for less than the owner originally paid, the loss is non-deductible.<p>Sellers who have refinanced to get at some of the equity in their homes are in for an even bigger shock. If the mortgage balance is larger than the sale price, not only is the loss non-deductible, most sellers are resigned to never seeing a penny because the lender has first claim on the sales proceeds. In fact, they'll have to dip into personal savings to make up the difference between the sales proceeds and the mortgage balance. And of course, if they want to buy another home, they also must scrape up enough extra cash to make the new down payment. But it can be quite a shock to find out that not one of these out-of-pocket costs is tax deductible.<p>Simply walking away from the whole mess or halting mortgage payments until the lender forecloses usually isn't a viable solution because the IRS considers such actions to be "sales," with the outstanding mortgage balance becoming the "selling price." In a supreme irony, owners who owe more on their mortgage than they paid for the house are even deemed to have made a profit when they abandon a property or let it slide into foreclosure. "People who refinanced for more than the original purchase price would not only lose their home and their good credit rating but also have to pay tax on the gain from the money they don't pay back," Dellinger says. <p>People stuck with their homes have only two realistic courses of action. They can sell at a loss, write it off to experience, tighten their belts, and move on. Or they can hang on to the property until the real estate market improves and values rebound. <p>From an investment standpoint, the latter is not a bad alternative. With property prices still low and interest rates poised to climb, it's a good time to buy real estate, so it stands to reason it's also a good time to hang on to real estate. Remember, because your investment is your down payment, not the value of the house, even a low rate of inflation will translate into very attractive returns. For example, a $50,000 down payment on a $300,000 house appreciating at 3 percent a year is earning 18 percent a year, tax free. <p>Homeowners who have had to move out (due to a job transfer, for instance) face a more complicated but potentially more lucrative situation. A house enjoys more favorable tax treatment as a rental than as a personal residence. In addition to interest, rental real estate can be depreciated, and other expenses (management fees, utilities paid, brokerage fees, maintenance costs, etc.) can be deducted against income.<p>With the rental market strong in many areas, homeowners who refinance at current low rates may find they can charge close to their monthly mortgage payments. When tax benefits are added in, that can provide a relatively painless way to wait for real estate values to recover. The only drawback is that when a home is rented, the owner's basis in the property is adjusted to fair market value at the time of conversion, if this is lower than the original purchase price, for the purposes of calculating depreciation. <p>But with rental property, the original purchase price less depreciation is still used to figure the capital gain or loss from sale. Thus, there will be no taxable gain if the home is sold for more than the value at the time of conversion to rental but for less than the original price. As usual, however, none of the loss is deductible.<p> <p><p>

Fund managers, reaching for higher returns, are buying restricted securities. Anybody remember what happened the last time they did this?<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>Conventional wisdom says that it takes roughly one generation before folks forget a scandal. What seems unforgettable today--Charles Keating's theft of millions from his unsuspecting bank depositors, for example--is soon time out of mind, destined only to be repeated some years hence. Time heals all wounds, after all; even those created by Wall Street scalawags and schemers. <p>Conventional wisdom, so often wrong, is right on about this. Investors' memories are shorter than a firecracker's fuse. Otherwise, why would no one be concerned about the new trend among mutual fund managers to buy restricted securities? More and more of them are doing it today, say our sources, in the search for higher yields and "cheaper" stocks. <p>Restricted securities are known as such because they trade relatively infrequently among institutional investors only and are not, therefore, easily dumpable. Restricted securities include stocks or bonds issued by private or foreign companies; they also may be stocks and bonds issued by well-known public companies but not registered for sale to individual investors. <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission relaxed the rules surrounding the sale of restricted stocks in 1990, and since then the number of issues has exploded. In the first half of 1993 alone, $73.2 billion was raised in private placements, an increase of 35 percent over the first six months of 1992. Companies like to float restricted stock or bond issues because they're a cheaper way to raise money. Registering securities for sale to individuals--in an initial public offering, for example--is a costly process. <p>Institutional investors have eagerly bought up these so-called private placements of restricted securities in recent years. Because issuers of these securities avoid registration costs, they pass some of these savings along to investors: Bonds or preferred stocks usually carry slightly higher yields than comparable securities, and stocks typically trade at a discount to freely swappable issues. In an overheated stock and bond market like ours, good values are harder to come by; so fund managers go off the beaten path to try to find them. One thing they found: Restricted securities.<p>As long as stock and bond prices are generally rising--as they have been recently--restricted securities are not highly risky because they are in demand among buyers. The only trouble comes when stock and bond prices start to fall and buyers start to evaporate. Then, restricted stocks decline in price further and faster than their more easily traded brethren. This is because the holders of these securities--institutions like mutual funds or brokerage firms--are limited in whom they can sell to: The buyer must be another institution. Sure, the institutional market is a huge one, but it is still smaller and more limited than the entire market of stocks and bonds that trade free and clear of restrictions. The fewer the buyers, the more difficulty the seller has unloading a position.<p>The last time fund managers were buying heavily into restricted stock proved how disastrous this can be. The year was 1968, exactly one generation ago. It was a period eerily like ours, in that investors were positively tripping over themselves to buy shares in hot mutual funds. Fund managers were becoming celebrities, and money flooded fund coffers. <p>One of the men of the moment was Fred Mates, a fund manager who had opened the Mates Investment Fund in August 1967. Mates was one of the "Three Freds"--Fred Alger and Fred Carr were the other two--famous for their aggressive and winning fund-management styles. (Of the three Freds, only Alger remains in the fund-management business today; Carr was disgraced by the fall of his junk-bond-laden Executive Life Insurance Co., and Mates died in 1982.) <p>Right out of the gate in '68, Mates's fund was a star performer; assets under management increased almost 100 percent in its first year of business, forcing Mates to close the fund to new investors. In September 1968, Mates bought 300,000 restricted shares of Omega Equities, a smallish conglomerate, in a private transaction. Omega was trading over-the-counter at around $24 at the time, but because the shares Mates was buying were unregistered, he paid only $3.25. A bargain. <p>Realizing that his Omega shares could not be sold, Mates valued them in his portfolio not at the $24 price that fully registered shares would command, but at a discounted price of $16 a share. Still, that gave the fund's net asset value a huge instantaneous profit of 500 percent in the Omega holding alone. Mates Fund assets, thanks in part to the Omega investment, were up 168 percent for the year. Shareholders were thrilled.<p>Mates was not alone in buying restricted stock. The late John Brooks recounted the tale in his splendid book The Go-Go Years: "The startling thing is not that Mates did it, but that it was being done all the time in 1968, by mutual funds and hedge funds...."<p>Disaster struck when the SEC halted trading in Omega Equities that December. Unable to liquidate his position in the stock, Mates suspended redemptions of his fund's shares. Investors were trapped. When they were finally allowed out of the fund six months later, Omega's stock was 50 cents a share, down 85 percent from Mates's original discounted price. The fund manager, up to that time a hero to the investing world, became an outcast.<p>That was then. A generation later, investing in restricted shares is back in vogue. <p>How can you tell if your fund is getting in on the restricted stock or bond act? Most funds have steered clear of investing in illiquid securities until now and are precluded from buying them by their own investment rules. If a fund manager changes his strategy to include investing in these issues, he must first ask for approval from shareholders. If your fund is one of those interested in purchasing restricted or, as they are sometimes called, Rule 144a securities, a discussion of this change in investment policies must come up for a vote in your fund's annual proxy statement. <p>Such a change was made last May by the <a name="FUND:LDDVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LDDVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lindner Dividend Fund</b></a>, a $1.3 billion (assets) fund that invests in mostly bonds or preferred stock for income-oriented investors. Its shareholders approved the move into restricted issues and, four months later, the fund's management had invested almost 5 percent of its assets in unregistered bonds or preferred stocks. Eric Ryback, manager of the fund, says he likes restricted securities because they carry yields that are 1.5 percent to 2 percent higher than comparable, liquid issues. <p>Lindner Dividend is a top fund. It was ranked number one among medium-term funds in last month's Worth mutual fund guide, in part for its stellar historic returns: up an average 14.5 percent in each of the past ten years. What's troubling is that its management, eager to maintain those high returns, believes it must turn to more exotic securities, thereby increasing its risk level. <p>Soon to follow suit is the Lindner Fund, a $1.4 billion (assets) growth fund that has had an enviable average annual return of 13 percent in the past five years. In its proxy dated September, fund comanager Ryback asked shareholders to approve changes in the fund's investment objectives to permit investments in restricted securities.<p>Ryback, 41, who has been comanaging the Lindner Fund since 1984, expects shareholders to approve the change in objectives for the fund. As for the problems that a down market might bring to his illiquid holdings, Ryback says he has no worries. "There's a market for [restricted stock]," he says. "With the explosion of mutual funds there is no shortage of buyers."<p>If shareholders in the Lindner Fund approve the change, its management will be allowed to invest up to 25 percent of the fund's assets in restricted securities. Interestingly, this is quite a bit more than what the SEC suggests fund managers buying illiquid securities should limit themselves to. When it relaxed the rules on trading in restricted securities among institutional investors three years ago, the SEC said that mutual funds should invest no more than 10 percent of assets in "illiquid assets." <p>Ryback says that the types of restricted shares he'll be investing in shouldn't be considered "illiquid"; therefore he can justify his 25-percent-of-assets limit. "They trade just about every day. We have sold large blocks; we're not worried," he says. Still, they are restricted securities not listed on a securities exchange and can only be bought and sold by institutions. This limits the universe of buyers available to someone who might want to sell a restricted stock.<p>Part of the reason Ryback sounds so unconcerned is that a computerized quotation system has been developed--called the PORTAL Market--which acts as a kind of clearing system for the trading of restricted securities among institutional investors. Portal provides greater liquidity to investors in restricted shares than existed in 1968. But no amount of computerized quotation systems can prevent a free fall in stock or bond prices when panicky sellers outnumber buyers.<p>Maybe there won't ever be another free fall in stock or bond prices. Maybe investors won't again experience the horror of watching their mutual funds' shares plunge in value because no buyers can be found for their restricted securities. Maybe this time the bubble won't burst.<p>Gerald Perritt, a Chicago-based small-cap stock-fund manager and editor of the newsletter Investment Horizons, isn't so sure. When he saw the change in the Lindner Dividend Fund's prospectus, he advised his newsletter readers to sell the fund's shares. Says Perritt: "Anytime I see a fund manager changing his objectives to fit into the current market environment, I head for the hills."<p>Fred Mates may be dead and gone, but the world should long remember the lessons his shareholders learned way back when. You know what they say about history and being doomed to repeat it. Let the investor beware.<p>Gretchen Morgenson is the executive editor of Worth.

Fund companies use tricks to make their returns seem better than they are. Here, some of the popular ones.<p>By Derrick Niederman<p>Everyone knows that mutual funds are sold largely on the strength of their past performance. Never mind that the past isn't prologue in the fund industry. Fund marketers know that good returns have an undeniable appeal to fund shoppers. <p>This puts pressure on fund managers to produce the kind of good numbers that make a fund hot. Nothing wrong with that--good numbers benefit shareholders as well as the fund-management company.<p>Trouble is, the obsession with returns has created an incentive for managers and marketers to take little liberties with their performance, to make it look perhaps even better than it is. For investors, it's helpful to know the tricks the trade uses to dress up results. That way, you can find the unvarnished truth about a fund's numbers.<p>
The Big Return: 
A mutual fund with a big aggregate return over a long time, say 200 percent over ten years, looks pretty good. After all, investors in the fund tripled their money. And dividing 200 percent by ten suggests an annual return of 20 percent, better than the S&P 500's 14.7 percent on average during the period. <p>Those assumptions are way high. Thanks to compounding, 200 percent over ten years represents an annual return of just 11.6 percent. Nothing to be ashamed of, but not 20 percent.<p>This confusion works to the advantage of marketers who advertise big numbers over long periods. They figure that dividing by ten is about as much math as a typical investor is willing to do.They're probably right.<p>Ads for the <a name="FUND:TEPLX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/TEPLX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Templeton Growth Fund</b></a>, for example, state that a $10,000 investment on November 29, 1954, would have been worth $1,844,602 by June 30, 1993. Powerful stuff. Less powerful is the fact that this is a 14.3 percent annual return. It's not misrepresentation--a 14 percent return is sensational if kept up. Still, $1.85 million looks more impressive than 14.3 percent annually ever will.<p>The more woeful the fund's performance, the more likely its performance will be stretched out over many years. Unless you can calculate square roots in your head, ignore the big numbers and look for compounded annual returns.If they're missing from the ads, ask for them when you call for information.<p>
The Ten-Year Drop-Off:
At the end of 1991, the ten-year compound annual return of the <a name="FUND:LOMCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LOMCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CGM Capital Development Fund</b></a> was 25.6 percent. That made it the single best growth fund in the country for that period. But by the end of 1992, that ten-year return dropped to 20.6 percent. Still impressive, but what happened to the extra 5 percent included in the previous year's numbers?<p>The obvious explanation would be that the fund did terribly in 1992. Not so. In 1992, CGM returned 17.5 percent--a little lower than its past annual standard but well ahead of the S&P 500's return of 7.6 percent. What actually happened was that at the end of 1992, the ten-year record no longer included 1982, a year in which the fund rose by 78.9 percent. <p>In this case, reported figures--using the ten-year magic number--do the fund a disservice. Remember, although long-term performance may be the best indicator of a good fund, high returns may be linked to an unusual event or market aberration. Look at the returns for each year. Uniformly good performance is better than a high ten-year figure that came from a few stellar years.<p>
The All-Important Time Period:
If a fund's marketer is clever about the time period he chooses to highlight, he can make a fund look much better than it really is or was. Between late 1990 and late 1992, for example, the five-year returns for almost any equity mutual fund would have been worse than the three-year figures. That's because, while the 1990 numbers included the 1987 crash, 1992's did not. Five-year figures are now safe from these games, since the crash is six years past.<p>Is a fund advertising its performance relative to some arbitrary point in market history?Take a moment to check. For example, as of the end of 1993, three-year return figures will no longer include the recession of 1990, in which the market dropped sharply during the second half. Because the Persian Gulf war rally began in mid-January, 1991 was an unusually good year to invest--but not a representative one. For funds that focus on a particular investment area (over-the-counter, gold, or health-care stocks), the choice of time period can have an even more misleading effect.<p>While we're talking numbers games, a word about percentages: Mutual funds and brokerage firms often brag in their ads about how their managers or analysts have outperformed the market averages. While all claims are vetted for accuracy, careless investors may think the returns more dazzling than they are. <p>In 1992, for example, Smith Barney  reported saying that its analysts' top stock picks for the previous year beat the market by 48 percent. Since the S&P 500 rose 30 percent that year, that meant the firm's picks gained by 44 percent.<p>Most investors would think that was just fine. So it is. But some, in a moment of lassitude, might think the wizards at Smith Barney had beaten the market by 48 percentage points--producing a 78 percent return--rather than 48 percent. Which would be, as the saying goes, too good to be true. <p>Contributing editor Derrick Niederman is a mathematician turned securities analyst.<p><p>

Today's highest-yielding funds may look muscular, but many are hooked on risk.<p>By Gregory Millman<p>June 25 was a black day for investors in Hyperion 1999 Term Trust. After months of denial, the bond fund's managers finally came clean. In a letter to the trust's shareholders, they laid out the facts: Hyperion's investors had lost 15 percent of their assets and could lose more. <p>Why? Because the supposedly conservative bond fund had taken a big risk and lost. In June 1992 its sponsors had raised $521 million by promising investors an 8 percent return at a time when most bond funds were yielding 7 percent. To achieve this boost in performance, the trust's managers had wagered nearly a third of its assets on a rise in interest rates by buying high-risk securities called interest-only strips. Instead, interest rates fell, and the price of the strips did too. As a result, for every $10 invested in June 1992, investors held shares worth just $8.38 on August 9, 1993. On top of that loss in principal, the fund's managers cut distributions to 7.25 percent.<p>That's quite a dive for a bond fund that seemed safe. In the words of the Hyperion prospectus, "all securities in which the Trust will invest will be either (i) issued or guaranteed by the United States government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities or (ii) at the time of investment, rated in the highest category by a nationally recognized rating agency--e.g., AAA by Standard & Poor's Corporation or Aaa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc." But these assurances aren't quite what they seem. The prospectus does not explain that government securities can be riskier than junk bonds, that a triple-A rating doesn't mean a thing, nor most significantly that fund yields won't survive the next turn in rates--and neither will an investor's principal.<p>Hyperion 1999 is just one example of what can happen in the current ultracompetitive climate for fixed-income investing. Traditionally, bonds and bond funds have been the choice of conservative investors. But as interest rates on everything from savings accounts to certificates of deposit to bonds themselves have declined, these conservative investors have become ravenous for higher yields. And bond marketers know it. That's why newspaper ads trumpet current yields in big, bold type--even though those yields can change sharply at any time. The financial press plays the same game. Endless lists tout the funds with the highest yield. In August, for example, one national personal-finance magazine touted the superior yield of <a name="FUND:MGIGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MGIGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Managers Intermediate Mortgage Fund</b></a>. At 12.7 percent, it yielded a third more than the second-best performer in its class.<p>But there's no free lunch in the bond world. Bond-fund managers know that nothing is easier than pumping up a fund's yield with a dose of financial steroids--although that means taking on risk that may lead to long-term financial debility. And at the moment Wall Street is awash in a kind of financial steroid called either a derivative or a synthetic. These are a new kind of security created by the financial revolution of the last decade.<p>Most of the time no one mentions just how risky these investments can be. The article on Managers Intermediate, for example, never said anything about risk--even though more than 20 percent of the fund is invested in derivatives whose value could nose-dive on the next rise in interest rates. The stakes are so high--winning a top ranking in a category for even one quarter of the year can add tens and often hundreds of millions in new assets to a fund--that managers aren't about to stress the downside of their products.<p>But something else is at work here besides predictable human greed. So new are many of these derivatives that none of the managers using them can predict their returns with any certainty. And so complex are these instruments that the average investor can't calculate the risk added to a bond fund by using derivatives. "There is hidden risk in these high yields," says Mark Cunningham of Buck Consultants, a New York firm that analyzes fixed-income securities. "But it takes a fortune in computers just to figure out what these funds are worth."<p>"Embedded in many of the bond funds now are IOs, POs, inverse floaters, some insane investment that no sensible person would buy with their own money if they knew they were really there," says Paul DeRosa, president of Eastbridge Asset Management, an institutional money manager in New York. And DeRosa is one of the people who helped invent the derivative markets while at Citibank in the early 1980s. The situation is so laden with the potential for abuse that one mutual fund expert, Ron Santangelo of Prudential Securities in New York, suggests that investors avoid the highest-yielding funds. "If one fund yields 50 to 100 basis points [100 basis points make up one percentage point] higher than similar funds, that's a flashing red light," he says. Investors in conventional bond funds worry about losing their capital if rates go up. Investors in funds that rely too heavily on derivatives can lose their shirts no matter which way rates head before they even know they are in danger.<p>The old-fashioned way to deliver higher than average yields is simply to buy bonds that don't mature for 10, 20, or 30 years. Long bonds usually pay higher interest than short bonds to compensate investors for the substantial risk that inflation and interest rates could surge before their bonds mature, which would erode the value of their investment. "In 1985 or 1986 we had a lot of money coming into long government-bond funds," says John Rekenthaler of Morningstar, a mutual fund advisory service. "A lot of money came into the funds in '87, and then interest rates rose and scared hell out of those folks." After that experience, brokers started offering shorter-term funds.<p>But interest rates, especially rates on short- and intermediate-term bonds, have fallen steadily during the last five years. "In 1989, the standard intermediate-term bond fund offered yields of 8.5 percent to 9 percent," says Paul DeRosa. "Under present circumstances that same fund would probably have difficulty delivering more than 5.5 percent." Short-term funds show even lower yields.<p>To many fund managers, derivatives seem like a heaven-sent way out of this bind. Derivatives, which don't behave at all like traditional bonds, are by-products of a financial revolution that has gone unnoticed by most people who don't work for investment banks. During the 1980s, as financial deregulation made trading stocks less profitable for Wall Street's big firms, these investment houses began to create new services--products actually--that they could sell to the institutional money managers. Hotshots, called rocket scientists, with engineering, physics, or math degrees from MIT or UCLA divided financial instruments the way physicists analyzed subatomic particles.<p>For example, mortgages pay principal and interest for as long as 30 years. But most investors aren't inclined to hold on to a security for that long. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association and the Federal National Mortgage Association, the quasi-governmental agencies that buy mortgages from banks and savings and loans, and the agencies' investment bankers have designed derivatives to meet the demand for long-, short-, and medium-term investments. First, the mortgages are turned into securities called collateralized mortgage obligations or CMOs. The cash flows from a pool of mortgages are divided up into pieces, each with specific characteristics such as duration (a number that measures how long investors have to wait for the cash that an investment throws off), yield, and risk. For example, investors who bought a security that was backed by a specific part of the pool might look to get all their principal back in seven years.<p>To turn this instrument into a derivative, an investment banker will then customize it. For example, maybe an institutional investor wants a lump sum at regular intervals with the chance for some extra return if interest rates fall. Sell that client just the principal payments on a pool of mortgages. Such a derivative is called a PO, for principal only. Or how about buying just the interest payments, a derivative called an IO, for interest only. Or an inverse floater, which pays more when rates fall and less when rates rise. In June, the newsletter Inside Mortgage Securities estimated that more than half of all mortgage securities outstanding were in the form of derivatives--nearly $730 billion of $1.4 trillion. <p>Like electrons and protons, each derivative behaves differently. For example, anyone who expected interest rates to fall would buy a PO, because homeowners would refinance their mortgages as rates went down. The investor would thus get his cash payments of mortgage principal more quickly. By contrast, someone who expected rates to rise would buy IOs, because homeowners would be unlikely to refinance and the investor could look forward to a long stream of interest payments.<p>Any investor who buys an IO or a PO or any other derivative is making a highly leveraged bet on the future--which is why these securities can go up or down so much faster and so much further than plain vanilla bonds. What is the right price to pay for a stream of payments that might last 30 years--or maybe just 15? "Everybody is guessing, making judgments on the basis of past experiences and expectations," says Thomas Poor, managing director of Scudder, Stevens & Clark, a Boston mutual fund company that uses derivatives in its fixed-income funds. "But it's an inexact science. That's why collateralized mortgage obligations yield more than treasuries."<p>In the right interest-rate environment and in the hands of the right manager, these exotic securities are everything an investor could ask for and more. <a name="FUND:SCSTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SCSTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>The Scudder Short-Term Bond Fund</b></a> shows a total return of 7.6 percent during the past 12 months. About 10 percent of the fund's holdings consist of inverse floaters, says Poor. The closed-end TCW/DW Term Trust 2002 fund, though AAA rated by Standard & Poor's, is more than 40 percent invested in inverse floaters. Investors think so highly of the fund's prospects that its shares trade at a price above the value of the bonds it holds. "The only way you can outperform in the marketplace is by buying things that are not as well understood [by the average money manager] or by taking massive guesses," TCW's Philip Barach says. "It's very hard to get inverse floaters [now]. They were probably one of the cheapest fixed-income securities of the 20th century. Now they're incredibly desirable; everyone in the world wants them. TCW overall probably owns close to a billion dollars of them."<p>The results at these funds have encouraged other fund managers to follow suit. According to data provided by Morningstar, nearly three dozen open-ended fixed-income mutual funds have committed from 5 percent to 40 percent of their portfolios to such volatile and illiquid instruments as IOs and inverse floaters. (For a list of these funds, see "High on Derivatives?") Closed-end funds, which issue shares that trade on stock exchanges and often borrow to leverage their assets, are even more aggressive. It's not unusual to find closed-end funds with 20 percent to 40 percent of their portfolio in these instruments. (For a list of these funds, see "The Worst Addicts.")<p>So if these funds have done well with derivatives, what's the big problem? Shouldn't investors just go out and buy shares in a "good" fund? From his cramped 23rd-story office at Buck Consultants in midtown Manhattan, Mark Cunningham has developed a frightening answer to that question. Cunningham, whose office is cluttered with heaps of math and engineering textbooks, is a kind of reverse rocket scientist. Big institutional clients pay him to apply mathematical tools like Bayesian analysis, the same technique that discovered the link between smoking and cancer, to figure out where the rockets launched by the Wall Street hotshots will come down. These methods tell him that investing in some of these funds is like buying a ticket in the interest-rate lottery.<p>For example, Cunningham's analysis of the Scudder Short-Term Bond Fund shows an 80 percent increase in volatility in the fund over the last year. After perusing a list of the securities it held in 1992, Cunningham says, "Looking at this portfolio, we can't tell how the fund will behave. A lot of these will zig when they should be zagging." <p>If Cunningham can't figure out the risk in one of these funds, what hope is there for the average investor? Most investors don't even understand what kinds of risk to look for, says Rick Siedband, assistant vice president at Piper Capital Management, a money-management firm based in Minneapolis. The average investor thinks of risk only as credit risk, he notes, and looks for a government guarantee that the issuer of the paper won't default. But a government guarantee is no protection against interest-rate risk. If the security is an inverse floater and rates go up, cash flows to investors will plummet with or without the government guarantee. A top rating from S&P or Moody's also guarantees only the creditworthiness of the issuer.<p>Investors who would never gamble in the roll-the-dice world of commodities and options have put money into derivative-laden mutual funds because they have read the reassuring words AAA rated and government guaranteed. But they are actually playing the same sort of game. Buyers of IOs, for example, pay today for what they hope will be a long stream of interest payments tomorrow. IOs don't pay any principal, so when a homeowner prepays his mortgage, the interest payments stop cold and the IO holder gets nothing. Like an option buyer, an IO buyer pays up-front for an instrument that may expire worthless. But in one way, IOs are even riskier than options. The options trader needs only to be right about the price or rate direction. To succeed in IOs, it's not enough to be right about rates; the buyer also needs to be right about what homeowners will do when rates move up or down.<p>Recent experience shows that behavioral patterns are a lot harder to predict than Wall Street's rocket scientists initially thought. After studying the ways in which millions of homeowners paid or refinanced their mortgages for the past few decades, Wall Street was pretty confident that the homeowner's threshold of pain was about 2 percentage points. As long as there were fewer than 200 basis points--or 2 percentage points--between the rate on a homeowner's existing mortgage and current mortgage rates, homeowners wouldn't refinance. As long as homeowners endured the pain, everyone's investment would behave predictably and no one would lose serious money.<p>But last year Wall Street suddenly realized that the rule of thumb wasn't true anymore. When the financial scientists weren't looking, fee-hungry mortgage bankers made refinancing a lot easier. "Some of our contacts are seeing people refinance at as low as a 75-basis-point spread between the current mortgage on their property and what's available in the marketplace," says Prudential's Ron Santangelo. "In this environment we've seen IOs decrease as much as 50 percent in value just over the last 12 months." <p>Many investors were drawn to Hyperion 1999 by the name of Lew Ranieri, the legendary Salomon Brothers mortgage-bond trader. Ranieri founded Hyperion Capital Management in 1989 after he was pushed out of Salomon by then-chairman John Gutfreund. Despite Ranieri's fame, his massive gamble on IOs shocked some of the gutsiest managers in the fixed-income world. "Anybody managing money would know it's not prudent, logical, or a good bet to make," says TCW's Philip Barach, who attended Hyperion's road show.<p>Anybody managing money would spot the risk, but how about the average individual investor who bought into this fund--or any of the others that are heavily into these derivatives? Hyperion, which would not comment on its fund's performance, certainly disclosed its investment strategy. The initial offering prospectus states that the fund will invest in IOs, for example, which have "significantly greater price and yield volatility than is the case with traditional debt securities." The fund's November 1992 annual report says that 32.7 percent of the fund's portfolio is invested in these stripped mortgage-backed securities.<p>But experts who work with these funds doubt that this kind of disclosure is sufficient. "A lot of times I will see pie charts with portfolio breakdowns that don't always represent the true risk of the pieces of paper they own," says Prudential's Santangelo. A Scudder brochure, for example, simply lists the holdings of the Scudder Short-Term Bond Fund as 1 percent cash, 22 percent mortgage, 18 percent asset-backed, 9 percent collateralized mortgage obligation, 21 percent corporate, 9 percent reverse floating rate, 9 percent government, 6 percent foreign pay, and 5 percent Yankee/Supranational Agency. And would the majority of people who see the name FBC Mortgage Securities Trust 18 CMO Series A in another fund's financials recognize that it is a residual, one of the riskiest derivative instruments?<p>"I'm not sure if it's deliberate action on the part of many fund managers or the fact that it's not required of them to list it as such, so they don't," Santangelo says. "I think all the risks of a piece of paper should be properly disclosed, especially if it's not of the normal nature you would expect." <p>The regulators and the raters contribute to the problem. There's nothing illegal about disclosing a list of securities without explaining precisely what they are or how they behave. "As long as you disclose what you're going to do, you can do almost anything," says Eastbridge's DeRosa. "I can say I'm going to put one third of the fund's money in high-coupon IOs. High-coupon IOs may be one of the riskiest investments on the face of the earth, and the SEC may or may not appreciate that potential investors don't have even the slightest idea of what a high-coupon IO is. But so long as it's revealed in the offering document, it goes through."<p>The SEC's effort to encourage the mutual fund industry to produce clearly written, easily understood prospectuses has left the agency with little wiggle room. "It seems to be contrary to go back to funds and say, 'Use a page for every derivative you're going to do,'" says Gene Gohlke, associate director for compliance in the SEC's Investment Management division. "If you do that, you probably come out with a 20- or 30-page document nobody would read. How do you convey the essentials of these very complex instruments so the average person who doesn't even know what a stock is can understand it?" He says that the agency has directed its inspectors to "look more closely at funds that are using derivatives in a major way and compare that to the disclosure in the prospectuses," but notes that "based on our experience doing inspections, we haven't had any significant problems with the disclosures that funds have in comparison with what they're doing."<p>Investors shouldn't expect much help from the rating agencies either. Even the riskiest funds can secure a AAA rating for credit quality. Russell Long, director of Standard & Poor's mutual fund ratings group, says, "Right now our analysis is a credit-risk analysis; it doesn't incorporate the other type of risks that are in bond funds." Fitch Investors Service in New York recently launched a rating service that could tell investors at a glance about those other risks in a fund. Not surprisingly, fund managers aren't exactly lining up to have their portfolios rated by Fitch. <p>A few financial regulators have admitted that they're as confused as investors. They've formed a support group formally named the Financial Innovations Study Committee but known by everyone as the Weird Instruments Committee. This group of tax lawyers, economists, accountants, bankers, and regulators is trying to understand the implications of several hundred new high-tech financial products. "It's clear that the IRS and all the other regulatory agencies are behind the curve in figuring out what to do with the new instruments," says Joanne Medero, former general counsel to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and now a partner with the law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. No one expects any concrete recommendations from this group soon.<p>In the meantime investors are on their own. And maybe they would do best to follow the rule of thumb suggested by one analyst who knows the market well: "If I can't explain it to my mother, I won't buy it."<p>

 TROUBLE WITH FUND WRAPS 
<p>
What to ask  
<p>
 By Andrew Gluck  
<p>
 With some 3,700 mutual funds to choose from, putting together
a portfolio of more than a couple of funds can be a daunting
task. So investors who don't have the time to become mutual fund
experts have little choice but to pay for some help.  
<p>
 Traditionally, fund investors have gotten advice in exchange
for paying commissions. But growing numbers of investors are
seeking no-load funds that forego the up-front commissions and
allow more investment dollars to start earning from day one.
So the big Wall Street brokerages, with their huge sales forces,
are changing their stripes. The brokerages and mutual fund companies,
which till now have given fund advice only on a commission basis,
are rolling out no-load fund advisory packages. They're billed
as mutual fund wrap accountsa name that suits them well, since
some basic information about them is being kept under wraps.<p>
<p>
 On the surface, mutual fund wrap accounts are a great idea.
They combine all the advantages of no-load mutual funds with
the commission-free investment advice of wrap accounts. Investors
who want to put at least $25,000 in no-load funds can get advice
about which funds to buy, in most cases for an annual fee of
1.5 percent of the amount invested plus all the usual fund operating
expenses, which usually range up to another 1.5 percent. The
brokerages say investors get custom-tailored, long-term investment
programs that are reviewed and updated quarterly.  
<p>
 Unfortunately, many mutual fund wraps come up short when compared
with the available alternatives. They can be more costly and
less personalized, and they offer only a limited number of funds
from which to build a portfolio. The people who sell them aren't
always clear about the total fees charged, and perhaps worst
of all, performance figures for comparison shopping can be difficult,
if not impossible, to get.  
<p>
 In November 1991, the Consulting Group of Shearson Lehman Brothers
(now part of Smith Barney) introduced the first of the brokerage-house
wrap programs, the TRAK Personalized Investment Advisory Service.
It's been a marketing success, attracting 40,000 investors and
$1.5 billion. In January of this year, Prudential Securities
launched Target, its version of the fund wrap account.   
<p>
 Brokerage rival Kidder, Peabody & Co. in March began offering
Insight, its fund wrap account, using Kidder's existing family
of funds to build client portfolios. Merrill Lynch expects to
roll out its version of the fund wrap this fall.  
<p>
 Although some programs are more personalized than others, the
broker-sold products all work basically the same way: The investor
fills out a questionnaire that asks about personal financial
goals and investment history, and the answers determine the client's
risk tolerance. (Prudential's and Shearson's questionnaires consist
of eight and nine questions respectively, while Kidder's includes
30.) Based on their answers, clients are scored and categorized
by their risk profiles.   
<p>
 Each risk category has a different mix of stock, bond, and money-market
funds. Going beyond the basic classifications of conservative,
moderate, and aggressive risk profiles, Shearson and Kidder each
have seven risk categories and Prudential has 20. After a client
is classified into one of the risk categories, the mix of recommended
funds gets fine-tuned by a stockbroker. Investors receive a quarterly
report on their performance and, if needed, recommendations are
made about which mutual funds to switch out of and into.  
<p>
 But rather than allow investors to pick from all the no-loads
already on the market, Prudential created a family of nine funds
and Shearson created a family of 12 funds that are used exclusively
for the fund wrap programs.   
<p>
 While the workings of fund wraps are easy for a broker to explain,
investors buying them may not be told exactly what they're getting.
That's because the brokerage firms often won't disclose how the
various portfolios have performed. Both Prudential and Shearson
declined to provide performance data on the risk categories their
programs use. "Some firms appear to be going out of their way
to keep investors from having the information necessary to make
an informed decision," says Don Phillips of Morningstar, which
tracks fund performances. "They're attempting to go back to the
dark ages of investing, where they control the data flow to clients.
From an investor's point of view, it's nuts."  
<p>
 Shearson and Prudential have not only refused to tell prospective
buyers how their portfolio recommendations have worked out, but
they've also declined to publish total returns for the funds
used in their wrap accounts. Nor does either firm provide total
return statistics to mutual fund research firms, such as Lipper
Analytical Services and Morningstar. Kidder Peabody was the exception,
saying it would provide the press and customers with quarterly
performance data on its Insight mutual fund wrap program.   
<p>
 Shearson and Prudential are not alone in making it hard to get
performance figures on fund wraps. Fidelity Investments, the
nation's largest mutual fund company, offers its Portfolio Advisory
Services for investors with at least $100,000. PAS uses Fidelity's
funds to design portfolios, and its fees are a bit lower. But
like its competitors, Fidelity does not provide prospective investors
with performance data on its eight portfolios.   
<p>
 With only one of the major firms that offer fund wraps disclosing
how the product is performing, investors are likely to have a
tough time shopping for the best program. But if the difficulty
of getting performance data isn't enough to turn off potential
clients, they also need to be wary of a salesperson's inaccurate
description of fees for a fund wrap account.  
<p>
 A Fidelity sales representative told a Worth caller recently
that the charges for Portfolio Advisory Services would include
a 1 percent wrap fee plus the management expenses on the mutual
funds selected. Actually, PAS charges a 1 percent wrap fee plus
the fund's total operating expenses, which could mean an annual
fee that's 30 percent to 40 percent higher than what Fidelity's
representative indicated.   
<p>
 Indeed, Fidelity even went so far as to publish a chart in its
PAS Fact Sheet that compared its 1 percent fee to the 3 percent
that equity wrap accounts charge. The chart failed to mention,
however, that the 3 percent includes all costs, while investors
in the PAS also pay fund expenses that raise the comparable figure
to about 2.5 percent.  
<p>
 Calls to Shearson and Prudential branches in New York also yielded
inaccurate information about fees for their programs. Brokers
at both firms assured a caller that the total expenses on TRAK
and Target included only the 1.5 percent wrap feenothing else.
Even when asked about additional fees, the brokers didn't mention
the charges for the funds' total operating expenses, which add
about .8 percentage points a year for a bond fund and as much
as 1.5 percentage points for a stock fund.  
<p>
 Despite the difficulty of getting accurate expense information
and any performance data, the fund wrap accounts being offered
by the major players may turn out to be sound investments. But
investors may do better getting fee-only advice from a financial
planner or money manager. Investors generally pay between .5
percent and 1.5 percent of assets per year for an independent
advisor to select and manage a portfolio of mutual funds. These
advisors are likely to work with hundreds of well-known no-load
funds whose performance is published in magazines, newspapers,
and fund services. And they usually provide more personalized
help with building and monitoring a mutual fund portfolio.  <p>

CD investors have finally joined the mutual fund bandwagon--that's not good news<p>By Jonathan Burton<p>Grand central station, 8 a.m. bleary commuters pour from packed trains to flow into thick Manhattan crowds. Breaking free for a moment, Thomas Derderian stops at a nearby Dreyfus investment center. His certificates of deposit are maturing, and the 48-year-
old president of the Redding Group, a New York advertising agency, bristles at the meager yields he is getting from his bank. For the first time ever, he is considering mutual funds. Derderian is no home-run hitter; 8% a year would do just fine. He takes a prospectus for the <a name="FUND:DGRIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/DGRIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dreyfus Growth & Income Fund</b></a>, which gained 20% in 1992. Yes, he says, stocks are risky, but name an alternative. "If I could get the same rate in the bank," he admits, "I wouldn't be here."<p>Say hello to one of Wall Street's latest believers. For the last 18 months, people like Derderian have been pouring billions into equity mutual funds, those that invest in stocks. In 1992 alone more than $71 billion flowed into these funds__that's $71 billion net after subtracting the money that flowed out as investors sold funds to pay for college, retirement, or a vacation, or just to lock in profits. And the flood shows no sign of retreating. In the first quarter of 1993, $27.2 billion of net new money gushed into the pool. This new money has considerably expanded the ocean of money in equity mutual funds__only $529 billion in all.<p>This flood hasn't gone unnoticed by the pundits who vie to explain Wall Street. In late March and early April, for example, the economy seemed sluggish, but the market wouldn't stop its assault on new heights. Why? All the liquidity in the market from mutual funds, the analysts answered. "Beyond any question of improving economic growth and corporate profits, just about any Wall Street analyst will tell you 'liquidity' is what's keeping the stock market afloat right now," opined the Associated Press on April 12. In fact, several analysts suggested, the market couldn't fall while all this excess cash needed to be invested.<p>What may be more significant than the amount of this inflow, however, is the kind of people behind it. People like Thomas Derderian, who are lifetime savers rather than investors. These CD refugees held onto their federally insured accounts while interest rates shrank from 8% to 7% to 6% and then to 5%. Only when rates plunged below 4% did they start to consider trading safety for yield. They have been virtually pushed into mutual funds. And that's precisely what worries some mutual fund managers and industry observers. This new money is hot money. It moved massively into the market, without much fundamental conviction, when the deal got too good to turn down. Implication: It could flow out just as quickly.<p>"These are conservative investors," warns Eric Kobren, editor of the "Fidelity Insight" newsletter. "If the market does take a tumble here, we could see them head for the hills."<p>Richard Hoffman, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Co., agrees. "The money that's coming into the mutual fund industry is not long-haul money," he surmises. "Once they hit that first pocket of volatility, these people will become frightened, and it will just accelerate the volatility."<p>"The new investors are savers, and they don't understand risk," explains Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "They have moved from a CD to a mutual fund, and many of them think they have price stability__and they don't." Adds Johnson warily, "I don't want to be around when they find out."<p>In other words, when the market hits its next bad stretch__call it a correction or a bear market__this money could stampede out of mutual funds as fast as it's flowed in. The money that came in near the top, that may even have kept the market creeping those last few inches higher, could make the downdraft all the stronger. Panicky shareholders could jam the toll-free telephone lines of the giant mutual fund families, demanding an instant divorce. Fund managers, who on average are keeping about 10% of their holdings in cash, would then use this supply to absorb the initial shock wave. Once cash positions run low, the funds would have no recourse except to liquidate securities into a declining market. That in turn could exacerbate the downward spiral and encourage even more share redemptions over a period of several demoralizing days. "It could be," ventures Barbara Morrow of Barronett Global Investors, "like a big margin call on the whole market."<p>THE DANGER SIGNS<p>In 1991 health care and biotechnology stock funds were on fire. That year, 26-year-old Charles Mangum guided <a name="FUND:FSHCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSHCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity Investments' Select Medical Delivery Fund</b></a> to a 78% gain, and investors clamored to get aboard. Mangum remembers watching the money roll in. First the fund hit $50 million, up from $38 million in 1990. Then $100 million. Then $200 million. As the money arrived, he funnelled it into ever more expensive health care and biotechnology stocks. The glowing stories in the business press started to make him wince. He wondered how many new investors were adding their money to his fund without understanding the risk. Finally in early 1992, the bubble burst. Investors who had bought into the fund in mid January bailed out in February__after losing 15% of their investment. After peaking at $1.7 billion in December 1991, assets of <a name="FUND:FSPHX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSPHX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity's Health Care Fund</b></a>, which Mangum started to manage in early 1992, plunged to $500 million by the end of April 1993. The sobering experience left an indelible mark on Mangum. "If you met me, you'd swear I was 40," he says.<p>That example, of course, involves just a small sector and a single industry. Is such a bleak scenario likely for equity mutual funds as a whole? Well, part of that scenario is absolutely certain to happen. There will be an end to the current bull market, and that end will be marked by a correction of noticeable magnitude. The question isn't if. It's when. Peter Lynch, who ran <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity's Magellan Fund</b></a> for 13 years and who writes a column for this magazine, is a long-term investor who has little use for attempts to time the market. But he does observe that major stock market corrections do appear with a surprising degree of regularity. On average, he states bluntly, "every two years the market has a 10% decline. Every six years: 25%." When was the last time the Dow Jones Industrials were zapped for 25% of their value at one sitting? October 1987. The average bull run lasts 37 months. This one is already 33 months old.<p>Some of the smart money is clearly rattled at the moment. "I've got more cash in my personal account than I usually have," concedes a veteran Wall Street stock picker who prefers to remain anonymous. Says M. Kimelman & Co. director Bernadette Murphy, "Usually we have a summer rally. I'm concerned this year we might have a summer sell-off." Investment sage Warren Buffett has told his flock that "the rewards from investing over the next decade will be significantly smaller than they were in the last." Lord Abbett partner John Walsh observes euphemistically that in the equity market ahead, "selectivity's going to be much more important."<p>Individually several mutual fund managers are reducing their own exposure by shutting the barnyard gate. This at least might minimize the amount of money coming in that must be invested at current high market valuations. <p>During the first few weeks of this year, <a name="FUND:STCSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/STCSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Strong Common Stock Fund</b></a> was deluged with $5 million in new commitments every day. From January through March the fund more than doubled in size, to $390 million from $179 million, according to managers Richard Weiss and Carlene Murphy. "We can't find enough stocks to soak up all that money," Weiss said just before they closed the fund to new investors on March 19.<p>Many managers have made similar decisions for their portfolios. Eric Ryback closed the <a name="FUND:LDDVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LDDVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lindner Dividend Fund</b></a> on March 4 when assets reached $1 billion. In February Thomas Marsico stopped taking deposits for the Janus Twenty Fund, citing a desire to run a concentrated portfolio. Robert Bacarella closed his popular Monetta Fund to new investors in March, when its assets reached $500 million.<p>"This is a stressful period for us managers," says Lawrence Auriana, co-manager of the <a name="FUND:KAUFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/KAUFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kaufmann Fund</b></a>. His fund took in $200 million in the first ten weeks of 1993, or about $3 million a day. "When things are going well, we're very nervous. We know the market is both cyclical and volatile, and we've been through enough bear markets over the last 25 years that we've seen it all. Hopefully a lot of these investors will be able to withstand a decline, but we're not betting the fund that they will." <p>Of course, most of the big money isn't getting out of the market. It can't afford to. Money managers aren't paid to sit on the sidelines for months while they wait for the inevitable correction. No, even though everyone knows market timing is a fools' game, much of the big money is betting it can call the turn. In March, equity fund managers had just 9.9% of their assets in cash. That's up from 8.9% in January, but not by much. Says Barton Biggs, who's in charge of global asset allocation at <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a>, "It's the sixth or seventh inning of the game, not the ninth inning. In our business, we can't afford to leave the game in the sixth or seventh inning." <p>The numbers suggest that it is indeed late in the game. For most of the past two decades, companies have traded, on average, at a modest 12 times what they were expected to earn per share over the year to come. But stocks in the first few months of 1993 hovered near a heady 22 times forward earnings per share. This is among the highest ratio since these figures were first collected in 1926. How can a slow recovery, with the economy barely ticking upward at 1.8% a year (according to the first quarter 1993 figures from the Commerce Department) justify these prices? And what about suggestions that we're sliding back into recession or that inflation is returning? Is anything more than excess liquidity__the torrent of money into equity funds included__propping up the market?<p>Rest assured there's a lot more liquidity where the first quarter of 1993's $27.2 billion came from. About $3.3 trillion is idling in short-term instruments. Dominating this landscape is a mountain of CD dough more than $700 billion high, say Federal Reserve surveyors. In April alone, $110 billion of CDs came due.<p>Yet in the absence of economic and earnings growth that would catch the market up to its current valuations, all that liquidity is just expanding the bubble and raising the decibel levels of the bang when it bursts. The long-term investor__and all the numbers still say that equities are the place to be long-term__needs to understand how a short-term puncture of a speculative bubble or a longer-lasting bear market affects a portfolio.<p>NAME YOUR SCENARIO<p>If the hot money in mutual funds poses a danger to mutual fund investors, the magnitude of that danger__and any decision on what to do about it__depends on the size of any correction. A short, sharp nosedive like that of October 1987 is very different from the long grinding bear market of, say, 1973 through 1974. The ramifications would be very different too.<p>The October 19, 1987 crash, which slashed 22.6% off the Dow in a single day, collared a bull market already in its fifth year. So many investors were led to the guillotine, says Ralph Wanger, manager of the Acorn Fund, that it seemed Wall Street had taken a page from the French Revolution. "One day you felt fine," Wanger observes. "The next day your head was in the basket."<p>Few people predicted the fall. Equity mutual fund assets had doubled between January 1986 and August 1987, soaring to $243 billion from $120 billion. Eric Ryback was managing the Lindner Dividend Fund in St. Louis when the crash came. "Everybody was saying the market was too high, but no one was reacting to it," he recalls. "There was a lot of euphoria." <p>When the October surprise came, many shareholders bailed out of Ryback's and most every other fund. That emotional decision forced many fund managers to liquidate securities in order to satisfy skittish investors who wanted to sell, even if they were convinced that the damage was done and the market would bounce back. Fidelity's Magellan Fund, for example, had been 98.6% invested on October 19. As the market went into a free fall that day, it raised cash by unloading $1 billion worth of stocks. Most fund investors wanted no part of the stock market. Industrywide, redemptions outpaced new sales by $1.2 billion in October, and investors continued to redeem more than they put in for all of 1988, pushing the total for that year to $8.5 billion in net redemptions. Investors closed almost a million equity-fund accounts that year.<p>But some investors couldn't panic in October; they were saved by jammed phone lines and overwhelmed mutual fund staffs. Forced to stay invested during the crash itself, they didn't sell at the panicky bottom. Within three months the market had recovered all that it had lost in October.<p>Ryback actually went fishing in Idaho for a week. When the market tanked, Ryback told his boss, Kurt Lindner, that he would cancel the trip, but Lindner urged him to go. "He said, 'I can't think of a better thing to do,'" says Ryback. <p>But the 1987 crash, while certainly traumatic, wasn't the classic bear market: a market that goes down, and down, and down__and stays down. "Once every 20 years, we have a secular bear market," says Barton Biggs. "They're a real killer. The Dow and the S&P go down 40% to 50%. That's when people in those mutual funds are going to get their clocks cleaned. The last one we had was in 1973-'74. A secular bear market really does a lot of emotional damage." Adds Kenneth Tarr, president of Credit Suisse Asset Management, "There is an event in every generation's lifetime that separates people from their capital. We have not had one yet."<p>Those who have been through a bear market never forget it. As a young clerk on the floor of New York Stock Exchange in the early 1960s, First Albany's Johnson recalls, "I thought it was onward and upward forever. Boy, oh boy, did I learn."<p>That bear, like the 20 others since 1890, eventually ended, but not before most investors threw in the towel in disgust. Of course, Johnson explains, "that's when you want to buy." Trouble is, that's precisely when investors have neither the stomach nor the cash to take the plunge. "It's easy for us to talk about it now," says Johnson. "But when it's happening, believe me, emotions often tend to interfere with good strategies. That's why you try your best to develop discipline." Yet investors caught in the fierce grip of a bear tend to react without much creativity or discipline. They despair. <p>The extended downturn of January 1973 through December 1974__the last significant bear market__shaved 45% off the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Sickened investors dumped equities, swamping the funds with redemptions. Many of today's investors, too young to remember the early 1970s, think of the October 1987 crash as the epitome of a bear market; they have difficulty comprehending a drawn-out, debilitating decline. The Dow Jones closed on January 2, 1973 at 1031.68; on December 31, 1974 it stood at 616.24. The numbers that track equity mutual funds show a grim similarity. Immediately before the end, the industry enjoyed record popularity. Equity-fund assets hit $56 billion in 1972, up smartly from $51.6 billion the year before. But when the market sank in 1973, frightened investors jumped overboard. By December 1974, equity funds held just $31 billion in assets. Redemptions would continue to outweigh sales for four of the next six years.<p>In April 1972, Ralph Wanger's <a name="FUND:ACRNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACRNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acorn Fund</b></a> was two years old, and Wanger managed $22 million of other people's money. "Things just kind of unwound very gradually" during the bear market, Wanger remembers. "It was a deadly, grinding sort of thing. The slow motion of it kept everybody paralyzed. You just hated to come to work." Investors also hated to be in stocks. By September 1974, Acorn's assets had dwindled to just $9.5 million. "If you lost only half your money during that two-year period, you were doing pretty well," says Wanger. "There were a lot of guys who lost all of it and ended up working in their uncle's shoe store. We should've known better, and we didn't."<p>Some money managers worry that the current high level of complacency makes mutual fund managers and investors remarkably susceptible to a secular bear market. The stock market is coming off one of its longest bulls ever, 33 months of upward momentum as of the end of July. At 16.2% a year, according to Ibbotson Associates' calculations, returns over the period from January 1, 1982 through December 31, 1992 have been well above the historic annual average of 10%.<p>Market mavens insist that cash from the small investor will continue to push the market higher. But few of these experts were active investors during the last bear. The typical equity fund manager is a 45-year-old male who has been running his particular portfolio for just five years, according to Morningstar Inc. Of the 2,559 funds that Morningstar follows, only 48 have had the same manager for 20 years or more. Another 34 have been on the job for at least 15 years. "There's a baptism out there for a lot of folks," says Marshall Acuff, portfolio strategist for Smith Barney Shearson. "I don't know whether the waters will be very kind." <p>SO WHAT TO DO?<p>Hanging by the tail of a bull isn't much fun; neither is being caught in the gaping mouth of a bear. Therefore, this might be a better time than most for investors to evaluate their portfolios and their own goals, horizons, and risk tolerance. Put away the Ouija board and start studying the statements that come in the mail. Trying to time the market is virtually useless, so don't bother. "It does weird things to your brain," cautions Ralph Wanger. Adds Hugh Johnson, "Most people are not good enough to time markets. If you own high-quality growth stocks, companies that have a long record of relatively uninterrupted earnings and dividends, then in the long term you'll be just fine." <p>Of course, that's the challenge, isn't it? Right now, any investor ought to be able to make a case for each stock in his or her portfolio. Why will it go up? How strong is that case? When in doubt, sell into the next rally.<p>The same principles apply to mutual funds. Now's the time to consider the details of a fund's performance. How well does it do in a down market, and how quickly does it recover? (See chart on page 56.) How volatile is the fund? Some funds, index funds in particular, track the market. Investors can expect them to be as risky as the market as a whole. Other funds (earnings momentum funds being a prime example) outperform the market on the way up and dive much faster than the market on the way down. Investors who can ride out these swings do well over the long term. Investors who can't stand the drop and who sell at the bottom shouldn't be in funds like this. (Worth's "The Ultimate Guide to Mutual Funds" [October/November 1992] lists performance consistency and the biggest quarterly loss for 20 top funds for long-term investors.)<p>Nor should short-term investors. A buy-and-hold strategy works well__given enough time. But investors need to consider their real timeframes. When college tuition or retirement loom on their own inevitable schedules, buy-and-hold may be just wishful thinking.<p>The 1980s may have been the decade when the rising market lifted all equity funds. The initial evidence is that the 1990s will be a stock picker's market, if folks like Warren Buffett are to be believed, anyway. Equity funds that lagged their category brethren during the 1980s are suspect. If a fund couldn't outperform similar funds during that decade, the manager may not be much of a stock picker__even if the fund did well. Remember, the market as a whole returned more than 16% a year on average for a decade. Also think about the size of a fund. Can a manager__no matter how smart__with $7 billion effectively pick stocks?<p>Finally, this may be an appropriate moment to consider alternatives to U.S. equities. "It might not be a bad time to look at Europe," observes Bernadette Murphy, "just because their markets are depressed." Others advocate investing in Asia, where most economies outside of Japan's are growing rapidly. Japan itself, despite the current high returns from Japan funds, may not be a great bet. Price/earnings ratios in the Tokyo market have crept up toward levels close to those that prevailed before the bubble burst in 1990.<p>Any investor considering putting money in an equity fund for the first time ought to pause. Cash isn't trash, even at 3.2%. Wanger, who manages an equity fund, would avoid buying stocks "just because your CDs are [paying] lower [interest rates]." Barbara Morrow points out that, in any case, taking on new risk at this point is a dubious proposition. "There are a lot of question marks in the world, in our economy, and in our government," she says. "That's all making me very wary." Those who can't resist getting wet in the equity funds now should certainly look for a fund with a relatively low minimum investment and then practice dollar cost averaging by investing the same amount each month.<p>Above all, don't become complacent. Unlike the later stages of most previous bull cycles, currently there is a glaring absence of pure old-fashioned greed. In its place is the misguided notion that betting on mutual funds is a no-lose proposition. But greed actually has its good points__for the savvy investor. Greed alerts cooler heads that a market top is imminent; it is the flashing red light before the car overheats. Complacency, however, dulls the investors' ability to act. A complacent market is a docile herd moving on faith. That's dangerous. A bear on the prowl isn't hungry only for pigs. A pasture full of sheep will do. <p>Jonathan Burton is the New York correspondent for The Far Eastern Economic Review.<p> <p><p><p><p>

					<font size=4>
						 <p>By Robert N. Veres<p>Way back in the olden days, ten years ago or so, there were two ways to buy mutual funds. Investors could pay a broker an 8.5% commission to find the right fund and keep an eye on its performance (called a load fund because of the commission), or they could find a no-load fund, pay no commission, and keep tabs on its performance themselves.<p>Since then, computers have liberated the creative minds in the mutual fund industry, allowing them to offer a broader array of choices. Now there are "A" shares, "B" shares, "C," and even "D" shares; deferred sales charges, 12(b)-1 fees and trail commissions; wrap fees; no-loads, low-loads, and level-loads. It's an array that can bewilder even brokers and financial advisors. The bottom line, however, is that they're all terms to describe how mutual fund companies put our money into their pockets. Although none of these methods is necessarily bad, today's investors must be careful they're getting what they're paying for.<p>Let's start with no-load funds. Financial planners are beginning to make a distinction between "true" no-loads and look-alikes. Investors who don't want or need the services of a broker or investment advisor, or those working with a fee-only financial planner (who charges them directly for advice), should read the prospectus to make sure they are in a true no-load fund, with no sales commissions paid up front, or deferred and charged to their portfolio in subsequent years.<p>On the other hand, investors who need the services of a broker or planner to help find a fund, and who are willing to pay for it through commissions, will face a wide range of load fund options. In recent years, the 8.5% commission has become an endangered species. At this writing, only about 30 funds still pay brokers 8% or more; most others have dropped their front-end commission to under 5.75%, with some as low as 3%. At the same time, they've added annual charges (known as "12(b)-1 fees" or "trail commissions") of between .25% and 1.25% of each investment. Paying brokers less up front and a little something every year gives them an incentive to provide ongoing service__handling the paperwork if an investor moves or gets married, for example, and checking to see if they're still on track for a fully-funded retirement. <p>So the first rule of thumb is, make sure to get service from brokers or financial planners in return for the commissions paid. Rule number two: Keep up-front loads at 5.75% or less, and keep the trail commissions at .4% or less. That would leave out, for example, four of the Rightime funds, <a name="FUND:NUSFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NUSFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New USA Mutual</b></a>, Progressive Environmental Fund, and <a name="FUND:GRGSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/GRGSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Voyageur Growth Stock Fund</b></a>. They all pay front-end commissions of 4.5% or more and pay a trail commission of .9% or more a year. <p>While front-end commissions were being scaled down, brokerage houses such as <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> and Shearson were discovering that a lot of investors didn't want to pay any up-front commission at all, but that they still wanted professional advice. So the brokerage world created what are now called "B" share portfolios__funds that look like no-loads but still pay a commission to the broker. <p>To understand how this works, let's consider a $2,000 investment in a "B" share portfolio. All $2,000 goes into the fund from day one, just like a traditional no-load product. However, when the investor writes his check, the fund company reaches into its pocket and pays a front-end commission__ranging from 3% to 6% of the $2,000__to the broker. This $60 to $120 is treated as a "loan" that has to be paid.<p>Who pays? The investor. The fund company recoups the money through higher annual fees taken out of the account. What's more, if the investor wants to withdraw the money before this "loan" is paid off, he has to pay off the loan in what's called a back-end charge. In the first year, it's usually equal to the amount of the commission, decreasing to zero after six or seven years, when the fund has been paid back.<p>Today's securities market includes more than 250 different "B" share funds. Not surprisingly, the size and terms of the "loan" can vary greatly from company to company. The Kemper B funds, for example, offer a 3% commission to the broker and collect .75% for six years. The Alliance B funds pay a 5.5% commission and collect 1% a year for six years; IDS pays 5% and takes back 1% over seven years. Perhaps the most aggressive is Keystone, which pays 4% but then assesses 1.25% a year for seven years. If each of these funds earns a 10% yearly return, the annual loan rates would be approximately 13%, 7%, 12.3%, and 21%, respectively. <p>At the end of these various periods, IDS, Kemper, Alliance, and Keystone convert their "B" shares to "A" shares, which means the deferred sales charges stop. Not so the "B" funds offered by Prudential-Bache, Merrill Lynch, Dean Witter, Eaton Vance, and John Hancock. These fund companies keep collecting on the "loan" indefinitely__or until the shares are sold. Investors who are confused about whether their fund converts or keeps paying interest forever may have a hard time finding out; when contacted recently, a Merrill Lynch shareholder services representative did not know.<p>So what's the third rule of thumb? Invest only in "B" share funds that convert to "A" shares after a reasonable period. A "B" fund that takes 1% or less a year out of the portfolio and converts after six years will probably cost about the same as a front-end loaded fund. Except, that is, for investments of more than $50,000 in any one fund family.<p>On front-end commissions, mutual funds offer what's known as break-points__essentially discounts for high-volume customers. Investors pay the standard (published) commission rate on the first $50,000; for the next $50,000, they'll usually pay about a percent less, and for the next $100,000, another percent will get lopped off. At the $250,000 point, another percent goes away, until they get to $1 million. Investors with more than $1 million to invest can pretty much dictate terms. As an example, a $170,000 investment in the <a name="FUND:CABDX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CABDX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Alliance Capital Growth & Income A Fund</b></a> costs the published 5.5% rate for the first $50,000, a 4.5% rate for the next $50,000, and a 3.5% rate for the remaining $70,000. The effective overall commission rate would be 4.38%.<p>With "B" shares, there are no break-points. Most__but not all__fund families have rules against putting more than $100,000 into "B" shares. What most investors don't realize, however, is that money put into "B" shares doesn't count toward a total break-point calculation. Thus, if an investor puts $55,000 into a "B" share fund and $145,000 into an "A" share fund with the same company, the company will credit only the $145,000 toward its break-point calculations.<p>"B" funds are also poor vehicles for moving money in and out of a fund on a regular basis. Wes Bigler, a financial planner in Atlanta, reports a particularly vexing problem with his retired clients. If the portfolio is generating $400 a month in dividends, he might have the fund send $300 to the client and reinvest the remainder, so the account will grow with inflation. However, some fund groups will credit a commission "loan" to the reinvested amount and take a back-end charge out of the distributions. "They tell me they're working on the problem," he says. "But it isn't fixed yet."<p>Despite all this, there are some instances when "B" shares make sense. Consider, for example, an investor who's over age 5912 and wants to roll money from a company pension plan into mutual funds in a personal Individual Retirement Account. Many fund groups will waive the surrender charge for distributions from a retirement plan. That means that the broker will get paid by the fund company, but the investor may not have to pay back all of the loan. The same is true for older investors. Any "B" fund surrender charge will be waived if the investor should happen to die before the "loan" is paid off.<p>As the mutual fund industry moves from 8.5% front-end commissions to low-loads with trails to "B" shares, the trend is pretty clear: Funds that are sold through brokers are eliminating the front-end commissions in favor of ongoing compensation for (theoretically, at least) ongoing service. This trend first reached its logical conclusion with so-called "wrap fee" accounts, which are managed portfolios sold primarily through brokerage houses. <p>In most cases, wrap accounts are sold without a front-end sales charge but with a fixed annual fee that covers all expenses__the broker's commission, the portfolio manager's salary, and all the costs of buying and selling stocks. Brokers will often say that this eliminates any incentive to run up trading costs and churn an account. But the fees charged by wrap accounts are astronomical by mutual fund standards__typically up to 3% of assets. The theory seems to be that if investors pay managers and brokers as much as they would make by churning the account, these advisors won't have any reason to cheat them. <p>Recently, a number of fee-only financial planners have created a more reasonable version of this concept. They'll assemble a portfolio of the top-performing no-load funds and charge between .6% and 1% of assets each year to watch over the money. Typically, investors also get ongoing financial planning service included in the deal. Add in the expenses for the funds, and this brings the total cost to below 2%__and possibly much lower. A number of commission-based planners are now doing the same thing with load funds. By offsetting any commissions they earn against the fee, they offer exactly the same price to their clients.<p>A number of mutual funds are offering essentially the same deal. The funds are so new that the nomenclature is still being worked out; some companies call them "C" shares, some call them "D" shares, and some call them "level-load" funds. In any case, they pay no up-front commission to the planner or broker, but instead deliver a somewhat higher trail commission of between .65% and 1.25% a year. At this writing, there are more than 50 of these funds on the market, including nine managed by the Thomson Fund Group. The American Capital Group in Houston has recently announced that it will offer its full family of funds with a level-load option. <p>As the creative juices flow in the mutual fund industry, it has become increasingly difficult to tally up how much investors are paying through the alphabet soup of "B," and "C," or "D" shares. Investors should get in the habit of toting up the amount being billed out of the portfolio either directly by a fee-only planner or through various front-end, deferred, and trail commissions. If they have trouble with the calculations, they should ask their advisor to sort them out. Chances are, they'll get a straight answer. If not, then they should take their money elsewhere. <p>Robert N. Veres edits and publishes a monthly newsletter for professional financial advisors.<p>-----<p>A FUND SHOPPER'S GUIDE<p>Here's a breakdown of how today's brokers can get paid for selling mutual funds.<p>"A" Shares. The traditional load fund arrangement, where the investor pays a commission to a broker right off the top of his investment.<p>"B" Shares. The broker still gets a commission for selling these funds, but the fund company fronts the money and then gradually recoups it out of the investor's account.<p>"C" and "D" Shares. Sometimes called level-load funds, the broker gets no commission up front. Instead, he gets an annual payment called a trail commission out of the investor's account.<p>Wrap Fees.

						Land vs. Stocks<p>
By John Fried<p>
Superman's foe, Lex Luther, thought he had a surefire plan for turning a profit on land: buy property along the San Andreas Fault and then sink the western half of California with a nuclear device. Result: instant beachfront. Short of such extreme measures, land speculation can be an unpredictable enterprise. The outcome can vary widely, as some of the following examples show:<p>
Portland, Oregon: 1975, $10,000 per 10,000-square-foot lot; 1995, $50,000. Appreciation: 400 percent.*<p>
San Jose, California: 1975, $14,500 per 10,000-square-foot lot; 1995, $200,000. Appreciation: 1,279.3 percent.*<p>
Wisconsin farmland: 1975, $434 an acre; 1995, $1,065 an acre. Appreciation: 145 percent.**<p>
Texas rural land: 1975, $461 an acre; 1995, $727 an acre. Appreciation: 57.7 percent.***<p>
These prices are typically the kinds of quotes bandied about when people are touting their land investments. But factor in taxes and inflation, and these increases can deflate rapidly. Also, return on land is based primarily on the income generated from it -- timber, crops, real estate.<p>
The price indexes compiled by the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries come the closest to doing for land what the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index does for stocks. The NCREIF indexes are widely used as benchmarks by institutional managers to track the total return of properties across the U.S., and they take into account the appreciation as well as income derived from the property. But for purposes of comparison, NCREIF's statistics date back only nine years. For this period, the annualized total return has been 21.87 percent for timberland, 6.26 percent for farmland, and 3.74 percent on property.<p>
During the same period, the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index has returned 14.8 percent annually, according to Ibbotson Associates. Land, though, has literally proved more precious than gold, which has returned an average of only 1.7 percent a year since 1985.<p>

						By Jonathan Butler<p>Manufactured homes aren't just for trailer parks anymore. In 1995, the number shipped increased 11.7 percent from 1994; it should jump 5 to 10 percent in 1996. Why? Manufactured homes can cost half as much per square foot to build as traditional homes. Manufactured-home stocks may be good buys now, too, since rising employment means more demand for low- to mid-priced homes, says John Diffendal, an analyst at J. C. Bradford in Nashville. Look for companies that sell and finance what they manufacture -- they're less vulnerable to rising interest rates.<p><p><p>

						<p>Atherton, California, one of America's ten wealthiest communities, lies in a world of its own. It has sports heroes, silicon tycoons, attentive police, and million-dollar acres.<p>By James Conaway<p>I am riding in a silver Mercedes through the twilit byways -- there are no "streets" -- of Atherton, California. My driver, a real-estate agent, wears a pink linen suit with a gold, diamond-encrusted bee pinned to one shoulder; she is smiling. "I just sold this one," she says of a nice but not extraordinary house, "and the lot, less than four acres, for about four. They'll tear it down and build something larger. They won't subdivide."<p>Her name is Barbara Tyler, and last year she brought in more money than any Coldwell Banker agent on earth -- "just under 50," as she  
puts it, the missing noun being million. <p>"Most of the buyers are from Silicon Valley, but we also get stockbrokers, attorneys, bankers. We get Taiwanese, some from Hong Kong, Japan. We get sports stars. We get the VCs and the start-ups."
VCs are venture capitalists, and start-ups are the founders of companies, usually in electronics. The house standing before us in massive granite splendor, however, was built not by a VC, start-up, or sports star but by an Asian investor who has never lived in it. A "spec," it is priced at just under ten and is Barbara's costliest offering: six bedrooms, pool, tennis court, gym, a "Den or Worship Room," according to the brochure,  gold chandeliers from Italy, wood paneling from South Africa, and a ten-car underground parking lot with a driveway sloped so as not to scrape the undercarriage of a Ferrari.<p>Two large houses are going up on verdant lots to the west; whether ultimately Tudor or Mediterranean, they are presently just tons of upended plywood and stacks of roofing tiles. Nearby is a copse of unplanted trees, their root balls wrapped. "This lot sold for about one point six. They'll have about five in it.... This one cost four point six, just for the land."<p>We pass a vibrant green polo field where a groom is walking a horse draped in a blanket. The bell tower on an old Spanish-style convent is visible in the background, a pastoral scene suffused with soft light. "The Menlo Circus Club," says Tyler of Atherton's curiously named country club. "It defines prime."<p>An acre is worth at least $1 million in Atherton. It is one of the wealthiest communities in America, according to Census Bureau figures for income and property value. I have come here, 30 miles south of San Francisco -- "mid-peninsula," as they say -- to see what sort of people live in this maze of lanes, drives, avenues, courts, even a "forest."<p>It isn't the 2,500 houses that distinguish the place but the fecundity of what obscures them: trees, flowering shrubs, walls and iron fences draped with ivy. Atherton's 7,400 residents include remnants of old money -- like Madeleine Haas Russell, an aging member of the Levi Strauss family -- and inheritors of fortunes made in various endeavors, from hardware to toothpaste. But those that attract the most attention are the athletes -- Willie Mays, San Francisco Giant Barry Bonds, former 49er Joe Montana and 49er wide receiver Jerry Rice, former Raider Jim Plunkett -- and businessmen, such as <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a> and Don Fisher, founder and chairman of the <a name="NYSE:GPS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11469"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gap</b></a>. There are also 72 horses. All take advantage of Atherton's natural cover and protean photosynthesis.<p>Atherton is also distinguished by what it doesn't have: businesses, a cemetery, a golf course. A resident has written a fantasy about outer-space visitors in the year 3500 who discover vestiges of a "culture...distinctly different from that of the more advanced civilization of others who adjoined the area.... Small groups of perhaps no more than a single family occupied plots having a surprising uniformity of area of approximately one acre."<p>With the exception of some heavily built upon hills to the west, Atherton is flat, which adds to the seclusion of individual residences. It is bounded on the west by Woodside -- also expensive, but, as one Athertonian puts it, "too...remote" -- and by Interstate 280. To the south lies Menlo Park, highly coveted by new-home buyers but not quite Atherton, either. To the east lies the Bayshore Freeway and to the north Redwood City, a gritty dose of service-industry-cum-bungalow reality that Athertonians must confront at Woodside Road.<p>The one-acre zoning, the rules that houses be set well back from property lines and screened by trees, and the limits on the square footage of houses -- 18 percent of the total property -- have stimulated ongoing negotiations among real-estate agents, builders, planning commissioners, architects, and lawyers, a mano a mano financed mostly by new money.<p>The mayor, Didi Fisher -- no relation to Don -- attributes the influx to executives profiting from initial public offerings of stocks. "IPOs have brought a lot of new people to town," she explains. "They can easily commute to San Francisco, San Jose, Silicon Valley, and Palo Alto.... The school populations are booming. There are more kids in Little League than ever."<p>She wears slacks and a navy blazer, the daylight ensemble of choice; she serves without pay. "This is a scenic and rural area," she adds, but civilization lies all around. The town is having trouble getting new citizens to attend meetings about crime prevention and to appreciate the value of knowing how many children and what sorts of cars their neighbors have.<p>She gives me a copy of the Atherton Resident Handbook, which provides a brief history -- "This area of ancient live oaks, mild climate, and accessible fish and game was once the traveling ground of the small tribe of Costano Indians. It came under Spanish rule in 1769." The handbook also advises me to leave a house key at the police station and to have my children fingerprinted in case they are kidnapped.<p>The plate on Marion Oster's car -- TREGDDS, for "tree goddess" -- was a gift from her husband in recognition of her efforts in getting an ordinance passed that preserves the oaks, pines, cedars, ash, redwoods, eucalyptus, and exotics, such as puzzle trees, that were planted during garden competitions of yore. "Anything that is four feet in circumference or more and at least four feet from the ground can't be cut. Real easy," she explains.<p>Marion is supervising the filing of index cards by another volunteer in Heritage Room, the history wing of Atherton's pretty little Spanish-colonial town hall on shady, residential Ashfield Lane, across the street from the train station and the modern, one-story, commendably low-impact municipal office building and police department. A children's picture book showing what people do all day in Atherton would have pages devoted to agreeable, middle-aged women like these, attending meetings of the Tree Committee, the Friends of the Atherton Community Library, the Lindenwood Homes Association, the Holbrook Palmer Park Foundation, the Woodside-Atherton Garden Guild, or the Atherton Dames, who sponsor the summer barbecue, the Halloween and Christmas parties, and the Easter-egg hunt at Holbrook Palmer Park.<p>The same book would show a train stopping at the quaint station with the tile roof. The train whistle would be tooting. Young, hungry execs would be boarding the 6:30 a.m. to San Francisco, vice presidents the 7 o'clock, and, just before the 9 o'clock, graying CEOs would be stepping out of cars, some of them chauffeur-driven, their sartorial bias -- pinstripes, subdued glen plaid -- more Greenwich than West Coast. <p>Domestics get off at this same station, having come from South San Francisco and elsewhere, though most of Atherton's "help" live in rooms and cottages built for the purpose.<p>Among the town's support staff are 24 police officers, some of whom are leaving the police station next door to ticket drivers out on El Camino -- mostly passersby from Redwood City and Menlo Park. As recently as two years ago, Atherton's police officers were among the least compensated in San Mateo County, before the town agreed to bring the salaries into parity. The beefy force is paid for by a surcharge, approved by the voters. "It allows us to give a more personal service," I am told by the chief, Steve Cader, who wears 
a jacket and tie. Personal service includes returning keys left in the ignitions of parked cars and picking up newspapers for those who have gone to Hawaii or "the desert."<p>More than half the homes -- 1,400 -- have alarm systems wired to the police station, and most other residences have arrangements with private security agencies. Apparently the word is out, for robberies are rare in Atherton, and there has been only one murder, back in the 1950s; it involved a husband and wife. "Our guys know at night who's moving around and who belongs here," says the chief.<p>In 1860, Faxon Dean Atherton -- described in a pamphlet published by the Atherton Civic Interest League as "a native of Massachusetts, engaged in commodities" -- bought some 500 acres south of San Francisco. It was part of what had been the immense Rancho de las Pulgas; in the summer, he and his family traveled down by coach and then by train to escape the fog and cold of the city. They were joined by other wealthy San Franciscans -- the metals smelter Thomas H. Selby, the banker Joseph A. Donohoe, and, later, the mining magnate James R. Flood, who built what is still described as "that awful wedding cake of a house," which was demolished in 1934.<p>Atherton's property was divvied up among his children. Those and other estates were self-supporting, although fine comestibles were regularly brought down from San Francisco. Accounts of the period recall a lavish Brigadoon -- full of good horseflesh, optimism, and the pleasures of country life.<p>In 1923, the town was threatened with absorption by Menlo Park, and Atherton's fathers rushed to incorporate. The name they favored, Fair Oaks, had already been assigned, so they used the founder's name instead to define their 4,486-acre retreat with its 650 souls. The town's independence thus preserved, the fathers banned commerce and set one acre as the zoning minimum, unusual at the time. The acres were measured to the middle of the roads that fronted them, giving rise to what is known today all over America as "the Atherton acre."<p>Nan chapman, the first female member of the town council, holds a book of photographs, Gabriel Moulin's San Francisco Peninsula: Town & Country Homes, 19101930. One photograph shows a couple in a garden: he in white trousers and shoes, she in a white chiffon dress and broad-brimmed hat. "That was my friend's grandmother," she says of Mrs. Clarence R. Walter, wife of a wealthy San Francisco merchant who summered in Atherton. The first time Nan went to dinner at the Walters', as a child in the 1940s, she "didn't know what a fish fork was. I certainly wasn't accustomed to a footman standing behind my chair while I ate."<p>Atherton was then, and still is, a haven from the city, from "its weather and hustle and bustle," as Nan puts it. "The average summer day here was 75 degrees and sunny." Today, when she walks around Atherton, it smells the way it always did, "the blossoms, the redwoods," she says. "The old berry bushes are still on the fence down by the club. People still cherish their privacy; each yard is its own little piece of paradise." What distinguishes it from earlier Atherton are that most people live here year-round now and share a degree of wealth. "Then, the rich were very rich -- there wasn't much in between. It's more of an even playing field now."<p>Athertonians still tend not to think about how much money somebody has; they are used to celebrity. "We don't go chasing Joe Montana down the street for his autograph," Chapman says. She remembers watching the 49ers practice at nearby Menlo School, before they moved to their own quarters, and talking with quarterback Frankie Albert on the grass. "One of the hardest things," she pauses. "I don't want to say 'yuppies,' but some people who move here want everything they had on 15 acres somewhere else -- swimming pool, cabana, exercise room, tennis court, three-car garage, and a 7,800-square-foot statement house."<p>"This is a low-maintenance area." Jeanne Jackson is explaining the local fondness for ivy and agapanthus, which require no care. She is an artist and her husband is an investment banker with Hambrecht & Quist, in San Francisco. The Jacksons have been coming to their secluded weekend retreat in Atherton for 32 years. They originally sought advice from late landscape architect Tommy Church, who helped many here. "Tommy came and he looked, and he said, 'You can't possibly afford to turn this into a garden,'" the backyard being quite large. "I asked what we should do, and he said, 'Water it!'"<p>The Jacksons' house was decorated by the late Michael Taylor, another prominent appointer of Atherton homes, whose style could best be described as monumental: mission-like tables covered with art books, a massive stone mantel, a sofa so deep it enfolds the sitter. Big windows give the sitting room a feeling of comfort and space, but the kitchen remains resolutely in the 1960s. "We didn't redo our kitchen when other people were redoing theirs," she says, having made me a cup of coffee in the microwave. "Now everybody's into bathrooms." But she and others like her feel that their houses, once considered adequate, even beautiful, have been relegated to a category known as the teardown.<p>Ann Ramsay owns five acres and a ranch-style house at the corner of Alameda de las Pulgas and Polhemus Avenue, little more than a mile away. "My friends say, 'You live in a teardown!' Well, I don't care, this was my family's place," she says.<p>In the 1950s, Ramsay rode horses for miles across unimpeded meadows; her sisters later left with their shares of an estate that had belonged to their grandparents, the Wiels, another resonant name in Atherton. Ann stayed for the memories, the weather, and the proximity to the airport, which is not so near that the planes can be heard.<p>She recently had installed what may be the most valuable two-acre vineyard in California, each acre being worth at least $1 million. The cost of putting in the cuttings of pinot noir and sauvignon blanc was another $50,000. Ramsay will eventually sell the grapes to a winery for a pittance, relatively speaking, but she likes the idea of the old place producing. "People drop by and thank me for planting it," she says. "I don't care what the land's worth -- they couldn't blast me out of here with dynamite."<p>Genevieve Merrill sits in the kitchen of what was the gardener's cottage on what is left of the Moulton estate. She has white hair and smokes a cigarette with enjoyment. "The founders thought this was country," she explains, "and they wanted it to stay that way. Growth has been controlled. People resent it sometimes, but it has saved the place."<p>The cottage's windows were salvaged from James Flood's wedding-cake construction; another small house on the property came from the old Hahn estate. "My mother-in-law's mother was Mrs. Moulton," Merrill says. "She loved to build things. She settled here in the 1890s and built near Mrs. Winchester, then bought this from the Bassetts."<p>The old names hang around like ghosts; not everybody recognizes them today. The big properties are gone, with the exception of the estate owned by Madeleine Haas Russell, who lives here part of the year. The Flood estate, now the neighborhood on Lindenwood just east of us, is crowded with houses that are small by Atherton standards. Still, Genevieve Merrill doesn't see any great alteration in Atherton: The arrival of new money can change things only so much because there are just a handful of building lots left. "We're maxed out," she says.<p>The sign next to the drive that leads into the Menlo Circus Club -- prime zero -- reads: caution: children, horses at play.<p>"The club" (to say "the country club" is to refer to the one in Woodside) is rooted in the high jinks of a bunch of young equestriennes and the town's relentless charity. An impromptu circus organized by 11- and 12-year-olds with ponies in 1920 on the estate of W. B. Weir was a success, and Mrs. Weir persuaded the girls to turn it into an annual benefit. Two years later, according to an informal history of the club, "a group of parents and other interested persons gathered together on the veranda of the Hahn home to discuss the matter."<p>That is, to establish a permanent home for young riders, as well as a place for their parents to play polo and bridge near the Sacred Heart school. The result is this 30-acre expanse with pool, tennis courts, and stables -- and an annual Class A horse show that brings 500 fine saddlebreds and hunters-jumpers into the field for a week. It raises money for the Peninsula Center for the Blind and is not to be confused with the Tally-Ho, which raises money for the Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford.<p>The horse show also provides considerable work for the haulers of horse manure. In Atherton, this tends to separate the old householders from the new, who often object to smells endemic to the rural and scenic. One woman called her council member to demand that the police remove a pile of manure from the road in front of her house. "Why don't you just get a shovel?" asked the council member. The woman called back later to ask what she should do with the manure. "Well, why don't you put it on your rosebushes?"<p>I have been granted an interview with the club's manager, Ron Dodson, but first I take a tour of the stables: brass lamps, lots of hanging tack, green half doors open against the white clapboards, 72 stalls, and horses, all guarded by a whippet and a corgi. Lodging a mount costs almost $400 a month, training excluded. Forty thousand dollars' worth of rubber bricks has just been installed to prevent the tenants from slipping. Outside, in the ring, the trainer is taking 
a horse over jumps flanked by potted plants. The scene is watched intently by a teenage girl in helmet and chaps, while her mother waits in a station wagon.<p>Ron Dodson has a shaved head and a white goatee. He was hired at the club in 1962 as a waiter. "I made a dollar fifty an hour," he says, laughing at the memory. "They gave me a raise to a buck seventy-five." Now he has his own residence within walking distance and plays golf in his spare time, though there isn't much of that. "Total customer satisfaction is my job. I have a lot of bosses -- 369 of them. They all paid their money, and they have to be paid attention to."<p>He gives me the nickel tour of the club, also decorated by Michael Taylor. "Michael's stuff is heavier than hell. See that?" he asks, referring to the top of a column that serves as a side table. "It's a rock. We had to buy a hydraulic lift to move the damn thing."
Dodson is black, the only African-American I have seen. I've already heard disparaging remarks made by club members about Willie Mays and Barry Bonds, who is recently divorced. I ask about discrimination. Ron says, "There isn't any. Plenty of Jews belong, black guests come all the time. There aren't any black members because...." He ponders and says that, other than those of the sports stars, "I don't think there are any black families in Atherton."<p>Henry Cartan's family moved down in the early 1940s from San Francisco and bought the old Watkins house, a beautiful white Gothic Revival built by a steamship captain. "I had a ball," he says. "I was too young to be drafted. I hung around the club with a bunch of no-goods, swimming. I drove a Model A for the Suburban Water Company" -- which his father owned. "My friends called it Bourbon & Company.
"Oh, what spoiled kids we were! We didn't get bombed like kids today. There was no dope.... We threw eggs at the police on El Camino and had to sweep the parking lot outside the station. Today we'd be in cuffs."<p>He lives in a different house now. It, too, is grand, though not by current Atherton standards. He manages three family ranches from San Francisco, to which he commutes. "It's delightful," he says. "I take the 8:02 and I'm in by 9. I take the 4:25 and I'm here by 5. I read the paper or farm magazines on the way up, I snooze on the way back."<p>Willie Mays is Henry Cartan's neighbor. I inquire about this, and Henry shrugs. "Willie has a beautiful arm, but he came over here one morning in a blue-velour bathrobe and read me the riot act. The kids, you see, had been throwing eggs at his dogs." <p>He called up Mays recently and asked him to sign a baseball for a friend. But the Cartans did not invite the Mayses to their big Christmas party.<p>We pass through Cartan's regal living room with its Orientals and Victorian windows revealing the porte cochere. In the foyer stands a lacquered case containing intricately carved figurines of men and women and a couple of monkeys engaged in happy coitus. He removes a pair and uncouples and rearranges them in a different attitude. 
"It used to be that the rich weren't so young," he says, reflecting further on Atherton. "We didn't have the Larry Ellisons of Oracle, the rich baby boomers. If one of them bought this house today, it would be bulldozed."<p>Willie Mays's ranch is a teardown, too, but not Joe Montana's house. I have been told by several people of its replica of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, a view of which is sought after even by Athertonians with provenance. So is the glass case in Jim Plunkett's home that contains his 1970 Heisman Trophy and his 1981 Super Bowl MVP award. There is goodwill toward most of these sports stars, whose "lives are run by agents," according to another neighbor.<p>Most of the celebrities are outward looking, socially and professionally, and use Atherton as a safe and anonymous base, but then that's also true of Athertonians in general, old and young. Theirs is a rather chilly democracy based on one's achievement or one's ancestors -- i.e., money. Decorum is key.<p>"It's the privacy," Jim Plunkett says of Atherton's appeal when I finally reach him by telephone. "That and the proximity to Stanford University." He is a member of Stanford's golf club and sponsors the annual women's tournament. A Coors franchise takes him periodically to the San Joaquin Valley, and promotional television and radio work for the Raiders removes him regularly from Atherton. Weekends are spent at home, "driving the kids around. Here they all go to private schools, so their friends don't live nearby. It's just something you have to do."<p>The Plunketts' two-story house was built in 1983, replacing a teardown from the 1950s. "We just needed more room, with the kids. We're actually in a hollow," he adds, almost apologetic. "Some of these new houses dwarf the properties they sit on."<p>The symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the founders of companies has produced far more Athertonians than professional football or its equivalents. "We call it the Internet-scape." This from a young venture capitalist who is part of it; when limits on selling new equities were lifted, "those guys started dumping condos in Mountain View and buying in Atherton."<p>Bill Draper, prominent Republican and Athertonian of long standing, founded Sutter Hill Ventures in the early 1960s, then one of three firms in venture capital on the peninsula. Now there are more than 100, and Bill has a new company, Draper International. "Because of Stanford, the economics are great," he says over an early breakfast at Buck's in Woodside, before driving his Mercedes convertible to San Francisco, 35 minutes and several Mozart concerti away. "The graduates all want to stay.<p>"You could drive around New Canaan, Connecticut, and see more-beautiful houses, but the East doesn't have the booming electronics, the vibrancy you get from the interplay of cutting-edge technology and business, or the beautiful weather."<p>"That's the real reason Silicon Valley and the rest of it happened here," adds Draper's former partner, Paul Wythes. "The Big One: weather. There's no humidity. And no mosquitoes, no flies. You're not breathing Bel Air air, and the foothills block the fog. The nights are a bit chilly."<p>So that child's picture book of Atherton would as likely show people driving to resplendent office buildings in Palo Alto as well as in San Francisco. It would show them riding and playing tennis at the club, teeing off on the Stanford Golf Course or the one at the Menlo Country Club, in Woodside. It would show them driving the kids and shopping at Draeger's in Menlo Park, where they would eat warm duck salad in the mezzanine bistro and watch courtesy clerks in aprons and ties bagging some of the 60 olive oils and special cheese sourdough bread. It would show others in Jackson Hole or Miami, calling Draeger's long-distance to order ginger or a certain kind of olive.<p>At home, in the evening, older Athertonians would be seen pouring martinis and discussing Phar Lap, the famous Australian Thoroughbred that died mysteriously after winning the race at Agua Caliente in 1932 and was buried here -- part of him, anyway, though that is still in dispute. "He died eating the oleanders," one Athertonian would be saying; another, "No, it was the colic."
The younger adults would be shown driving children back from Little League, before going off to dine at Stars in Palo Alto. And a few would be "house thumping" -- checking out the latest neighborhood construction.<p>"The trouble with Atherton," says the only resident developer, Kevin White, a slender man of 43 in a black suit with hair to match, "is that you'll be living in a home, and somebody will make you an offer for it you can't refuse."<p>He sold one house and is building a larger one that resembles a classical temple, with eight big columns and a stone-like facade. "We call it Palladian," he says. Although it is unfinished, he and his family live in it on Faxon Forest, a road he created and named. "In the last five years, I have bought and developed more land in Atherton than anybody -- about 50 million."<p>A new stove sits in the foyer, waiting to be put into a kitchen the size of a small gym; the parlor, where we sit, with dusty black floors and an incomplete fireplace, contains the requisite monumental couch and French-provincial side chairs. "This spot is the center of our universe," he says. "So quiet. Just close enough to the club."<p>The house is 10,000 square feet, not including the basement. The land was part of the old 15-acre Heller estate -- "that's Wells Fargo Bank and stagecoach money," says Kevin. He grew up in wealthy, neighboring Hillsborough, "but I have roots in San Francisco," as did old Faxon Dean Atherton -- financial ones, anyway, that allowed White to move down-peninsula to what was, even then, a nascent development.<p>White bought the estate, he says, directly from the family. "The people who bought in here later are among the wealthiest in California. The lots sold for an average of one point eight five, and I encouraged them to buy more. As a result, two families each bought three lots, and another family two. They're the equivalents of a Picasso or a van Gogh." We go out onto the porch. Sawhorses sit in the weeds; a child's sneakers lie on the steps. "I'm spending three million on construction, and that doesn't include the raised pool or the fountain, all surrounded by French limestone."<p>The clutter will be cleared away, of course, but for the moment the scene suggests a hybrid of the Loire Valley and Appalachia. His neighbor's house reminds me of a small cruise ship. One of the others will cost about $5 million to complete. When I point out that these statement houses offend many Athertonians, he says, "People who do great things in life are entitled to some self-expression. This is a cul-de-sac. If you don't like the way they look, don't come down it."<p>The night before I leave, I drop by the Menlo Circus Club's Thursday-night buffet. The women, tastefully if brightly dressed, smile; the men look proprietary in their suits and blazers and one Black Watch sport jacket. Dusk settles over the polo field as grooms and mounts wend stableward and members tuck into shrimp and crab claws -- nothing molded here -- beef tenderloin, rock cod, and "chicken Parmesan" from chafing dishes. There is a timelessness about the scene, a geographic free float: the top end of Anywhere, USA, circa 1950.<p>I remember being told by Nan Chapman, "So far, we have been able to keep progress and the wolves from our doors. It's not so much that things are the same but that I can feel the same way about them that I once felt."<p>The base price of this, the best of recollected America, with the best weather and the best proximity to airplanes and electronic commerce, is $1 million an acre. That's an Atherton acre. A house will set you back another one point two, at least. That's if you're not encumbered by a teardown and don't need to express yourself.<p> <p><p>

						By Jeff Blyskal<p>America's wealthiest towns are the stuff of fiction and bizarre fact. Kings Point, Long Island, was the prototype for F. Scott Fitzgerald's fictional West Egg in The Great Gatsby. The Coronado Country Club section of El Paso, Texas, prohibits most outdoor lights so that its mountainside residents can enjoy the sparkling views of the city without distraction. Rich towns are home to Greg Norman (Jupiter Island, Florida), Charles Schwab (Atherton, California), Mary Higgins Clark (Saddle River, New Jersey), and Marshall Field (Lake Forest, Illinois).<p>These megabucks locales are on our list of America's 300 wealthiest towns, a registry that is the result of painstaking statistical research as well as hundreds of phone calls to chambers of commerce, post offices, real-estate brokers, and other local experts. Some of our discoveries:<p>>Although 26 states are represented, including Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Oklahoma, the state with the most rich towns is New York: It has 81 of our 300. Long Island alone has four towns in the top ten.<p>>While the high-income communities we've identified contain a respectable percentage of households that bring in more than $150,000 (21.5 percent), they also have a significant percentage earning less than $25,000 (14.5 percent).<p>>Three of the most resonant town names in America -- Beverly Hills, Greenwich, and Lake Forest -- ranked only in the 80s. Their five-digit populations are among the largest on our list; many of our wealthiest towns have little more than 3,000 or 4,000 people.<p>>Resorts -- Aspen, the Hamptons, Nantucket -- do not make our list because their wealthy temporary residents derive and report their incomes elsewhere.<p>>The triple-gated community of Rolling Hills, California -- with a population of 1,748 -- leads the 300 with an average income of $305,700 and an average home value of $587,900. The community, built in the 1930s, permits only one-story white houses, house trims in earth tones, and white wooden fences. Its street names -- Buggy Whip Drive and Horseshoe Lane -- are testimony to the town developer's fondness for horses: Residents must also give up a ten-foot strip of property for horse trails. Myron Floren, who played accordion on The Lawrence Welk Show, lives there.<p>>The Upper East Side of Manhattan -- on our separate list of city neighborhoods -- has the single largest concentration of wealth in the nation. Counting only annual income and home value, it is the site of $21 billion in riches.<p>>Grand old estates -- the kind that once signaled wealth -- are increasingly being broken up into smaller and smaller parcels, and even smaller lots are being chopped up. On Jupiter Island, Florida, the newly wealthy are building million-dollar homes -- monumental in size -- some on lots no bigger than 90 by 100 feet. In South Barrington, Illinois, mock Norman castles stand side by side where pumpkins once grew.<p>>Some preferences never change. Look for the rich by the water, close to horses, or near a great golf course (one Illinois town on our list is actually called Golf, and, of course, there's Pebble Beach, California).<p>We worked on this project with Scan/US, a Los Angeles based firm specializing in geomarket-analysis software that offers highly detailed income and population data. You, your neighbors, and everyone else in the country live inside the borders of six million "census blocks," demographic constructions that are each roughly the size of one city block. Scan/US has assembled these blocks into 1.3 million "microgrids," measuring between one-sixteenth and one mile square and covering every populated inch of ground in the U.S.<p>Data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which Scan/US has updated to 1995 based on economic and demographic trends, were electronically poured into these grids. We used this system to scour the nation for communities with average annual incomes of $100,000 or more. We conducted searches both by place (including incorporated and unincorporated towns that are recognized by the Census Bureau) and by zip code, because, oddly, neither picks up all pockets of wealth. For example, in New England, New York, and Wisconsin, incorporated towns are recognized not as "places" but as "minor civil divisions." Because of this and other peculiarities, the Census does not recognize as places well-known affluent addresses like Greenwich, Old Greenwich, Cos Cob, Riverside, and New Canaan, Connecticut; Short Hills and Essex Fells, New Jersey; Lincoln and Sherborn, Massachusetts; and even Pebble Beach. They did, however, show up in zip-code data. We took apart or combined zip-code areas to build towns, deleting from our list places and zips with fewer than 400 residents -- Gibson Island, Maryland, and Eyak, Alaska, for example.<p>In some cases -- as when Pelham Manor, New York, was removed from the Pelham zip -- the leftovers did not clear the $100,000-plus income bar; on the other hand, when the town of Cochituate was extracted from the zip of Wayland, Massachusetts, Wayland's average income rose. We checked population figures with each town. In other cases, combining one high-income zip with one or more relatively low-income zips in the same city resulted in an overall average household income that didn't make the cut. Where several high-income places are part of larger high-income zip codes, we opted for the greater detail -- so in Illinois, we list South Barrington, Barrington Hills, and North Barrington, all places within the Barrington zip code. The town of Barrington, however, didn't make our list.<p>Some towns are carved up in ways meaningful to the Census Bureau and local functionaries, but odd to most everyone else. There are five Chevy Chases on our list -- Chevy Chase, Chevy Chase Town, Chevy Chase Village Town, Chevy Chase Section Three, and Chevy Chase Section Five. In the middle of these Chevy Chases is a town called Martin's Additions; it also made our list.<p>Of 500 $100,000-plus communities, we chose the top 300 for our final list. To rank these well-to-do hamlets, we used two key indicators of wealth -- average household income and average home value (we consider the latter essentially the price of admission to each town).<p>Our Scan/US software also enabled us to comb every street in every major U.S. city to nail down statistically the 50 wealthiest neighborhoods. Identifying neighborhoods, however, required a different methodology, so we kept this ranking separate from the list of towns (see list on page 72).<p>To pinpoint neighborhoods, we started with the 23 cities that have populations of 500,000 or more. We then located all microgrids where household income averaged at least $100,000 and built proximate microgrids into neighborhood clusters. Unfortunately, the boundaries of most neighborhoods are either nonexistent or nebulously drawn in the minds of local residents. Even where city-planning boards have roughly drawn official neighborhood lines, population and economic growth trends have little respect for such boundaries. So we defined ritzy neighborhoods by counting only $100,000-plus microgrids. Our thinking: This is the prime big-city acreage, where people like Ross Perot hang their hats (in his case, in the Preston Hollow area of Dallas).<p>To connect our microgrid compositions to local neighborhood names, we relied on a variety of maps, including some on CD-ROM, printed city maps produced commercially, and community/neighborhood maps from city-planning departments. We also fine-tuned locations and double-checked names with real-estate brokers and chambers of commerce.<p>Some cities contain wealthy independent municipalities that the locals consider neighborhoods. For example, Highland Park is a town completely surrounded by Dallas, yet residents see it as part of Dallas. Ponte Vedra, Florida, is just over the border from Jacksonville, yet that is the first place city residents think of when asked to name the richest neighborhood in town. We chose to list these locations in our city-neighborhood list rather than our rich-town list. Such anomalies are footnoted on the neighborhood list.
We couldn't catch up with or accurately assess a few new or suddenly rising neighborhoods. Realtors report that the Geist Lake area in Indianapolis, where homes are going for $750,000 to $3 million, has recently taken off. Three years ago, the Silver Creek area of San Jose didn't exist; today, it would probably rank high on our list if current numbers were available.<p>We also decided not to include neighborhood enclaves where we counted fewer than 1,000 people -- for example, Baltimore's Roland Park and Memphis's Chickasaw Gardens. Finally, to prevent neighborhoods in cities with a high cost of living, like New York and Los Angeles, from dominating the ratings, only the three highest-income neighborhoods from each city were included.<p>Neither our town nor our neighborhood list reflects differences in cost of living. The cost of living in the New York metropolitan area is more than twice that of living in the Louisville, Kentucky, metro area, which can effectively shrink the income differential between second-ranked Hewlett Bay Park, New York, with $348,500 in average income, and 196th-ranked Glenview Hills, Kentucky, with $168,800 in average income. A home that costs $573,000 in the CEO bedroom community of Saddle River, New Jersey, could be bought in Paradise Valley, Arizona, for just $321,000, according to the real-estate firm Coldwell Banker. Cost-of-living differentials, of course, also reflect the immutable wisdom of intangible market-demand forces -- the higher costs in New York suggest the area is more desirable than Kentucky or Arizona and simply worth the price.<p>The towns and neighborhoods in this top-350 ranking reflect a combined community of achievers and the fortunate. Overall, the average income of the one million households in our top 350 is $146,000 -- more than three times the national average of $44,000. The elegant homes and estates represented here have an average value of $413,000 -- four times the national average.<p>But all in all, these numbers are averages that give only a symbolic representation of the actual moneymaking power and property values in these communities. Beverly Hills homeowner David Geffen, for example, earns considerably more than that town's $137,100 average income. Former New Orleans Saints owner John W. Mecom's home, on Lazy Lane in River Oaks, is the most expensive property currently listed for sale in Houston at $8.9 million -- 19 times the neighborhood average of $464,882. Anyone interested?<p><p><p>

						Mortgage preapproval puts home buyers in the driver's seat<p>By Roy Furchgott<p>As the economy improves and home sellers regain clout in the real-estate market, buyers need every edge they can get. Many are finding one by getting approved for a mortgage before they even pick out a new home. "Twenty percent of our residential pipeline is pre-apps," says Glen Spears of Barnett Bank of Central Florida.<p>"I recommend preapproval for anyone purchasing for the first time, anyone who wants a negotiating edge with a seller, or a worrywart," says Nancy Boles of Fleet Mortgage in Columbia, South Carolina. <p>Unlike prequalification, in which the lender provides a more informal judgment as to how large a loan the buyer would qualify for, preapproval requires the buyer to actually apply for a loan, document assets and debts, go through a credit check, and pay an application fee, which may not be refundable. The credit check will reveal problems that could waylay your mortgage, giving you time to improve your credit without the pressure of a looming closing date. Preapproval also helps you secure top treatment from real-estate professionals, who are assured that you're not wasting their time on a fantasy. <p>Preapproval can improve your bargaining position, too. "Buyers can often negotiate up to a 5 percent better price with that commitment," says Spears. "They can close within days."<p>While preapproval is good for most home buyers, don't do it if you're six months away from buying. Some application documents expire in as few as 30 days, so you'd end up repeating the process.<p><p><p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> OVERHAUL MONITOR <p>If you rebuild it, will home buyers come?  <p> By Roy Furchgott  <p> So it's finally time to ditch the '70s-vintage avocado-green decor in your kitchen. What do you replace it with if your goal is to increase your house's value by as much as the cost of the renovations? How can you make sure that potential buyers will like your new kitchen as much as you do?  <p> First, do no harm. For hard-to-install items, such as tile sand cabinets, concentrate on mainstream designs. "Make conservative decisions -- go with white or light cabinets rather than a green wash," says Mark Richardson, senior vice president of Case Design/Remodelingin Bethesda, Maryland. "The goal is to have something that would cause only a low percentage of the market to say, 'I don't like that.'" Express yourself with items that are easy to change, like paint, wallpaper, and furniture.  <p> Next, find out what the renovations are worth by getting anassessment. For $300 to $600, a bank-certified appraiser will look at your property and, with the help of the contractor, assess how much the improvements will increase its value. The assessmentis a must for getting an improvement loan from a bank.  <p> But Remodeling magazine's 199596 "Cost vs. Value Report," at $5.50 (202-736-3418), can function as a poor man's assessor,showing the estimated cost and return of various renovationsin 60 cities around the country. For example, adding a deck,while big in Birmingham, Alabama (138 percent expected returnon the renovation cost), is less popular in Lancaster, Pennsylvania(40 percent return). The reasons for the variations can be anything from regional taste to local weather conditions.  <p> Some improvements are fairly safe bets nationwide. Minor kitchen remodeling (refinishing counters and cabinets, updating appliances,and repainting) averages a 98 percent return. Adding a bathroom averages an 89 percent return. The worst returns come from replacing windows (69 percent return), replacing siding (68 percent return),and adding a home office (58 percent return).  <p> But in a sense, any remodeling job delivers a major return --improvements can reduce the capital-gains tax you pay when you sell your house. The cost of any renovation that adds value to your home, prolongs your home's life, or adapts it to a new use can be added to the cost basis of the house. When you sell your house, the cost basis is subtracted from the selling price, and you are taxed only on the remainder.  <p> Overspending and underspending are equally dangerous to return on investment. The law of diminishing returns says that the more you spend, the less you're likely to recover. "You don't wanta $1 million home in a neighborhood of $300,000 homes, but you might want a $400,000 home," says Richardson. As for underspending, it is often a question of how long before you plan on moving out. "Say you are going to stay in your house four years," says Richardson. "You might want to put in Corian counter tops that still look new in three or four years, versus laminate counter tops,which will look used."  <p> With the right planning, it's possible to beat the averages. John Floberg and his wife, Martha Hickner, found that out when they had to move from their Minnesota home, with its renovated kitchen. According to the 199495 "Cost vs. Value Report," they could expect a 22 percent loss on the $45,000 remodeling -- a $9,900 hit. But in the end they recaptured the full cost of there novation: "We had a realtor open house, and that was it," says Hickner. "Basically, the kitchen sold the house."  <p> How did they do it? The tiny kitchen was the obvious liability of the three-story, turn-of-the-century clapboard home. They maximized their return by converting a full bathroom to a powderroom and adding the shower space to the kitchen, which was rebuilt with high-end appliances, laminate counters, and solid-wood cabinets.The house sold for the asking price: $289,000.  <p> Hickner says the experience taught her an important lesson."Wait a year after you have decided to do it," she says. "Think about it: Plan, reconsider, interview." Plans for their new second-floor bathroom are ready for bid.  <p><p>

Is your neighborhood American Gothic or Picket Fences<p>Sure, it seems safe now, but could there be a crime problem around the corner in your neighborhood? CAP Index may have the answer.<p>Founded in 1988 to do crime-risk assessments for companies considering new turf, CAP Index, based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, now offers its CAPRisk reports to individuals concerned about potentially dicey neighhoods. The assessments, which consider police reports and demographic factors, predict the likelihood of various crimes five years into the future. "Executives who have used our assessments for their companies now use them on a personal level," says CAP Index vice president Ricci Levy. "Torn between two homes, they might use us as the deciding factor."<p>At $345 for a site-specific assessment, the report might seem dear compared with driving around and looking and listening. But in relation to the possible expense, headaches, and danger of moving to unsavory surroundings, it might pay for itself and then some. For more information, call 610-354-9100.<p><p>

						January 1996--Special issue <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> BE IT EVER SO HUMBLING <p>1996 is shaping up as a year to remember that a house is a home, not an investment. With inflation projected to stay low, appreciation in home prices will do the same.  <p> By Nick Ravo  <p> Homeowners may soon find themselves yearning for the good old days of double-digit inflation. That's because house prices virtually everywhere in the country are expected to increase only slightly in 1996, shadowing an equally small projected rise in the consumer price index. Real estate is a hard asset like gold bullion and pork bellies that characteristically marches in step with inflation. Over the past five years, for example, inflation has averaged a mere 3.1 percent annually, according to Regional Financial Associates, an economic consulting firm based in West Chester, Pennsylvania. And the median increase in home sale prices has been guess what? 3.2 percent each year.  <p> "People should view their home only as a source of shelter, not as an investment,'' says Mark Zandi, chief economist at RFA."If you think you are going to buy a home, sell it for a profit, and get a real return after inflation, well, you are not going to get it, in most places. And it is probably going to continue this way.''  <p> Last year, the inflation rate was 2.9 percent, and the median sales price of a single-family home rose a minuscule 1.9 percent, according to RFA. This means that prices, when adjusted for inflation, actually fell 1 percent. And this year won't be much better. Inflation is projected at 3.3 percent, while the median home-sale price should rise 3.7 percent, an after-inflation return of 0.4 percent.   <p> "It is highly regional,'' says Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers. "But what is unusual overall is that sale prices haven't been increasing as much as they have in previous economic expansions. It has been something like 1 percent after inflation, and that is remarkably low.''  <p> Last year, the real estate markets on both the East and West Coasts significantly underperformed the rest of the nation. In the Los Angeles area, for example, where the recession lingered into 1995, the average sale price of a home fell 7.6 percent from the second quarter of 1994 to the second quarter of 1995 (from $190,900 to $176,300), according to the National Association of Realtors. In the New York City region, prices fell 3.7 percent, from $174,600 to $168,100, and in Boston, they fell 1.3 percent, from $181,300 to $179,000.  <p> Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research at the National Association of Home Builders, a trade group in Washington, D.C., says that during the sharp declines in home sale prices in the first half of the 1990s, homes on the East and West Coasts, in all parts of the market top, bottom, middle took a real beating. "In the Northeast, the bottom part of the market was probably hit harder,"Zandi says. By contrast, in California, homes at the top of the market bore the brunt of the price collapse, according to Zandi. Ahluwalia adds that condominiums and co-op apartment prices still haven't recovered in most of the country, including New York City.   <p> Conversely, prices skyrocketed in a few areas. In Salt Lake City, the median sale price spiked 16.6 percent, to $111,500 from $95,600, and in Colorado Springs, Colorado, prices jumped12.1 percent, to $115,900 from $103,400. Not all the appreciation took place in the fast-growing Rocky Mountain region. Home prices in Detroit rose 11.4 percent, to $97,100 from $87,200, in large part on the strength of record profits posted by the automobile industry.  <p> Just as in the mutual fund business, however, past results are not indicative of future performance. RFA is predicting that in 1996 real estate prices will recover in California and the Northeast, achieving increases just below the projected inflation rate. In fact, RFA forecasts that no state will see its median home price decline in 1996. Only in the District of Columbiais a decline projected of 3.8 percent. The largest appreciation,6.9 percent, is expected to occur in Oregon, while the overheated markets of the Mountain West and Midwest should start to cool off, with homes appreciating about 4 to 6 percent.   <p> This leveling of price increases nationwide is partly the effect of southern California's nascent recovery. That is where, with the economy mired in a deep recession, real estate had been depressed the longest and prices fell the most. "A lot of the places that were doing real well, like some of the Rocky Mountain areas,were doing so because the demand for housing was being spurred by people leaving California,'' Zandi says. "As California improves, these areas will start to experience a slowdown. And there is the perception now in southern California that real estate prices have bottomed out.''   <p> As for the Northeast, Zandi expects that ongoing layoffs from bank mergers, defense-industry cutbacks, and a shrinking public sector will continue to dampen the home market. "From Hartford to D.C. is probably the weakest part of the country right now,'' he says.  <p> Zandi also notes that in 1995 California and the Northeast were hurt by the type of buyer dominating those markets: first-time purchasers of inexpensive starter homes. "Statistically, that pulled down the median price,'' he says. "In 1996, we'll see a wider range of buyers, and that will mean higher median prices.'' <p> Of course, all bets are off if a tax-reform package that includes eliminating the deduction for mortgage interest becomes law. If such a plan were adopted, some economists believe home prices could fall as much as 15 percent overnight.  <p> Meanwhile, mortgage rates are stable and predicted to remain so. Rates for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage should stay flat or drop a half a percentage point to about 7 percent, according to Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH Associates, a publisher of mortgage data in Butler, New Jersey.  <p> "Interest rates haven't been a real big factor in this market,'' he says. "More important has been the lack of income growth, rising taxes, fear of job losses, increasing debt loads, and demographic changes.''  <p> After federal tax-code changes in 1986, the stock market crash in 1987, the savings and loan crisis, and the recession in 19901992, will the boom years of the 1970s and 1980s, when homes appreciatedany where from 10 to 30 percent a year, ever return? Not anytime soon, according to economist N. Gregory Mankiw and graduate student David Weil, both of Harvard University. Back in 1989, these two published a paper predicting a 3 percent annual decline in house values after inflation in America through the 1990s. They cited the aging of the baby boomer generation and the relative scarcity of home-buying families coming along behind them as the biggest factors.  <p> The rapid run-up in prices in the 1970s and '80s "was a 20-year blip,'' says Daniel McFadden, chairman of the economics department at the University of California at Berkeley. McFadden published a paper last year on the long-term demographics of the housing market. He believes that in most areas there will be a more than adequate supply of housing to meet population increases, and he predicts that national median home prices will, after adjusting for inflation, slowly decline each year through the year 2100, when they will be roughly one third of what they were in 1990. "Prices will decline 10 percent over the next ten years," he says. "Without a tight supply, prices don't go up."  <p> Demographics, however, may also offer some good news for the second- or vacation-home market, which was hit hard in the late1980s and early 1990s, with prices plummeting by as much as 30 percent in many areas, in large part because of tax-code changes that curtailed the deductibility of non-primary residences.

Chant Realtors in Milford, Pennsylvania, says that he and others in the industry expect slow but steady growth in second-home sales because of the bulge of baby boomers now moving into the 45-to-54 age bracket, the time when, historically, people have been the most likely to buy a second home.  <p> Pall Spera, of Pall Spera Realtors in Stowe, Vermont, and a former regional vice president of the National Association of Realtors, has already noted a comeback from the depths of five years ago. "The investor-buyer of second homes, the one who rented them out and used them as a tax shelter, has almost disappeared,'' he says. "But the market is awakening very favorably with user-owners. We were at the bottom for most of '91, but there has been a very nice resurgence."  <p> "If you want to make money in real estate, there is one simple rule,'' Chant says. "Get in front of the baby boomers' demand.'' <p> There is, to be sure, a whole litany of demographic caveats to this axiom: What if baby boomers spend the funds they would have used on second homes on private education for their late-born children? Or on taking care of their aging parents? Or what if they have been so shell-shocked by the recession in real estate over the past five or six years that they plow their money into mutual funds instead, as they have been doing?  <p> Zandi thinks boomers simply may not have enough extra money to buy second homes, as their parents did before them. "Because home prices have been flat, a lot of people are not going to have the equity built up in their first home that they would ordinarily use to buy or make the down payment on a second home,'' he says.  <p> They might, however, have enough cash for time-share condominiums, which have become popular again in recent years after falling into disrepute in the 1980s. Time-shares (often called vacation or interval ownership) allow a buyer to spend a designated week or weeks each year in a specific unit at a specific property, usually a one- to three-bedroom furnished condominium. Typically, a week a year for anywhere from 25 to 50 years at a time-share resort costs an average of $9,500, according to the American Resort Development Association, the trade group representing time-shares. There is also an annual maintenance fee that canrange from $200 to more than $1,000.  <p> Those who invest in time-shares usually are buying vacation futures, so to speak, rather than actual property (in rare cases, time-share investors actually receive a deed for their share in a property), and selling that time can be very difficult. These are not, then, full-time retirement arrangements. Nonetheless, the worldwide time-share market has grown from $500 million to$5 billion since1981. Unlike the time-shares of the past, however,which were often sold by scam artists and fly-by-night companies, today's units are more likely to be run by established hotel and resort companies like Hyatt International, <a name="NASD:MAR"></a><b>Marriott International</b>, and <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Walt Disney</b></a>.  <p> The best news in today's real estate market is that the age group 62 and older is growing ever more slowly, so demand for housing in retirement areas will be flat for a while. "It's not going to pick up again for another ten years, when the baby boomers start to retire, so you might see some softness in prices in places like Florida,'' says Zandi.  <p> That means, at least for those with cash at hand, now might be a good time to buy before the demand starts to build around the year 2005. Says Zandi, "It might be a good time to go bottom fishing."  <p> Nick Ravo is a reporter with The New York Times. He can be reached at nickravo@nytimes.com.  <p><p> <p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> CRACKS IN THE FOUNDATION  <p> By Kathleen Murray  <p> Several years ago, James Blythe's $150,000 home in Warrenton, Virginia, started listing to port. Cracks fissured the walls; doors and windows could no longer be closed in their warped frames. <p> Blythe took comfort in his ten-year new-home warranty, which he assumed would cover the $34,000 in damages his house had sustained.But his confidence may have been misplaced. Home Owners Warranty Corp. in Arlington, Virginia, which insured Blythe's builder,went bankrupt last October after state insurance regulators discovered the company was short $45 million.   <p> Home warranties were created in the 1970s to pay for repairs to new houses if the builder was unable to do so. To secure coverage,builders paid warrantors a premium, which was passed along to buyers. A typical warranty provides ten years of coverage against major structural flaws and mechanical defects and shorter periods of coverage for less serious problems. By 1994, HOW, the largest of six national home-warranty companies, covered 2 million new homes with ten-year warranties, commanding half the market. <p> HOW wasn't the only large warrantor to experience financial difficulties. In 1993, the next-largest home-warranty company, Home Buyers Warranty Corp., based in Aurora, Colorado, was placedunder supervision by state regulators after the insurance company that backed it failed to meet a new, higher capital reserve requirement. The company resumed normal operations in September of that year, after the insurance company received an injection of new capital.  <p> Blythe is one of about 1,500 homeowners with HOW warranties who have filed warranty claims that were not settled as of last October. And because HOW is paying only 40 cents on the dollar on claims for homes built in the last decade, these people maybe stuck paying for thousands of dollars in repairs. More than1.5 million other homeowners will wind up with completely worthless warranties should the company go out of business.   <p> This does not surprise homeowner advocates. According to Jordan Clark, president of the United Homeowners Association in Washington,D.C., the purpose of warranties is less to indemnify new-homebuyers than to provide cheap protection for developers. For example,warrantors often charge builders just $600 for a ten-year policy on a $300,000 home, leaving themselves vulnerable to big losses. And though home warranties are supposed to cover all major structural damage, many warrantors try to avoid payment by including a clause stipulating that a house must be unsafe, uninhabitable, or unsanitary to qualify for a claim. According to R. Jean Fischer, founder of the Ridgemere Institute, a home-warranty consumer group in Nashville, this practice violates insurance laws.   <p> "Warranties are deceptive and give the homeowner a false sense of security," says D. Brent Lemon, a Dallas attorney who has filed dozens of cases against HOW. They may even limit a buyer's rights. For example, in Texas, homeowners by law get four years' worth of protection against construction defects, while the average ten-year warranty provides two-year coverage. If Texas homeowners accept the builder's warranty, they lose the more extensive state-mandated protection.   <p> In an effort to protect themselves, warrantors have begun to clarify their contracts. Residential Warranty Corp., for example, "now makes a point of writing limited' continuously throughout its warranty," says Tom Bothell, a company spokesman.  <p> Federal and state oversight of this business is lax, so it's up to home buyers to protect themselves. Read the warranty carefullyand be sure you understand the extent of its coverage. Most warranties cover only defects in manufacturing and materials for one year and don't cover such nonstructural damage as flooring or furniture ruined by flooding. However, a home insurance policy can be used to fill in those gaps.   <p> Anyone signing a contract on a new home should check the builder's references, licenses, and insurance. Fischer recommends that home buyers review floor plans and code inspection reports, talk to architects and local inspectors, and pay an independent soil engineer the few hundred dollars it costs to determine if the home is built on solid ground.   <p> Homeowners should also hire an independent engineer to inspect the house. It's not cheap anywhere from $500 to $1,500 but "considering your house is likely to be the biggest investment you'll make," says Fischer, "it's worth the money."   <p><p><p>

						The depressed dollar has an upside:  A potential jackpot for holders of some U.S. stocks.  <p> By Gretchen Morgenson  <p> There's nothing like a crisis to focus folks' attention. Such is the case with the currency mess that has suddenly gripped the U.S. Although the dollar was in a free fall for almost a year, it was only after the buck took a big bath against the Japanese yen and the German mark in April that politicians and media pundits began to seize on the sad state of the greenback, and what it means for American businesses and consumers.  <p> Still missing from most of this talk, however, is one of the most significant potential consequences of the down-and-out dollar: a wave of future takeovers by foreign companies with fistfuls of strong currencies. With the dollar at fire-sale levels, particularly against German, Swiss, and Japanese currencies, America's newly efficient, highly profitable corporations now look cheap to foreign investors.  <p> So far, big acquisitions by foreigners have been few. They've also been limited to pharmaceutical companies and certain consumer-goods concerns. In late spring, Hoechst AG, the German chemical and pharmaceutical giant, paid $7.1 billion for Marion Merrell Dow, a U.S. drug company with $3.1 billion in sales last year. Hoechst made the purchase to bolster its sales in U.S. markets and to gain access to the nation's impressive biotech arena. Last year, Britain's B.A.T. Industries, an insurance and consumer-goods conglomerate, bought American Tobacco. The acquisition is already paying off: First-quarter pretax profits at B.A.T. jumped almost 20 percent.  <p> But many more such takeovers may be in the offing. Donald Gimbel, managing director at Furman Selz Capital Management in New York City, reports that investment bankers, both here and abroad, are working overtime advising potential European acquirers on promising targets. "The major European conglomerates can definitely make the case for acquisitions in this country," says Gimbel. "They recognize the merits in buying big brand-name companies. And corporate earnings are coming through faster than the market is going up." So many of these companies look inexpensive, even absent the profitable currency translation.  <p> While Americans normally don't cotton to the idea of foreigners buying up U.S. assets (remember the fears in the 1980s that JapanInc. was going to buy up virtually all of USA Inc.?), American shareholders rarely gripe when the companies they own personally are bought out at fat premiums, no matter who's doing the buying. <p> Which areas of American industry are ripest for takeovers in the coming months? And who will be the likely acquirers?  <p> Certainly not all industries are likely to witness the takeover wave. Don't, for instance, expect merger mania to hit American software or service companies, for instance. That's because shares in these outfits are still favored by investors and carry relatively high valuations.  <p> Some of the money managers who pay attention to this area believe that future dollar-play takeovers will center on five industries: natural resources, food companies, pharmaceuticals, heavy-equipment manufacturers, and chemical producers. In these industries, stocks,if not actually cheap, are certainly not overvalued. "These takeovers will be made for competitive reasons," says Charles B. Carlson, editor of Dow Theory Forecasts, an investment newsletter based in Hammond, Indiana. "Foreign companies are looking for faster inroads into U.S. and overseas markets." Carlson notes that Ingersoll-Rand's $1.5 billion acquisition of Clark Equipment in early May could well have been a preemptive strike against a foreign acquirer. <p> Natural-resources companies look particularly attractive because many of the industry's stocks are in the cellar. The first of what could be many natural resourcerelated takeovers took place in April when Argentina's state-controlled oil giant, <a name="NYSE:YPF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42017"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>YPF SA</b></a>, bought Dallas-based Maxus Energy Co., a debt-laden oil and gas producer with properties in the U.S., Indonesia, and South America. YPF paid $745 million for Maxus, or $5.50 a share. Before the bid was first announced in February, the stock traded at $3.75. <p> Other natural-gas producers, even those with better balance sheets than Maxus's, saw their shares fall precipitously in late1994 because of a 36 percent decline in gas prices last year. This decline came about because a surge in drilling in 1994 was followed by a very mild winter across most of the nation. Now drilling has slowed considerably: The U.S. gas-rig count stands at 321, down 32 percent from last October's peak of 470. According to <a name="NYSE:LEH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41936"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lehman Brothers</b></a> oil and gas analyst Robin Shoemaker, the currentrig count is substantially below the levels required to sustain gas reserves and meet the country's usual natural-gas needs. Therefore, he sees a rebound in natural-gas prices in 1996. <p> If Shoemaker is right, any company wanting to acquire natural-gas properties on the cheap would be looking to get in now. That's because, according to Shoemaker, there is typically a six-month lag between the low in rig counts and the turning point in gas prices. He believes the independent gas-producing companies in the position to benefit most from a recovery in gas prices are <a name="NYSE:HSE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13983"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>HS Resources</b></a> (NYSE: HSE), <a name="NYSE:UMC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16420"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>United Meridian</b></a> (NYSE: UMC), and <a name="NYSE:APC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10111"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Anadarko Petroleum</b></a> (NYSE: APC).   <p> Chemical companies that may be ripe for foreign acquisition include smaller, specialty producers such as <a name="NYSE:RXN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11275"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rexene</b></a> (NYSE: RXN) and <a name="NYSE:LAW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10884"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lawter International</b></a> (NYSE: LAW). Lawter does nearly 50 percent of its business overseas, and as Charles Carlson points out, the fellow who runs the outfit is getting on in years. For these reasons, Lawter may be attractive to a nonU.S. buyer.  <p> Who will be doing the acquiring? Money manager Gimbel believes U.S. shareholders will be entertaining offers from Britain's Hanson PLC, the Netherlands' Royal Dutch/ Shell, European supermarket giant Carrefour, packaged-goods maker Unilever, Heineken, and pharmaceutical concern Ciba-Geigy. He also thinks foreign banks, such as Hong Kong/ Shanghai Bank, Lloyds and NatWest in Britain, and Germany's Commerzbank AG, will be shopping U.S. shores for financial-services companies that are depressed in price.  <p> Brian Fernandez, director of research at the San Francisco investment firm of Volpe Welty, says the acquirers will be strategic buyers, "people who are willing to look out three to five years and need a stake in the U.S. for fundamental positioning, distribution, or technical reasons. The cymbals will clang when they buy because the transactions will be large and there is a lemming-like quality to buyer pools from time to time."  <p> Where are the Japanese in all this? Ironically, although Japan's currency has appreciated the most against the dollar, Japanese investors are pulling in their horns. Japan is short of cashand actually has been busy selling U.S. assets to raise money. Says Fernandez: "The [Japanese] banking industry is in a shambles, industrial companies are reeling from the yen, and investors who loaded up on U.S. government bonds at 300 yen per dollar have lost 73 percent of their money a huge number." And having made many of their biggest real estate investments at the top of the U.S. market, the Japanese are shell shocked. So much for the dangers of the U.S. becoming a subsidiary of Japan, Inc.  <p><p> <p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>SELLERS GRAB THE UPPER HAND<p>By Jim Melloan<p>Home buyers hoping to take advantage of a softening real estate market may be in for a surprise. Although sales of both new and existing single-family homes are expected to decline this year, the prices that sellers ask (and receive) may jump even more than they did in 1994. In fact, the latest figures from the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, based in Washington, D.C., forecast a 4.2 percent increase in the price of existing homes in 1995 (versus a 2.5 percent rise in 1994) and a 3.7 percent increase in the price of new homes (versus 3.1 percent last year). The projection for existing home prices is higher than the one released by the association before the start of the year.<p>Yet the group continues to forecast a drop-off in the number of buyers this year, predicting that sales of existing homes will fall by 3.7 percent and sales of new homes will decline by 5.7 percent.<p>How can prices be rising if fewer people are buying? <p>David Lereah, the association's chief economist, says it's a simple matter of supply and demand. Yes, the demand for homes has dwindled--the result of rising interest rates and slower job growth. Meanwhile, however, the supply of homes for sale has fallen even more, and it's this growing scarcity that's pushing up prices.<p>Last year was a good one for home sales, mostly because the economy added 3.5 million new jobs, Lereah says. Although interest rates began rising early in the year, many borrowers were able to offset the higher cost of money by choosing lower-priced adjustable-rate mortgages over fixed-rate loans. At the same time, sellers, many of whom had been sitting on their properties for lengthy periods, were eager to finally close a deal. Few held out for sweetened offers.<p>Now, with even fewer homes on the market, sellers are beginning to get tough. In addition, manufacturers expect to build 5 percent fewer new homes this year than they did in 1994. Homeowners throughout the nation should thus expect that 1995 will be a reasonably good year for property values. The map below shows how home prices have fared in major metropolitan areas during the 12 months ended in February. <p><p>

						By Gary Hector<p>Home may be where the heart is, but it increasingly shares office space with business. This year as many as 4.5 million new people will join the 43 million Americans who work at home, according to LINK Resources, a New York research firm.<p>The phenomenon of telecommuting is no longer new, but the new wave of commerce cocooners has higher expectations than did the pioneers of a decade ago. With the electronic gear now available, they expect, rightly, that their home office will be less an outpost on the business frontier than a node on a global network. <p>Today, the ideal home office is a place where an executive or professional can conduct electronic correspondence and tap into an array of information resources. The technology needed to do this is readily available, easy to use, and reasonably affordable.<p>A few thousand dollars will buy a home-office comunications center that will be more nimble and sophisticated than most found downtown. A PC or Mac, printer, fax, modem, cordless phone, some software, and a few technical manuals are all you need.<p>Resist the urge to buy the most powerful computer you can afford. Its capabilities will probably exceed your needs, and no personal computer retains its leading-edge glamour for long. Instead, plan to upgrade every few years as your computing needs grow.<p>Compatibility matters; buy whatever system is favored by your colleagues or clients. <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> or IBM clones, running DOS or Windows, control about 88 percent of the personal computer market. If you want a Mac, new conversion boards are available that will allow you to run PC software. A new PowerMac with such a board already installed costs about $2,600 and includes a built-in Intel microprocessor. <p>One thing you shouldn't skimp on is phone lines. Sharing a phone with the rest of the family may seem a prudent economy, but the first time your child answers, you may lose an account. Plan on three lines: one for the family, one for your business, and one to handle faxes and computer links. The new digital cordless phones from Uniden and other makers let you roam around without those Martian sounds you hear on older cordless models, and the digital transmission scrambles the signal, foiling eavesdroppers.<p>Unless you're a bona fide hacker ready to tackle the Internet, sign up with at least one online service: <a name="NASD:CSRV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43062"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CompuServe</b></a>, Prodigy, or <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b>. Connecting to the electronic world through these relatively user-friendly on-ramps has become a major resource for at-home workers. Among other things, these services allow you to send E-mail to any other wired soul. E-mail is instantaneous and can cut your long-distance bills.<p>CompuServe, the granddaddy of online services, lets you to do patent searches, read recent court filings, search through hundreds of industry newsletters, and, for qualified users, access special tools like J.P. Morgan's system for assessing global investment risk. The major services offer free test periods of three to ten hours. <p>They also offer ways to access the Internet, though to varying degrees. Prodigy has the best link-up at the moment, and direct links are offered by companies like the Pipeline in New York City or Netcom On-Line Communications, among many providers. Costs run $20 a month for 20 to 40 hours online. <p>When it comes to modems, buy the fastest available. Although not all online services run at the highest speeds and those that do sometimes charge a premium, few things will save you more time for less money than a modem that can quickly download data. Speed is particularly important on the part of the Internet called the World Wide Web, which is replete with colorful graphics that chew up online time.<p>Another option is an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) line, a high-speed telephone connection that carries data at 64 kilobytes per second. These lines have had some technical problems and are just becoming widely available for the home. Pacific Bell is offering free installation in California, with monthly fees starting at $20.<p>Although most new computers have built-in fax modems, get a standalone machine as well. Faxes are still easier to send by hand__especially when it's something you've torn out of a magazine__and their arrival is more noticeable in physical form. <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> offers a laser printer (for about $800) that doubles as a fax, saving desktop space. Color ink-jet printers prices also have been falling; you can get a good one for around $450.<p>As home-office workers plug in and log on, their major problem may in fact be information overload, not isolation. And while the cyber-world can save time and make you money, it is a poor substitute for human contact. Julie Dodd-Thomas, Pacific Bell's resident expert on telecommuting, says, "We don't recommend working at home five days a week." <p><p>

						By Ilyce R. Glink<p>Five years ago, dennis and Karen Bookshester plunked down $250,000 for eight mountaintop acres in a resort development in Colorado's Vail Valley. Today, the land alone is worth $750,000, and perhaps $2.5 million including the home they built on it.<p>As Mark Twain reputedly said, "Buy land. They ain't making any more of it."<p>Actually, Twain's axiom hasn't held up so well in recent years__at least not for most residential real estate. The second-home market, however, is another story. Prices for vacation homes have begun to rise of late partly because the 80 million members of the baby boom generation are now entering middle age__the time of life when people are most likely to buy a second home.<p>Some real estate experts expect second-home ownership to double by the year 2000, meaning that nearly 13 million Americans will buy full or partial interests in second homes within five years. According to the American Resort and Residential Development Association, adults are most likely to purchase second homes between the ages of 45 and 64. David Weil, an economics professor at Brown University, notes that "the first of the boomers will hit 50 next year, the main crunch in 2007, and the last of them in 2014." He calculates boomers could be buying second homes at least until the year 2030. <p>The last time boomers bought real estate en masse was during the 1970s and 1980s, when they pushed the real price of homes 30 percent above inflation. The same thing could happen this time, though not all areas will perform equally well as investments. The key to playing the location game is to zero in on areas that offer something special and limited in supply. A basic checklist:<p>Easy access. Two thirds of second homes are located within 150 miles of the owner's primary residence. The best locations take no more than four or five hours to reach, whether by car or, for the most exclusive areas, by plane. For example, Flathead Valley, Montana, has developed slowly due to its remoteness. In comparison, fast-growing Cordillera, Vail, and Beaver Creek, Colorado, all are within an hour of the nearest airport.<p>Diversion. Successful second-home investment locations boast cultural and social resources, not just natural ones. Aspen, for example, is a culturally vibrant community year-round. Also look for first-rate golf courses and other sports facilities.<p>Security. "Second-home owners want to know their kids can safely roam around outdoors," says Davis Chant, a realtor in Milford, Pennsylvania. Adds John Tuccillo, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors, "Baby boomers will be looking to live out their lives in a safe and secure environment."<p>Zero population growth. Successful second-home locations are exclusive and discourage overdevelopment. The residents of Hilton Head, South Carolina, for example, have all but forbidden new construction. The allure boils down to quality of life, says Flathead Valley regional planning director Stephen Herbaly: "If we destroy the air and water quality, we've got nothing."<p>Buy low, sell high. Look for affordable housing stock that leaves room for appreciation. In Flathead Valley, land costs $10,000 an acre. Something comparable will run a half million or so in Aspen, if you can find it.<p>Play the margins. Shop on the fringe of a prestigious community. Five years ago, Cordillera, where the Bookshesters bought their acreage, was a no-name development just outside Vail, one of America's most popular ski resorts. "Looking back, it seems like a no-brainer," says Gerald Engle, Cordillera's developer.<p>Bet on celebrity. Never underestimate the value of star power__even the local variety. When Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley's teenage son threw a much-publicized unsupervised party at the family's Grand Beach, Michigan, home, Chicagoans learned several generations of Daleys had summered there. Since then, area realtors say, Grand Beach has become more desirable.<p>Understand the drawbacks. Not every developer has the golden touch. Even in good areas, second homes are relatively illiquid investments, and there are often hidden costs. Banks also are more reluctant to lend for second homes than for primary residences, often charge higher interest, and normally consider only a fraction of potential rental income when making loans. Vacation property also doesn't qualify under the IRS rule that allows home sellers to defer capital gains taxes by plowing the proceeds back into their next purchase.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>WHO WINS WITH DISCLOSURE?
Pitfalls in the tell-all movement in real estate<p>By Peter G. Miller<p>When it comes to buying a home, no one wants to walk away with a lemon. The question is, how much information about a home's defects must be disclosed by law?<p>As a matter of practice, homeowners and their brokers looking to sell a property typically reveal "material" defects to a prospective buyer, such as termites feasting on the home's foundation. But judging what is or is not a material defect, proving what is actually known, or even determining what should be known are hardly clear-cut matters. The result: Courts nationwide are now clogged with lawsuits filed by home buyers.<p>To resolve the problem of excessive litigation, mandatory seller disclosure forms are now required by law in 23 states. Hawaii and Oklahoma are due to enact such disclosure rules effective July 1, 1995, and more states are likely to follow. "On balance, the forms will reduce litigation," says Ralph Holmen, senior counsel for the National Association of Realtors. Already, says Holmen, a number of major real estate brokers are reporting fewer suits as use of the disclosure forms has spread. <p>The eventual winners of this tell-all movement? Real estate brokers may come out on top. State and local chapters of the NAR lobbied heavily for disclosure rules in order to reduce a broker's liability in lawsuits based on nondisclosure problems. Since the new disclosure rules focus on sellers, premiums for what's known as "errors and ommissions" insurance, a kind of malpractice coverage for real estate brokers, are expected to fall. So far these premium costs have held steady, but experts say the rules will have an impact in the future. <p>But even as disclosure standards become increasingly common, buyers and sellers nationwide still need to tread carefully. State laws governing disclosure vary widely, creating much confusion as to what a buyer and seller must know to arrive at a handshake. Examples from around the country show that, depending on the state, disclosure can pose problems for buyers and sellers alike:<p>* Wisconsin sellers must disclose under penalty of law "defects in [a home's] roof." But unless there is a glaring, visible problem, most roof damage, like rotted wood, can go undetected. Few owners (or brokers) are trained as roofers, engineers, builders, or architects.<p>* Rose Pothier, a Santa Ana attorney, points out that in California, disclosure statements do not have be completed by sellers when a property faces a foreclosure or government sale, or when it is held by an estate or trust. <p>* Virginia owners need not complete disclosure forms if they sell properties in "as is" condition. But this means savvy buyers there should discount their offer for an "as is" property. Virginia owners must also tell buyers if there are "any substances, materials, or environmental hazards (including but not limited to asbestos, radon gas, lead-based paint, underground storage tanks) on or affecting the property." Yet even if an army of inspectors combs the real estate, how can they possibly know about conditions next door that may "affect" the owner's domain?<p>* In at least one state, disclosure has created more lawsuits. The Agency Law Quarterly ($157 annually, 800-299-9961) reports: "The state with the most disclosure has had the highest number of claims. California lawyers have learned that disclosure does not guarantee a fail-safe transaction. In fact, disclosure, as practiced on the West Coast, typically raises buyer expectations to unrealistic levels." Says ALQ publisher Frank Cook: "Disclosure gives lawyers something to go to court with. Where things were gray before, suddenly they are black and white."<p>How should disclosure be handled by buyers and sellers alike? There are some basic rules that should be followed:<p>* Buyers should always stipulate that home inspections are a condition of the sale. Home inspectors are critical since they act as independent professionals in documenting the condition of a house. If the inspection is not satisfactory, the buyer can ditch the transaction and get his or her deposit back.<p>* Sellers should not fill out disclosure forms or write contract clauses themselves. They should enlist the aid of a real estate attorney or broker. By doing it right upfront, they'll avoid costly battles down the road.<p>* Sellers who live in states where disclosure is mandated by law should take care when completing generic questionnaires--laws vary as to what can be stated. For example, Wisconsin permits sellers to answer questions by marking "See expert's report," while Texans may choose "Unknown." In cases like these, sellers should rely on expert reports. Disclosure then becomes part of an inspector's purview, thereby reducing seller liability--that is, if sellers have answered truthfully.<p>* Consider escrow accounts and home warranties to pay for any repairs if you're selling. To cut costs if there is a problem that cannot be resolved before closing, a contract can limit seller repair costs to just those funds placed in an escrow account. Limited home warranties, which owners generally purchase through real estate brokers, can also provide protection against major structural defects and system failures, such as clogged plumbing, that occur after the sale. Before setting up an account, sellers should check with a local real estate lawyer to find out if these accounts are allowed in their state.<p>* Include a mediation clause in the sales agreement. Real estate mediation panels don't prohibit one person from suing another, but buyers and sellers should check first how local panels are conducted. Panels stacked with local real estate brokers can compromise mediation, since brokers work with one another and share information. They also, by the way, use mediation hearings to identify potentially lucrative future transactions.<p>Robert N. Bass, a Phoenix attorney with a large real estate practice, says that many Arizona contracts require mediation by an outside intermediary in the event of a dispute between buyers and sellers or between buyers, sellers, and brokers. "I have had several situations where broker clients have received 'demand' letters from attorneys threatening litigation," Bass notes. "It has given me some pleasure to remind them of their client's obligation under the contract to first try mediation with a view toward settling before litigation is filed." <p><p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>BEWARE REVERSE-MORTGAGE MANIA
Don't let a bad deal burn up your home equity.<p>By Elizabeth MacDonald <p>The offer is inviting. Why not take the equity built up in your home and turn it into a reliable income stream? Such is the notion behind one of the hottest new financial instruments out there -- the reverse mortgage. <p>As with many newfangled ideas, the reverse mortgage was born in California. It promises a borrower a set amount of monthly payments based on three factors:a percentage of the equity held in a home, an annual percentage rate applied against that equity, and the borrower's life expectancy. <p>Reverse mortgages are particularly attractive to retirees or anyone else on a fixed income. The nation's 13 million senior citizens are increasingly looking to turn an estimated $750 billion worth of home equity into quick cash with reverse mortgages, according to Ken Scholen, director of the National Center for Home Equity Conversion in Apple Valley, Minnesota. Since reverse mortgages were first introduced in 1989, more than 18,000 people have signed up with over 80 lenders in 47 states. "Today, we get more letters inquiring about reverse mortgages than any other issue, since they are so complicated," says Bronwyn Belling, housing specialist with the American Association of Retired Persons in Washington, D.C. Not surprisingly, such complexity often hides gigantic charges.<p>Last April, a group of senior citizens filed an amended class-action suit on behalf of 1,500 borrowers against Providential Corp., a San Francisco mortgage lender, charging that the firm "bilked millions of dollars from trusting senior citizens." The suit says Providential used deceptive sales practices, such as not disclosing usurious rates and phantom fees. As a result, these borrowers say they lost a huge portion of their assets, which they could have used to pay off nursing-home expenses or bequeathed to their children. <p>Reverse mortgages work much like home-equity loans. Borrowers typically draw between 30 and 80 percent of their home equity in the form of a fixed monthly payment or credit line. The borrower then agrees to repay the balance due if he or she moves from the residence. Repayment is secured by a first trust deed on the borrower's home -- when the borrower moves or dies, the lender is repaid from the proceeds of the sale. Payments are not taxable and don't affect Social Security benefits. Interest costs can be deducted when the house is sold.<p>Unlike regular home-equity loans, reverse mortgages have no income requirements, making them much more attractive to retirees. Furthermore, home-equity loans and credit lines are typically paid off within ten years; reverse-mortgage payments usually last as long as you live in your home. <p>However, some lenders cook up outrageous calculations based on laughable life expectancies.The longer the term of the reverse mortgage, the greater the chance that fees and interest charges associated with it will skyrocket. As a result, such terms accelerate the decline in home equity, in some cases leaving borrowers high and dry.<p>Consider the case of Mary McCarthy, 88, of San Francisco, one of the borrowers in the class-action suit. On September 25, 1990, McCarthy took out an 11.5 percent lifetime reverse mortgage equal to 80.79 percent of the value in her $354,000 home. Providential Home Income Plan, the lending arm of Providential Corp., provided the loan. According to McCarthy's documents, Providential calculated her life expectancy to be 8.28 years. She agreed to receive up to $2,149 in monthly payments, plus a $38,000 advance to pay off an existing mortgage. The suit says that McCarthy was told at the end of the mortgage she would have $99,667 in home equity. <p>However, the suit charges that Providential instead used a 13.5 percent rate. Furthermore, McCarthy says in the suit that in May 1993 Providential gave her a $2,000 lump-sum payment after it "took advantage of her by pressuring her" into a "no points, no fee" rewrite of her loan. She says Providential didn't tell her that it actually added $8,796 in fees to her loan balance for this advance. She also says it failed to tell her that she owed an extra $26,000 by the end of September 1994 because of these charges. Worse, by May 1995, McCarthy will have zero equity in her home because of this rewrite.Adding further insult, Providential has the right to 50 percent of any appreciation in McCarthy's property value, a perilous clause found in roughly 1 percent of all reverse mortgages. In response to the suit's charges, Providential Corp. states that they "border on the bizarre." Plaintiffs are now appealing a court decision forcing arbitration. <p>Although McCarthy's experience was a nightmare, reverse mortgages can be a source of economic comfort if used properly. "Roughly 84 percent of senior citizens responding to our surveys say they really want to stay in their homes and never move," says Belling. As reverse mortgages proliferate, it's smart to protect yourself or your parents. Here's how:<p>-> Educate yourself. Request the free 47-page booklet Homemade Money by mailing a self-addressed postcard to AARP Home Equity Information Center, 601 E Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20049.<p>-> Check out government-backed reverse mortgages. Roughly 10,000 lenders in 47 states are now eligible to originate loans under a Department of Housing and Urban Development program. HUD loans typically carry no appreciation clause. Borrowers pay roughly $4,000 in closing costs, compared with $5,000 or more for similar loans. <p>Also, the Federal Housing Authority is now insuring 25,000 reverse mortgages through September 1995. Applicants must be 62 or older. Monthly payments are guaranteed, even if a lender goes bankrupt or if the market value of the home drops below the loan balance. Insured amounts vary, from $67,500 in rural areas up to $151,725 for metropolitan addresses. On a $100,000 home, FHA insurance costs would come to about $2,000. To find out more about federally insured reverse-mortgage lenders in your area, call the FHA at 800-732-6643. <p>-> Get advice before you sign. Reverse-mortgage borrowers who want FHA-insured loans must now visit HUD-approved independent counselors, found in major cities. Such a counselor will analyze your financial situation, review the terms of a reverse mortgage with you, and then tell you whether this loan is suitable for you. If it is, you'll get a list of HUD-approved lenders. The counselor will also help you fill out your application and act as your liaison with the lender of your choice.<p>-> Question the loan's terms. For example, Providential's chairman, William J. Texido, was quoted in newspapers as saying that the average life expectancy of a 76-year-old Providential borrower is 8 years. Loan-disclosure documents, however, reveal that the firm commonly used a 13.3-year life expectancy for such borrowers. Furthermore, Providential apparently did not consider that many senior citizens move into nursing or retirement homes many years before death and therefore well in advance of their loan's maturity. <p>-> Use reverse mortgages as a tax-planning tool. If your estate is worth more than $600,000, encumbering your home with a reverse mortgage could shrink your assets below that threshold, thereby avoiding stiff federal estate-tax rates as high as 55 percent. <p>-> Consider borrowing from your kids. With the help of a family lawyer, set up your own reverse mortgage with your adult child. Your offspring would then pay you a fixed sum equal to a certain percentage of the equity in your home. You'll get the cash, your children will reap the tax benefits of depreciation of the real estate, and you'll skip high fees. Plus, your asset will stay right where you want it -- at home.<p><p>

How good schools produce higher home values.<p>By Margaret Opsata <p>How much does public-school excellence contribute to the value of a home? And how do you make sure you are moving into a good school district? <p>The answer to the first question: More than you may think. For the answer to the second, keep reading.<p>Homes in good school districts are typically priced 10 percent to 20 percent higher than similar houses in not-quite-good-enough districts. In extreme cases, however, the value added is even more: as much as a couple of bedrooms and baths, a new kitchen, a finished basement, a swimming pool, and a tennis court combined.<p>Consider, for example, Las Virgenes, a desirable school district located in Calabasas, just northwest of Los Angeles. Some houses there sell for $1 million and up. But according to housing specialist Alfred Gobar in Placentia, California, nearly identical houses lying just outside the school-district lines bring only $700,000 to $800,000.<p>The price disparity, however, is usually worth paying -- so long as you actually do buy a house within the true confines of a good district. The reason: Your home will be easier to resell, and its price should hold up better. Because of this, even folks without children should investigate an area's school district before buying a house. <p>This is true even in weak markets. During the past recession, for example, Washingtonians who could no longer afford to send their children to private schools moved in droves to the top-rated Walt Whitman school district in neighboring Montgomery County, Maryland. "The in flux was so large that demand kept pace with supply, and housing prices remained relatively stable across the school district," says Jose Saiz, a Bethesda, Maryland, real estate broker.<p>Communities with good schools, however, are not always easy to spot. They aren't necessarily the towns with the nicest houses, highest property taxes, or best city services. In addition, reality doesn't always live up to reputation when it comes to the quality of a town's schools.<p>A good way to dig out the truth is through National School Reporting Services of Stamford, Connecticut, a new and reliable source of unbiased information on public schools across the country. Its reports compare more than 1,500 school districts in ten states: Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Districts in five additional states -- Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas -- will be added before the close of 1994. By next year, the service's reports are expected to cover the nation.<p>The NSRS reports compare school districts using more than 200 measures, among them class size, teacher experience, curriculum, athletics, special programs and students' Scholastic Aptitude Test scores. NSRS sells its reports to real-estate brokers, who offer them for free to prospective home buyers.<p>Another important indicator of school-district quality -- one that the NSRS reports do not measure -- is elementary-school reading-test scores. Researchers have found that school districts in which reading scores have remained consistently superior over a ten-year period or so are most likely to be ranked as excellent. <p>For more than a decade, G. Donald Jud, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, has studied the relationship between educational excellence and housing values. "Each 4 percent increase in reading achievement scores is associated with a 2 percent to 3 percent increase in property values," he says. <p>If you see a rapid improvement in these scores, that's a good sign that the quality of education in the district is rising. To unearth the scores of reading tests in a particular school district, either search local libraries for newspaper reports, or ask for the test results from the state's department of education or the county school-system offices.<p><p>

It takes work, but now's the time to become a landlord.<p>By Stuart Weiss <p>Short of acquiring another home, how can you win in a rising real estate market? Buy an apartment building.<p>The real money in real estate is made buying actual properties. To play, you need at least $50,000 that you can lock up for some time. You also need to take time to research your local market and watch over the property you wind up buying - even assuming you'll hire a property manager. Good negotiating ability is key, since you and the seller determine the price. This is why apartment investing can make sense even in depressed markets.<p>To be successful in real estate investing, aim for cash-on-cash returns of at least 10 percent and capitalization rates of at least 8 percent. To figure cash-on-cash returns, divide the building's net cash flow by your down payment. A capitalization rate is your building's net operating income divided by the purchase price.<p>Here's an example: You offer to buy a six-unit apartment building in a good neighborhood for $360,000. You put $100,000 down and finance the rest with a 6 percent adjustable 30-year mortgage. The average rental unit goes for $625 monthly. Your building's annual income is $45,000. <p>Subtract from this a vacancy and bad-debt allowance of 6 percent, or $2,700; operating expenses of $11,250 (as a rule, operating expenses - utilities, insurance, maintenance - should be from 25 to 50 percent of the rents you take in); and a 5 percent management fee of $2,250.<p>That brings your building's net operating income down to $28,800. Since your annual loan payments are $18,800, your investment's cash flow is $10,000. Therefore, your cash-on-cash return is 10 percent. The capitalization rate is 8 percent.<p>On this investment you'd get depreciation write-offs of just under $10,000 per year. This figure comes from estimating that 75 percent of your purchase price, or $270,000, is depreciable over the standard 27.5 years for residential property. These write-offs come in handy if you need to shelter other income. <p>A great thing about owning real estate is the tax-free exchange rule: When you trade up to another property, capital-gains taxes are deferred until you sell. Try doing that with stocks.<p>The downsides to property investing? You could hire the wrong property manager. You could face major repairs. Interest rates could go up and your adjustable mortgage could reprice itself. The neighborhood could deteriorate.<p>To make things easier, your property should be located within a half-hour of where you live, even if you have a good professional manager. "Apartment properties are management intensive," says Will Creagan III, a broker with Business Real Estate Brokerage in San Diego. <p>Novices should avoid properties in bad neighborhoods where evictions and crime are facts of life. "I have investors who say 'I'm not going to buy unless I can go to this property at night and feel comfortable,' " says John Smelter, a partner at Sterry Van Ness, a San Diego real estate broker. "That takes care of 70 percent of San Diego County."<p>You might think it wise to stick to prime apartments in top location. But top-drawer properties usually carry higher prices; that means a lower cash-on-cash return. There are other problems. "You get too close to the high end, and you have tenants who pay their rent but are the first to move out and buy a house when interest rates drop," says Paul Labby of Carla Properties in Portland, Oregon. "Most of the properties that have been foreclosed on in this city have been at the high end."<p>Should you go with a fixed- or a variable-rate mortgage? If a fixed loan is, say, 8 percent and a variable is 6 percent, then it's probably best to go with the variable rate. Even if rates continue to move up, it would probably take four years for your adjustable to get to 8 percent and four more to get to 10 percent because of the annual caps most adjustables have. If you plan to hold your property for a long time, a fixed-rate mortgage will be safer, but a more active trader will likely want to go with a variable.<p>Get to know some bankers and brokers in town and spend time visiting properties and studying recent transactions. Property markets are more inefficient than equities, in part because information is scarcer. But that's precisely why the small investor who's willing to work hard may do better.<p><p><p>

Buy an off-campus house, and the IRS will kick in.<p>By Margaret Opsata<p>Is your teenager mature enough to manage a small apartment building or rooming house? If the answer is yes, he or she can earn a degree from any college in the country at little or no cost to you.<p>Here's how. You buy a three- or four-bedroom house near campus, hire your son or daughter as resident house manager for a salary of free rent, and lease the rest of the rooms at market rate to other students. Besides eliminating your son or daughter's housing expenses, which can exceed enrollment costs at many schools, the venture could generate enough rental income to more than cover tuition, books, clothing, and incidentals. Best of all, most of the money earned will be tax-free.<p>Because you have purchased the house as an investment and do not live there yourself, you are entitled to deduct many more expenses than are permitted with a personal residence. "As rental real estate, not only is the mortgage interest deductible, but you can also write off property taxes, insurance, repairs, maintenance, and depreciation," says Stewart H. Welch III, a fee-only financial planner in Birmingham, Alabama.<p>In addition to free rent, your child can also earn a reasonable management fee of perhaps $100 to $150 a month. "That becomes another tax-deductible expense for you, and your child won't owe income taxes on the money because the total annual fee is less than the standard deduction," Welch says. Unless he or she has another job, of course.<p>You can even write off visits to your child on campus, as long as the main purpose of each trip is to check on the real estate. Absentee owners are allowed to deduct the travel costs of inspecting their investments.<p>If your youngster manages the place properly, you probably can sell it at a profit when he or she graduates. The demand for housing around college campuses remains constant, regardless of whether real estate markets in general are weak or strong, so you should see some appreciation after four years. <p>"Instead of paying out thousands of dollars a semester in nondeductible college costs, you're investing in an asset that produces thousands of dollars in tax-sheltered income and then delivers a tax-advantaged capital gain," says Cynthia L. Conger, a certified public accountant with the Arkansas Financial Group in Little Rock.<p>In addition to the numerous financial advantages of owning your child's college residence, the arrangement may also give you greater peace of mind as a parent. You can try to encourage your child to be neat, arguing that slovenliness harms your property's value. And you can visit the premises frequently - actions that might be uncomfortable, if not impossible, if you weren't the landlord. <p>Indeed, both you and your child must treat the entire arrangement as a business deal if it is going to work satisfactorily. The youngster must set aside time to screen tenants, collect rents, perform yard work, enforce house rules, and pay bills. <p>All terms and conditions of occupancy, including the rental-payment schedule and penalties for lateness, as well as the grounds and procedures for eviction, should be spelled out in a written lease that is signed not only by each student renter but also by one or both of the renter's parents. The resident manager needs the inner strength to enforce the rules, even if it means telling a friend to move out. <p>The income stream will be steadier if you use a one-year lease that permits sublets instead of renting month to month. That's because a student who drops out of school will be required to continue paying rent until another tenant is found. In addition, everyone should pay a security deposit refundable only if the renter does not damage the property. <p>Nonetheless, you should expect higher than usual wear and tear on your property. For example, repainting walls and replacing carpets probably will be necessary each year.<p>For this reason, look for a solid structure. Unless local public transportation is excellent, confine your search to within two miles of campus, an easy commute to classes. <p>You and your son or daughter should begin looking for tenants as soon as you have signed a contract on the house. Advertising in the college or town newspaper or posting notices on bulletin boards around campus may be enough of a marketing effort. Involve your child in the tenant-selection process. <p>Of course, not every college student is capable of managing property, and some simply don't want the responsibility. Those who rise to the challenge will benefit from the experience. As Nancy Langdon Jones, a financial planner in Upland, California, says, "Management experience looks awfully good on a resume these days.<p><p>

The reward of becoming a landlord to mom and dad<p>By Margaret Opsata<p>Changes in the tax laws have taken a lot of the bang out of real estate investing in recent years. But you can still get favorable tax treatment on the purchase of a home while helping out your elderly parents at the same time. Here's how: Buy their home, or if they don't already own, buy a residence for them and be their landlord. With the residential real estate market warming up, now is the time to strike a mutually rewarding deal. <p>Meaningful tax savings are possible if your tax bracket is higher than your parents'. That would make mortgage deductions worth more to you than to them. If your parents finance your purchase, your deductible interest payments made to them become their income, not a bank's. A sale and leaseback can also benefit you where future estate taxes are concerned, particularly in a rising real estate market. This is because the portion of your parents' estate that was their house has been turned into cash and is no longer appreciating in value.<p>You could structure the deal as an investment in rental property, but for many people the simplest approach is to treat it as a second-home purchase. The tax law still allows deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes paid on both a principal and a second residence. If you already own a second (or vacation) home, it may even pay to sell it, or stop claiming deductions from it, in order to benefit from the higher deductions you may be allowed if you purchase the home your parents reside in. <p>To make sure your parents' residence will qualify as your second home, you have to spend some serious time there.<p>Parents who sell their home will find themselves in for a special treatment where the windfall capital gain is concerned: $125,000 of it is excluded from taxation, provided that one of them is 55 or older and neither has taken the exclusion before. <p>In order to play by the rules, your parents must pay you rent. The rent, however, could be financed from your parents' interest, property tax or insurance savings, or from the proceeds of the sale itself. <p>The rent you charge must be realistic. If the rent is clearly below market, the Internal Revenue Service may consider the difference as taxable income to your parents or an outright gift. But you're allowed to put the rental figure at the low end of the fair-market range. <p>The best practice is to collect market-rate rent and, if necessary, return part of it to your parents as a tax-free gift. Any individual can give any other individual as much as $10,000 a year without incurring gift taxes. The rent your parents pay becomes income to you, but it can be largely offset by legitimate expenses, including property taxes, insurance, repairs, maintenance, and loan interest, if you've borrowed to make the purchase.<p>It may, in fact, be preferable to borrow from your parents to buy the home, if the estate of the second parent to die seems likely to exceed the $600,000 estate-tax threshold. True, the value of the note you give your parents when you buy their house becomes part of the estate. But the note will be partly paid down and the payments spent. If interest rates rise between now and the time of death--and they're certainly rising now--the value of the note would be further discounted to reflect the higher rates. The note would simply be worth less because of the lower interest rate and yield it provides. Therefore, the taxable value of the estate is also reduced.<p>In structuring any sale, be sure to get a tax accountant or tax attorney's advice. The available options become increasingly complex, such as the use of the parental home to finance what's called a family annuity. This is akin to a reverse mortgage, which allows a homeowner to borrow monthly amounts by pledging the equity in the home as collateral; when the borrower dies, the loans plus interest are repaid from the proceeds of the house sale.<p>In a family annuity, the child gives the parent an income for life, and the debt thus incurred by the parent is canceled when the child inherits the parental residence  later on.<p>These techniques are tricky and could violate tax laws if technical requirements are ignored. Get professional help before trying any of them. <p><p>

It's possible to love your new home even after the closing<p>By Margaret Opsata<p>Most house sales, when they're finally sewn up, leave both buyer and seller satisfied. Only after the closing does it dawn on the buyer that his purchase involves more than a transfer of assets--it means undertaking financial and other heavy burdens. Disillusionment starts to replace euphoria.<p>This change in emotions is known as buyer's remorse, and for the most part it can be chalked up to oversights made by buyers in an overly optimistic mood. Brokers selling properties encourage the mood. <p>In a competitive market such as is expected to develop this spring, it pays to keep a cool head. This reality test should help.<p>-- Are you underestimating the cost of operating the home? Many buyers think existing homes offer better value because their prices, per square foot of space, are usually lower than newer homes'. The much higher costs of operating and maintaining older places, however, can easily wipe out any price saving. A 1991 study by the National Association of Home Builders shows that it costs nearly four times as much to run a 30-year-old house as it does to run one built after 1990. On average, an older home costs $4,384 a year per $100,000 of value; a newer one costs just $1,874 a year.<p>To find out how much a home will cost to run, ask to see utility and repair bills for the past three years. Have your independent house inspector examine them.<p>-- Don't be duped by dimensions. There are no universal standards governing the calculation of living space in house listings. This explains why a 2,000-square-foot place may seem roomier than a 2,800-square-foot prospect. In some places, square footage of  lofts or cathedral ceilings may actually be double-counted. In others, truly usable space--basements, even rooms sunk into hillsides--may be ignored. <p>As a result, comparisons between houses are unreliable. Forget advertised figures. Carry a tape measure when you inspect a house.<p>-- Are you overlooking what's over the fence? Scenery and privacy offered by woods and other undeveloped tracts adjoining a lot may seem desirable. But today's meadow or forest can become tomorrow's fire station or topless bar.<p>Determine the ownership of adjoining property, how it is zoned, and what zoning changes can be made to it. <p>-- Don't forget to investigate sound and air pollution. A neighborhood that seems peaceful during the day can become a war zone at night. A race-car track a half-mile away can ruin a relaxing Saturday; shifting winds can bring industrial odors to your door. <p>Visit the neighborhood at different times of day and night and again on weekends. Interview neighbors and employees living and working in the area.<p>-- Check out neighborhood schools. Think you're buying a home in an elite school system? Make sure you're right.<p>-- Account correctly for a mortgage's points. Tax laws permit buyers to deduct in full the fee they pay to get a mortgage loan on a primary residence--known as points--in the year that they assume the loan. But this deduction is possible only if the fee is paid in cash and not from proceeds of the loan itself. If you use loan proceeds to pay points, you can take the deduction only by spreading it out over a period of years. This reduces the ultimate tax benefit.<p>Establish a full deduction by paying the points with a separate check on an account that clearly hasn't been established with loan proceeds. This may be a checking account or your earnest money returned on closing.<p>Even when entitled to a full deduction, some borrowers rely on inaccurate point figures supplied by lenders on Form 1099 information returns. Accounting on 1099s is sloppy in many cases and downright inaccurate in others. The loan-disclosure document received at closing shows the definitive figure. If there is a discrepancy in the two documents, ask the lender for a corrected Form 1099.<p>-- Don't overpay property taxes. If the current year's property taxes haven't been paid on the house, the seller is supposed to give you a check for his prorated share at closing. In some places, however, the current-year tax figure is a mere projection of last year's. If taxes increase, you'll owe the entire amount of increase.<p>Ask the seller to deposit a reasonable amount in escrow to pay his share of any increase that may result from tax hikes.<p><p><p>

Illustrations showing great benefits can be misleading<p>By Virginia Applegarth<p>Marketing experts often say that people put off buying life insurance because they hate to think about death. It's more likely that people avoid insurance because they hate what they have to go through to buy it. <p>As a financial advisor, I recently took on a client who had been caught in a bidding war between two insurance agents. He was overwhelmed with statistics they'd thrown at him. Their primary weapon was the all-too-common policy illustration, a spreadsheet that projects how much a client or his beneficiaries will get each year, extending decades into the future, assuming that the client pays a specific premium every year starting now. The client's file was more than six inches thick. <p>Life insurance illustrations should be the least important factor when deciding what company and policy to buy--well behind the financial strength of the company and its ability to demonstrate a history of low expenses and high returns. <p>What's the problem with most illustrations? First, they are generally incomprehensible. A typical illustration may run on for ten pages or more, containing more than 1,000 separate figures. Second, insurance companies aren't required to--and usually don't--disclose underlying assumptions about expenses or investment performance. Third, they aren't reliable. Dick Weber, a life insurance expert in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania and a leading analyst of policy illustrations, says the term "accurate illustration" is an oxymoron. If a company assumes an interest rate just a half-percent better than it's currently paying, he says, the projected annual premium will be 8 percent lower. A 1 percent improvement in the cost of death benefits will cut projected premiums another 10 percent. Excluding a company's fixed overhead from a policy's estimated expenses translates into a 4 percent premium savings. And making aggressive cancellation assumptions can cut premiums another 14 percent. Taken together, an illustration showing a company's actual current costs might show premiums 50 percent higher than illustrations incorporating all of these "improvements." <p>What's wrong with lower premiums? Nothing, as long as the real premiums that policyholders end up paying turn out to be as low as the "projected" premiums. But because they are only projections, life insurance illustrations are virtually always wrong, except for the guaranteed columns (typically based on a 4 percent or 5 percent interest rate). Any amounts over the guaranteed cash value and death benefit are a company's best guess (or irrational hope) about future performance. So, although an illustration may appear precise (say $169,422 of projected cash value in the 20th year), nothing could be further from the truth.<p>Many policyholders today are sadly learning the result of insurance planning that was based on the double-digit interest rates that prevailed in the past. With rates now languishing at a 20-year low, they are being asked to pay premiums far above the amounts quoted in their policy illustrations, or to pay much longer than they expected. <p>To turn the tables on the illustration game, ask your insurance company or agent for current illustrations (called in-force ledgers) based on the investment rates their policies are currently earning and the current costs for death benefits and administration. This will give you a much better idea of how your policy is holding up in the low-rate environment.<p>Whether you're checking on an old policy or buying a new one, also ask your agent to run illustrations assuming the currently available interest rate and ones with the rates two percentage points lower. If the policy plan doesn't work under this scenario, watch out. <p>Look out for companies that factor in improvements in mortality charges, expenses, high lapse rates, or increased dividend or interest rates. These projected improvements have no impact on how a policy will actually perform, but they do provide an indication of a company's sales ethics.   <p> <p><p>

Sure, real estate is slow. But some houses are selling. And there's no reason why yours can't be one of them.<p>By Margaret Opsata<p>America is awash in unsold homes. We've all seen them, those vaguely depressing places where the for sale sign is as much a yard fixture as the birdbath or lamppost and the owners eagerly watch each approaching car in the hopes it will carry that endangered species, the Prospective Buyer.<p>There are many reasons for the sluggish sales: Money is tight. Consumer confidence is low. Job insecurity is rampant. People no longer believe that real estate is a good investment. Perfectly valid reasons, all. But there are other explanations for why a house on the market forever remains unsold: ineffectual real estate brokers and the homeowners themselves. "If the agent and the seller are doing everything right, a house could sell in 30 days," says Tom Posey of Posey Properties/Better Homes & Gardens Realty in Plano, Texas. "If they are doing everything wrong, it could sit there for years." <p>Marianne Voragen of RE/MAX West Realty in Woodland Hills, California, agrees. Although Southern California is in a protracted real estate slump, she maintains that it is "really a great market if you know what you're doing and you're prepared to work." <p>Top brokers use many different tactics, but their overall strategies are very similar. They advertise properties regularly, alternating between text ads in the newspaper classifieds and display ads that picture the home. Their ads do not repeat the same information week after week; each is worded differently. They enter houses in the area-wide multi-listing system, of course, but instead of just waiting for the telephone to ring, they aggressively promote the property on an individual basis as well. <p>What kinds of promotional tactics do successful brokers use? They may participate in house tours featured on cable TV, advertise outside the real estate section of the newspaper, or launch joint promotions with rival agencies. Voragen recently installed a hot line that prospective buyers can call 24 hours a day to receive an audio tour of any of her listed properties. <p>Most important, hardworking agents stay in frequent contact with sellers. "Customers should receive ongoing reports, in writing as well as verbal, about what is happening on their marketing plan," says DeLora Wilkinson, executive vice president and general manager of the Houston office of Henry S. Miller Realtors. Homeowners should not expect miracles, but they deserve to be kept informed. <p>If your home has gone unsold for several months and you see little evidence that your broker is doing much about selling it, ask for a detailed marketing timetable. If that is unsatisfactory, think about switching to a more aggressive agent. Although representation agreements typically run for between one and six months depending on your region, some brokers will release an unhappy seller early if the working relationship deteriorates.<p>Unreturned phone calls to a broker are a good indication that the homeowner may need another agent. Besides being discourteous, ignored messages suggest that the broker is too busy hustling new listings to be bothered with owners who have already signed representation agreements. The best brokers usually limit themselves to no more than 15 or 20 listings at a time, so they can give each property the time and attention it deserves. <p>Don't confuse high visibility with hard work. Some home sellers are happy simply if their broker holds frequent open houses. Unfortunately, only about 5 percent of home sales occur as a result of open houses. This may be because such events tend only to attract curious neighbors and potential buyers who browse with no clear idea of the price or location they want. "Holding an open house just to have one may do nothing but satisfy the ego of the owner," Posey says. In fact, it may hurt more than help. "The main benefit we get from open houses is identifying buyers for other properties we have," says Voragen. <p>Can changing agents make a difference? Yes, say the experts, who have a bagful of tricks to freshen an old, stale listing. "We can reenter the house in the multi-listing system under a new number and a new date. People forget," says Lillian Dorfman of Weichert, Shannon & Luchs Realtors in Bethesda, Maryland. Switching brokers also gives the seller an opportunity to select someone with creative marketing ideas and a solid track record of delivering on promises. (Before signing any agreement, a seller should obtain references from several people who have used the agent, both ones suggested by the broker and some chosen at random from a recent client list.) <p>While a skillful agent is more likely to succeed in selling a home than an incompetent one, there is only so much any broker can do if homeowners refuse to help themselves. Many home sellers make the costly error of clinging to an unrealistically high price for their home. They know that real estate values have dropped a little lately, but they simply cannot believe the house they bought a few years ago for $185,000 is worth only $155,000 today. So they insist on listing it for thousands of dollars too much. <p>How can you come up with a price that's realistic but not a giveaway? The only valid yardstick of current market value is recent comparable sales figures, which are published weekly in most newspapers and kept on file in real estate offices. Unfortunately, some owners rely instead on meaningless information like the listed price of other unsold homes (which may be 20 percent or even 30 percent too high) and neighborhood rumors about the large sums that recently sold properties supposedly commanded. "Neighbors lie," Voragen says.<p>Sellers can get a feel for current value by checking out the competition. "They should have their broker take them on a tour of houses in their price range," says Wilkinson. The visitors need to ask themselves honestly whether their home compares favorably with others available to buyers for the same money. If the answer is no, it's no surprise that the overpriced home has attracted no offers.<p>Sellers must also learn to separate emotion from reality. Buyers couldn't care less how much trouble the owners had hanging the bedroom wallpaper or finishing the job by candlelight when the power failed. Similarly, buyers place no premium on the sellers' charming furniture arrangements or sophisticated taste in avant-garde art, because these items are not included in the sale.<p>Sellers who confuse emotion and value are at a particular disadvantage today, because a significant number of homes on the market are there as the result of job transfers and are being sold by corporate relocation specialists, who have absolutely no attachment to the real estate. "All they want to know is what it will take to get this house sold and off the market at the least cost in the shortest period of time," says Wilkinson. Consequently, company buyout homes have fresh coats of paint, new carpeting, and manicured lawns that make them the most desirable places in their price range. In order to compete, individual homeowners must either lower their asking price or undertake these same cosmetic improvements.<p>Home sellers can learn a few things from these professionals. From the outside, a house needs to look like it's worth the money, and the yard must appear neat and tidy. "If buyers don't like the outside, they will never come in, and once they are in, you need to maintain that good feeling," says Dorfman.<p>Most important, don't despair. It's easy to feel discouraged, even insulted that nobody seems to want your much-loved home. But instead of making excuses, review your approach and your agent. An attractive house that's aggressively marketed at the right price can sell. Even in this market. <p> <p><p>

Thanks to the National Association of Realtors, the home-mortgage deduction remains safe for democracy. And you still haven't refinanced?<p>By Margaret Opsata<p>Judging from the number of angry cards and phone calls that flooded U.S. Senator James Sasser's office in February 1993, you might have thought that the Tennessee Democrat, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, had come out against a clean environment or in favor of unsafe sex. In fact, he had floated an idea even more heretical: Sasser suggested lowering the tax-deductible cap on home mortgages, down from the current $1 million level. If more revenues were needed to battle the burgeoning budget deficit, Sasser believed, Congress should extract them from those who can best afford to pay more--specifically folks who own expensive homes.<p>Before most homeowners had even heard about Sasser's idea, the National Association of Realtors issued a "call for action" to the 750,000 real estate brokers who constitute its membership, urging them to vent their dissatisfaction with Sasser's proposal to the senator and his committee members. "We are not above jamming switchboards and sending mountains of mail to make our point," says NAR spokesperson Elizabeth B. Duncan. <p>Sasser soon saw the error of his ways, and the idea was scuttled. Score one for the NAR and the American homeowner.<p>Sasser wasn't the first politician to come up against the NAR. The association has a history of in-your-face lobbying practices. During the 1992 election, the Realtor's Political Action Committee was the second-largest political contributor in the United States. It distributed $4 million to lawmakers and candidates around the country who were on its side. <p>In that election, R-PAC donated to 58 candidates for the U.S. Senate--43 of them won--and to 473 candidates in the 535 U.S. House of Representatives races (355 won). Politicians clamor for R-PAC donations, which are made only to candidates who give the "right" answers on a lengthy questionnaire. The Realtors' quiz covers just about "every major political issue on the national agenda even remotely connected to real estate," according to Larry J. Sabato, a professor of government and author of PAC Power (W.W. Norton, 1985). <p>Not everyone is comfortable with the NAR's heavy-handed tactics or, for that matter, with the influence PACs have over the U.S. government in general. But the fact remains that the millions of homeowners who take the deduction and the millions of homeowners who don't are all better off financially because the deduction exists. And, because the mortgage deduction remains sacred, today's low interest rates offer an attractive investment opportunity. <p>Who really benefits from the home-mortgage deduction? First, of course, are the 27 million taxpayers who itemize the mortgage deduction on Schedule A, collectively deducting about $200 billion a year, or about $7,400 each. In fact, many homeowners would pay less in taxes under the new, higher 1993 rates than they would have paid under the old 1992 rates without the home-mortgage deduction. Assuming standard itemized deductions, homeowners making $100,000 would pay about $4,000 less in taxes, $150,000 earners would pay $6,500 less, and $200,000 earners would pay $9,000 less.<p>Not all homeowners take the mortgage write-off; in some cases the deduction they're entitled to is smaller than the standard deduction. But even these homeowners benefit from the mortgage deduction's remaining in place. How? The mortgage deduction, which really boils down to a government-created incentive to own property, helps keep home values high.<p>Were that incentive to vanish, real estate values everywhere would plunge. Nobody knows exactly how much the drop would be, but economist Paul Roberts, chairman of the Institute for Political Economy,estimates that prices could fall as much as 33 percent if the deduction were to disappear. "It would make the Great Depression look like a picnic," says Roberts.<p>The NAR also argues, with some credibility, that the mortgage deduction stimulates the economy, creating jobs in construction, consumer hard goods, and other housing-related industries. Donald Ratajczak, an economist at Georgia State University, estimates that all this real estate-related activity accounted for about 13 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, or roughly $650 billion last year.<p>These days it's difficult to find any lawmaker, like Sasser, foolish enough to question the merit of the mortgage deduction. In fact, every deficit-reduction proposal floated in the 1980s by either Congress or the executive branch has specifically preserved the deduction. Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton each took pains to assure the NAR that the home-mortgage deduction was untouchable as long as they were in the White House.<p>With the home-mortgage deduction apparently safe for democracy and with mortgage interest rates at record lows, the time has come for homeowners to revisit their investment strategies. For starters, if you have a low rate, don't be in a hurry to pay off your mortgage with excess cash (see "It Doesn't Pay to Prepay," Worth, October 1993). Instead, put the spare cash to work in higher-yielding investments. <p>More aggressive investors might even consider increasing their mortgage borrowings and placing the lump sum they receive from the bank in relatively safe investments that return more than the mortgage's interest rate. Your cost of funds--as mortgage interest--is tax deductible, and a larger deduction will shelter more income from the taxman. A larger mortgage may also keep you in a lower tax bracket.<p>When you can invest with a long-term time horizon, it doesn't take much of a difference between the rate at which you borrow and the investment return to translate into real money. For instance, let's say a 40-year-old homeowner wants to refinance his mortgage at 7.5 percent for 30 years and borrows $100,000 more than he needs to repay the original loan. If he invests that $100,000 at an after-tax annual rate of 8 percent, he'll have $240,000 on hand when he turns 65. Although 8 percent is not an easy yield to come by in today's declining interest-rate environment, it is possible to achieve in a corporate bond of reasonably good quality. <p>If you put any extra investment dollars into a tax-deferred account, your funds will grow more rapidly. The IRS does not allow mortgage proceeds to go into tax-free investments such as municipal bonds (reasoning that if the interest on dollars borrowed for investment is tax deductible, the return on investment shouldn't escape taxes), but the money can be put into a tax-deferred annuity or a pension account like a 401(K) or a Keogh plan. "With the tax-deductible mortgage interest on one hand and tax-deferred compounding on the other, it's almost a no-brainer to take money out of your house," says Jeffrey Goldberg, president of the Financial Consulting Group in Northfield, Illinois. The self-employed can reap even bigger rewards: When mortgage proceeds are put into a Keogh account or a SEP-IRA, the contribution itself is also tax deductible. <p>Homeowners who extract pension contributions from their home over several years may want to do so through a home-equity loan rather than by refinancing. "With a home-equity line of credit, you can take only what you need each year for your 401(K). It's a little more conservative approach than committing to a much larger mortgage," says Gary Pittsford, a financial planner who heads G. L. Pittsford & Associates in Indianapolis. <p>None of these strategies is without risk. By taking a bigger mortgage and paying it down as slowly as possible, the homeowner is automatically saddled with larger payments that will be due every month for the next 30 years, regardless of how the investments have fared. Still, it makes sense to consider reinvesting the results of a successful refinancing. After all, interest-rate declines, like the one we've just seen, happen very rarely indeed. Why not try to make the most of it? <p>Margaret Opsata has been covering real estate issues for 20 years.<p><p>

 HIDDEN INSURANCE 
<p>
Homeowners can save money by paying attention to those mysterious
little policies they bought with their homes  
<p>
 By Margaret Opsata  
<p>
 A year after moving into their dream house, a Cabin John, Maryland,
couple received a chilling letter from the Washington Suburban
Sanitation Commission. Their home had been built illegally across
a sewer easement, the letter said, and was scheduled for demolition.
This was the first the panicked homeowners had heard about any
easement, which had not shown up on the title search they paid
for when they bought the house.  
<p>
 But the couple had also bought a policy along with the title
search when they closed on their house. Like most homeowners,
the Maryland couple had not completely understood what title
insurance was or why they were advised to buy it. They saw it
as simply another of several mysterious expenses that appeared
on the settlement sheet and had to be paid before they could
move into their home. Indeed, when the bombshell letter arrived
from the sanitation commission, the couple's lawyer had to remind
them that they had even bought title insurance in the first place.<p>
<p>
 Fortunately, they had. The title insurer intervened and agreed
to pay the costs of rerouting the sewer line and relandscaping
the grounds: an $80,000 construction bill, plus the cost of reconnecting
the diverted sewer to adjacent homes and preparing new surveys
for the affected properties, as well as all legal expenses involved.<p>
<p>
 In addition to title insurance, home buyers are often advised
to buy private mortgage insurance and credit life insurance.
Although these three types of policies together generate millions
of dollars in insurance sales every year, few people understand
what such insurance covers, whether it is a good investment,
or even what it costs. And even those who do notice the thousands
of dollars in premiums they're charged most often figure it's
insignificant compared with the amount of their mortgage anyway.
But in many cases, homeowners end up paying too much, paying
for too long, or paying for the wrong kind of coverage.   
<p>
 Title insurance, the coverage that saved the Maryland couple's
home, covers the cost of defending or settling claims that were
not discovered during the title search. Buyers are not always
told that there actually are two types of title insurance: lenders'
coverage, which costs a onetime premium of about $2.50 for every
$1,000 borrowed and which every mortgage company requires before
agreeing to underwrite a home loan, and owners' coverage, which
costs an additional onetime payment of $3.50 per $1,000 and is
optional.   
<p>
 As the names suggest, the first coverage protects the interests
of the lender while the second safeguards the interests of the
homeowner. Unfortunately, these interests are not always identical,
but more than a few buyers incorrectly assume that they are automatically
protected when they purchase coverage for their lenders. The
real estate agent or lawyer who handles the closing is supposed
to clear up this confusion, but since commissions or fees are
generally not paid for recommending buyers' coverage, advisors
sometimes neglect it. Title companies themselves have little
financial incentive to help out. "With only a onetime premium
involved, companies have no money for advertising to consumers,"
explains H. Randolph Farmer, a senior vice president at Lawyers
Title Insurance in Richmond, Virginia.  
<p>
 Other times, buyers decide not to purchase insurance because
the threat of title problems seems so remote. Actually, disputes
arise with surprising frequency in the 1990s. In addition to
undisclosed easements, they can include liens placed by contractors
who were owed money by previous homeowners and improperly surveyed
property boundary lines that inadvertently caused a driveway
or fence to be built on a neighbor's land.   
<p>
 Fraud and forgery are other leading causes of title problems.
A party to an acrimonious divorce does not want the former spouse
to share in the proceeds of a home sale and hires an impostor
to sign relevant documents while masquerading as the marriage
partner. Relatives eager to dispose of an inherited property
casually forge the signature of a family member who opposes the
sale. One audacious case involved an army officer's home in Georgia
that stood vacant while the owner was stationed in Germany. "A
woman boldly visited the county courthouse, gathered the pertinent
facts about the property, forged a deed conveying the house to
herself, recorded the forged deed, and posted a for sale sign
in the front yard," recalls Farmer of Lawyers Title, which handled
the case. When the major returned from overseas, he found his
home inhabited by strangers who had innocently purchased the
place believing the title was clear. Eventually they were forced
to move, but their title insurance allowed them to recover their
investment.  
<p>
 In fact, deceptions are becoming so commonplace that some title-insurance
companies conduct identity checks at the closing table. Even
so, the industry's loss-adjustment expenses are currently running
about double the historical average, according to Gary Garrity,
vice president of the American Land Title Association in Washington,
D.C.   
<p>
 Homeowners may well ask why they should pay the cost of a title
search and then pay again to insure against errors that occur
during the search. The truth is, lenders don't object because
homeowners are paying for the coverage. And because few home
buyers protest, the practice has become entrenched within the
real estate industry.   
<p>
 Even though home buyers pay the bills, lenders rarely let homeowners
choose which title insurer to use. Instead, the lender typically
selects a company, orders a policy, and presents it to the owner
at the closing table. However, any consumer who wants to comparison
shop is theoretically free to do so. Because rates are regulated
by state insurance commissioners, buyers probably will not notice
much difference in price among title insurers in their area.
What will distinguish the companies is the level of service they
offer. Some respond promptly to claims while others ignore policyholders,
so it is worthwhile to seek references from real estate lawyers
who are familiar with all the companies. Buyers should also contact
the Better Business Bureau and the consumer-affairs department
of the state insurance commission, which may know of past problems.<p>
<p>
 Homeowners who fail to purchase title insurance for themselves
when they acquire property can buy it at any time, although they
must pay the cost of a new title search. Those who presently
are insured should consider increasing their coverage if their
home has increased in value, unless their policy is automatically
adjusted for appreciation and inflation.   
<p>
 Although the public is rarely told of its existence, a discount
on lenders' insurance is available to people who refinance their
mortgages if the title has been searched within the past ten
years and the new policy is written by the same company. To obtain
the savings, they must request a title-insurance reissue rate
when making a loan application.   
<p>
 Homeowners also should remember that owners' title insurance
extends from the day they purchase until the day they sell and
even continues after death if title to the property remains in
the family. Thus, someone who refinances does not need to purchase
owners' title insurance at all because the original policy is
still in effect. Unfortunately, says Benny L. Kass, a real estate
attorney with Kass, Skalet, Segan, Spevack & Van Grack in Washington,
D.C., "a lot of people who refinance are being sold new owner's
coverage by settlement companies and lawyers who are basically
dishonest."   
<p>
 Some of these same shady characters may fail to explain private
mortgage insurance. PMI helps people obtain a mortgage when they
have not accumulated enough to make the traditional 20 percent
downpayment. The insurance, which costs homeowners between $3.50
and $5.00 a year per $1,000 borrowed (or about $1,500 a year
on a $300,000 house), covers the lender in case of a default,
allowing bankers to make loans they might otherwise refuse to
underwrite.   
<p>
 The concept of PMI is excellent, but its execution is fraught
with pitfalls. For starters, the insurance is offered by only
eight companies, which seem bent on keeping as much distance
as possible between themselves and the home buyers who purchase
their premiums. "Mortgage insurers work with lenders, who choose
an appropriate PMI program for each borrower. Generally, the
consumer does not even know who the insurer is," says Suzanne
Hutchinson, executive vice president of the Mortgage Insurance
Companies of America, the Washington, D.C.-based trade organization
for the industry.   
<p>
 Should homeowners care which company gets their PMI payments?
"I would say not," responds Charles M. Reid, president of United
Guarantee Residential Insurance in Greensboro, North Carolina.
"It is a free marketplace, and a lender is going to do everything
possible to [find] a very competitive monthly payment for the
borrower."   
<p>
 That assumes that bankers shop as hard to save our money as
we would. Consider that after shoehorning buyers into PMI programs
not of their choosing, lenders are not required to notify homeowners
when they've acquired enough equity so that the PMI can be canceled.
"It is up to the homeowner to keep an eye on that because most
lenders don't track it," says Bonnie O'Dell, director of consumer
information at the Federal National Mortgage Association.  
<p>
 Some lenders even require that PMI be carried for the length
of the loan, no matter how far down it is paid. No federal regulations
have been written to prohibit this clearly unfair practice, so
the only way for homeowners to climb out from under unwarranted
PMI premiums may be to refinance their loan.  
<p>
 PMI borrowers should periodically review the amount of equity
in their home in order to cancel the insurance or, if necessary,
refinance at the earliest opportunity. Although it takes almost
11 years to achieve 20 percent equity in a 5 percent down, 30-year
fixed-rate loan at 7 percent interest, rising property values
or home improvements can cause the equity to appreciate much
more rapidly.  
<p>
 Regardless of how much or how little equity they have in the
home, those who refinance, as well as new buyers, are wise to
resist sales pressure from their lender to buy credit life insurance,
which pays off the mortgage if the homeowner dies. "Credit life
is usually a rip-off," declares Peter C. Katt, a fee-only life
insurance advisor in West Bloomfield, Michigan. Indeed, he points
out that when the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
studied credit life insurance in 1991, it found that only 39
cents of every premium dollar is ever returned to the consumer.<p>
<p>
 The credit-life industry can maintain its whopping 61 percent
margin because its insurance costs from about 2 to 4.5 times
as much as term life insurance, which can also be used to retire
a mortgage upon death. For example, term insurance for a 35-year-old
male nonsmoker currently costs 92 cents per $1,000 of coverage,
while credit life for the same individual costs $4.08 per $1,000.
Credit life insurance salespeople would argue that their premiums
never increase while term insurance grows more expensive each
year as the person ages. But they fail to point out that credit-life
coverage decreases as the mortgage principal is paid down, while
term insurance coverage remains constant. (To reduce term insurance
in tandem with the mortgage, request a lower level of coverage
every year, which will also lower the annual premiums.) The difference
in premiums is less dramatic when homeowners are older, but credit
life never proves to be the more economical deal. "Credit-life
premiums rarely cost less than twice what someone can pay for
term insurance," Katt says.  
<p>
 It is custom and lender clout, rather than any equitable division
of personal responsibility, that makes title and private mortgage
insurance a necessity for American homeowners to buy in the mid-1990s.
Fair or not, prudent consumers have little choice but to pay
for these two products. However, unless home buyers can't get
life insurance any other way, there's no good reason to enrich
a credit-life company.

						Direct-response auto insurance eliminates the middleman<p>By Morey Stettner<p>Here's a nasty secret that the agent who sold you your car insurance doesn't want you to know: He may be obsolete soon. The growth of direct-response insurance companies -- which sell policies directly to consumers via toll-free phone lines -- could kill off traditional auto-insurance agents.<p>Highly regarded direct-response carriers, such as USAA, GEICO, and Amica Mutual, give quotes over the phone and train customer-service representatives to answer questions. And since these companies don't pay commissions, their policies are often cheaper by 10 percent or more.<p>From 1984 to 1993, direct-response companies' share of the auto-insurance market grew twice as fast as that of other insurers. In a 1995 survey of insurers conducted by Conning & Company, 
a Hartford, Connecticut based market-research firm, more than 75 percent of the respondents predicted that direct-response companies would capture an increasing share of the personal-auto-insurance market. Indeed, there are signs that shoppers will have more opportunities to cut out the middleman and buy auto insurance directly from the source. Deep-pocketed American International Group is helping a California carrier, 20th Century, expand its direct-response operation into Arizona. And GEICO, now a privately held firm owned primarily by Warren Buffett, has broadened its focus from active and retired government employees to include all drivers.<p>Competition will heat up even more when an ambitious new carrier, Direct Response, starts selling auto insurance directly to the public in 1997. The company, formed by two seasoned insurance executives, has attracted $215 million in private equity financing. One of its founders has built 12-year-old Direct Line Insurance into the largest personal auto insurer in the United Kingdom.<p>"Why did Buffett buy GEICO?" asks Lee Jamieson, counsel to the chairman at Direct Response. "The reason is direct-response companies will gain market share because of economies of scale and because consumers are more inclined to buy auto insurance over the phone. We're confident we can provide a high level of service and educate consumers. And we intend to undercut the competition by offering a lower-priced product by cutting agency expenses and building costs."<p>To test how much money you might save with direct-response companies, try the Consumer Reports Auto Insurance Price Service (800-808-4912). For $12, you will receive quotes to insure your car from up to 25 companies (the service is available in California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington).<p>Progressive Insurance, a direct-response insurer, also offers a free auto-insurance comparison-rate service in most states (800-AUTOPRO). Aside from giving Progressive's rate, the company provides rates from up to three insurers. For example, a 35-year-old Maryland driver with a clean record received the following three six-month premium quotes on a 1987 Subaru: Progressive, $450; Allstate, $294; State Farm, $221.<p>There is a downside: To control costs and keep their risk pool clean, many direct-response companies choose their markets selectively and restrict who can purchase policies from them. USAA, the nation's fifth-largest car insurer, sells auto policies only to military personnel and their families. ITT Hartford sells policies that are usually lower in price exclusively to American Association of Retired Persons members using a special hot line (800-423-6789). New Jersey Manufacturers offers auto insurance only to employees who work for a member company.<p>There are geographic limits as well. Nationwide Insurance, a big national carrier, sells auto policies by phone in 20 western states. Policies from 20th Century are available only in California but will soon be sold in Arizona. And a start-up outfit, Driver's Direct, pitches car policies in Illinois and Iowa.<p>"If you're looking at a regional carrier, be careful," says Robert Hunter, head of the insurance group at the Consumer Federation of America. "Understand what happens if you use a company that's only licensed in a few eastern states and you drive out to California and have an accident. You want to make sure that the company provides good service even if you're out of state or out of the region where it operates. And make sure it's financially sound."<p><p><p><p>

						Viatical settlements offer the terminally ill cash today<p>By Morey Stettner<p>Larry Imbordino, a 39-year-old firefighter in West Chicago, 
Illinois, recently took his two young sons on a weeklong vacation to Florida. He calls the trip a miracle. Imbordino, who has suffered from lymphoma for nine years, has persevered through several
relapses and rounds of chemotherapy. A year ago, he was nearly out of cash.<p>"After all the treatments and doctor bills, I wasn't left with much," Imbordino says. "My credit was ruined, and I had to put my house up for sale."<p>Then he heard about viatical settlements. In return for naming Viaticus, a private company, the beneficiary of his $40,000 worth of life-insurance policies, Imbordino got a check for $30,000. "It was tough to fill out those forms," Imbordino says. "It's like an admission of death. But that money enabled me to take my sons to <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a> World, pay my mortgage, and take care of all my other bills."<p>Today, more than 70 companies buy about $500 million in life-insurance policies annually from the terminally ill. While most early viatical settlements (from the Latin viaticum, a word meaning provisions for a journey, later adopted by Christians to mean the Communion given to a dying person) were reached with AIDS patients, the practice is moving into the mainstream, serving victims of cancer and other illnesses. In 1994, CNA became the first insurance company to enter the viatical business when it began funding Viaticus; other insurers are expected to follow. <p>Should you decide to viaticate, your aim should be to launch a bidding war to attract the highest payout for your policy. The Viatical Association of America (800-842-9811), a nonprofit group, offers a free list of its member companies. Payout rates range from 40 to 90 percent of the face value of the policy, so there is room for negotiation. Once a firm determines that your policy is valid and incontestable (and that the insurer permits it to be sold), it will review your records to estimate your life expectancy: the longer you've got, the lower the bid.<p>Because viaticals are still new and work with a vulnerable population of terminally ill people, there's room for chicanery and downright fraud. Only 11 states have laws or consumer safeguards that regulate viatical companies.<p>Of the 70 or so viatical outfits, only about a dozen actually have the capital on hand to pay out. The rest are brokers who first cut a deal with a patient, then place the account with a funder, who in turn coughs up the cash. "What most people who viaticate don't know is that brokers charge a commission," says Per Larson, a financial adviser in New York City. "The median is 6 percent of the face value of the policy." New York is the only state that requires brokers to disclose their commissions.<p>"Brokers don't have to disclose how they are being paid or who's paying them," Larson says. "What's worse, there's a built-in structural incentive for the broker not to get you the highest offer. They may not want to damage their relationship with a funder that pays a high commission, and there's no reason for them to engage in competitive bidding." You can avoid this by working directly with a viatical firm.<p>In some cases, dying persons sign up with a viatical firm and then wait months for their payout -- time they can't afford to lose. As part of negotiations with a firm, viaticators should insist that an escrow account be established before they give up their policy.<p>A final word of caution: Clinics, doctors, and other seemingly unbiased sources of counseling can steer you to viatical companies for the wrong reasons. The Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington, D.C., has agreed to accept 3 percent of the face value of all policies bought within a 100-mile radius of Washington by Life Entitlements, a New Yorkbased viatical firm. "I see it as a conflict of interest," says Peg Downey, a financial planner in Silver Spring, Maryland, who thinks Whitman-Walker could possibly end up sending all its viatical business to Life Entitlements. "This may help Whitman-Walker, but it's not necessarily in the individual's best interest."<p><p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> PREPARE FOR MEDICARE <p>The window of opportunity for the best premiums closes quickly <p> By Morey Stettner  <p> If you or a parent is approaching age 65, it's not too soon to look into Medicare and Medigap policies for health insurance. And before long, it may be too late. Medicare premiums are lowest if you enroll three months before to four months after your 65th birthday; after that, the premiums may grow by 10 percent for each year you wait. At the same time, start comparing Medigap policies. These Medicare supplements, sold by private insurers, reimburse policyholders for costs not covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs. Federal law guarantees that during the six months following enrollment in Medicare Part B (in which97 percent of Americans over 65 are enrolled) anyone can buy a Medigap policy regardless of health problems. After this six-month window, insurers are likely to require a medical screening, and applications can be denied.  <p> There are ten Medigap plans to choose from, labeled A through J; the benefits improve as you go down the alphabet. "The rates vary, so compare a few quotes from private insurers," says Sam Beller, president of Diversified Programs, a New York City insurance agency. "Also, check if you can get retiree health insurance from your former employer."  <p> The Social Security Administration offers a free booklet, 1996 Guide to Health Insurance for People With Medicare, with a directory of agencies providing free counseling on Medicare and Medigap coverage (800-772-1213). The Health Insurance Association of America offers free guides on Medigap and long-term-care policies:write to HIAA, Publication Office, 555 13th St., NW, Suite 600-E,Washington, D.C., 20004.   <p><p>

Worth magazine/Personal Adviser<p>FOREIGN POLICIES
Fearing kidnappers? Fido needs a bypass? We got you covered.<p>By Morey Stettner<p>Everyone knows about life, health, and auto insurance. But kidnap insurance? That's one of the creative new policies insurance executives have dreamed up. Do these products make sense? For some anxious buyers, maybe. For insurers, definitely. Here are a few plans to think about -- or not, as the case may be.<p>KIDNAP INSURANCE. Attention, kidnap targets! This coverage pays the ransom up to the policy limit ($1 million to $30 million), along with the services of crisis-management specialists and related medical, legal, and travel expenses. The cheapest plan costs $1,000 a year for insurance of $1 million. The coverage includes losses from extortion and unlawful detention. Just don't brag about your purchase, or your claim will be denied. "Confidentiality is an absolute requirement of all parties," says Mike Andritch of Preferred Contingency Insurance Services. <p>If you travel to high-risk countries such as Colombia and Peru, this coverage can be a lifesaver -- literally. But executives who rarely go abroad are better off using common sense (namely, don't flaunt your wealth and shun publicity about your pay package). <p>PET INSURANCE. Veterinary Pet Insurance now offers catastrophic care for dogs and cats. Pet owners can insure their pets against major illnesses and broken bones; routine checkups are not covered. A policy on a puppy or kitten starts at $49 a year, with pricier, added-benefit policies for older pets. <p>As a rule, insurance should save you from financial crises, not a few hundred dollars in veterinary bills. Most pet owners are better off earmarking some savings for a pet's medical care.<p>WEDDING INSURANCE. A wedding can involve big bucks: payments to a caterer, florist, reception hall, photographer, band. For $603, you can buy a $20,000 policy from Fireman's Fund that covers everything from stolen gifts to a last-minute rip in the gown. Even your photographs are insured: If the negatives are lost or stolen, the policy pays to fly the family back to the wedding site for a new round of pictures. <p>But if someone gets cold feet, there's no coverage. Nor should you need added liability protection, since you may already be insured by the wedding or reception site's policy.<p>PERSONAL-COMPUTER INSURANCE. Your computer crashes and you lose dozens of vital files. Disaster? Not with this policy from Frontier Insurance. For $125 a year, you get $10,000 of coverage that pays for a systems consultant to reinstall lost data or help reconstruct files. The policy, geared toward professionals who use a computer for storing business records, covers loss of data from virtually any cause, from accidental erasure to a virus.<p>While homeowners insurance usually covers computer theft, it won't help retrieve lost data. If there are valuable files on your computer, $125 a year is a small price to pay to cover their loss. And let's face it: No matter who you are, you're more likely to suffer a crash than a kidnapping.<p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> IT'S VARIABLE, BUT IS IT PROFITABLE?  <p> By J.C. Louis  <p> Of the three cornerstones of sound investment planning preserving capital, minimizing taxation, and outpacing inflation the last is the most vexing to the life insurance industry.  <p> This wasn't the case back when whole life, with its fixed premium, death benefit, and guaranteed return, was the dominant life insurance product. But the inflation and sky-high interest rates of the1970s and early 1980s undermined the premise on which whole life was sold that the tax-free compounding of policyholders' assets in the insurance company's portfolio would eventually pay for the premiums. Soaring rates made it impossible for insurers to make good on that promise.  <p> In response, insurers shifted investments and products toward vehicles that offered higher returns but also greater risk. This strategy led to variable insurance, including universal life, whose cash value fluctuated with interest rates.  <p> Then came variable universal life. To combat the steady erosion of inflation, insurance companies now permit policyholders to place their premiums in accounts, administered by the companies, that invest primarily in stocks. Some insurers have joined premier mutual fund families, which place insurance premiums in accounts that emulate their no-load funds.  <p> The holder of a VUL policy invests in and manages a diverse portfolio of equity mutual funds, which historically have provided an effective hedge against inflation. The policyholder can alter the amount and timing of premium payments or the size of death benefits. He or she can borrow tax free up to 90 percent of the policy's cash value periodically or in one chunk or name a child beneficiary while retaining ownership. This last option lets the policyholder enjoy VUL tax benefits, then pass them along. These are all attractive options, and sales of VULs have more than doubled in the last five years, exceeding $7 billion in1994. Equitable Life and Prudential are the leading underwriters. <p> But VULs come with major problems. First, the policyholder assumes the risk, which is not true with whole life, as the rate of return on investments is not guaranteed (though the death benefit usually is) by the insurer. The investments' value depends on the performance of the funds chosen by the policyholder.  <p> Moreover, insurers often hamper their customers' ability to optimize returns. To achieve maximum performance over the long term, a VUL holder ideally should be able to load a policy with a wide array of highly aggressive funds. Insurers, however, seek to minimize trading and hold down costs by offering a limited number of funds to choose from. This can make assembling an optimal portfolio difficult. Jack Bowers, editor of the independent newsletter Fidelity Monitor, says restrictions on investment options result in systematic investment underperformance for the holders of VUL policies.  <p> VUL policy returns are also diminished in other ways. James Hunt, an actuary with the insurance group of the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America, says the mortality charges alone (the cost of  the actual insurance, exclusive of the investment component of the account), which are often not listed in prospectuses, can greatly exceed the cheapest term insurance. Broker commissions, management fees, and monthly and annual administrative costs may further reduce performance by between 2 and 5 percent.  <p> The upshot, says Hunt, is that a VUL account below $100,000 isn't cost-effective. Larger policies should generate a minimum average annual return of 10 to 12 percent (before asset charges) to be comparable to a typical whole-life policy earning 7 to7.5 percent. VUL is "a wonderful product conceptually," says Hunt. In almost all cases, however, "you need to select aggressive-growth funds, dollar-cost average over a long period [20 years or more], and hope you do well enough to overcome the charges."  <p> For these reasons, says John Fenton of Tillinghast, an Atlanta insurance consulting firm, "if one cannot commit to a consistent savings plan or tolerate any loss of principal, VUL is not the place to be." Moreover, if the policy lapses, all money borrowed from it could be taxable.  <p> Newsletter publisher William E. Donoghue advises those with VUL coverage to compare the net loan costs (the interest rate on loans taken against the policy minus the rate generated by the investments) and the range of choices in funds. "One needs international stocks and bonds as well as gold, junk bonds, and real estate funds," he says. The Consumer Federation of America(202-387-6121) will create a detailed comparison of a VUL policy against low-cost term coverage for a $40 fee.    <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Advisor/Family Finance<p>IN INSURANCE, STICK WITH THE BASICS<p>By Kathleen Murray<p>We like to be protected. These days insurance companies are only too willing to help. Faced with stiff competition and hemorrhaging red ink from natural-disaster claims, insurers nationwide are inundating individuals with pitches for expensive policies that provide overly narrow coverage.<p>"Right now you're seeing a lot of companies aggressively trying to remarket old policies and develop new lines," says Steven Goldstein, spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, an insurance-industry group in New York City. "But some of these products are duplicative, and some people simply don't need them." <p>For example, the rapid growth in home offices and telecommuting has prompted companies like RLI Insurance in Peoria, Illinois, to offer home-office insurance policies to cover office equipment. RLI charges up to $225 annually to cover as much as $5,000 worth of equipment, such as fax machines and computers. These plans also include protection against up to one year's  loss of income due to, say, fire or theft. Such coverage may seem prudent, but Kathleen F. O'Reilly, counsel for the Consumer Federation of America's insurance group in Washington, D.C., says you should first make certain you're not already covered under your homeowner policy, or that you can't get an inexpensive rider. <p>Other insurance products merely offer new twists on traditional policies, like life and medical insurance. Salvatore Castiglione, chief of the New York Insurance Department's Consumer Services Bureau, says agents often pressure workers nearing retirement to buy so-called vanishing-premium life insurance. Agents often claim these policies pay for themselves by redirecting dividends toward premium costs after nine years or so. However, dividend payouts are calculated on the basis of the insurer's assumptions about the direction of market rates. If rates decline, individuals may end up paying premiums well beyond nine years. <p>Some insurers also pressure single people and childless couples to buy unnecessary life insurance, experts say, in part by failing to inform them that the primary reason for such coverage is to protect immediate-family members against loss of income if the policyholder dies. This often makes sense for single-earner families with children. But for single- and two-earner households with no children, it's usually unnecessary.<p>Senior citizens may be encouraged to acquire "dread disease" health insurance from companies such as American Family Life Assurance Co. of Columbus, Georgia. These offer financial protection should the insured contract specific illnesses, principally cancer but also diabetes, renal failure and others. For example, a typical cancer policy costs between $222 and  $276 annually and provides an initial $1,750 payout upon diagnosis, up to $2,100 for every surgical procedure, and $300 a day for hospital costs ($600 a day for stays of more than 70 days).<p>Sounds good, but policyholders may find that this supplementary coverage may actually raise their out-of-pocket costs, and Norma Border, director of the National Association of Claims Assistance Professionals, says that many companies selling these policies are often slow to pay off claims.<p>Rather than answering every brochure appearing in their mailbox, people should stick with the basics in buying insurance. For example, comprehensive medical coverage will buy up to $1 million of insurance in a lifetime for as little as $51 a month.<p>By investing in solid, comprehensive life, homeowner, and medical coverage, individuals will have more insurance than they can ever use. Policyholders can also ask insurers to append riders to their existing policies for supplemental coverage.<p>For example, State Farm in Bloomington, Illinois, offers $10,000 in additional home-office coverage for as little as $14 a year. And those who don't already have income-replacement insurance under a disability plan can get it through a rider for an additional $50 annually. For a list of inexpensive life, health, and long-term care policies, individuals can order a free report from Quotesmith, an insurance price-comparison service in Darien, Illinois, by calling 800-556-9393.<p>Generally, says Robert Hunter, spokesman for the Consumer Federation of America in Washington, D.C., piecemeal insurance policies are not the best way to protect yourself. Says Hunter: "The worst buys are policies that are narrow and restrictive."<p><p>

						Bypassing the middleman can mean cutting your costs.<p>By Robert N. Veres<p>The old adage in insurance circles is that life insurance is sold rather than bought. Deconstructed: Unless you pay somebody a lot of money to persuade people to buy insurance, they won't. This is one reason some insurance salesmen earn commissions equal to as much as 150 percent of a policy's first-year premium.<p>At one time, the mutual fund industry used to abide by the same idea, selling its offerings primarily through brokers. Then, fund companies discovered they could bypass the middlemen and market directly to the public. <p>Now some insurance companies are starting to do the same thing. They are offering an array of products directly to consumers and, in the process, are eliminating charges for sales commissions. By shopping carefully or by enlisting the help of a non-commission, fee-only financial advisor, consumers can share in the cost savings. <p>At present, there are about 30 no-load (commission-free) plans offered by 11 different insurers. Last year, Denver-based Great-West Life -- one of the few insurers with a top financial rating from A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's and Moody's -- cut back its reliance on brokerage relationships and created a no-load insurance line that has grown to include two universal-life policies, two whole-life contracts, and a ten-year renewable term policy.<p>More recently, Security Benefit Life entered the market with a universal-life policy, and Ameritas Life received approval to sell no-load contracts in New York. A further twist was added by Federal Home Life, which introduced a joint first-to-die universal policy designed for working couples, with the benefits payable if either spouse were to suffer premature death. It also is being sold as a no-load product.<p>The new offerings arrive none too soon. With certificates of deposit still paying little in the way of interest, many commissioned life-insurance agents have been hawking policies as investments, tempting buyers with yields on universal contracts of roughly 6.5 percent a year -- tax free. Nevertheless, the upfront costs are so high that, at today's rates, someone in the 30 percent tax bracket who purchased a fully loaded universal policy would have to hold on to it for 20 years before he would see the returns the brokers promise. And even then, the promised return isn't much better than that offered by intermediate-term bonds.<p>The question is: Why wait so long?<p>The beauty of no-load life insurance is that when upfront costs are eliminated, the payoff can start building much faster. "If you have already identified the problem and you have identified life insurance as being the most economically viable solution, then you really don't need the services of a salesperson," says John Roeske, a vice president at Great-West Life.<p>Similarly, the annuities market has also  spawned commissionless alternatives. Currently four companies offer no-load, no-surrender-charge annuities. The least expensive is offered by Vanguard through National Home Life. The product's overhead costs, which include administration fees and guaranteed death benefits, are less than 1 percent of the total investment. The average cost for all variable annuities, according to Chicago-based Morningstar, is 2 percent. Another no-load variable annuity is being readied for market later this year by discount broker <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab & Co.</b></a> through Transamerica.<p>Vanguard allows annuity holders to invest in a variety of its funds. Because of these plans' tax-deferred status, it usually makes sense to buy value-oriented funds whose high percentage of dividends can accumulate free of current taxes. <p>A newcomer to the annuities market is American Skandia Advisors Choice. Skandia's contract lets a buyer choose from a variety of asset managers; it also offers 37 mutual fund portfolios -- more than any other annuity currently on the market. But this flexibility may not come cheap. On top of the 0.9 percent administration costs, Skandia uses brokers to sell its wares, giving them free rein to negotiate their commissions with their customers. These fees are taken from the annuity. <p>It would be nice to report that sales costs are all a buyer needs to look at when shopping in the insurance market. Unfortunately, the truth isn't so simple. Because insurance contracts are complex, a carrier can drop sales charges and simply build the costs in elsewhere. What's more, some fully loaded policies are good buys because the companies that sell them consistently make money for their customers despite high sales costs. Northwestern Mutual Life is such an example.<p>Serious shoppers need to either take their time and wade carefully through all the choices or hire a fee-only financial advisor to do the work for them. The latter option, of course, will cut into the savings of buying a no-load policy.<p><p>

						In postearthquake Los Angeles, insurance doesn't always provide protection -- unless you have the Equalizer<p>By Mark Stuart Gill<p>At 4:31 A.M. on January 17, the tectonic plates that connect North America and the Pacific Basin rubbed against each other. An instant later, a vibration that would measure 6.6 on the Richter scale shot up 11 miles through the earth's crust and surfaced near a community north of Los Angeles called Hidden Hills, where it exploded the chimney of a $455,000 ranch house belonging to Jonathan Kissel, a criminal defense attorney with a thriving practice in Los Angeles. Kissel and his wife woke up as bricks rained down on their patio. Inside the house, their tile floors popped open. Inch-wide gashes tore across the wall. Through the dark, Jon Kissel heard glass crashing and realized his $295 bottles of Lafite-Rothschild '66 were bouncing out of the wine rack.<p>The Kissels had been through earthquakes before. Jon yelled to his wife Pam, "I'll get the girls, you get the baby." But the house was alive and fighting them. A 300-pound Mitsubishi wide-screen TV fell off its stand and clipped Jon before it rumbled across the room and blocked the bedroom's exit to the hall.  Pam slipped past the TV and into the hallway, where the hot-water heater crashed through the wall of a utility closet and pinned her momentarily against the wall.<p>As Jon ran towards the room where his two daughters slept, Pam got free of the water heater--just in time to see her baby boy's crib rolling across the nursery. It was moving toward a cracked window that overlooked a hill. For a few horrible seconds, Pam Kissel thought her son would die.<p>A moment later, the shaking stopped. Everything was quiet. Fifty homes in the neighborhood had suffered extensive damage from what would soon come to be known as the Northridge earthquake. The Santa Susana mountains were 15 inches higher. In the next room, the crib rocked gently next to the window. The baby never even woke up.<p><p>Like most Californians, Jon Kissel says he's used to living in a landscape where disaster comes routinely, in the forms of earthquakes, wildfires, mudslides, and windstorms. "It's the price you pay," he says now, "for living in paradise." What worries him far more is the quake's financial aftermath--the haggling with insurance companies that may drag on into the next century. <p>At least Kissel's insured. Only 25 percent of homeowners in California have insurance for quakes, which are not covered under standard homeowner's policies. In the area hit by the Northridge quake, about 40 percent are covered. Earthquake insurance can cost as much as homeowner's insurance itself--about $2 for every $1,000 worth of coverage--and is notoriously ambiguous in its wording.<p>One thing was immediately clear to Kissel, though: The policy had a 10 percent deductible, which meant he'd be eating the first $45,500 of damage to his home. "The sun was just coming up when I read that," he says. "My wife was threatening to move back to Chicago. I got on the telephone and called my Equalizer."<p>He's talking about Robb Greenspan, a 42-year-old former nightclub musician turned public adjuster whom Kissel hired to do battle with his insurance company and, he hopes, increase his settlement by as much as six figures. California, the state that gave us the tax revolt, has currently turned its self-absorbed revolutionary ire against the insurance industry. The shock troops in this war are public adjusters like Greenspan. PAs, as they are called, represent claimants against private adjusters employed by insurance companies. They speed up the paperwork, prepare what one might call generous estimates of damages, and handle the technicalities that overwhelm amateur claim filers. At the end of the process, a PA takes a lucrative contingency fee, around 10 percent of the negotiated settlement.<p>In normal times, public adjusters are about as well regarded as personal-injury lawyers. In fact, to protect consumers from the often predatory ways of PAs, California law states that public adjusters can solicit business only between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., and they are not allowed to approach clients when a loss-producing disaster is still in progress. Other states don't even allow them to solicit business outside their own offices. The insurance industry regards PAs as a nuisance. "A public adjuster can always gouge an extra 10 percent out of an insurer just by being a pain in the ass for long enough,'' says an insurance adjuster. "But those inflated payments just get reflected in higher premiums next year."<p>But these are not normal times. Since 1990, California has been hit by one costly disaster after another. The governor's office has issued emergency declarations covering 56 of the state's 58 counties. The 1992 Los Angeles riots cost $750 million in insurance payouts. Last fall's brushfires, which swept through some of the the most expensive neighborhoods in the country, cost more than $1 billion. But these full-blown catastrophes look like petty claims compared to the earthquake, which will cost an estimated $2.5 billion in insured losses, putting it alongside Florida's Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and the Midwest floods in 1993 as one of the most expensive disasters in U.S. history. <p>The likes of Jon Kissel may deal with disasters by deciding they are a worthy price to pay for living in L.A., but Robb Greenspan doesn't need to make any psychological cost-of-living adjustments. Catastrophe is his business. He refers to the riots as "my Super Bowl moment." Before then, the Greenspan Co. had been a small family-owned business started by Robb's father in 1946. The firm serviced mostly fire victims like the Cask 'n Cleaver restaurant chain and Kyong Sok Ko's EPS 23 Minute Photo & Studio. But now that bad things have started happening even to rich people, Greenspan says his 40-person firm has negotiated settlements for glamorous clients such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Rob Reiner. He drives a Mercedes-Benz 300SE. "Robb's like this Schwarzenegger hero/villain guiding us through the financial apocalypse of L.A.," says one of his clients in the movie industry.<p>While consumer advocates allow that it's possible to wangle a fair settlement after a property loss, the operative sentiment throughout the state seems to be: If you don't go on the offensive, you'll get screwed. "Forget all the insurance ads promising security and the hype about "good hands' people protecting you," says Ina De Long, a former State Farm insurance specialist and president of United Policyholders, a consumer-advocacy group. She says she quit State Farm after 22 years because she felt the company provided inadequate training for its adjusters. "After a loss you have to kick and scratch. People have grown deeply mistrustful of insurance companies."<p>After five years of record disasters and record payouts, insurance companies are less willing than ever to give generous settlements. "Insurance is so universal, it's regarded as an inalienable right," says De Long, who's helped make high insurance premiums a hot-button issue in California politics. "But what it's become is a real bottom-line business. Money in is good, money out is bad."<p>Greenspan says his typical clients will call him when they find out, for instance, they'll only collect $300,000 on a $500,000 loss. PAs like Greenspan can help close those gaps. Sometimes, they can do much better for their clients. In 1992, when a high-rise in downtown Oakland suffered fire damage, Greenspan says he was approached by the building's owners. Their insurance company had offered a $55,000 settlement to replace electrical wiring and clean the carpets and walls. Greenspan brought the case to arbitration and got his clients $22 million. "The fire was small, but a transformer that burned up had PCPs in it," he says. "My strategy was that the entire high-rise was environmentally unsound. Big, big issue in the '90s. Anyone can make a damaged structure look all right. But is it really healthy?"<p>Of course, most of his settlements are a little more down-to-earth. Jon Kissel first used Greenspan in 1993. Rain had leaked through Kissel's roof and mildewed the walls. Allstate sent out an adjuster, who inspected the damage. Kissel, who was expecting just $11,000, hired Greenspan, who promptly settled with Allstate for $53,000. Even subtracting Greenspan's fee, Kissel made four times what he thought he would.<p><p>"You're misinterpreting the policy," says Robb Greenspan. "My client has a devastating loss." It's a couple of days after the earthquake. More than 200,000 earthquake insurance claims have been filed. The Clinton administration is seeking a $6.6 billion aid package (later adjusted to $8.6 billion). Thousands of applications for Federal Emergency Management Agency aid are pouring in, so many that National Guardsmen are standing outside FEMA's makeshift offices in the San Fernando Valley to prevent rioting. In his cluttered high-rise office near Koreatown, Robb Greenspan is arguing about dog food.<p>"My client was quaked, he was burned out," says Greenspan, hashing out a claim for a house in Malibu destroyed by wildfires in August and finished off by the earthquake four months later. "The house is kaput. Irreplaceable mementos. His wife--she loved that house. Did you know it's affecting the marriage? And you're hocking me about reimbursement for $273 worth of Kibbles 'n Bits."<p>The adjuster from the insurance company, a beefy, blond kid in a suit who looks like he played offensive tackle on his college football team, fidgets in his chair. A beeper starts to buzz spasmodically on Greenspan's belt. No more than 30 seconds ever go by when something in his office isn't beeping, screeching, squawking, ringing, or paging. His office is crammed with cellular phones, a two-way radio, and police and fire scanners, all beneath framed pictures of burning buildings on the wall. Another beeper connects him to a news service that, for $200 a month, relays breaking news about fires before the fire engines even arrive.<p>This time, it's the client Greenspan has been discussing, Howdy Kabrins, calling from his car phone. Kabrins, a 46-year-old entrepreneur, owns La Salsa restaurants, a 45-store chain of Mexican eateries in the western United States. He's been calling every ten minutes for updates on the negotiations. He wanted to be here in person, but a mudslide has jammed up traffic on the Pacific Coast Highway. Greenspan puts him on the speakerphone and goes back to bickering with the adjuster. <p>Greenspan's chief technique is to simply wear down the opposition. "Time is on my side," he says later. "Insurance-company adjusters work on a salary. They get paid to close cases, not to nitpick." <p>"Robb's secret," says one client, "is that he's got incredible stamina and a leather bladder." Another says, "He keeps repeating the same bad jokes over and over until the adjusters go insane." <p>The topic of contention is a small clause in the policy that covers additional living expenses (the out-of-pocket money a client spends while his home is uninhabitable). Greenspan is trying to prove that Kabrins needs $10,000 a month to maintain his normal lifestyle while his home is being rebuilt. The insurance adjuster figures he can get by on $6,000 a month. <p>"These are Howdy's food receipts for $75 a day," says Greenspan.<p>"We can't give him that much credit on food," says the insurer.<p>"He's a restaurateur," says Greenspan. "He eats good." <p>"He eats very good."<p>"You want him at <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> every night?"<p>The adjuster holds up another bill. It's from a Malibu kennel. "Why should we pay for dog food if a kennel is feeding the dogs?" he asks.<p>"You're really stuck on the dogs," says Greenspan. "You're obsessed with these dogs.  The truth is Howdy had to feed them before he took them to the kennel."<p>"The dogs ate $237 worth of food while they were waiting to go to the kennel?"<p>"They're big dogs. Hungry dogs."<p>"Does he have any receipts for all this dog food?" asks the adjuster.<p>Greenspan shakes his head and tries another tack: "Those poor dogs were traumatized. All four of them: Paco. Tequila. Razzle. And..." <p>"Panda," says Kabrins, his voice crackling over the speakerphone.<p>"You're lucky we didn't send the poor dogs to a shrink," says Greenspan to the adjuster, "and stick you with the bill."<p><p>By the time Kabrins arrives, an hour later, Greenspan has managed to hike his additional living expenses to $10,000 a month. Kabrins, who's paying $7,000 a month for a large rental house on the beach in Malibu, seems pleased but confused.<p>"I wish I could handle this myself," he sighs. "My bank thinks I'm crazy to be giving a public adjuster 15 percent of my settlement. But dealing with this is like taking on a whole other career." According to Ina De Long,  many couples find that one of them has to give up his or her job after a disaster to work the claim full time.<p>"I hired Greenspan," Kabrins continues, "because I had to level the playing field. Also, I didn't want to hire a lawyer. I hate dealing with lawyers. This insurance company I thought was going to be there for me is now trying to bury me in paperwork. They're killing me." <p>Greenspan hustles Kabrins off to the only quiet place in his offices, the men's lavatory. "Look," he says. "We're going to concede on the dog food. I agreed to only $50 in reimbursement. See, the dog food is just our ploy."<p>"Our ploy?" asks Kabrins. <p>"Yes," smiles Greenspan. "We concede the little stuff and then nail them for the big stuff."<p>Because Kabrins lived in Malibu, where real estate prices and the risk of natural disaster are both high, it was practically impossible for him to insure his house fully against disaster. When he bought the house and property in June 1993 for $1.5 million, he bought homeowner's insurance from California Fair Plan, a state-mandated policy offered by a consortium of insurance companies for property no one wants to insure. Kabrins's annual premium for that was roughly $2,300--and the coverage it offered was bare-bones. The policy promised to pay not what a home costs to rebuild, but the "current cash value" of the home, less depreciation for age and wear, which in this case came out to around $572,000.<p>Since Kabrins estimated his house would cost $800,000 to rebuild, he supplemented Fair Plan with a disaster policy from SafeCo, a Seattle-based insurance company. In the event of a disaster, the policy--with an annual premium of roughly $1,000--guaranteed the replacement costs for the house and its contents over and above what his Fair Plan policy covered.<p>Six months later, when everything Kabrins owned was destroyed, Fair Plan paid off, but Howdy got a little surprise: The back pages of his SafeCo policy guaranteed him coverage for every type of disaster but fire. According to the policy, Greenspan says, SafeCo didn't appear to owe his client anything but additional living expenses.<p>"He was misinformed," says Greenspan, who says he has two other multimillion-dollar clients in the same canyon as Howdy Kabrins with the same interpretation-of-policy issue. "What does the insurance company think Howdy was buying a policy for? Snowstorms?"<p>"It's really a surreal situation," says Kabrins. "They're offering me $10,000 a month to live for 18 months while my house is being rebuilt. But I'm not getting any money from SafeCo so I can rebuild."<p><p>Three weeks after the quake, Allstate is finally ready to send an adjuster out to the Kissels' home in Hidden Hills. The company has gotten off to a slow start processing earthquake claims; its own San Fernando Valley office suffered structural cracks and had to be abandoned. En route to the meeting, Greenspan pilots his gray Mercedes down Highway 101, a cellular phone glued to his ear. "I'm trying to service more than a hundred clients from the quake already," he tells a caller. "I'm sorry, but I'm not taking any claims under a million dollars anymore." Even a month after the quake, he's turning away at least 50 potential clients a day.<p>Greenspan's car is as well wired as his office. Beeps, rings, squawks. The digital beeper on his belt scrolls news of a fire in Hollywood. He's worked seven days a week, operating on a manic energy since the quake. He doesn't sleep; he barely eats. "I don't even have time to figure out my own earthquake problems," says Greenspan, who owns a three-bedroom home in the San Fernando Valley town of Encino. "The sucker slipped right off its foundation. It's probably not even safe to be living there."<p>The Kissels have similar problems. Except Jon Kissel is already out a total of $26,000. A day after the quake, the family fled to a $275-a-day condo unit in Palm Springs. While they were gone, Kissel paid a local contractor $5,000 to shore up the house. He paid out another $3,700 for security and help moving to Palm Springs, and he hired a structural engineer for $400 to do a preliminary examination of the house.<p>Greenspan encouraged Kissel to spend freely because he was certain the Kissels had a great case. For starters, Allstate, the second-largest property insurer in California, is going to bend over backward to accommodate them. In 1991, the company, a division of Sears, Roebuck, got slammed with a wave of bad publicity when it agreed to pay an unprecedented $1 million to settle charges brought against it by the State Department of Insurance that it had mishandled some of its 600 claims from the Oakland fires. "It was a real David and Goliath thing," says Greenspan, whose says his office handled 150 of the homes up in Oakland. "The big impersonal company beating up on the little guy. They don't want to get that image down here."<p>But Greenspan's real trump card is that he's going up against an Allstate adjuster who's never handled an earthquake before. In order to promptly process the thousands of claims that have poured in (claims would total 36,000 by mid-March), Allstate was forced to recruit a small army of freelance catastrophe adjusters from out of state. In all, 15,000 of these "disaster cowboys," as Greenspan refers to them, have come to California to work for several dozen insurance companies.<p>"Cowboys are totally unfamiliar with Southern California," says Greenspan. "They want to close their cases and go home. Dealing with them is a headache for me, but the final settlement is usually much larger. Some of these cowboys work in auto claims. They don't know a fender from a ridge beam. I capitalize on that ignorance."<p>Disaster coverage is a no-win situation for insurers--an actuarial nightmare. "You have a period of 15 years when you have a zero percent loss ratio, and then in one year you have a 1,000 percent loss ratio," says Richard Rupp, vice president of risk management at Calco Insurance in San Mateo. Because the IRS taxes all unused premiums as profits each year, insurers can only accumulate reserves for a catastrophic event with after-tax profits. They claim that's the reason premiums and deductibles are so high. So insurers don't put much energy or time into quake insurance. Until after the Northridge quake, many California insurers didn't even bother to vary the cost of quake coverage according to where a homeowner lived.<p>The state tried to address the problem of disaster coverage after a 6.2 quake in Lomo Prieta, outside of San Francisco, in 1989. State legislators rushed to establish a mandatory earthquake recovery fund. Homeowners in California contributed $12 a year to the fund if they lived in low-risk areas, $66 a year if they lived in high-risk areas. In exchange, the state would pay as much as $15,000 to owners of a single-family home for quake damage, with a $1,000 deductible. The fund was established in 1992, then quickly killed after legislators realized even a minor earthquake would bankrupt it.<p><p>"What are the four seasons in California?" Greenspan asks, sticking his nose near a large crack under the roof of the Kissel home. "Fire, flood, riot, and earthquake!"<p>Greenspan cackles. William "Buddy" Maynard, the Allstate insurance adjuster assigned to the Kissels, scratches his head. This is the second time he's heard the joke this morning.<p>Maynard is exactly the kind of adjuster Robb Greenspan was hoping for--a semiretired Texan who's never worked an earthquake. He's 54 with a string tie, stained teeth, a leathery face, and a habit of tucking his thumbs behind a big silver belt buckle that reads bm. Maynard lives in Tomball, Texas, a small town near Houston. For the last decade, Maynard has spent a third of each year away from home handling disasters. During the rest of the year, he fishes, hunts, and works local catastrophes, mostly fires and tornadoes.<p>In late January, Allstate gave Maynard a choice between assessing snow-related damage in the Northeast or working the California earthquake. The choice was easy: He arrived in California ten days after the quake. He and other freelance adjusters were given a day-and-a-half crash course in earthquakes and California insurance laws and codes. <p>Like Greenspan, Maynard is working around the clock. He's been up since 3 a.m. doing paperwork. As soon as it was light this morning, Maynard started inspecting the 43 properties assigned to him (of those, 22 are seriously damaged like the Kissel home). <p>Originally, Jon Kissel figured he had total damage in the $100,000 range. But now Greenspan is finding that every door frame is no longer level. The flagstone decking around the pool has popped up. The garage was yellow-tagged by the city. It may have to be torn down. The breezeway has been flattened. The north wall of the house--which looks fine--interests Greenspan the most. It's mostly glass, and if he can prove it's unstable, the whole house may have to be written off. Pam Kissel sets Maynard up with a tall glass of Gatorade as they all inspect the wall in question. He sips as he inspects the property. He keeps murmuring politely, "A crying shame." <p>Greenspan's on his best behavior today. He and Maynard are trying to outcharm each other. Each adjuster is trying to prove to the clients that he truly represents their interests. "Did you know I'm a professional magician?" Greenspan asks. "Performed at Magic Castle. In Los Angeles." Greenspan produces a deck of playing cards and starts making the jack of spades disappear. In the background, Jon Kissel is jumping around excitedly. "Robb's the best," he whispers. "Listen to the Equalizer work." Kissel seems as interested in the game--getting his due from the insurer--as he is in repairing his house. <p>"I think the Kissels should be reimbursed for their car," suggests Greenspan, referring to Kissel's '66 Thunderbird.<p>"Isn't that auto insurance?" asks Maynard.<p>"No, no. A large can of paint vibrated off a garage shelf and coated the car. Pink paint."<p>"Crying shame about that car," drawls Maynard.<p>When a house is destroyed by fire or hurricane, the extent of damage is easy to figure out. But the severity of quake damage is often a judgment call. Whether a roof overhang needs to be torn down or just shored up is a matter of opinion. Some adjusters judge damage to a home by the number of vertical cracks in the wall; others swear by diagonal cracks. "It gets to be like a temporary-insanity trial," says Ina De Long. "Each side puts up its own experts, who tend to conclude what the people paying them want to hear."<p>Greenspan has already persuaded Buddy Maynard to use the recommendations of the Kissels' engineer. Now the two adjusters delve into the arcane issue of aftershocks. It's a loaded issue: Damage caused by an aftershock is considered part of the quake that preceded it. If, however, the temblor is considered a separate quake, a new 10 percent deductible applies. Even though Allstate says it has no official definition of an aftershock--the company says it treats each tremor on a case-by-case basis--Maynard seems to believe that in California any seismic activity occurring more than 72 hours apart may constitute separate quakes. Considering that at least a thousand minor temblors were recorded since January 17, it's not in the insured's best interest to speculate too deeply about which of them contributed to the damages.<p>Maynard takes some pictures of the cracks in the wall of the swimming pool with a pocket camera. "Those cracks happen during the 6.6 or are they more recent?" he asks the Kissels.<p>Robb Greenspan smiles. "Buddy, did I tell you what the four seasons in California are?" he asks.<p><p>Howdy Kabrins's ranch house sat on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Hemmed in by mountains on three sides, with actor Sean Penn's mansion down the block, it was a remarkably beautiful place. Now the guest house and the rosebushes surrounding it are blackened stumps. A crumbling chimney and cracked tennis court reek of smoke.<p>Even if Kabrins does get the money to rebuild, he can never re-create his old house. Since it was built, Malibu has passed strict zoning laws to limit rampant growth in the upscale enclave. The Kabrins's old house was grandfathered in under the statutes. A rebuilt one won't be.<p>"SafeCo still won't pay to rebuild and refurnish Howdy's home," says Greenspan, inspecting the diving board and the Jacuzzi, which melted into plastic lumps. "But we're trying to itemize the contents of the house, just in case."<p>If Greenspan can convince SafeCo to pay for the contents of the house, that could add another $100,000 or more to Kabrins's settlement. But it will also mean months of bickering with the insurance company over the value of contents.<p>Kabrins didn't make videotapes or lists of his possessions. He doesn't have receipts for most items, and they were all burned, so he can't have them appraised. He has to get appraisals from descriptions. Then he has to apply some kind of fair depreciation to the declared value of the object to find the actual loss of value. Numbers chasing numbers.<p>Greenspan takes notes. He'll return to his office and over the next several weeks compile a loss inventory by what public adjusters call "embellishing it out." This simply means describing the item in enough detail to convince the insurance company of its maximum value.<p>With Greenspan's help, Kabrins is moving mentally from room to room trying to recall the entire home, item by item. "It's brutal," he says, resting for a moment on the chimney. "You feel like an idiot trying to remember how many shoes you had and what was in the bottom drawer of your linen closet. You finish a room and you know you've forgotten a hundred things."<p><p>Forty-three days after the earthquake, the Equalizer has finally taken an afternoon off to inspect his own home. Greenspan pokes at the side of the house, which has rotated slightly on the foundation like a lazy Susan. A large crack runs up one wall. "Oh, this is $15,000 worth of repair, easy," says Greenspan. <p>Greenspan should be able to get a better deal for the Kissels. He's recommending that the house be declared a total loss. The north wall, he says, is too unstable for repair. If Allstate agrees, the company will pay out the original value of the house--$455,000. Take away the deductible and Greenspan's fee ($40,950), and the Kissels walk away with $368,550 Not bad considering that falling real estate values make the house worth a lot less than that. <p>As for Howdy Kabrins and his fire-ravaged Malibu house, SafeCo sent him living-expenses checks for $180,000 to cover the next 18 months. That's $63,000 more than SafeCo had originally offered. While SafeCo still wouldn't pay for Kabrins's house, Greenspan says he recently got the company to extend full guaranteed coverage to two of his other clients, even though their policies didn't exactly promise that. He's certain he can cut the same deal for Kabrins. If he does, Greenspan will have made an extra $350,000 for Kabrins.<p>"You know," says Greenspan, looking discontentedly at his house. "I think I'm just going to tear this whole thing down to the foundation and rebuild." The three-bedroom house was worth about $800,000 several years ago. But so many foreclosed homes are now selling in the Valley at fire-sale prices, it's not worth half that. Plus, he says, he never really liked it in the first place.<p>Does he figure he'll just get his insurance company to reimburse him? Well, not exactly. Greenspan never carried any earthquake insurance, even though his girlfriend is an insurance expert. "Too expensive, too complicated," he admits, "and frankly, who needs the grief?"

						<p>Fat fees in life policies are well hidden.  Problem assets can be, too.  It's up to you to protect yourself against getting a bad apple.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>For an industry that's supposed to be selling financial reliability and solidity, the life insurance business has had its share of failures and turmoil lately. The twin 1991 collapses of the $13 billion (assets) Executive Life Insurance Co. and $13.8 billion (assets) Mutual Benefit Life Insurance were followed by a flap at Metropolitan Life that broke last year. Florida regulators uncovered questionable sales practices among some Met Life agents; the company agreed to pay over $11 million in refunds to customers there and plans to offer as much as $30 million to another 45,000 life insurance buyers. Met Life is under investigation in 18 states. <p>In spite of these incidents, insurance remains key to most people's financial plans. Over 154 million Americans own life insurance today. <p>But life insurance buyers are all too often in the dark when evaluating policies. The two main reasons for this: First, there are woefully few independent and trustworthy sources of information out there on policies and companies. Second, disclosure on insurance-policy fees and commissions is practically nonexistent.<p>It's a given that consumers can't count on getting the unvarnished truth from the roughly 250,000 insurance salesmen who make their livings on commission. Sure, some of these folks may be well intentioned, but who knows which ones they are? Neither can shoppers rely completely on the different rating agencies--like A.M. Best--that assess insurers' financial soundness. After all, Executive Life had two top ratings, A+ from Best and AAA by Standard & Poor's, weeks before it announced a charge of $515 million against earnings because of the declining value of its junk bond portfolio. One week after the announcement, Best and S&P both downgraded Executive to an A.<p>Aren't state insurance regulators out front on insolvency issues among life underwriters? Not necessarily. The door between the state insurance commissioners' offices and those of the industry's giants is all too often a revolving one. According to a study on commissioners conducted in 1990 by the Consumer Insurance Interest Group and the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents, roughly half of the commissioners who left their state office went directly to work for the industry. The study also found that almost 40 percent of commissioners worked for the industry prior to taking regulatory office. Close ties don't normally make for tough regulators.<p>Then there's the disclosure problem. Most consumers don't know, for instance, that a traditional life policy carries commissions of 55 percent to 110 percent of the first year's premiums. And because these commissions decline after the policy has been in force for several years, salesmen eager for repeat commissions are tempted to sell their customers replacement policies. Also hidden are details of sales incentives and trips won by high-performing salesmen. Even though these are ultimately paid for by consumers, they rarely find out about them.<p>The hyperbole that salespeople employ in the so-called illustrations used to sell a policy can be another problem. Illustrations show the projected interest rates your money is supposed to earn over the life of the policy. But because these policies can be in effect for decades, rates of return vary wildly. This is why they are not guaranteed. Policyholders often have to cough up more dough to cover additional premiums required by the shortfall in policy performance.<p>Life insurance buyers must take matters into their own hands. They must be able to recognize tricks that insurers use to make their policies more attractive upfront, but that can later cost the unaware policyholder more in premiums. They must know which questions to ask to understand often incomprehensible policies.<p>To help in this effort, James Schwartz, founder of Fee-Only Insurance Specialists in Englewood, Colorado, has designed a questionnaire you can ask an insurance salesman to fill out before you buy. It will reveal an insurance company's financial strength and a policy's fee structure. <p>Schwartz is worth listening to. Back in the 1970s, he was a pioneer in the development of no-load life insurance, a growing part of the industry today. Schwartz is also the author of Enough: A Guide to Reclaiming Your American Dream, a financial planning book.<p>Many insurance buyers believe they've done all their homework if they've gotten three different policy quotes from as many insurers. Schwartz says that's nonsense. "All the bids could come from companies of questionable financial strength," he says Don't assume that buying a policy from a well-known company is the answer. Says Schwartz: "Household names don't pay claims. The quality of assets does."<p>Insurers who get into trouble usually do so as a result of too many risky assets held in their portfolios, a symptom of the high front-end commission structure. Executive Life's missteps were in low-grade bonds; Mutual Benefit's in real estate. In any case, consumers must assess an insurer's asset quality before signing on.<p>If you're shopping for a life policy or adding to existing coverage, give Schwartz's checklist, reprinted below, to prospective insurers' representatives to complete and sign. If you don't understand something, ask for an explanation.<p>It would be great if life insurance shoppers could rely on someone else to do their policy analysis for them. But until the disclosure of fees, commissions, and asset quality among insurers is made clearer, you're on your own.<p>Gretchen Morgenson is the executive editor of Worth. <p><p>

Now that advisors have to disclose their insurance commissions, negotiating can save more than ever<p>By Robert N. Veres<p>This summer, congress quietly debated a consumer-protection bill that could revolutionize the way people shop for insurance. Buried within its 30 pages of legalese, the Investment Advisor Regulatory Enhancement and Disclosure Act of 1993 requires all registered investment advisors (RIAs) to tell their clients how much they're making in commissions and fees on the sale of every financial product. Sound pretty basic? Consider that the bill has stirred up a storm of controversy among financial planners, with some longtime practitioners talking openly about leaving the profession.<p>The real issue isn't mutual fund commissions; they're already disclosed in every prospectus. Nor are stock and bond commissions a problem. They've become so negotiable that wire houses go out of business about as often as airlines and discount companies like <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a> and Waterhouse Securities gleefully publish their rates for all to compare.<p>The real sticking point is insurance commissions. Few consumers realize that on a standard life policy, between 50 percent and 125 percent of the first-year premium goes to the agent who sold the policy. That's right: When a buyer writes that first check, some insurance companies turn around and give the full amount, and often more, to the agent. And until the new act takes effect, there is no mechanism for making consumers aware of that.<p>Unfortunately, the new bill doesn't require everybody who sells financial products to reveal the commissions they earn. Perhaps the most prominent exemption goes to insurance agents themselves (who number about 500,000). The National Association of Life Underwriters, in its 1992 annual report, reported that its lobbyists had "vigorously opposed" an effort to make insurance agents conform to the Investment Advisors Act. Accountants and stockbrokers are exempt, too, as is virtually everybody but financial planners who offer some investment advice for a fee.<p>This means that all of the roughly 18,000 RIAs will be required to tell their clients how much insurance products cost. This is certain to create at least a small hue and cry among consumers, who presumably would prefer to pay less than a full year's premium for the privilege of being sold. Surprisingly, many in the financial-planning profession are sympathetic. Some senior members of the planning community are even calling on insurance carriers to reprice their policies. "The product that I'd like to see would have a [smaller] commission out of each premium payment--the way mutual funds are sold," says Roy Diliberto, a Philadelphia-based financial planner.<p>Still others would like to see negotiated commissions on insurance products. This would require changing state laws that make it a crime to rebate any portion of insurance commissions to the consumer. At present, only California allows rebating. Florida's anti-rebating statute was declared unconstitutional a couple of years ago, but the insurance industry--with the help of the state's insurance commissioner--has managed to stretch a state antidiscrimination statute to cover the hole. If a Florida agent sells a policy to one person for less than the same policy is sold to another, then that's discrimination and therefore illegal. So much for negotiating in that state.<p>Still, negotiations are taking place in some corners of the insurance marketplace, anti-rebate laws notwithstanding. Some of the smaller and more aggressive insurance companies have begun creating different commission structures on what are basically the same policies, as they have for similar products such as annuities. They get around the anti-rebating statutes by registering each policy individually with the state insurance commissioner as separate products. "Let's say you will have an annuity that pays a 5 percent commission to the agent," explains Walter Lineberger, CEO of Personalized Brokerage Services in Topeka, Kansas, perhaps the largest annuity clearinghouse in the country. "The same company may offer another annuity that pays a 1 percent bonus to the policyholder in the first year. And guess what? The agent gets a point less. Some companies have a whole series of policies with different bonuses and commission reductions. Just within a couple of months, it went from being rare to being just as common as flowers in a country field."<p>Specific examples are not hard to find. Agents for Jackson National Life in Lansing, Michigan, most commonly sell the Ultimate-2 policy, which carries a commission equal to 70 percent of the first-year premium. But when they're bidding against other agents for a low-risk client, they may offer Ultimate-1 and settle for 45 percent. When Alexander Hamilton Life agents deal with customers wanting about $100,000 in death benefits, they'll offer the XTR policy; those looking for death benefits in the $350,000 range may be shown the P-250 contract, where the commission, as a percentage of the first-year premium, is lower.<p>The same is true for annuities. Look, for example, at the single-premium annuities offered by American Investors Life, a solid Midwestern carrier. The company's SPDA VII-D and SPDA VII-E contracts are issued on the same policy form; the main difference is that E carries a lower commission than D. "It's just how you decide to take your commissions," explains Stacy Combs, a marketing representative with the company. "If an agent wants, he can give a higher interest rate to the client and not make as much commissions, or he can make a little more commission and not give as much interest to the client."<p>Annuity D currently pays investors 7.9 percent annually, while the E contract pays 9.3 percent. The difference can add up. According to company projections, a $10,000 investment in the lower-commission contract will have $14,000 more value in 20 years than the higher-commission annuity.<p>What may be the state of the art in flexible commissions can be found at Lamar Life Insurance Company in Jackson, Mississippi. Lamar, which carries an A+ rating from the A.M. Best Company and an A from Weiss Research, sends prospective agents a computer disc on its CLASS (Comfortable Living and Solid Security) universal life contract. When running projections for a client, the agent can specify the percentage commission he'll take--ranging from 20 percent to 100 percent. When the 100 percent option is selected on a $5,000 yearly premium at current rates, the surrender value is zero for the first three years of the policy, compared with $14,410 in the third year when the 20 percent option is picked.<p>Where does this leave consumers? Although the new legislation doesn't force most people who sell insurance to disclose the commissions, the fact that some advisors have to should make the information common knowledge. For now, the average consumer can negotiate commissions only with smaller, less-well-known companies that give their agents some flexibility. An astute buyer might pick an A or A+ rated company and get a 20-year illustration with cash-value and death-benefit projections at the guaranteed interest rate--which is usually 4 percent a year. Then he can tell the agent that he has a better illustration from another company and mention that there is a positive surrender value in the second and third years. If the agent runs a new illustration, chances are it will be at a lower commission rate. This new illustration could be then shown to other agents, who would be asked to match it. <p>To compare apples to apples, make sure that all illustrations use the same 20-year period at the guaranteed interest rate. Since some policies focus on building cash value and others on maximizing the death benefit, make sure those amounts are relatively consistent.<p>As negotiating commissions becomes more widespread, the larger insurance companies are beginning to be less rigid about their own commission structures--at least on the high end of the market. At Prudential, for example, large corporate buyers can now sit down with a representative from the corporate-owned life department, which has a number of reduced-commission products available. "The special corporate policies are getting so refined that you can just dial a commission," says a Prudential general agent who requested anonymity. "More often than not, it is based on the size of the premium and what an agent would be willing to give up."<p>Robert N. Veres edits and publishes Inside Information, a monthly newsletter for professional financial advisors.<p>-----<p>A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE...CAN SAVE A BUNDLE:<p>The more consumers know about insurance, the more they can save. An excellent primer is Life Insurance Sense and Nonsense, self-published by Glenn S. Daily (234 E. 84th Street, New York, NY 10028). Here are three basic elements of Daily's approach:
--Don't put much faith in policy illustrations. They're not a reliable tool for comparing products.
--Don't equate premiums with price. It's easy for a company to project low premiums to lure you in. 
-- Focus on the costs. Future performance is unpredictable, but you can increase the odds by reducing commissions.

						 <p>By Peter Lynch<p>You've got your eye on a fine company. All the signs are favorable, but there's this nagging doubt that keeps you away from the stock. So you stand by with cash in your pocket as the company continues to thrive, and you watch the stock price rise accordingly. This leads to Unbuyer's Remorse, which I can't help feeling every time somebody mentions the <a name="NYSE:CML"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10262"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CML Group</b></a>. CML sells NordicTrack, and my nagging doubt about the future of living room skiing caused me to ignore the good news that has led to a tenfold gain in the stock price from late 1990 to 1992. I missed the entire move. But, in fact, there were many points along the way that an investor could have bought the stock and made money.<p>My relationship with CML (the monogram of the founder, Charles M. Leighton) goes back to the early 1980s, before CML had anything to do with NordicTrack. This was the parent company of Britches menswear, Caroll Reed women's wear, and Boston Whaler. The corporate strategy was to reach the 30 to 50 age group at work and at play. CML had figured out that this group was growing four times faster than any other age group in the population, and that it had a lot of money to spend. <p>I didn't own a Boston Whaler at the time (my family has since corrected this error by giving me one), but this was the most frequently sighted boat along the coastline, and I'd ridden in enough Whalers to be fully convinced of the superiority of the product. Meanwhile, on a trip to Baltimore, I was in need of a suit and I bought one at Britches of Georgetowne and wore it on "Wall Street Week" with Louis Rukeyser.<p>Still, wearing a CML suit and having ridden in CML boats did not cause me to recommend CML stock on Rukeyser's program, although CML was among the hundreds of holdings I'd acquired for the <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Magellan Fund</b></a>, so I liked it well enough to have bought a sizeable chunk.<p>DML was one of those scattershot enterprises in which success in one division was counteracted by failure in another, so on the whole it didn't get very far. There was a stretch when Britches and Boston Whaler both did well, and CML made a big profit from Sybervision which produced videotapes of athletes so that weekend hackers like me could improve our games by osmosis. Meanwhile, Caroll Reed was a drag on earnings, and Britches was expanding in too many directions at once. CML also had a lot debt.<p>My favorite CML subsidiary was The Nature Company - where else can you buy your children a tyrannosaurus tooth? These award-winning stores reported a remarkable $600 per square foot in annual sales, a record that no other retail operation bigger than a hot dog stand could hope to match. Alas, there weren't enough Nature Company outlets to bail out the other CML businesses, especially during 1988-'89, when boat sales began to slump and Britches began to slip and Sybervision was no longer the rage. By the end of the decade, CML's financial condition had not improved. For several years, the stock had sold in a narrow range: $3 to $8. (I say narrow only because of the spurt that was about to occur, which carried the stock price to $33.50 as of this writing.)<p>This is where it pays to keep in touch. CML sold Boston Whaler and unloaded Sybervision and Caroll Reed in order to reduce debt and devote itself more fully to NordicTrack. The NordicTrack division had been rapidly gathering momentum since CML acquired it in 1986. In the first year, NordicTrack sold 30,000 exercise machines; in the third, another 30,000; and 140,000 by their fifth year. People who never skied cross country or even across the street were skiing in their living rooms.<p>We had a NordicTrack at home, and my wife, Carolyn, continued to use it regularly. I admired it from a distance, as a piece of sculpture, but I could see that it was well-built, and much less bulky than a rowing machine.<p>In late 1990 I was in a perfect position to take advantage of the positive developments. I knew that the company had restructured and that NordicTrack now accounted for over 90% of the earnings. I knew that NordicTrack sales were increasing at a phenomenal clip. I knew that NordicTrack was opening numerous retail outlets and kiosks where people could try out the equipment.<p>Prior to this, the only way you could buy a NordicTrack machine was by mail order or by calling an 800 number shown on the TV ads. Hundreds of thousands of customers had bought this $600 product sight unseen. There had to be millions more who would never purchase an expensive item from a TV offer but who would respond to a personal demonstration.<p>I was also getting positive recommendations from two professionals who had given me good advice in the past: Dick Goldstein, a successful private money manager based in Denver, Colorado; and Harry "Skip" Wells III, an analyst at Adams, Harkness & Hill, a regional brokerage firm in Boston. Goldstein told me CML had become his largest position. Wells has been following CML for almost a decade, even though it was getting little attention from Wall Street. In his CML reports, Wells gets so excited about fitness that he makes you want to stop reading and start doing sit-ups., He also gets very excited about the prospects for CML, since in his view we are at the beginning of a "fitness-wellness megatrend" and the potential market for NordicTrack equipment is huge.<p>So here I had two experts egging me on, NordicTrack sales increasing at 15% to 100% a year, the company reducing its debt, plus the dramatic new development of the kiosks and the retail stores. Yet I avoided even thinking about buying CML stock, or about recommending it to any of the charities on whose investment committees I serve.<p>My Nagging Doubt Lobe was telling me that NordicTrack was a fad and not a mega-trend, that most people attracted to exercise machines already owned one, and that they weren't likely to purchase a spare. Moreover, I imagined that thousands of former floor skiers had gotten tired of sliding their legs back and forth and had returned to the Jane Fonda workout tapes.<p>Many companies give investors a lot to worry about, but there are genuine worries and then there's the "bogeyman in the closet" variety. The bogeyman hasn't come out yet, and you're not sure he's in there, but you aren't about to poke around in the dark to prove that he isn't.<p>I've often alluded to the fact that the collapse of the housing market was the bogeyman in the closet that scared investors away from Fannie Mae, a solid company that on close inspection was a great investment and less risky than most. I'm constantly reminding people that for 15 years, the bogeyman of too many <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> restaurants has been scaring investors away from the wonderful enterprise, even though the stock has gone up tenfold since people began to worry about a fatal glut. Yet here I was, worrying about the glut of NordicTracks and not doing the homework that might have put this fear to rest.<p>In hindsight, I wish I had dragged myself out to the Chestnut Hill Mall to visit the new NordicTrack retail store. I would have seen firsthand the array of new products - the NordicFitness chair, the NordicFlexGold body building machine, NordicRow TBX, the recumbent bike exerciser, and the various advancements in stationary skiing.<p>If I had watched the customers try out this equipment, perhaps I would have understood the importance of these retail outlets, which by 1992 accounted for about 25% of NordicTrack sales. Perhaps I would have taken Skip Wells's megatrend projections more seriously. Of the 10 million "fitness enthusiast households" in the United States, fewer than 4% currently own a NordicTrack, and on top of that, there are 45 million "fitness aware households" that might finally decide to start exercising.<p>One of the benefits of visiting a retail outlet is that it brings the numbers alive. You can study a company's earnings potential all day long, but bullish forecasts always seem more believable after you've seen the evidence in person at the mall. But I never gave myself a chance to view the evidence. I stayed home and ignored all the positive signs, as CML's stock price rose from a low of $3.50 in late 1990 to $33 by the end of 1992.<p>Whenever you have a nagging doubt about a company that's doing well, it's human nature to think you're the only person who feels that way, but the truth is that every other would-be investor is as worried as you are. The bogeyman that causes you to ignore the good news is having the same effect on everybody else. The very existence of doubt creates the conditions for a big gain in the stock once the fears are put to rest. The trick is to put your fears to rest by doing the research and checking the facts - before the competition does.

By Peter Lynch<p>
For centuries, prospectors have been obsessed with finding valuable substances under the surface of what appears to be dull land. One is reminded of John Paul Getty's advice to youngsters on how to get ahead: "Rise early, work hard, strike oil." Maybe the West was won with the six-gun, but the divining rod had a lot to do with who made money on the deal.<p>
Most mineral rights have long since been captured by the rich friends of the geologists, but the prospector's spirit is alive and well on Wall Street. Here, it's still possible to find treasures buried in the balance sheets. This is a lot less work than mining in the Sierra Madre.<p>
Take <a name="NYSE:WH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Whitman</b></a>, which these days has nothing to do with the Whitman's Sampler. This is the nation's largest independent bottler of <a name="NYSE:PEP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11166"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pepsi-Cola</b></a>, but that's not the half of it. Whitman also owns Midas Muffler. Midas Muffler is to Whitman what oil is to a Texas cattle ranch. It's a subterranean value that someday may be extracted.<p>
Shareholders in Whitman were rewarded last year when the company decided to extract Pet. Pet, like Midas Muffler, was a Whitman division. It makes Pet condensed milk, the Old El Paso line of Mexican foods, Progresso soups, and Van de Kamp's frozen seafood. "We believed...that if Pet were a stand-alone company, its value in the market, in combination with Whitman's remaining value, would be increased," says the Whitman annual report. That's exactly what happened. Pet shares were parceled out to Whitman shareholders, and now trade on their own. People who held onto them now have Pet stock, in addition to their Whitman stock.<p>
Subterranean treasures are hidden in many balance sheets. They fall into three general categories: (1) divisions worth more than Wall Street gives them credit for (such as Midas Muffler); (2) cash in the bank; and (3) stock in other companies.<p>
My favorite cash-in-the-bank story is <a name="NASD:VOLVY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41854"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Volvo</b></a>. Some years ago, that company had $34 in cash and liquid assets for every outstanding share, and the stock was selling for $34. Buyers got Volvo for free. This strong cash position made me comfortable enough to make Volvo the largest holding in the <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Magellan Fund</b></a>, where it was a big winner.<p>
It's rare to get something for nothing, like Volvo, but it's quite common to get something for very little. A case in point is <a name="AMEX:SBN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15378"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sunbelt Nursery Group</b></a>, a company with no debt and lots of trees and shrubs, which has a major store renovation program underway. Heavy rains in the Southwest this year have scuttled the nursery business, and Sunbelt stock has been scuttled as a result. Sunbelt has over $2 per share in cash and the stock sells for $4 1/2. Buyers get all the nurseries for less than $2 1/2, in effect a 50% discount.<p>
An example of the third type of hidden treasure, stock in other companies, is <a name="NYSE:DYA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10485"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dynamics Corporation</b></a>. Dynamic's numerous businesses range from the simple (Waring blenders, Acme Juicerators, can openers, ice cream makers) to the incomprehensible (zero-insertion force printed circuit board retainers). The company is doing a great job with the simple-minded divisions and breaking even on the incomprehensible ones.<p>
When the price of Dynamics stock fell in half in 1990, prospectors began to take an interest in the fact that Dynamics owns 37.4 percent of the shares of another publicly traded enterprise called CTS. CTS once stood for Chicago Telephone Supply, but the company no longer has any connection to telephones. Like Dynamics, it makes its own line of incomprehensible products, similar to the zero-insertion for whatevers.<p>
The point is that the market value of the CTS shares owned by Dynamics is $45 million and the market value of Dynamics in toto is $55 million. A buyer of Dynamics gets both companies for the price of one. This math works only when the parent company has no debt. If Dynamics had borrowed $45 million to buy its CTS shares, the value of those shares would not be an extra asset. As it turns out, Dynamics has a cash surplus of $5 million in excess of debt or over $1 per share. Of course if CTS is unattractive, so is Dynamics. But it was reassuring to learn that Mario Gaelli, one of the world's best investors, has owned the stock for years and recently has been buying heavily, increasing his stake to over 27%.<p>
The best prospecting opportunities are often found in stodgy old banks. Banks have been going around the world picking up assets here and there for decades. Their balance sheets are like old attics, filled with mementos that nobody knows they have. <p>
I found this out in the 1980s, when I got interested in <a name="NYSE:DAI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41231"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Daimler-Benz</b></a>, the maker of Mercedes cars and trucks. I was planning to buy Daimler-Band shares directly, until I discovered that Deutsche Bank, which is attractive in its own right, being a peculiarly German combination of J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, owned a third of all Daimler shares, yet the bank was selling for a price that ignored this remarkable asset. Buying Deutsche Bank was a way to get Daimler-Benz for free.<p>
In the late 1980s, when big U.S. banks were suffering the consequences of their widespread generosity toward Latin America, the price of BankAmerica shares dropped from $35 to $5. That got my attention. There was no way to tell how many more of BankAmerica's borrowers would default, but I was impressed that the bank's deposits came almost entirely from retail customers whose money was protected by the FDIC and therefore were unlikely to bolt, and that it had pawnable assets in all corners of the globe. Among other things, it owned a major bank in Italy, a major bank in Seattle (Seafirst), and as many branches in California as <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> had hamburger stands. BankAmerica's secondary resources helped convince me the institution would survive, and the stock was a big winner.<p>
Over the last decade, I've been following a regional bank called SunTrust, a strong lender with good reserves that has the largest trust operation in Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee, three growing states. In the commercial real estate hysteria, its stock price fell in half. The subterranean asset in this case was the 12 million shares of <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> that SunTrust keeps in its vault. Being an Atlanta bank, and with Coca-Cola headquartered in Atlanta, it naturally bought a few shares of Coke from time to time, and at present, these are worth more than $1 billion. In early 1991, when you bought a share of the bank for $18, you got $4 worth of Coke as part of the bargain - even banks go better with Coke. Today, SunTrust sells for $40 share.<p>
So, in analyzing a stock, it's always a good idea to learn what's hidden under the surface of the company you've invested in. If you have an idea of the value of the parts, you may not be as quick to panic and sell the stock prematurely, before the value has been extracted.<p>
When you're doing this sort of prospecting, you have to assure yourself of three things: (1) the company at large is worth owning; (2) the subterranean assets are worth owning; (3) the company has little or no debt. In all the above cases, Sunbelt, Dynamics, Whitman, and the banks, the principal businesses were well managed, and the stocks were attractive even without the added attractions.<p>
You can do a thumbnail analysis of a company's hidden values with nothing more than an S&P report and a copy of the company's annual report, plus a pocket calculator. First you need to determine the market value of the company as a whole. That's easy: Multiply the number of shares outstanding by the stock price.<p>
Flip through the annual report to the balance sheet and look for the category marked "cash." Divide this number by the number of outstanding shares, and you can determine whether there's a significant amount of cash per share. This is only meaningful if the company has little net debt, which is shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet.<p>
When the company owns a large quantity of stock in another company, as Dynamics owns CTS, this fact will be reported on the literature. To find the value of this holding - for instance, the CTS stock - you multiply the current stock price of CTS by the number of CTS shares owned by Dynamics. Dividing the result by the number of Dynamic shares outstanding, we conclude that CTS is worth $11 a share to the shareholders of Dynamics.<p>
It's harder to put a price tag on a division of a company, such as Whitman's Midas Muffler. Even thought the soft-drink bottling business has been very competitive lately, it's been a lucrative cash-flow business for decades. With a fair valuation for Hussman and the other divisions of Whitman, investors are getting Midas for almost nothing.<p>
Of course, to get the benefit of a subterranean asset, somebody has to extract it. This is exactly what happened in 1989, when Affiliated Publications unleashed the enormous value of McCaw Cellular in a $2.6 billion dollar spinoff to its shareholders - without triggering the huge capital gain tax that would have resulted had Affiliated sold off McCaw.<p>
But if a company isn't interested in exploiting its underlying assets, and Wall Street doesn't recognized them, they can remain for decades and the shareholders won't benefit. In fact, value investing, as this sort of prospecting is sometimes called, has been out of favor for several years, causing great frustration among proponents like Gabelli. But this is an argument for patience. Sooner or later, value will out.<p>
I'll leave you with another stock that has all the elements: <a name="NYSE:OC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11126"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Orion Capital</b></a>. This is a profitable insurance company that has no commercial real estate mortgages to worry about. Its ratings were just raised by A.M. Best and Standard & Poor's, a rare event these days for an insurer.<p>
In 1991 Orion extracted the value of one of its subsidiaries, <a name="NYSE:GNC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12377"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Guaranty National</b></a> which specializes in auto insurance for bad drivers, a lucrative part of the business. Orion Capital put Guaranty National on the market, selling 51 percent of the share and keeping the other 49 percent for itself. The proceeds and a dividend from Guaranty yielded $105 million to Orion Capital. The two companies are run by the same CEO, so they are closely linked. Orion is a $38 stock but if you subtract its $10 share worth of GNC, it is really a $28 stock earning $4 a share in a lousy period for property and casualty insurers. This is quite a coup, and if business improves earnings could rise sharply. <p>

By Peter Lynch<p>
Savings and Loans are the latest untouchables of the stock market. Mention the term, and people grab for their wallets. They think about a $500 billion S&L bailout bill we'll probably have to pay, the 651 bankrupt institutions closed since 1989, the lavish spending by their officers and directors, the 1,361 fraud cases under investigation by the FBI. The word "thrift" once reminded us of Jimmy Stewart in "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE." Now it's Charles Keating in handcuffs.<p>
Since 1988, it's been impossible to pick up a newspaper and not read some story about an S&L bankruptcy or a civil lawsuit or a prosecution of Congress's struggle with the bailout bill. At least five books have been published on this sorry subject, not one of which is entitled "HOW TO MAKE A FORTUNE BUYING S&L STOCKS."<p>
For years, I've been searching the disaster areas of the market for signs of life. This has been a very successful strategy. Again and again, I've found strong companies with bright futures selling at bargain prices beneath the gloom and doom. Today many of these happen to be S&Ls.<p>
In fact judged on the most basic measure of financial strength - equity to assets - well over 100 of today's S&Ls turn out to be stronger than the nation's preeminent bank, J.P. Morgan. People's Savings Financial of New Britain, Connecticut, to name just one, has an equity-to-asset ratio of 12.5, while J.P. Morgan's is less than six.<p>
Other factors combine to make J.P. Morgan the great bank that it is, so the comparison with People's Savings Financial is fanciful. That said, there are plenty of S&Ls in terrific financial shape, which is precisely the opposite of what we've always been led to believe. <p>
Of course, there are plenty of S&Ls in lousy shape, which is why it's important to make distinctions. I've identified three basic type: (1) the bad guys that perpetrated the frauds (the fraudulent S&Ls, with notable exceptions such as Keating's, tended not to be publicly traded), (2) the greedy guys that ruined a good thing by making risky commercial loans (something they knew nothing about), and (3) the Jimmy Stewarts.<p>
The Jimmy Stewart S&Ls are my favorites. They've quietly been making a profit all along. These are the no-frills, low-cost operators that take in deposits from their neighborhoods and then make residential mortgage loans. They can be found in small cities and towns across American and in certain urban areas that the big banks have overlooked.<p>
By sticking to its basic function, a Jimmy Stewart S&L can avoid hiring high-priced load analysts and other expensive muckamucks employed by the big banks. Likewise, it can avoid buying a Greek temple for the main office, Queen Anne furniture for the lobby, blimps, billboards, celebrity sponsors, and original artwork. Travel posters will suffice.A lending institution in a large, competitive market cannot afford to be so thrifty. Major commercial banks routinely spend the equivalent of 2 1/2 to 3 percent of their entire loan portfolio just to cover overhead and related expenses. Therefore, to break even it must make a "spread" of at least 2 1/2% between what it pays for deposits and receives from its loans.<p>
A Jimmy Stewart S&L can survive on a much narrower spread. Its break-even point is 1 1/2%. Theoretically, it could make a profit without making any mortgage loans at all. If it pays 4% in interest to passbook savers, it could invest the proceeds in 6% Treasury bonds and still earn money. When it writes 8% or 9% mortgages, it becomes highly profitable for the shareholders.<p>
For years, the inspiration for all the Jimmy Stewart S&Ls has been Golden West Financial Corp., based in Oakland, California. Golden West owns and operates three S&L subsidiaries, all of them run by a delightful couple, Herb and Marion Sandler. The Sandlers have the equanimity of Ozzie and Harriet and the smarts of Warren Buffett, which is the perfect combination for running a successful business. Like Ozzie and Harriet, they've managed to avoid a lot of unnecessary excitement. They avoided the excitement of investing in junk bonds that defaulted and commercial real estate ventures that defaulted, which in turn enabled them to avoid the excitement of getting taken over by the Resolution Trust Corp.<p>
The Sandlers have always been reluctant to waste money on foolishness. Their distrust of the newfangled caused them to eschew ATMs. They never lured depositors with toaster ovens or ice buckets. They missed the great boom in misguided construction loans. They stuck to residential mortgages, which still make up 96% of Golden West's portfolio.<p>
In a famous incident in the mid 1980s, Marion Sandler addressed her peers at an S&L conference in Virginia on one of her favorite topics, "productivity and expense control." The subject was so captivating to the other S&L directors in the audience that a third of them walked out. They'd packed the house to hear about fancy new computer systems and counting machines, but not to hear Ms. Sandler talk about cutting costs. Perhaps if they'd stayed for her lecture and taken good notes, many of them would still be in business today.<p>
Up until the 1980s, Golden West was one of the few S&Ls that was a public company. Then, in a rash of stack offerings in mid decade, hundreds of the formerly private thrifts, operating as "mutual savings banks," went public more or less simultaneously. I acquired 135 of these for the <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Magellan Fund</b></a>. I was so enamored of the S&Ls that anything that had the word "first" or "federal" in it, I bought.<p>
Almost every S&L that came public, I owned. My attraction for S&Ls might seem indiscriminate, but my fund was so big and they were so small that to get enough nourishment out of them, I had to consume large quantities, like a linebacker offered a plate of petit fours. <p>
Of the 450-plus thrifts that sold stock through public offerings throughout the decade, over 100 were acquired by bigger banks or S&Ls, usually at a large profit to the shareholders (the watershed example is Morris County Savings Bank [New Jersey], which came public in 1983 at $10.75 a share and was bought out in 1986 at $68 a share), while 65 failed, usually at a total loss to the shareholders (I know this from personal experience because I owned several in this category). That leaves nearly 300 still in business.<p>
In the last three years, the stock prices of strong and weak thrifts alike have suffered through the real and psychological depression about the real estate market, which supposedly is falling in and around us. In fact, the collapse in real estate is generally confined to commercial projects, and the best of the Jimmy Stewart S&Ls have only a limited involvement in those. For the most part, their portfolios are concentrated in mortgages on single-family homes in the $100,000 range. They have plenty of equity, good earnings growth, and a solid base of loyal depositors, and still their stocks have sunk.<p>
One could not have dreamed up a better atmosphere in which to hunt for bargains. Until the beginning of 1992, investors had been turned off by the entire S&L group. Brokerage houses have reduced or eliminated their coverage of these stocks, and thus far ignored the early signs of revival.<p>
Intrigued by the cheap prices at which many S&L stocks have been selling, several months ago I immersed myself in a copy of the "THE SNL QUARTERLY THRIFT DIGEST" - my idea of the perfect bedside thriller. It's published by SNL securities out of Charlottesville, Virginia, where Reid Nagle and his staff do an outstanding job of keeping tabs on all the S&Ls. I spent so much time with my nose in this huge book that my wife, Carolyn, began referring to it as the Old Testament.<p>
With the book in hand, I devised my own S&L scorecard, listing the strongest institutions by state and jotting down some of the key details. Many of these same numbers can be found in the quarterly and annual reports, S&P reports, and the "VALUE LINE INVESTMENT SURVEY" on the individual companies in the S&L group.<p>
Here I found many exciting prospects: companies with equity-to-asset rations 30% to 100% higher than J.P. Morgan's whose stocks were selling below book value, with p/e ratios that were less than half the p/e ratio for the stock market in general. In analyzing the investment potential of each, I considered the following:<p>
CURRENT PRICE. The importance of a low price is self-evident.<p>
INITIAL OFFERING PRICE. When an S&L is selling below the price at which it came public, it's a sign that the stock may be undervalued. Other factors, of course must be considered.<p>
PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO. As with any stock, the lower the better. Some S&Ls with annual growth rates of 15% a year have p/e ratios of seven or eight, based on the prior 12 months' earnings. This is very promising, especially in light of the fact that the overall p/e of the S&P 500 stocks has been above 25.<p>
HIGH-RISK REAL ESTATE ASSETS. This is the most critical item to consider. With this number, "THE THRIFT DIGEST" keeps track of how many commercial real estate and construction loans the S&L has made. This is a crucial factor because bad commercial real estate loans have been the downfall of most of the thrifts and banks that have failed. What you want to see here is a very low number, preferable under 5%. You're really comfortable when you find an S&L such as Bell Bancorp or Charter FSB Bancorp, which does virtually no lending of this kind.<p>
EQUITY-TO-ASSETS RATIO. This is the second most important statistic. It measures financial strength and also tells a lot about an S&L's capacity for survival. The higher the number, the better. There's an incredible range between e/a's as low as one or two (the candidates for the scrap heap) and e/a's as high as 20. An e/a of 5 1/2 to 6 is average, but when it falls below five, it has reached the danger zone. All else being equal, I'd prefer to invest in S&Ls with equity-to-assets above nine.<p>
DIVIDEND. Many S&Ls pay better-than-average dividends. When one of them meets all the other criteria and also has a high yield, it's a plus.<p>
BOOK VALUE. Most of the assets of a bank or an S&L are in its loans. If you can be confident the loans will be repaid in full, you can be confident that the book value is accurate reflection of the actual worth of the institution. Many promising S&Ls are selling at 60% to 90% of book value, as shown in the chart below.<p>
If you don't have access to a copy of "THE THRIFT DIGEST" (your stockbroker or your library might have it), you can check the annual report of any individual S&L for the dollar value of the construction loans and commercial real estate loans, etc., listed under "assets." By dividing this total into the total dollar value of all outstanding loans, you get a useful approximation of the high-risk percentage. <p>
In the chart below, I've included ten S&Ls that get excellent marks in several categories: book value (they all sell at a discount), equity-to-asset ratio (with three exceptions, nine or better), high-risk loans under 6.5% of total assets, and p/e ratios below 12 on the last 12 months. For the 12 months ending in March 1993, it's likely that these companies will be selling for less than ten times earnings with the general market over 20 times earnings. That several of these companies have been buying back their own shares in recent months is another positive.<p>
This is a research list, not a buy list. Many other S&Ls have numbers that are equal to or better than these. If you have a favorite local thrift, analyze it yourself by filling in the same blanks I've filled in here. Or, if you don't want to do the homework, invest in thrifts through a mutual fund such as Southeastern Thrift & Bank, which trades on NASDAQ.<p>
Ultimately, shareholders in the surviving S&Ls can benefit in two ways. Either the franchises will continue to prosper on their own, or they will be taken over by other banks and S&Ls; this has occurred many times already. From 1987 to 1990, a terrible period for S&Ls, more than 100 were acquired by larger institutions that saw their inherent value.<p>
Currently, the United States still has more than 12,000 banks, thrifts, and credit unions, which is far more than we need. There are seven banks and S&Ls in my little town of less than 20,000 people, as compared with the ten domestic banks in all of Canada. Eventually, consolidation will result in many other S&Ls being bought out at a premium. Finally, there are 1,178 savings and loans that haven't yet come public. These, too, will be worth investigating.<p>
The Virtues of Thrifts:<p>
Here are ten strong S & L candidates to consider, based on the percentage of high-risk real estate assets in the bank's portfolio.<p>

						February 1996   <p>Worth magazine/Experts  <p> SWEET AND SOUR <p>Index funds can be valuable tools--unless they are used as part of a dubious strategy  <p> By Susan Lee  <p> Question: what do 300 episodes of Melrose Place, a ten-pound Toblerone bar, two Andre Agassis, and 75 index funds have in common?  <p> Answer: They could all be too much of a good thing.  <p> This isn't the usual whine against index funds. You know, the one where some stock jockey gripes that just trying to mimic the Standard & Poor's 500 Index is an exercise in mediocrity and that any alert investor can outperform the market. I don't buy that argument.   <p> The idea behind index funds is both sound and alluring. It is based on the theory that no one can reliably beat the market over the long run. But who needs theory? In practice, in any one year, a majority of mutual fund managers fail to beat the market. Actively managed funds are, of course, hampered by higher expenses and fees, as well as the need to set aside cash for rainy days and redemptions. Indexing is a way of investing inthe broad stock market that is, of duplicating the record of those indexes that track the broader market. If you buy an index fund, you are the market sure, you can't outperform yourself, but you won't underperform, either.   <p> Index funds possess other virtues. Buy a share in an index fund and voil you are instantly and almost perfectly diversified. (Diversification allows investors to reduce nonmarket risk without reducing returns.) Although there is no agreement on the number of stocks needed to diversify, 30 is about the fewest it would take. While that doesn't sound too onerous, buying a share of an index fund is surely cheaper and more efficient than buying stocks in 30 companies. A stock market index fund is also no-sweat. It doesn't require knowledge of specific companies such as growth potential or dividend payouts. And there is no need to follow individual stocks no annual reports to flip through, no stock-tracking software to buy, no time spent riffling through newspapers to see whether you've made money. If the market is up, you are up. Simple as that.  <p> Moreover, investing in an index fund is cheap. It doesn't require pricey brokers, personal finance advisers, or subscriptions to investment newsletters. Nor does it demand high payments for commissions or loads and fees. Expenses are low because once the index is in place there is little active trading, except for occasional portfolio rebalancing. (But watch it some funds charge higher fees than others.) And since there is little trading involved in maintaining these portfolios, there are also fewer tax consequences. The buy-and-hold strategy avoids a potentially nasty capital gains tax bill at year's end.   <p> As you can see, index funds are quite attractive. So it's no wonder that lots of companies have started to market them. Offerings have expanded from the primitive (funds that mimic the Standard & Poor's 500) to the more refined (funds that track the Wilshire 5000, the Russell 2000, and mid-cap stocks). Currently, it is possible to buy U.S.-bond index funds, European and Pacific stock market index funds, emerging-markets index funds, and funds that track utility and gold stocks. Some companies have even introduced "enhanced" index funds oxymoronic vehicles that try to beat the market by employing various techniques.  <p> These newer index funds offer some of the same benefits as simple stock funds by giving investors an inexpensive and efficient way to diversify within asset classes. But they also permit inexpensive and efficient diversification across asset classes. For example, sophisticated investors want not only a mix of stocks and bonds but since foreign stocks make up 61 percent of the global market, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International some foreign exposure as well. Foreign-stock index funds serve that purpose.  <p> But what about returns? It makes no sense to plunk something into your portfolio if you don't expect delicious returns. A look at the small- and mid-cap U.S. markets and the foreign stock markets over the past ten years indicates that returns have indeed been higher than the S&P 500's average annual return of 14 percent. Over the last decade, the Russell 2000 Index of small stocks averaged an annual return of more than 15 percent, the Russell Midcap Index averaged 17 percent, and the Morgan Stanley EAFE index of foreign stocks averaged 21 percent. But these were returns achieved by indexes not by funds purporting to mimic those indexes. Unfortunately, it is impossible to judge whether the funds based on those indexes have tracked them in a consistent and detailed way: Not enough have been around for ten years.  <p> Further, these funds tend to have higher fees and expenses. And some have special hazards. Enhanced index funds use strategies of actively buying and selling stocks or a grab bag of options and futures ploys, which can result in larger tax consequences. Foreign funds are open to currency risk, and emerging-markets funds carry political risk.  <p> But perhaps the most troubling aspect of the availability of index funds with multiple-choice asset classes is, as index-fund managers have complained, that some investors treat them as an opportunity to engage in market timing by which I mean any activity that shifts money from one asset class or sector to another in an attempt to shun laggards and exploit leaders.   <p> Here the mere existence of index funds almost constitutes entrapment. Just like families of actively managed mutual funds, index funds provide an easy and efficient way of sending money into one category, such as bonds, and then withdrawing it and sending it into another category, such as stocks; or of plopping money into utilities and then moving it into natural-gas stocks. Investors can shift money without having to liquidate their portfolios which would take time, involve higher transaction costs, and invite complicated tax records. But index funds also give investors idle hands. As Kevin Johnson of Aronson + Partners, a Philadelphia money-managment firm, says, "If you forgo making decisions on individual stocks by buying an index fund, then how do you spend your time? You start making decisions across asset classes."  <p> Essentially, then, index funds allow investors to use a buy-and-hold strategy as the instrument for an active sell-and-buy one. That may sound fabulously clever, but think again. The record on market timing is clear: As survey after survey reveals, nobody has been able to catch both market tops and bottoms in a consistent, return-boosting way. Ditto for rotating money from sector to sector. Although sector funds do provide some diversification the reduction of stock-specific risk they leave investors wide open to industry-specific risk. "Sector rotating is like betting, pure and simple," says Gus Sauter, head of Vanguard Group's index funds. "It's not investing at all."  <p> And that's the bad thing. It's silly to choose a strategy that guarantees market returns and then use it in a way that risks subnormal performance.  <p> The index fund is a truly awesome invention. A cheap S & P 500 or a Wilshire 5000 index fund ought to constitute at least half of your portfolio. But treat the bells-and-whistles funds with caution, and approach any active tactical ploys the way you would the temptation of a ten-pound Toblerone bar. Just say no.  <p> Susan Lee is an economist and the author of the forth coming book Hands Off: Why the Government Is a Menace to Economic Health (Simon & Schuster).   <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Experts<p>DEBTORS' MONEY
Why the U.S. dollar, once literally as good as gold, has become a global economic problem.<p>By Walter Mead<p>"You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns," said presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan to the Democratic convention of 1896. "You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold."<p>Almost nobody today has any idea what Bryan was talking about. And that's too bad, because the monetary battle between tight-money gold bugs and the loose-money proponents of free silver in the presidential election of 1896 has again become one of the central problems of American politics and the international economy. Only this time, the currencies squaring off are the "loose" dollar and the hard-money yen and deutsche mark. <p>The struggle in American politics a hundred years ago--as it is today--was between two different concepts of money. On the one hand, money is supposed to be a reliable store of value. Savers and creditors count on a stable currency; they expect that the dollars they receive tomorrow will be approximately as valuable as the dollars they hold today. Inflation destroys that contract. On the other hand, money is supposed to serve as a convenient medium of exchange. It should not be in such short supply that the normal processes of economic life--investment and trade--are paralyzed by a scarcity of cash.<p>Ideally, of course, money should perform both functions well at the same time. But when a monetary system is in crisis, it can't serve both purposes simultaneously. Instead, people divide according to their interests. Creditors and savers, naturally enough, want to keep the value of money high, even if doing so damages the real economy. Entrepreneurs and debtors would rather see the value of money diminish than have high interest rates choke off economic activity. The U.S. divided along those lines at the end of the 19th century; a similar split is happening today among debtor and creditor nations. <p>In 1896 advocates of the gold standard wanted the United States to remain linked to an international monetary system based on a fixed parity between the American dollar and the British pound--approximately five dollars to the pound, and four pounds to one troy ounce of gold.<p>In the world of 1896 that meant, as it had since the Civil War, that America had what today would be called a tight-money policy. The world economy was undergoing a major expansion. Wheat from the United States, Argentina, and Australia flooded the market. Steel poured from the furnaces of the Ruhr, Pittsburgh, and Birmingham, England. But the world's gold supply--and hence its money supply--was relatively fixed. At a time of rising productivity in agriculture and industry, the prices of things fell and the cost of money rose. The gold standard was in effect a 19th-century version of a zero-inflation or even a negative-inflation policy. <p>Huge silver discoveries at the time, especially in the American West, led to an increase in the world's silver supply. The price of silver was plummeting, yet "free silver" enthusiasts like Bryan wanted to coin unlimited supplies of silver dollar coins and value them at the historic prices that held before the glut. This would have expanded the money supply, cutting the costs of credit for American farmers and small businessmen and inflating the price of the things these parts of the economy produced.<p>Politicians like William McKinley and creditors such as J.P. Morgan argued that free silver would plunge the national economy into crisis. (It would also, of course, have produced inflation, reducing the value of their bond investments.) Foreign investors would sell their dollars and their American stocks, and credit would dry up. Who, after all, would want to lend gold to be repaid in silver valued at an artificially high price?<p>The gold bugs won both the political and the intellectual battle in 1896. McKinley beat Bryan in the presidential election, the U.S. remained on the gold standard, and the dollar maintained its parity with the pound. In subsequent years the currency issue largely disappeared from American politics as a rush of gold discoveries in North America and South Africa greatly increased the world's gold supply. <p>In the longer term, the effects of American economic growth and World War I combined to knock everybody else off the gold standard. As global economic leadership passed from London to New York, the world increasingly ran on a dollar standard. The United States promised to redeem dollars for gold at a fixed price; other countries accepted this promise and held much of their financial reserves in dollars rather than the yellow metal.<p>The postwar monetary system, named for Bretton Woods, the New Hampshire resort where the international accord was hammered out in 1944, synthesized the two sides in the 1896 debate. On one hand, the U.S. kept its domestic currency at a par value against gold and foreign currencies. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve--abetted by the U.S. Treasury--pursued a relatively expansionary monetary policy. The United States had the best of both worlds: money that was both easy and sound. The Bretton Woods years--1946 to 1971--combined faster than average growth with low inflation. The dollar functioned as a stable store of value and as an accommodating circulating medium; it was the best of all possible worlds.<p>Of course, it didn't--couldn't--last. As the Fed increased the dollar supply in line with the needs of the domestic economy and as the U.S. government spent billions of dollars abroad on such dubious ventures as the war in Vietnam, it became all too clear to foreign bankers, governments, and investors that there were more dollars in the world's monetary system than there was gold in Fort Knox. The world gradually lost confidence in the U.S. government's promise to redeem dollars for gold at the price of $35 an ounce, and in the 1970s the system broke down in a wave of inflation and turmoil that shook the world financial system and saw the price of gold skyrocket as high as $800 an ounce.<p>Since then, the world monetary system has alternated between periods of chaos and stability, but precious metals have largely dropped out of the monetary system. This is partly because the price of gold in dollars has been relatively stable and partly because the extraordinary range of securities and currencies available today gives investors many more profitable ways to protect their portfolios than hoarding non-interest-bearing metal bars and coins.<p>But the dollar hasn't been nearly as stable against such currencies as the yen and the deutsche mark. In 1970 a dollar was worth 360 yen and 3.6 DM. In July 1995 a dollar was worth only 88 yen and 1.4 DM--a drop, respectively, of 76 percent and 61 percent against the two new supercurrencies. <p>There is a tendency in the U.S. and abroad to blame all this on the usual suspects--lax management at the Fed and the well-known tendencies of Americans to consume instead of save. While there is some truth in this, it is worth remembering that the greenback, for all its faults, hasn't gone down against gold. By this traditional measure, it is Germany and Japan that are out of line.<p>But assessing blame is far less important than understanding the new monetary world being created by these factors. Once again, as in the 19th century, the two functions of money--circulating medium and store of value--are increasingly diverging. The dollar remains the world's medium of circulation par excellence. When an Iranian sells oil to a Sri Lankan, the transaction takes place in dollars. But increasingly, the mark and the yen are challenging the dollar's role as the world's leading reserve currency. As recently as 1984, 75 percent of the world's currency reserves were in dollars. Today it is down to 65 percent.<p>Economists have tended to focus on the problems caused by the decline of the dollar as an international store of value. If central banks and private holders continue to lose confidence in the dollar as a stable store of value, demand for the dollar will fall, but the supply will be unchanged. The result, of course, would be a continued fall in the dollar's value, which would erode our purchasing power, raise domestic interest rates, and lower our standard of living.<p>But a two-tiered international monetary system poses its own dangers too. For example, the developing tigers in East Asia measure their income stream in dollars--from exports to the United States and other dollar-denominated trade transactions. Their debts, however, are usually denominated in yen, the currency of the region's largest creditor. If the dollar continues to drop against the yen, these countries--however successfully they increase their trade earnings in dollars--will have trouble repaying their current debts and attracting new yen-denominated investments.<p>The problems of a two-tiered money system are also showing up on this side of the Pacific. Take the U.S. stock market. In the 1990s dollar investors have reveled as stocks hit one record high after another. Yen investors haven't had as much fun. For an investor who counts his money in yen, U.S. stocks actually declined 9 percent from mid-1990 to mid-1995.<p>The result, of course, is a diminished Japanese appetite for U.S. securities. To put it in language that would be familiar to William McKinley, a soft-money, debtor country like the U.S. progressively cuts itself off from the access to the capital that it needs. Neither the Japanese, the Taiwanese, nor the citizens of any other country with a savings surplus want to lend to a country whose money keeps declining in value.<p>To the hard-money advocates this is intolerable. The U.S. must make the dollar one of the hardest of the hard currencies--even if it hurts. Raise interest rates; cut government spending; grit your teeth during the ensuing recession.<p>In 1896, Bryan thought we could force bimetallism on the world. The U.S. economy is so important to investors, he said, that they will have to deal with us whether we keep our money hard or soft. In today's world, the soft-money advocates say, both the Germans and the Japanese will have to continue accepting dollars in payment and investing in dollar-based economies because there isn't anything else to do.<p>But today that looks like a global lose-lose proposition. U.S. citizens lose purchasing power and the United States loses clout because a falling dollar undermines our financial strength abroad. Meanwhile, stagnating economies and low returns on investment in the hard-currency countries aren't making people happy there either.<p>The best solution would be for today's hard supercurrencies to soften a bit. Why should the mark and the yen appreciate against gold? I hope Germany and Japan will realize that their present reckless ultratight policies will ruin the world economy if they don't loosen up.<p>But don't count on it, and don't count on America's ability to make them see reason. One of the saddest consequences of being a debtor is that nobody listens to your proposals for credit reform.<p>Walter Mead is the Presidential Fellow at the World Policy Institute at the New School.

Worth magazine/Experts<p>THE FLAT TAXERS
What if everyone paid the same tax rate, no deductions allowed? It could happen--soon.<p>By James K. Glassman<p>Some very influential politicians want to end the tax code as we know it--make it less complicated, possibly more fair, and more beneficial to the economy. <p>Right now, the most popular idea is the flat tax, which after a generous personal exemption, would take the same percentage of income from everyone and eliminate all deductions--whether for charity or mortgages. Only income from interest, dividends, and capital gains would be tax free. That, at any rate, is the "pure" version of the flat tax proposed a year ago and slightly revised in July by the conservative House majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas.<p>Under Armey's proposal, Americans would pay 20 percent of their taxable income (declining to 17 percent after two years). This may be optimistic; the Treasury Department estimates a 22 to 23 percent rate would yield revenue equal to the current system.<p>Armey defines "taxable income" as salary and pension income minus personal exemptions: $21,400 for married couples filing jointly, $14,000 for single heads of household, and $5,000 for each dependent. So a family of four would pay taxes only on income above $31,400. If household income totaled $131,400, the tax bill would be $100,000 times the flat rate. At 20 percent, that comes to $20,000.<p>Is any of this politically feasible? "The flat tax is a home run," says Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, whose firm, The Polling Co., has been conducting focus groups for months on the issue. A 1995 Princeton Survey Research Associates poll found that 59 percent of Americans support a flat tax.<p>There is powerful opposition. The National Association of Realtors worries that ending the deductibility of mortgage interest and real estate taxes would depress the value of existing homes and turn potential buyers into renters. It participated in a study by DRI/McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Massachusettsbased economic consulting firm, which concluded that the net worth of U.S. households would fall by $1.2 trillion in the first year of a flat tax. <p>State and local governments, as well as many investment firms, also worry about the effect of the flat tax on the municipal-bond market. Under the Armey plan, munis would no longer be the sole tax-exempt bonds; corporate and U.S. Treasury bonds would enjoy the same privilege. Should this cause demand for munis to fall, outstanding bonds could drop in value and local agencies would have to pay higher interest to attract buyers of future issues.<p>Many economists, including Alan Reynolds of the Hudson Institute and Dan Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation, dismiss this concern. They say that low tax rates will spur investment and raise this country's savings rate, the lowest among all industrial nations, with the sole exception of the Netherlands. Dale Jorgenson, a Harvard economist who specializes in the economics of taxation, estimates that the flat tax will boost national wealth by $1 trillion, and even the DRI study concluded that, after the first two years, a flat tax would increase the annual gross domestic product by a full percentage point, substantially cut bond interest rates, and hike capital spending by 5 to 10 percent a year.<p>The flat tax isn't the only idea around. A tax on goods and services, such as a national sales tax or a value-added tax, has the support of Representative Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, where all tax legislation must originate. <p>For investors, either proposal would be a boon. If you and your spouse have $38,000 or more in taxable income, the IRS takes at least 28 cents of every dollar of interest you earn on Treasury or corporate bonds, stock or money market dividends, and gains realized in selling an asset. Under a flat tax or national sales tax, this tax bite would vanish.<p>Real estate and municipal-bond investors, however, may find the future less sunny.<p>Some 28 million Americans deduct a home mortgage on their tax returns, shaving an average of $2,100 off their taxes. The deduction, in effect, helps pay the homeowner's mortgage. Without it, says the NAR, summarizing the DRI study, "homes would lose 15% of market value, a loss that would be fully reflected in their market price ... an immediate and massive loss of equity." Hardest hit, says Linda Goold, tax counsel to the NAR, would be the "working rich"--two-earner couples with expensive houses bought with big mortgages.<p>DRI reached its estimate of 15 percent by calculating the value of the lost mortgage deduction, then adding the advantage of the lower mortgage rates that would result if the national savings rate rose. But this estimate is debatable. DRI posits rates falling about 1 percent, but that could be too modest (Armey predicts a decrease of two or more points). Even after tax rates were cut sharply, in the 1980s, housing prices kept rising, reducing the value of the mortgage deduction, notes Bruce Bartlett, a Bush administration Treasury official and now a private consultant.<p>David Wyss, DRI's research director, disputes this optimistic scenario. Without mortgage deductibility, he says, fewer families could afford big-ticket houses. Demand would drop, depressing real estate values. And the rising value of other assets may not help. "Most Americans under 55 have a negative net worth outside the value of their home," Wyss says.<p>A family with a hefty mortgage could find itself with a big tax increase under a flat tax. Consider a husband and wife with one child in which the spouses earn $120,000 a year from their jobs plus another $10,000 in interest and dividend income; they pay $37,500 in mortgage interest, $6,000 in state income taxes, and $4,000 in property taxes, and have $5,000 in other deductions. Under current law, this family would pay about $14,800 in taxes. Under the Armey tax, the family's tax bill would rise: $120,000 in salary (no tax on the investment income) minus $26,400 in personal exemptions equals $93,600 in taxable income. Multiply by 20 percent, and the bill comes to $18,720, or $3,920 greater than the current bill.<p>"People will buy smaller houses," Wyss predicts, "because part of what they buy now is a tax shelter." They'll diversify into stocks and bonds, investments that help businesses grow. This shift "from nonproductive to productive assets" could produce "significant long-term benefits," Wyss says--though it could take ten years.<p>A flat tax would change the bond situation as drastically as the real estate market. Interest on nearly all state and local bonds would remain tax-exempt under a flat tax. However, interest on bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, federal agencies, and corporations would also become tax-exempt, and that could mean trouble for munis.<p>The tax advantage now enjoyed by munis allows them to pay lower interest than taxable bonds. A high-quality muni might yield 5 percent, against 6 percent for a Treasury with similar maturity. But for a taxpayer in a 36 percent bracket, the muni's taxable-equivalent return of 7.8 percent (the rate if munis were taxable) versus 6 percent for Treasury bonds makes munis a better deal.<p>Reynolds and many other economists believe that one effect of a flat tax would be that the rate on Treasurys would fall to that of munis, leaving investor demand unchanged. But Micah Green, executive vice president of the Public Securities Association, says that the enactment of a flat tax might make alternative bonds more attractive, potentially forcing muni yields to rise and hurting both current holders and future issuers. "You're already seeing the effect," he says.<p>In a recent Smith Barney newsletter, George Friedlander, a fixed-income portfolio strategist, reports that "even the very preliminary discussions of Tax Reform that appeared in the financial press in late April caused the price of municipal bonds to decline." However, Stephen Entin, a resident scholar at the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, in Washington, D.C., says the decline could also be due to Republican proposals to shift spending to the states, putting them under more budget pressure. Entin believes that under a flat tax, "the economy would strengthen and state and local government revenues would increase."<p>Munis may in fact hold their own in a flat-tax environment. Entire classes of new buyers will likely enter the market, like pension funds, which currently pay no taxes and thus have no motivation to buy munis that yield even 90 percent of the Treasury-bond rate. Or banks. Or foreign investors.<p>In the end, no one can prophesy the result of a tax-system overhaul. And the possibility remains that more moderate approaches will prevail. Senator Arlen Specter and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt have offered flat-tax plans retaining mortgage deductibility, for example.<p>Still, opinion surveys largely confirm the popularity of the flat tax beyond its potential benefits. The reason, says Fitzpatrick, is that everyone gets treated the same under a flat tax. It's a notion Americans find powerfully appealing, and one that could ultimately sweep aside even the most entrenched opposition. Congress could vote on the issue as early as the end of this year.<p>James K. Glassman writes a column on politics and finance for the Washington Post. He also hosts TechnoPolitics on PBS and Capital Gang Sunday on CNN.<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Experts<p>EXCELLENT ADVENTURE
This economic recovery really is different--and that's good news for stock and bond investors<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>Wall street skeptics are famous for snorting whenever optimists claim "It's different this time" to justify sky-high stock prices. Stock market sophisticates say that by all standard measures--price-to-earnings ratios, the market's dividend yield, price-to-book ratios--we're in perilous territory where equities are concerned. And we have been ever since the Dow Jones Industrials broke through 4000 last spring.<p>So when the bulls argue that past is not prologue--that measures that once worked to value stocks no longer do the job because we've entered a different world--the bears smirk and warn investors to check for their wallets.<p>Normally, in this space we'd agree; Full Disclosure has a habit of siding with the skeptics. But this time, the doubters may be undone. The economic recovery we're in right now looks different from past recoveries. And this bodes very well for bond and stock investors, even at today's lofty levels.<p>That's not to say we think that all stocks will benefit from this happy scenario. After six months in which the Standard & Poor's 500 returned 20 percent, selectivity is crucial for investors looking to buy stocks now. But for three compelling reasons, many stocks still actually look like good buys.<p>What's the case? It has been best articulated by Richard Hokenson, chief economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York City, who says flatly: "The current economic recovery, which began in March 1991, is unique." His reasoning: This rebound, from its earliest stage, has generated substantially more productivity growth than real gross-domestic-product growth, something that has never happened before in postwar U.S. economic cycles. And even late in the recovery, productivity increases have kept pace with gains in GDP, another unheard-of occurrence. Finally, contrary to the Federal Reserve Board's fears last year, the inflation monster has been tamed this time around. Result: A highly unusual scenario--the best news on inflation will occur near the end of this expansion rather than in the beginning.<p>To Hokenson, these are secular, not cyclical changes for investors to ponder. And they are changes that will keep the recovery going much longer than most--well into 1996. That's because productivity gains are here to stay and high inflation, that ravager of stock and bond returns, is securely in the lockup.<p>The two are related. One of the key reasons Hokenson is looking for inflation to dip to an annualized 2.3 percent by the end of this year, down from 2.6 percent this June, is productivity. Much of our nation's growth rate is coming from purchases of productivity-enhancing equipment. Faced with the prospect of lower sales growth, more corporations in all industries are seeking ways to increase efficiency. Technology is often the answer. And when companies spend to buy these goods, they add to their capacity at the same time they add to the nation's overall growth.<p>Capital-spending surveys show that businesses shelled out an estimated 9 percent more on capital goods in 1994 than they did in 1993. And in the 12 months ended March 1995, unfilled orders for nondefense, nonaircraft capital goods surged 21 percent.<p>Another reason inflation is not the threat it once was and won't be for some time: Low and stable labor costs. What employers pay their workers, measured by the employment cost index, fell to 2.6 percent in the first quarter from 3 percent in the same period in 1994. Nonunion employee costs dropped even more dramatically: from 3.5 percent in the first quarter of 1994 to 2.6 percent this year.<p>Hokenson argues that labor costs have become a more important predictor of inflation than commodity prices. Indeed, there is a close correlation between unit labor costs and movements in the consumer price index. Yet the action in commodities indexes seems to be what Wall Street watches and worries about. Odd, since there has been almost no correlation between movements in the CPI and those of the Commodity Research Bureau Index or the Journal of Commerce Index for the past 14 years. "Commodity prices have become much less important over time because they represent a smaller and smaller component of total costs," says Hokenson. "In contrast, total labor costs have become more important over time, particularly in the CPI, which includes many services."<p>Nothing about this scenario will change anytime soon, according to Hokenson. Why? Because sudden, unforeseen run-ups in inflation are almost always accompanied by higher labor costs or skyrocketing oil prices. Since 1957, there have been only five incidents when total CPI inflation grew by more than 2 percent in one year. Of those five occurrences, four were prompted by leaps in oil prices of more than 20 percent in a year. In 1979, the only year that inflation rose without an oil shock, unit labor costs were running above 6 percent a year. Since oil prices are low and unit labor costs are under 1 percent, Hokenson believes a spike in inflation for this year and next is highly unlikely.<p>Even more significant, when inflation finally does blip up again, its moves will be off a very low base. The days of double-digit price increases, which investors remember too well from the 1970s, aren't coming back anytime soon. Low inflation and punched-up productivity gains are a potent combination to investors in both stocks and bonds. A core inflation rate of 2.3 percent makes the real return on a five-year Treasury note--recently yielding 5.75 percent--very attractive. And stocks? If you believe inflation has been whipped for more than just the short term, you'll see why money can still be made in equities. Even after their recent explosive moves.<p>Where should you focus your buying? Hokenson believes that makers of consumer durable goods, automobiles, machinery, and office equipment will benefit from the "unique" economic recovery we're in. Losers will be retailers and apparel manufacturers who cannot raise prices on their goods without crushing demand. Defensive issues, such as utilities, consumer nondurables, gold stocks, and military-equipment manufacturers, will underperform. "Growth in company revenues will not be driven by pricing power; it will increasingly be a function of rising output," says Hokenson. "And the most successful companies will be those that achieve increased output via rising productivity." Such productivity will also propel stock prices.<p>Beyond low inflation and hefty productivity, there's another interesting force behind the recent run-up in equities. So says J. Randall Woolridge, a finance professor at Pennsylvania State University's Smeal School of Business. Woolridge set out last year to determine whether stock prices were indeed overvalued, as many on Wall Street claimed. In his study, which appeared this spring in the Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, he concludes that, based on future cash flows of the S&P 500, the market is fairly valued.<p>Although analysts who assess market valuations using more traditional measures--such as earnings or dividend yields--would argue with Woolridge, there is no dispute over one aspect of his analysis: The premium investors get from equities over and above risk-free Treasurys--called the risk premium--has fallen sharply, from 8 percent in the 1970s to 2 percent today.<p>Historically, the market's risk premium--defined as the return in the S&P 500 minus long-term Treasury bond returns--has changed little. For almost 50 years, beginning in 1926, the premium was between 6 and 8 percent. The decline, which means investors will pay higher prices for equities, accepting lower return premiums over Treasurys, started in earnest in the 1970s. But it has never been as low as it is now.<p>Why? Woolridge says it is the result of rising volatility in bonds. Comparing the volatility of stock and bond returns since 1926, Woolridge found stock returns to be significantly more variable or volatile than bond returns through the 1970s; in the 1980s and this decade, bond returns have been almost as variable as those of stocks. "The relative risk has changed in bonds," he says, adding that he can only guess why this is the case.<p>"The bond market has become very sensitive to inflation issues; the stock market has not been as sensitive," Woolridge says. Another possible reason for the higher volatility: Vastly greater numbers of investors pouring money into the bond market via mutual funds than was the case 20 years ago. A third explanation: Globalization of the financial markets has led to much more action in the previously sleepy bond arena.<p>Whatever the reasoning, increasing volatility in bonds was not accompanied by a simultaneous increase in stock volatility. So investors perceive stocks to be less risky than they had been, at least compared with bonds. Is it any wonder the S&P has surged?<p>This perception could change at any time, of course. But the decline in the risk premium investors pay to own stocks certainly helps explain why the market is where it is. Things really may be different after all.<p><p>

						September 1995
Worth magazine/Advisor<p>BRIEFS<p>By Elizabeth Macdonald and Maxwell G. Dale<p>ONLINE SMALL-BUSINESS ADVICE<p>Lexis-Nexis, the Dayton, Ohio based information company, and Open Market, Inc., a Cambridge, Massachusetts, computer company, recently introduced an Internet database called the Small Business Service. For as little as $1.95 an article and zero browsing costs, Net surfers can access 8,000 stories on small-business issues. "Lexis-Nexis can give small-business directors an edge on their competitors," says Jim Weidman, a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business in Washington, D.C. Subjects range from capitalizing a start-up to legal changes affecting small businesses. To use the service, log on to World Wide Web site http://www.directory.net/lexis-nexis/sba.<p>
LATEST ANNUITY TARGET: WOMEN<p>At the behest of SunAmerica, a Los Angeles retirement-services company, the National Center for Women and Retirement Research in Southampton, New York, recently surveyed roughly 1,500 women about their retirement plans. The survey disclosed that women spend more time and money planning their wedding than their retirement. Also, 90 percent of respondents avoided retirement investing because of high capital-gains taxes, while only one third fully understood the capital-preserving qualities of annuities.<p>SunAmerica promptly began targeting women for its annuities. But the company didn't tell prospective customers that, as of the first quarter of 1995, variable-annuity sales have plunged to $2.1 billion, from $12.3 billion a year earlier, according to Lipper Analytical Services. In part this was a result of the bond market's poor 1994 performance. Says Eileen Sharkey, a Denver certified financial planner: "Annuities should never be the only retirement vehicle for an investor."<p>
NONTOXIC MUNIS<p>The Orange County financial crisis and the more recent downgrading of Washington, D.C., bonds have called attention to the general murkiness of the municipal-bond market. Reporting requirements are lax, making it difficult for investors to check for fiscal soundness. One option, according to the accounting firm Ernst & Young: Insured bonds. Nearly 40 percent of all municipal bonds will pay 100 percent of principal and interest in the event of default, says the Public Securities Association. Municipal-bond funds invested primarily in insured municipal bonds outperformed uninsured municipal funds by 1.27 percent during the first five months of this year. Keep in mind that so-called insured bond funds are required by law to stash only 65 percent in insured bonds.<p>
GUNNING FOR DERIVATIVES<p>Last May, Worth reported that the Internal Revenue Service wanted to attack derivatives. The agency is now set to aim and fire: In early 1996, the IRS will crank up a pilot computer program to help auditors calculate the difference between a derivative's discounted purchase price and the price it is expected to fetch in a given period of time. The program, developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, will help the IRS reconstruct market conditions at the time of the taxpayer's investment, allowing its agents to determine whether he properly reported gains or losses. Those who have done so incorrectly will have to pay up.<p>
THE DERIVATIVES-MESS MARKET<p>Investors can now capitalize on the imminent IRS crackdown on derivatives as well as the havoc the instruments have caused. C*ATS Software of Palo Alto, California, a derivatives-analysis software company that makes software to manage the structuring, pricing, and trading of complex derivatives, filed an initial public offering of 2 million shares at $12 last March. The IPO exceeded the maximum filing range of $11, according to The IPO Reporter. The stock is now trading around $11. The software is also used in back-office operations for processing, settlement, accounting, and reporting and is used by six of the world's ten largest commercial financial institutions. Says Norman Fosback, president of the Institute for Econometric Research: "We see a bright long-term future for this company."<p><p>

Worth magazine/Experts<p>OBSESSED BY INFLATION<p>By Walter Mead<p>Call me ishmael. when federal reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the Senate Finance Committee, "The appropriate rate of inflation, in my judgment, is zero," I had a sudden flashback to English 101: Great American Novels. I felt like a crewman on the Pequod listening as Captain Ahab uttered his unalterable vow to catch and kill the white whale. <p>We all know what followed upon that nautical policy statement: Moby Dick got away; Ahab, his ship, and all of his crew, except Ishmael, went down to a watery grave. I have no wish to experience the financial equivalent of shipwreck simply because the Federal Reserve's chairman is determined to put an utter end to inflation. <p>Most of the financial establishment didn't react to Greenspan's pronouncement with my degree of alarm, but then most of the financial establishment spent 1994 investing in the Mexican stock market. Instead, well-barbered heads on top of conservatively clad shoulders nodded approvingly. Bondholders, thinking only of the wonderful things zero inflation would do to the real rate of return on their investments, cheered the Fed chairman on.<p>So why am I here to speak of the dangers of this course? Zero inflation sounds great--like zero cancer. Why would anyone oppose it? <p>How about because it's a policy based on misleading statistics that, if it were to work, would produce the kind of low-growth economy enjoyed by Soviet Russia in the decade before the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and that, without public discussion, allows unelected bureaucrats to transfer wealth to older Americans from their children?<p>Strong words, I grant you. To understand why I believe this, let's look at what causes inflation. Most simply, inflation is defined as the rise in the prices of goods and services. But what causes prices to rise?<p>Economists offer two explanations, both focusing on supply and demand. The first--let's call this the friction theory--says that inflation is caused by friction when demand for a good temporarily exceeds supply. Sometimes an unexpected event curtails supply: A freeze in Brazil sends the price of coffee up as the supply plummets. At other times, demand suddenly soars. Suddenly everybody wants to drive a pickup, driving up the price of those vehicles--and the wages of auto workers, the prices of glass and steel, and so forth down the line. In a frictionless world, a new factory would immediately spring up to meet that demand. In the real world, however, there is inevitable grinding and delays as a segment of the economy changes direction. At some point in the future, of course, supply will catch up with demand, but as any consumer knows, prices never fall completely back to earlier levels (if they fall at all). Economists say that prices are sticky upward.<p>Economists who belong to the second camp, the monetarists, offer another explanation. Inflation is caused by expansion of the money supply. If a central bank or a national government increases the supply of money in circulation, the increased amount of money chasing the same supply of goods will drive up prices.<p>A capitalist economy always produces some inflation of the first sort--and that makes zero inflation impossible. We've come to understand that about unemployment, which is an analogous phenomenon. Politicians and economists have been attacking unemployment and pledging to end it for longer than most of us can remember--with very poor results to date. But the long battle against unemployment has taught us that, essentially, there is no such thing as a zero rate of unemployment--and that coming too close to it can be bad for the economy. <p>Why? Even in the best of all possible economies, there would be people looking for jobs. Young people are constantly entering the job market; other workers are changing jobs. There will never be a moment when everybody in the economy has a job at the same time; there will therefore always be some of what economists have come to call frictional unemployment--estimated to be at least 2 percent of the workforce.<p>In the same way there is an irreducible minimum of frictional inflation in the system. Demand for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers exceeds supply. The manufacturer wants to meet the demand, but delays adding workers until orders pile up. The prices at the toy store go up.<p>Because of economic friction, zero inflation is like absolute zero in thermodynamics: an important theoretical concept that can never be seen in real life. Physicists know they cannot produce a temperature of absolute zero in the lab, and that even if they could get it, they couldn't build a thermometer that could measure it. <p>But it's not just that zero inflation is impossible--it's also undesirable. Some inflation is crucial in any capitalist economy, because price changes are essential signals of supply and demand--price increases tell manufacturers, service providers, and investors what to do. If there is a widget shortage, the price goes up and the profits of widget makers increase. This makes existing producers increase their output and may cause new producers to invest in new widget works. <p>A healthy economy is an economy in which producers are getting many signals to increase production and investment. That is, an economy with a certain amount of built-in inflation. <p>You could only get zero inflation in an economy by killing it. Interestingly, the communist economies came closer than capitalist ones to eliminating inflation in the 20th century. The Soviet Union's apologists used to boast that its price stability proved the superiority of communism. <p>Now, clearly, high rates of inflation aren't healthy or necessary for growth. But fine-tuning the economy to achieve the best rate isn't easy--especially because economists have only a vague idea of what the current rate of inflation is. Alan Greenspan, ironically enough, has done the most to publicize this problem. Suggesting to Congress that we could reduce the deficit relatively painlessly, Greenspan argued that current government statistics overstate the rate of inflation by as much as 1.5 percentage points. In other words, more than half of the inflation that the government thinks it sees could be the result of errors in measurement.<p>That's terrific for politicians looking to cut billions of dollars from the federal budget painlessly by lowering cost-of-living adjustments in programs like Social Security to more "accurate" levels. But it's bad news for the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve. It reminds us that measurements of inflation are inherently unreliable. The consumer price index, which we use to measure the rate of inflation, cannot possibly keep track of all goods and services. It is based on the price of a basket of goods purchased by the average family. Like the Dow Jones Index or any other index, the CPI provides only an approximation of changing price levels. The Dow can be up when the overall market is down and vice versa. Similarly, the CPI can be up--if heating oil is in short supply, for example--even when the prices for most things are steady or even headed down.<p>Nor is it clear how much of any price increase should count as inflation. Health care costs today are much higher than they were 40 years ago--but 40 years ago you couldn't buy many of the treatments that extend our lives today. Or look at computers. The computer I buy in 1995 may cost $3,300 instead of the $2,500 I paid for one in 1988, but it comes with better graphics, a color screen, bigger hard and floppy drives, more memory, and a faster processor. The price of computers, measured by the amount of power a given sum of money can purchase, has dropped steadily and dramatically over those years. Is this inflation or deflation--and how does a price index measure it? <p>The imprecision of our statistics makes it impossible to know exactly what the rate of inflation is--which is one reason monetarists have urged the Federal Reserve to focus on the money supply and not the inflation rate. Unfortunately for this school of economics, money has become as difficult to define as inflation. Every new form of investment account, every new means of electronic transfer, has eroded the traditional definitions of money and the historical relationships between money supply and future economic growth and inflation. Those central bankers who tried to use the money supply as a means to control prices came to grief because in the end they could never get around basic but unavoidable problems: What, precisely, constitutes the supply of money that central bankers ought to control and how, precisely, can changes in the speed with which money circulates be measured? <p>To the chagrin of monetarists, Greenspan's Federal Reserve has thrown up its hands in despair on this issue, saying in effect that it's time to invent a new measure of the money supply since none of the traditional measures work anymore, but it would be lovely if someone else did it.<p>So here we are on the deck of the Pequod chasing a goal--zero inflation--that we may not want to reach and using instruments so inaccurate that we won't be able to see the whale even when it's right beneath us. Such is the power of obsession. Few in Captain Ahab's crew challenged his quest. Few object when the Federal Reserve's chairman announces a policy of zero inflation.<p>But targeting zero inflation isn't ordained by some law of economics; it's a policy decision, akin to deciding to cut welfare or put more money into defense. It hurts some parts of the population and helps others.<p>Fiscal conservatives love to point out that inflation is a hidden tax--one they blame on the federal government--on those who hold bonds and similar financial assets. And that's true. Inflation does erode the future value of principal and interest payments.<p>But the inflation rate is also one way that we decide how to apportion resources between generations. Higher inflation takes value from the older, bondholding generation--which enjoyed the consumption the bonds paid for--and allows the younger, asset-poor generation to pay its obligations in money of lower real value. Throughout history, debtors have always favored inflation; creditors have always opposed that.<p>I'm not sure there is any sound economic reason to use inflation policy to favor one generation over another, but there is also no way to avoid it. At a time when many of those crusading to lower the deficit speak so passionately about the debt we will leave to our children, it seems inconsistent to pursue a zero-inflation policy designed to ensure that those future debts weigh as much as possible.<p>So: Zero inflation is impossible to measure, impossible to create, and undesirable to have. Alan Greenspan, we can confidently predict, will never achieve permanent zero inflation any more than Captain Ahab ever caught Moby Dick. The only question is, how much damage will this mad quest inflict on the ship's long-suffering crew?<p><p>

Worth magazine/Experts<p>NOT ON YOUR LIFE
Insurance buyers in Australia and the U.K. are saving money. U.S. firms want no part of this.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>Life insurance is one of the most maddening and unpleasant purchases a consumer can make. It's certainly no fun to ponder one's mortality, but that's only the half of it. Some--though not all--of the roughly 250,000 folks who peddle life insurance in this country make used-car salesmen look downright genuine and benevolent.<p>Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of buying life insurance is trying to find out what a policy's true costs are; specifically, how much you're paying in sales charges. This is no coincidence--even industry types admit that life insurance doesn't exactly sell itself. To generate business, some life companies are willing to pay salesmen hideously high commissions. Agents can earn, for example, upfront commissions of as much as 125 percent of the first year's premiums on a whole-life policy. This is why it takes so long for cash values in a typical policy to build up to anything substantial, even after years of paying in hefty premiums. It is also why agents are often tempted to churn clients out of one policy into another after just a few years: This practice creates fresh commissions for the salesman.<p>The insurance industry has worked hard to keep costs and commissions in life products well hidden, but consumers are starting to get wise to this. No-load or low-load life insurance is winning market share from the heavily loaded products; no-load and low-load snared 4 to 5 percent of the estimated $1.6 trillion in new life insurance sold throughout the country in 1994, double the share of two years ago.<p>Low-load life insurance, in which commissions are practically nonexistent and a policyholder's cash value builds up almost immediately, might really take off if the disclosure of costs and commissions in life insurance policies were made mandatory. The industry is against this idea, however. William Regan, chief executive officer of the National Association of Life Underwriters, a 138,000-member industry group, derides the detailing of fees, calling it"the Consumer Reports mentality." He says, "The problem we see in full disclosure is that it takes the focus off what the buyer is getting and puts it on what the agent is getting. That's not the story."<p>Unfortunately, what the agent is getting is very much the story in the life insurance industry. What people like Regan don't want to admit is that the cost structures inherent in life insurance products are behind many of the scandals that have made headlines recently. In the past two years, for example, allegations of churning life insurance policies hit Prudential, Mutual Life of New York, Equitable Life, John Hancock, and other industry leaders.<p>In April 1994, this column published a checklist for readers to ask an insurance salesman to complete before readers bought a policy. The checklist called for, among other things, itemized costs of all commissions and charges attached to the policy. Kurt Arndt, a reader in North Carolina who was considering a life insurance investment, reports that when he attempted to get his Prudential agent to complete the checklist, he was told that the company "has no time to answer all questionnaires one might find in magazines." Says Arndt: "They were never willing to disclose in plain English how much they charge during the life of an insurance contract." He canceled his order.<p>Unfortunately, life insurance companies are not required by law to divulge such information in plain and clear English. Until they are, they're unlikely to volunteer it and will undoubtedly stonewall efforts to open up commission disclosure.<p>But this stonewalling may not work forever. Now that commission disclosure exists for the first time in Australia, the results are proving how beneficial it can be to consumers. According to research conducted by the Life Insurance Marketing Research Association International in Windsor, Connecticut, new-business commissions fell by more than half after disclosure rules went into effect in Australia, declining from around 90 percent of first-year premiums to roughly 40 percent. <p>In January, the U.K. also began requiring insurance companies to tell buyers in writing the fees earned from the sale of any product. Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, wanted consumers to be able to see exactly what they were getting when they bought life insurance. The LIMRA report states that the Securities and Investments Board, the U.K.'s chief insurance regulator, estimates that clearly detailed product information will save British insurance shoppers the equivalent of $1.6 billion a year.<p>One of the outgrowths of full disclosure is that more life insurance companies in Britain are changing the way they pay agents, switching from commission-based pay to salaries. Marks & Spencer's new life and pensions division started operating this year under new rules: Its sales force is paid a salary, with no bonuses or commissions. As the LIMRA study sums up: "Until the incentive to sell the product with the highest upfront commissions is removed, some agents will abuse clients by overselling and unnecessarily replacing policies." <p>It is just this kind of abuse that is alleged in a class-action lawsuit brought earlier this year against Prudential by a group of policyholders across the nation. According to the lawsuit, Prudential agents, to increase sales and commissions, enticed clients who had accumulated cash values in their existing policies to use that cash to purchase new Prudential policies.<p>Robert Bearden, a machinist from Fort Smith, Arkansas, is a plaintiff in the Prudential case. After Bearden was churned out of his old policy and into a new one, according to the complaint, the cash values and death benefits that he had counted on having were depleted. The lawsuit says, "[His] estate and retirement plan which had been thought to be secure is seriously endangered."<p>Stories like Bearden's do little to boost consumer confidence in an industry that's already under fire. Is it any surprise that the Insurance Information Institute says industry approval ratings fell from 48 percent to 42 percent last year? At the same time, the disapproval rating rose from 18 percent to 23 percent. <p>With the U.K. and Australian precedents to point to, however, consumers in the U.S. can at last turn up the heat on our own insurance regulators to work toward full commission disclosure in the selling of life insurance. <p>One way to do this is to write to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the group of state insurance regulators that oversees the industry, encouraging it to pursue commission disclosure. Lee Douglass, the commissioner from Arkansas, is president of the NAIC (120 West 12th Street, Suite 1100, Kansas City, Missouri 64105-1925). Another way to get the attention of life insurers? Buy only no- or low-load policies. To get more information on these products, call the Wholesale Insurance Network in Tampa, Florida, at 800-808-5810. <p>If consumers don't demand disclosure of commissions, the high costs of buying life insurance will be kept hidden by folks like industry spokesman Regan, who argues that disclosure only "muddles up the process." Regan should let consumers be the judge of that. <p><p>

Worth Magazine/Advisor<p>DR. BARNES'S PASSION FOR ART<p>By Peter Edidin<p>Bill gates, or vlad the impaler to his competitors, has struck again. Corbis Publishing, a small Bellevue, Washington, company controlled by Gates, has produced a terrific CD-ROM that restores some credibility to the much-hyped term multimedia. <p>A Passion for Art: Renior, Cezanne, Matisse, and Dr. Barnes is a virtual exhibition of some 330 works of art from the collection of Albert C. Barnes at the Barnes Museum in Merion, Pennsylvania. It takes you "into" the musuem, where the works hang upon the wall just as Barnes arranged them. The collection is famous for its stunning array of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings by Cezanne, Renoir, Corot, Pissarro, Modigliani, Courbet, and innumerable others. Picasso, Braque, Goya, Matisse, Monet, Klee--in fact, a virtual catalog of the great painters of the late 19th and early 20th centuries--are included here. Speaking on the CD-ROM, J. Carter Brown, director emeritus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., calls it "the greatest collection of its kind ever assembled by one person."<p>Barnes, a man of self-made wealth and self-taught connoisseurship, personally chose and negotiated for virtually all the thousands of works in his collection, mostly during manic buying trips to Paris between the two world wars. He once "actually waved his checkbook in the air," said Gertrude Stein, demanding she sell him a favorite Picasso.<p>The digitized images that record his passion are lovely to look at--the more so since, incredibly, they have been seen by only a handful of people in the past 70 years.<p>Barnes opened his musuem in 1925, showing art still regarded at the time as outrageous and avant-garde. The critics hated it, calling the paintings "diseased" and "degenerate." Embittered by this rejection of his attempt to enlarge the taste of his countrymen, Barnes closed the museum to all but a few painters, art historians, and students. <p>In bringing this work back to light, Corbis has used the vast storage capacity of CD-ROMs to allow the viewer to approach the paintings in a variety of ways. It's possible to take audio tours, conducted by well-known art historians, or study selected paintings with them. An index of all the works, with a pop-up image of each one as you scroll along, allows the paintings to be seen in any order, and portfolios of favorite works can be assembled.<p>The paintings can be displayed chronologically, by subject, or by artist. Each painter is shown in a painted portrait and has a brief biography, while the audio gives the correct pronunciation of his name. The works themselves are described in some detail and can be magnified for a closer look. There is an archive section, with letters showing the progress of Barnes's negotiations, check stubs testifying to their successful outcome, details on how he made the money he lavished on art, and other mementos of Barnes's life. The paintings also form part of a timeline that places the works not only in relation to one another but in the context of major events of the day. <p>All of these features are accessed with the click of a mouse on screens even the most technologically phobic will be able to fathom instantly. Finally, unlike many CD-ROMs, which are difficult to install and run, A Passion for Art requires nothing more than starting up the CD-ROM drive. <p>A Passion for Art sells from Corbis Publishing (800-260-0444) for $40 to $50 and will be available in an Apple version in May 1995. Minimum requirements are a multimedia PC with a 486 chip running at 25 MHz or better, 8 MB of RAM, 256 Super VGA screen, double-speed CD-ROM drive, 8-bit Windows-compatible sound card and speakers, mouse, and Microsoft Windows version 3.1. <p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>ADVISOR BRIEFS<p>By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>Stocking No-loads
The Securities and Exchange Commission recently made it easier for companies to adopt no-load stock plans that let investors buy stock direct from the companies, avoiding brokerage fees. These open-availability plans allow investors to reinvest partial dividends after investing as little as $50 in stocks, which can be traded at least once every five business days. Investors may automatically debit their bank accounts for purchases. Jim Volpe, a vice president with First Chicago Trust Co. of New York and an early champion of no-loads, says they save investors millions in fees. For a list of the 55 or so companies now offering such plans, call the Securities Transfer Association at 908-888-2112. <p>Educating IRA 
Millions of Americans will invest this year in IRAs. But many are putting their money in the wrong ones. According to the Investment Company Institute, one quarter of the $857.4 billion in IRA and Keogh money is stuck in federally insured bank and S&L accounts, whose modest returns are vulnerable to inflation. Says Eileen Sharkey, a certified financial planner in Denver: "Growth, growth, growth is the key. IRAs are too often in secure, dangerously low-yielding investments." Worse, a recent Federal Reserve Board study showed 47.2 percent of 3,906 households had at least some IRA money sitting in uninsured bank accounts. Sharkey says individuals more than three years from retirement should keep about two thirds of their IRA money in moderate-risk equity or balanced funds that beat the average equity fund over the last ten years.<p>Prepare to Meet Your Maker
Thought about dying recently? Probably not, according to a Louis Harris & Associates survey commissioned by the Lutheran Brotherhood, a not-for-profit financial-services group in Minneapolis. The November 1994 survey of 1,000 randomly selected heads of household found that almost 60 percent did not have a will. Those with children were even less likely to have one than the childless--33 percent versus 47 percent. The biggest will-makers were those over age 65 (72 percent had one). David Rustad, spokesman for the Lutheran Brotherhood, says about 80 percent of those polled had done no estate planning, such as establishing trusts. Says Rustad: "Americans are so averse to the subject of death, they don't plan for their heirs' financial well-being." <p>The IRS Eyes Derivatives 
The IRS wants its cut of the huge derivatives market, says IRS attorney Alan B. Munro. Munro is working with the Treasury Department on ways to tax the difference between a derivative's discounted purchase price and an estimated future price, much as the agency taxes the interest derived from the difference between the purchase price of an original-issue discount bond and the redemption price. If these rules take effect, "investors would have to include their gain in their gross income and pay tax on it," says Charles Wheeler, an investment specialist at KPMG Peat Marwick in Washington, D.C. Derivatives under scrutiny: Prepaid forward contracts, which the General Accounting Office says amounted to $7.5 billion in 1992; swaps ($4.7 billion); and interest-rate cap and floor contracts ($10.9 billion).<p>Thinking About A New Jet? 
CEOs who love their corporate jets may now have an easier time paying for one. NetJets of Montvale, New Jersey, sells time-shares in four types of private jets, including Cessnas and Raytheon Hawkers. The company divides each plane into one-eighth interests equal to 100 hours of flight time a year. A one-eighth interest in a $2.5 million Cessna Citation S/II, for example, goes for $330,000, plus $5,920 monthly for maintenance, crews, and insurance and $1,120 for each hour of flying time. If you fly 100 hours a year, the total expense of $513,040 is far below the $850,000 or so it costs just to maintain the plane. NetJets guarantees domestic availability of a seven-seat jet on four, six, or eight hours notice, depending on the type of aircraft and the amount invested. So far, the company has 220 investors, including some of the top ten companies in the Fortune 500.<p><p>

						April 1995 
Worth magazine/Advisor <p>ADVISOR BRIEFS<p>By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>THE TAX MAN COMETH 
Several tax-law changes took effect in 1994. Here are the most noteworthy:<p>A receipt from the charity, not just a canceled check, is now the only acceptable proof for individual charitable deductions of $250 or more if you are audited (it does not have to be attached to your return) <p>Unreimbursed moving expenses must be claimed as an adjustment to gross income, not as an itemized deduction.<p>To deduct moving expenses for a new job, employees must move at least 50 miles, up from 35 previously. The IRS wiped out deductions for travel meals, pre-move househunting trips, and temporary living expenses incurred up to 30 days after a move. <p>Most club dues are not allowable write-offs. <p>Taxpayers may deduct home-office expenses only if the office is their principal place of business.<p>Home buyers may now deduct seller-paid mortgage points for loans used to buy or improve a principal residence.<p>The minimum annual wage at which Social Security and Medicare taxes must be paid for household help is now $1,000, up from $50 a quarter. Baby-sitters under age 18 and in school are exempt.<p>The Nightmare Audit
This October, for the first time since 1988, the IRS plans to conduct line audits on 153,000 tax returns as part of its taxpayer compliance measurement program. But that doesn't mean the IRS is socking 153,000 individual taxpayers. Just 33,000 randomly selected wage earners will have to provide proof to an agent of each item reported on every line of their 1994 returns. The IRS also plans to go after 59,000 small-business owners who filed Schedule C and/or F, 12,500 partnership returns, and 48,500 corporate returns. The unlucky auditees should be prepared to hand over their 1993 and 1992 returns, too.<p>Patriots pay up
Back in the '40s and '50s, millions of Americans bought 40-year war bonds__$50 billion worth alone during World War II__which are now at maturity. A $1,000 series E bond purchased for $750 in November 1954 was worth $7,086.80 in November 1994. But yesterday's patriotism, like just about everything else, belongs in part to the IRS. The bonds' accrued interest is taxable, and those in the 28 percent bracket will have to pay $1,774 on that $750 bond.<p>Don't forget the DRIP
Sick of paying brokerage fees? More than 1,000 U.S. companies will sell you additional shares at prevailing market prices through dividend reinvestment plans. Plus, they'll let you reinvest dividends directly in new shares. Some firms even sell their shares at a small discount, usually around 5 percent. For the names of these companies and plan details, write for the Directory of Companies Offering Dividend Reinvestment Plans ($28.95), available from Evergreen Enterprises, P.O. Box 763, Laurel, Maryland 20725. For a free list of company names only, call The Moneypaper, a DRIP newsletter, at 800-388-9993.<p>Orange County fallout
The good news, according to Joseph Piraro, manager of the Van Kampen/American Capital closed-end fund, is that two big fund families__Franklin and Putnam__are now emerging from serious problems related to Orange County's bankruptcy. The bad news is how they've done it. Franklin in particular is said to have had to sell high-rated, short-term corporate debt to cover redemptions. Florida, Ohio, and Texas may be the next municipal-bond markets to have derivatives problems.<p>DON'T HANG UP

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>A LITERARY LOVE SONG TO LUCRE
By Peter Edidin<p>It is proverbially said that all the stories ever told contain only ten plots. Possibly, too, there are only that many subjects. The imagination, like plots, is fueled by facts. And the "`facts of life" are few, captured in the physical and emotional passage of existence: birth, death, youth, age, love, hate, joy, fear.<p>Money, certainly, is one of those archetypal elements of consciousness, and the subject of a lively anthology, The Oxford Book of Money, edited by Kevin Jackson and published this month (Oxford University Press, $25). Jackson, an arts editor at the daily Independent in England, has compiled "a book about money and the imagination." Money, he writes in an introduction, is so much with us as to be "the atmosphere we all breathe." The air in this book changes from page to page, as writers from Sophocles ("No thing in use by man, for power of ill/Can equal money") to Andy Warhol ("Cash. I'm just not happy when I don't have it. The minute I have it ... I just buy STUPID THINGS.") respond to the ubiquitous, maddeningly protean medium of exchange. <p>The book is neatly, if somewhat factitiously, organized into ten categorical chapters like "Opening Accounts," "Riches and Poverty," "Vice," "Virtue," "Coda: Hells and Heavens," and so on, but otherwise the selections, from brief aphorisms to a page or so of Marx or Dickens, are tightly packed according to no apparent system. This is a book for browsing rather than reading start to finish. Still, the range of writers and the breadth of their responses to money leave one alternately invigorated by so much ingenious thought and depressed that, clearly, history's principal thinkers have failed to comprehend and hence circumscribe money's mysterious influence any more than they have understood, say, sex. Not so incidentally, the subjects are often intertwined, whether it's John Updike's Rabbit and Mrs. Angstrom excitedly making love atop a pile of Krugerrands or the Emperor Caligula, "seized by desire ... rolling in gold over and over again." One is left feeling like Samuel Butler, who wrote, "While there is flesh there is money__or want of money; but money is always on the brain so long as there is a brain in reasonable order."<p>

						February 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Experts  <p> LET THE LOOTING BEGIN <p>Why are the SEC and the courts letting limited partnership investors get the shaft yet again?    <p> By Gretchen Morgenson  <p> Investors in real estate limited partnerships have already suffered three ignominies. When they bought their units in the 1980s,they paid exorbitant prices, including huge organizational and selling costs of 25 percent to the brokers peddling them. Then, the real estate market tanked, reducing the value of their units to a tiny fraction of what they cost. The third insult: Investors wanting out of their units found they couldn't sell, even at distressed prices. This is because regulators at the National Association of Securities Dealers and executives at the major firms have done all they can to prevent a secondary market in partnership units from springing up (Full Disclosure, July/August1994).  <p> What more could these investors suffer? If you're one of the millions who put an estimated $50 billion into real estate limited partnerships, prepare for the ultimate humiliation. Just when many commercial and residential real estate markets are picking up, sophisticated investors like ex-Drexel financier Leon Black, with the aid of greedy general partners, are swooping down on to limited-partnership investors and squeezing them out of units at pennies on the dollar.  <p> What do the regulators and the courts have to say to this egregious situation? Standing quietly by, they offer a clear message: Let the looting begin.  <p> Only a few such deals have been done so far, but because the potential profits are so huge and the Securities and Exchange Commission has done nothing to stop the pillaging, you can bet more will come. If the hardball tactics employed by Black in the most recent partnership take over were used to acquire a publicly traded stock, he would have been shut down instantly by well-organized institutional investors in the courts. But because limited partners in most of these deals tend to be unsophisticated small investors, powerless to organize, general partners appear free to impel limited partners, to whom they have a fiduciary duty, to sell their units back at rock-bottom prices. Glen Bigelow, head of Bigelow Management, a real estate investment firm in New York, says: "This is the most vicious type of insider trading I've seen. Yet there's an amazing silence from Wall Street and the SEC."  <p> Bigelow calls it insider trading because the very guys trying to gain control of the assets are the ones who know the most about the value of the partnerships' holdings. A recent deal involved 19 California partnerships--run by Century Properties, MRI Business Properties, and National Property Investors--which raised a total of $1.1 billion from more than 100,000 small investors between 1977 and 1986. The outfit tendering for the partnership units in mid-October--DeForest Ventures--consists of the general partners in charge of the 19 partnerships and Apollo Real Estate Advisors, a Leon Black investment fund. The general partners haven't done well for their small investors--in most of the partnerships, not one nickel in income has been distributed for five years. Apollo bought a third of the general partner for $15 million, then set up the group to make the tender.  <p> Black never plunges into anything unless he can get something big out of it. Here, that something is the potential to sell off, at sizable gains, the partnership's real estate once it's under his control. Forget that the proceeds from property sales are supposed to go to the people whose funds bought them initially--the long-suffering limited partners.  <p> The DeForest offering statement is a work worthy of Machiavelli. The firm tries to sell limited partners on what is a quintessential case of self-enrichment by a general partner. It says the offer will give unit holders "an opportunity to liquidate their investment without the usual transaction costs associated with market sales." Other reasons to tender: "General disenchantment with real estate investments, particularly long-term investments in limited partnerships" and "Continuing administrative costs and resultant negative financial impact on the value of the partnership's assets." Love the irony? Tender your dud units to the very folks whose high administrative costs helped make them a dud.  <p> The truly shocking part of the deal is the price DeForest offered to pay unit holders. For units of all 19 partnerships, DeForest offered only 60 percent of the estimated value Apollo gave the units when it assessed them before the offer. DeForest offered $70 million for assets that investors bought a decade ago for $550 million. Apollo values the assets at more than $116 million. <p> Lawrence Whiteside, a limited partner who put $5,000 in one of the deals, hired James Fotenos, a San Francisco lawyer, to try to stop the tender. In his complaint, Fotenos says the deal "represents a cynical attempt to exploit the frustration of the limited partners and capture a significant portion of the assets of these partnerships. . . . The real estate markets are turning around. . . . [This is] a crude attempt at looting the partnerships." <p> A San Mateo County Superior Court judge denied Fotenos's request for an injunction to stop the offer. As a result, it went through in late November. DeForest grabbed approximately 35 percent of the partnership units, effectively giving the firm total control over the operation. Fotenos believes there's nothing to stop the general partner from tendering later for the entire partnership. He plans to appeal the ruling.  <p> Why did so many investors tender units to DeForest at devastation prices? They're fed up with an investment that has returned zero for the past five years and that presents a tax-filing horror each April.  <p> One of the most distressing twists to this case was the late emergence of a higher offer for the partnership units made by Koll Management Services, a real estate company in California. Koll's offer to limited partners was 25 percent higher than DeForest's. But before investors could tender their units to Koll, the company rescinded its offer. According to court documents, Koll's president, Harold Hofer, said privately that a "deal had been struck" between Koll and Apollo when Apollo contacted the firm's CEO, Ray Wirta. As a result, Koll pulled out. (Wirta did not return a phone call for comment.) Once again, power and money prevail; limited partners lose.  <p> Where was the SEC in this mess, or <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, underwriter of three of the partnerships whose clients got the shaft? The SEC did not return repeated phone calls by press time. A Merrill spokesperson said, "Our most significant concern was that our clients had appropriate information to make the decision whether to tender." Thanks, guys.  <p> There's little investors in the DeForest situation can do now, but Fotenos recommends that anyone stuck in a burnt-out limited partnership write a letter calling attention to this outrage to Arthur Levitt, SEC Chairman, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. A letter-writing campaign is also a must for investors who get trapped in similar tender offers in the future. Given the easy profits likely to go to Leon Black in the DeForest deal, such tender traps are certain to become very popular indeed. <p><p>

You've heard of the gift that keeps on giving? Limited partnerships are the investment that keeps on taking.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>Are you one of the legions of investors trapped in a limited partnership you bought in the 1980s? Over the course of the decade, an estimated 10 million souls put about $90 billion into commercial or residential real estate, oil and gas, equipment leasing, and cable deals. Sold as portfolio diversification with tax advantages to boot, partnerships found their way into the accounts of even small, unsophisticated investors. Brokers who sold the deals raked huge fees off the top -- total organizational and selling costs often exceeded 25 percent of the amount invested -- and general partners running the properties earned rich management fees every year. <p>If only investors had done so well. Thanks to the real estate depression and low oil prices, most partnerships today are worth a small fraction of what investors paid for them. One knowledgeable player in the industry says that half the money raised in the partnership boom has been lost to excessive fees and declining asset values.<p>Investors bought partnerships for two reasons: They hoped ultimately for capital gains from assets held in the portfolio, and while waiting for those gains, they got tax losses from partnership depreciation. Jerry Cook, a computer specialist, and his wife, Ellen, an accounting professor at the University of San Diego, are typical limited-partnership investors. They bought into a commercial real estate deal back in the '80s. "We put the money we were going to use for our kids' college education into it," says Jerry Cook. Now, units for which the Cooks paid $1,000 each are worth $25. <p>Adding insult to this egregious injury is the fact that investors like the Cooks cannot escape their partnerships' clutches. Unlike most stocks and bonds, which are easily dumped, partnership units are a ball and chain. You've heard of gifts that keep on giving? Limited partnerships are the investments that keep on taking.<p>Why is there virtually no exit from a partnership? Except for a few small independent firms matching up occasional buyers with sellers, there is no established partnership market where investors can sell their discounted units. Few industry players seem interested in creating a market in these securities. Most of the big firms that hawked these wares won't buy them back -- not surprising, given how low the units have sunk from their offering prices. As a rule, general partners running the deals do little to encourage secondary market trading, obfuscating asset values and requiring buyer and seller to fill out mountains of paperwork before units can be exchanged. <p>There's a likely reason brokerage firms and general partners haven't worked to create a secondary market in partnerships: It would show what lousy investments they've been. Such a market would act as a report card on $90 billion in investments that have delivered little if anything on their promise. <p>News of what looked like an attempt to break this logjam came in mid-May, when the National Association of Securities Dealers said it hoped to start listing limited-partnership units on its OTC Bulletin Board, an electronic marketplace for illiquid securities, by the end of the year. Firms interested in buying or selling a partnership unit would put their bids and offers on the system. At last, investors could get a clue to their units' values and identify firms willing to take units off their hands.<p>Time to break out the champagne? Not quite. Although the NASD's plan sounds good and is an improvement over the disorganized and exceedingly illiquid market of today, many limited-partnership investors will remain hostage to bureaucratic obstinacy, powerful general partners, and big-shot brokerage firms. <p>Then there's the Internal Revenue Service, which must sign off on the bulletin-board plan before it gets started. Partnerships operate under different tax rules from corporations --  passing along tax advantages, like losses generated from property depreciation, to limited partners, for instance. <p>Under IRS rules, energy and real estate partnerships qualify for this special treatment if they're not "publicly traded on an established exchange." Will the IRS consider the bulletin board an exchange and disallow the special tax treatment? The IRS won't say.<p>Even if the IRS allows the bulletin board to exist without eliminating partnerships' tax treatment, true liquidity is never going to be achieved in limited partnerships. At least not until the NASD modifies its rules on the fees secondary-market firms can charge to help investors out of their problem units. For now, and for the near future, such a move seems unlikely. <p>The problem: The NASD's guideline regarding the fees firms can charge customers to trade securities. Such fees are not supposed to exceed 5 percent of the value of the securities traded, shared between the firm representing the buyer and the one for the seller.<p>While the guideline makes sense on more frequently traded instruments such as stocks and bonds, it has little basis in reality for limited-partnership units. Consider, for instance, a trade that took place this spring, of 25 units of Carlyle's Real Estate LP XIII at a small outfit called National Partnership Exchange in Tampa, Florida. The units, issued for $1,000 each, traded in May at $12, for a total of $300.<p>If a firm arranging such a trade followed the 5 percent guideline, it would be allowed to charge $15 for its services. Fifteen bucks doesn't go far when you have to locate a buyer for the units, hound the general partner to complete the necessary paperwork, and get the proper documentation -- such as powers of attorney, trust agreements, and other legal papers -- from the seller to the buyer. All these details typically add up to three months between the time a partnership is first traded and the moment the trade is consummated. What sane business would offer such services for $15?<p>Fewer and fewer all the time. Even as the NASD claims to be trying to help investors with its bulletin-board plan, it is censuring some of the few outfits that try to put together buyers and sellers of partnership units or harassing them with threats of frequent audits.<p>According to the NASD, these firms overcharge. "In most instances we found the 5 percent adequate to cover (their) costs," says Charles Bennett of the NASD. Result: Regulators' blind adherence to the 5 percent ideal has radically reduced investors' ability to exit partnerships. <p>Two years ago, for example, National Partnership Exchange made offerings in 285 different partnerships. Today they deal in 71. The drop is partly because a number of partnerships have been reorganized into publicly traded stocks. But, say industry sources, it is mostly a result of NASD threats. <p>Into this dwindling marketplace more and more partnership holders try to sell. Many have been in these deals for a decade. People's investment needs change; they should be allowed out, even if at an enormous loss. <p>Even though partnerships were sold as investments with 7- to 12-year holding periods, few are being unwound. That's partly because assets held in the partnerships are worth much less now than they were originally. General partners typically receive no payout from selling properties they hold until delivering to limited partners a return of their capital as well as a 6 percent or 8 percent annualized gain. Since such a prospect isn't possible, few general partners want to wind up their partnerships. <p>Fees earned while keeping the deals alive -- management expenses and reimbursements for operating costs -- can be mighty lucrative. Take the Shearson-Murray Real Estate Fund VI, a deal that raised $11.5 million from investors in 1981 to buy garden apartments. The fund went into Chapter 11 in 1986 and has operated under a reorganization plan since. <p>But even these dire straits haven't prevented the fund's general partner from extracting its fees. From 1991 through 1993, general partner and affiliates were reimbursed $600,000 for administrative expenses and property-management fees. And the limited partners? The fund's financials say the partnership will be wound up in '94: "It is unlikely that there will be sufficient cash remaining for a liquidating distribution to limited partners." <p>Investors in the Shearson fund can take solace in this: They'll no longer have a tax liability. Investors whose partnerships limp on soon find that not only are their units almost impossible to sell, they can't be given away. Charities won't accept them as gifts because of their costs and tax problems. Neither can you throw your units out; the IRS considers any disposition as relief of a debt -- a taxable event. <p>So investors are often stuck: up against general partners interested in maintaining a profitable status quo, brokerage firms with no interest in giving investors a clear idea of how bad these deals are, and regulators holding well-intentioned operators in an illiquid, complex market to unreasonably low fee standards. <p>Brian Propes, senior vice president at Securities Service Network, a small brokerage in Knoxville, Tennessee, has battled the NASD on the markup matter. His firm charges a minimum commission of $325 to do a partnership trade. This covers the costs of finding a buyer and generating the necessary paperwork and allows a modest profit. Propes's firm does 400 to 600 trades a year; mean trade size is about $6,000. <p>The NASD is threatening to crack down on the firm because on small transactions the $325 commission exceeds 5 percent. Says Propes, a former NASD regulator: "We're not out there to screw anybody. We're out there to get somebody out of something they don't want and get somebody into something they do want." <p>The 5 percent guideline, while admirable, is simply inappropriate for the partnership-units market. While the NASD insists that firms trading partnership units charge 5 percent, brokers who originally sold them made 8 to 10 percent. What's more, if a small investor buys a couple of shares of <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>from a discount broker, commissions will exceed 5 percent of the stock's value. The NASD doesn't seem to have a problem with that, as long as the investor knows what his costs will be.<p>Former regulator Propes says: "There's never a trade that a customer doesn't know what the costs are. Yet the NASD trying to force the 5 percent rule is really forcing (firms) to back off, leaving the customer in the cold."<p>If the NASD wants to help wounded partnership investors, it should do whatever possible to bring efficiency and liquidity to the market. This cannot be achieved until the regulators apply a different fee standard on limited-partnership units.

Though Marx was wrong about the future of capitalism, his work is still the best explanation of today's economic crisis.<p>By Walter Mead<p>Not so long ago, everyone -- left and right -- thought Marxism was the wave of the future. Das Kapital, Marx's almost impenetrable three-volume analysis of capitalist economics, set off the biggest international religious movement since the Koran. From the jungles of Vietnam and the rice paddies of China to the sooty tenements of Paris and Berlin, youthful converts combed Marx's work for clues to their own, and the world's, problems. During the 1930s it was almost impossible to be an intellectual and not be a Marxist. The political right, while railing against the doctrine, paid homage to its power: As recently as 1987 the president of the United States was convinced that, if it wasn't stopped in Nicaragua, the irresistible Marxist tide would subjugate the United States. <p>How quaint that all looks now. The collapse of European communism and the failure of welfare-state economics in most of the West has ended any thought that Marx was an unfailing prophet. How tempting it is now to throw him into the dustbin of history along with the regimes that appropriated his name. Marx has been dead for more than 100 years; isn't it finally time to bury his theories too?<p>Maybe not. Though there may not be very many Marxists left, almost every serious approach to the problems of contemporary society is to some degree Marxian. Ironically, socialism's collapse makes it possible to see Marx more clearly for what he was -- the greatest student of capitalist economics and the first economic thinker to grasp the powerful nature of capitalism (a word we owe to him). Marx was the first to put economic thought in a historical context. Adam Smith's concept of free markets has nothing to do with history; the bazaars of medieval Baghdad were free markets, and so were, presumably, the Stone Age jamborees where river tribes exchanged fish for the game and furs of forest tribes. But those markets never harnessed the full power of their societies; only when free markets were united to the idea of capital did they turn into a force that would remake the world. <p>The secret of the West's ability to dominate the world economy wasn't markets, said Marx; it was capital. Capital isn't a synonym for wealth. The medieval duke in his inherited castle was wealthy, but he wasn't a capitalist. In capitalist societies, money and power flow to those who use money to make profits and who then employ those profits to make more capital. "Accumulate! Accumulate!" thundered Marx in Das Kapital. "That is Moses and the prophets!" <p>Marx was the first to understand and articulate the revolutionary potential of capitalism. Driven by competition and the necessity of earning profits, the bourgeoisie -- Marx's term for capitalists -- was the greatest force for change in history. Here is what capitalism would mean, he wrote in The Communist Manifesto: "Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned."<p>Marx wrote these words in 1848. Revolution swept across Europe that year from France to Hungary. The industrial revolution had already upset long-established patterns of life. Machines that could spin and weave had reduced skilled handicraft workers to poverty. "Efficient" agriculture forced peasants off the land and into the crowded labor markets of Europe's emerging cities of factories and slums. The old nobility, challenged by an unpolished class of capitalist entrepreneurs, clung fiercely to power. Blood would run in the streets that year. Like Humpty Dumpty, Europe's traditional economic and social patterns seemed shattered beyond hope of reconstruction. <p>Almost 150 years after Marx described the nature of capitalist revolution, we are in the midst of a great upheaval of exactly the kind Marx experienced in his own day. Technological revolutions are creating new industries and destroying old ones; the American workplace is more insecure than ever, and both corporations and individuals are being told to prepare for a future that is ever more unpredictable. <p>The global nature of the current revolution would not have surprised Marx either. He predicted that capitalism would create a global society. "All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed," he wrote. "In place of the old wants, satisfied by the productions of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes." Capitalism would bring "even the most barbarian nations into civilization." <p>However, as prescient as some of Marx's extrapolations of the course of capitalism were, in other areas he was brilliantly wrong. Marx was rightly convinced that the proletariat, the capital-less workers, would have a greater influence on history than the bourgeoisie. Workers would use their collective power, he predicted, to form an effective international organization that would overthrow capitalism and replace it with socialism. <p>Here Marx underestimated the power of nationalism. "National differences, and antagonisms between peoples, are daily more and more vanishing," he wrote in 1848. Nationalism, he thought, was a bourgeois trick that would lose its force over time. "The workers have no Fatherland," he wrote. He could not have been more wrong. In 1914 European socialists enthusiastically followed their capitalists into the trenches of World War I. Today, we know that nationalism has outlived communism as a social force.<p>In fact, Marx's prediction needs to be stood on its head. Today, it is the capitalists who have no fatherland; multinational corporations make their investment and business decisions with less and less concern for the interests of their home country. It is the workers who want to subject international capitalism to national controls and who want American corporations to put the interests of their American employees ahead of their balance sheets. <p>But Marx's critics generally misidentify his greatest failure. They point to the dissolution of the Soviet system as a reason to dismiss the entire body of his work. He actually had little to say about how a socialist system would work, and the Communist planners combing his works for management tips came away empty-handed. They were forced to build their totalitarian states with materials from other sources.<p>And while Marx certainly didn't mind seeing a little bourgeois blood on the paving stones, there is nothing in his work to suggest he would have endorsed the waves of extended mass terror and sordid police repression that characterized the Communist world.<p>No, Marx's most profound mistake -- and the one that paradoxically makes him most interesting to us today -- results from his inability to grasp just how revolutionary and flexible capitalism can be. Capitalism, rather than plunging into crisis after the revolts of 1848, reorganized itself. The creation of the welfare state in Western Europe and North America began when Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck sought to outflank the German socialists by introducing insurance programs that sheltered German workers from the worst insecurities of capitalism. Gradually that movement spread throughout the Western world. Unemployment insurance, social security, disability insurance, and -- everywhere in the First World except in the United States -- guaranteed health care proved that capitalism didn't inevitably reduce workers to misery.<p>Marx thought that capitalism couldn't afford programs like this and that the workers would rise up against the system precisely because of the intolerable insecurity and suffering its booms and busts would cause. Capitalist competition would drive wages lower and lower. The poverty of workers would make the economy vulnerable to periodic crises when purchasing power failed to keep up with the supply of goods on the market. How could revolution not follow?<p>Capitalists and workers proved him wrong in the 20th century. It turned out that social programs and policies such as the minimum wage didn't wreck capitalism: They made it healthier. What workers could buy, capitalists could sell. When governments spent more money on unemployment benefits and job-creation programs during depressions, the depressions ended earlier and the capitalists returned more quickly to profitability. The politics of class conflict across the industrial world turned into the politics of class compromise. <p>Marx's vision of a proletarian socialist revolution may be dead, but the proletariat isn't. We live in a proletarian society, and the politics of the proletariat seem destined to play an ever greater role in American life, as he predicted. <p>Americans hate words that tell the truth about social conditions. America's family farmers would be called "peasants" anywhere else in the world -- at best "free peasants," since they have the option of leaving their debt-encumbered farms. But very few political candidates open their stump speeches in Iowa with the words "My fellow peasants." Nobody in America wants to be called proletarian, but in fact Marx's proletariat is alive if not well in the United States today: We call it the middle class. <p>Over the decades, proletarian has acquired connotations of blue-collar work: When we think proletarian, we think hard hats and time clocks. Blue-collar workers are proletarians, but they aren't the only ones. The word itself comes down from Roman times, when the poorest class of Roman citizens were people whose only property was their offspring. Marx uses the word to talk about people who live by selling their work: people who don't own enough property to live off their capital. Anybody on wage or salary who depends on that income for a living qualifies as a proletarian. When you include retirees whose pensions and Social Security are in effect deferred compensation for work they did when younger, virtually the entire middle class of the United States -- over half of the total population -- belongs to the proletariat. Other than the utterly dispossessed and unemployable people who have fallen through the cracks of the economy, owners of small businesses, people on trust funds, the top echelons of management in the corporate world, tenured university professors, and celebrities, virtually everybody in the United States is a proletarian. And most of those who aren't -- including small businessmen like fast-food franchisees and freelance writers -- are so immersed in proletarian values and culture that while we are technically members of Marx's least-favorite class -- the petit bourgeoisie -- we have largely been swallowed by the proletariat. <p>Clearly, Marx was wrong about the political evolution of this class; very few of us American proletarians walk around whistling the Internationale or plotting the overthrow of capitalism. But he was clearly colossally right to say that this class would become the dominant social force in the advanced industrial nations. Watch Congress writhe as it tries to cut middle-class entitlements. The middle class is the 900-pound gorilla of American politics; once it makes up its mind about something, no bourgeois lackey or capitalist tool can hope to stand against it for long. <p>The most important fact about American politics today is that the middle class isn't happy. The old compromise -- security and rising living standards for the workers, steady profits for the capitalists -- isn't delivering. "The constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation" are back. In the short run, they produce phenomena like Ross Perot's candidacy in the last election. In the long run? <p>Marx thought he knew where capitalism was headed, and that was his big mistake. Today we need to understand that capitalism's future is a question mark. Internationally, as capitalism spreads through the developing world, we can no longer be smugly sure that capitalism equals stability. If the capitalist system can no longer provide the wages and social benefits that people in rich countries expect, what will happen in the poorer ones? Korean, Chinese, and Malaysian workers hope some day to have living standards like those of their fellow proletarians in North America and Western Europe. So do the workers in Mexico, Poland, and Russia. Can capitalism deliver for the global proletariat the way it did earlier in this century for the proletariat in the advanced Western countries? <p>Communism has failed; will capitalism succeed? The answer may not be the one Marx predicted, but he did point to the test that modern capitalism must pass: To survive, capitalism must once again reorganize itself and find a way to satisfy the aspirations of the middle class. Let's hope it does.

For the sake of argument, let's say we do need to balance the budget. Would you raise taxes 3% or eliminate the army?<p>By Walter Mead<p>This is as good as it gets, economists were saying happily this spring. (Even if investors weren't. Hey, I didn't say things were perfect.) Three years into a healthy economic expansion, interest rates are still relatively modest. Unemployment is falling. Inflation remains low, even if threatening clouds can be spotted on the horizon. American products are recapturing lost ground in foreign markets. Look! They are even making money in Detroit.<p>Washington's response to all this good news? Panic. Blind, hysterical panic that recently came within an ace of wrecking the U.S. Constitution, destroying the government's ability to invest for the future, and ruining the economy for years, perhaps decades, to come. Washington, in other words, nearly passed the balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. This, the worst proposed amendment since prohibition, came within 12 votes of passing in the House, 4 in the Senate. Backers promise to bring it to another vote next year.<p>If you think I'm exaggerating, just read this piece of legislation. The balanced-budget amendment is 307 words of bad news, but the worst damage comes up front, in the first two of its eight sections. "Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year," unless a three-fifths majority in both houses of Congress approves, says Section 1. The ceiling on the national debt shall not be raised without a similar vote, says Section 2. Section 3 requires that no tax increases become law without a roll-call vote in both houses, by no means a bad idea, I admit. The remaining sections provide for exceptions (war or the threat of war), authorize enabling legislation, define terms like receipts and outlays, and announce that the amendment will go into effect beginning with fiscal year 1999 if it is ratified in time. <p>Those innocuous words disguise the worst kind of constitutional tinkering. The requirement that the budget be balanced in any given year sounds simple, for example, but in effect creates a litigator's dream. You don't like something the federal government has done? Challenge the budget accounting and claim that the government is really in the red and, therefore, that the department that annoyed you is operating with unconstitutionally appropriated funds.<p>Would the U.S. Constitution allow a federal court to declare the budget unconstitutional if it violated this amendment? If not, the amendment is toothless. Congress can happily vote any budget it wishes, announce that the budget is balanced, and go merrily home. But if the federal courts do have the right to review the budget, then sooner or later some zealous federal-district-court judge will declare the budget unconstitutional, and we will have created the biggest legal mess in our history. <p>Let's not forget: All this is for nothing. In my November 1993 column I demonstrated that neither the budget deficit nor the national debt loom large in relation to the nation's assets. Worries about the debt we are passing down to our children are painfully misplaced. We aren't, after all, just passing down debts, I tried to point out. Some of you weren't convinced, so I'll use another set of numbers. Using constant 1987 dollars, the total private net worth of the United States in 1946 was $4.5 trillion. The total federal debt, swollen from the cost of World War II, was $1.3 trillion. By 1992 the federal debt had reached $2.4 trillion, but the private assets of Americans had increased much more rapidly - to $17.7 trillion. Sure, our kids will inherit the federal deficit. But they will inherit our private assets also, so who cares? <p>Okay, I know from my mail that some of you would rather die than be convinced that the deficit doesn't matter (better dead than in the red). So let's assume that the hard-nosed deficit hawks get their way. Suppose Congress passes this misguided amendment and we have to balance the budget. What would you cut? <p>Take the budget for the 1999 fiscal year. The government projects total receipts of $1.629 trillion and total outlays of $1.830 trillion (in 1999 dollars). This leaves a deficit of $201 billion - or about 11 percent. Making up for an 11 percent shortfall sounds easy, right? Just cut out the fat. <p>Wrong. The federal budget is divided into two basic categories: discretionary and mandatory spending. Let's start by cutting discretionary items. Despite its name, discretionary spending isn't made up of frills and doodads. The $554.4 billion in discretionary spending for 1999 includes $253.8 billion in defense outlays, for example. That's $9 billion less than we spent in 1993 - and a 1999 dollar, because of inflation, isn't going to stretch nearly as far.<p>If defense can't be touched, that means looking for the fat in the remaining $301 billion in other discretionary spending. Cutting $201 billion from this part of the budget alone would require eliminating the combined non-entitlement budgets of the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, Treasury, State, and Veterans Affairs. Throw in a few other agencies such as NASA, the judiciary branch of the federal government, and both houses of Congress to achieve the total.<p>But what about mandatory spending? the deficit hawks ask. All those wasteful entitlement programs are just begging for the ax.<p>Well, not really. Mandatory spending - which is where most of the money is - includes entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. In 1999, the government projects that total mandatory spending will amount to $1.02 trillion. About 40 percent of that, $410.8 billion, is Social Security. Another $78.9 billion goes to pensions for retired federal employees. Most of the remaining $489.7 billion goes to Medicare and Medicaid: a combined total of $386.9 billion. <p>Health care reform is designed to tackle the runaway growth of these programs. But even if one of the current legislative packages manages to cut the rate of increase, it's hard to see how to cut the total unless we plan to deny medical care to the poor and the old. In the long run the only way to get the costs under control is probably the kind of single-payer plan that most deficit hawks hate as much as they hate deficits. No savings from any plan will roll in before 1999, anyway.<p>So what about those other entitlements? Unemployment benefits account for $25.1 billion of projected 1999 outlays. Any takers for wiping them out - or cutting them in half? <p>There is a juicy item in the mandatory budget of $124 billion for "means-tested benefits." This money includes such wasteful boondoggles as veterans' pensions, food stamps, child nutrition programs, and supplementary income payments to the disabled. No doubt better administration could shave a few billion here and there off all these entitlement programs, but there just isn't $201 billion of fat. <p>This leaves tax increases. Balancing the budget through higher income taxes alone would require a 30 percent tax increase by 2001. Based on current tax rates, this would mean an increase of $2,763 for a married couple filing jointly with a taxable income of $50,000 a year. Couples with $100,000 in taxable income would face an increase of $7,954. <p>Of course, spreading the pain around would help. Making up some of the money from tax increases, some from entitlement cuts, and some from reductions in discretionary spending could ensure that the United States still has a Congress - and possibly even a State Department - in the year 2000. But there is no doubt that the pain will be real.<p>By the way, the amendment would require another $50 billion in cuts by 2001. Good-bye, Department of Education. Good-bye, marines. <p>Most deficit hawks would be willing to live without the Department of Education, and a few might be willing to sacrifice the marines, but they certainly aren't talking about the negative effects that cutting $200 billion in government spending would have on the economy. When the government closes down a military base, even a useless pork-barrel military base, jobs are lost and businesses go bust as ripples spread through the local and regional economy. These consequences can be dramatic; every $1 billion cut in highway spending leads to a loss of 20,000 jobs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that eliminating the deficit over a five-to-ten-year period would slow growth by 0.5 percent per year, eliminating a half-million jobs in each year of deficit elimination. <p>But deficit hawks deny this. Government deficits divert investment from the private economy, they say. According to their scenario, balancing the budget will reduce interest rates, and the lower rates will lead to more investment in the private economy. This will stimulate the economy, increase productivity, and, in the long run, raise living standards and increase government revenues without raising taxes. Who knows, after 20 years we might get the Commerce Department back. <p>Nice theory, but how about some evidence? As economist Dean Baker of the Economic Policy Institute wrote in 1993, the data does not show a meaningful relationship between deficits, interest rates, and investment. A Washington University study appears to show that reducing interest rates by 200 basis points (half of the implied real interest rate of about 400 basis points on long-term government bonds) would increase investment by only $25 billion - a change of only 5 percent - in a $6 trillion economy.<p>Does all this mean we should just sit there and let budget deficits go on forever? Certainly not, but fixing the federal deficit is a little bit like Zen archery. "Don't think about the target," Zen masters tell novices. "Think about the arrow." To control the federal budget, we don't need to worry about artificial deficit targets, but we do need to think about the arrow - the spending that makes up the federal budget. If we spend our money wisely on programs that add to the national wealth and if we administer federal programs intelligently, then federal spending will benefit the country. The economy will grow, and revenues will rise. <p>The United States today doesn't have a deficit problem. It has a good-government problem. Panaceas like this amendment are based on despair about democracy. Its proponents point out that we vote for representatives who do things we don't like yet refuse to punish them at the polls. But if Americans can't elect representatives who will serve their interests, then tinkering with the Constitution won't save them.

The way David Blech does deals, he wins whether the company soars or craters.  Other investors aren't as lucky.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>Biotech investor David Blech is young, rich, and dissatisfied. It's not enough that he has an uncanny ability to take young biotech companies, fund them, and flip them to the investing public, bagging enormous profits for himself. Or that he has amassed, at 38, a fortune exceeding $200 million. Blech wants more. <p>Along with his bushels of bucks, Blech wants a higher profile--the kind that comes with building a big-league brokerage firm.<p>This is what people who know Blech surmise from the fact that he's taking his show--New York-based D. Blech & Co. --on the road. He's said to be doubling the size of his investment firm, to about 400 associates. He is opening brokerage offices in Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco and Boca Raton, Florida. Once a small venture-banking firm, D. Blech & Co. is fast becoming a full-service brokerage operation. <p>This expansion is worth noting: It increases the likelihood that, one day soon, you may be called by a Blech (pronounced "blek") broker pushing a high-risk deal your way. My advice: Hang up the phone. Although Blech has won big on his biotech investments, many of the investors who've bought into his deals have not. In fact, most of what Blech peddles is, well, dreck. <p>His companies sound exciting, with names like NeoRx Corp. and Ecogen Inc., and they're in the glamorous world of biotech. But, as is typical with biotech companies in the early stages, they're better at selling promises than products. Most have yet to earn a dime. Although their shares may have popped up in price after going public, they're now trading nearer the cellar than the sky.<p>Blech's methods of raising money may also have attracted the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to a Wall Street Journal story last fall, the SEC is looking into a controversial D. Blech practice of giving ultracheap "founders' stock" to brokers and financial consultants in exchange for their help in promoting a company's shares. The SEC would neither confirm nor deny the existence of a probe, as is its custom. D. Blech's public relations firm says the SEC inquiry was "informal."<p>But ultracheap stock is exactly what brought David Blech and his brother and former associate, Isaac, enormous riches since they began investing in biotech a dozen years ago. The brothers made their start in the early '80s with a $20,000 biotech bet in a company called Genetic Systems, which they later took public. David Blech was impressed by the huge profits investors reaped when Genentech went public and soared from $35 to $89 within its first hour of trading. So the two brothers decided to start their own biotech firm, even though neither knew much about science. In 1991, the brothers went their separate ways.<p>Getting in on the ground floor of a company usually entitles an investor to high returns if its products succeed. But the way Blech sets up his deals--investing in them, then underwriting their shares--he wins whether the company soars or craters. Blech's methods seem to be less venture capital, more shooting fish in a test tube.<p>For a man who's building an empire, David Blech is one shy dude. He refused to talk to Worth. But interviews with former associates of Blech's and with people who've dealt with him help bring him into focus. No one who has met Blech disputes that he's intelligent. But charming, no. One man who dealt with him paints him as "a whiny guy in a bad suit; he acts like a little kid." A former associate calls him "the ultimate opportunist." <p>If so, Blech must have smarted when he was dumped from Forbes magazine's list of the 400 richest Americans in 1993. The year earlier, he had made the list for the first time, with an estimated net worth of $295 million. <p>Blech's modus operandi goes something like this: Biotech companies, sometimes in search of capital, sometimes sniffed out by him, agree to his draconian investment terms in order to secure financing. He loans the company money in exchange for a controlling interest in the stock. He may also raise funds from other sophisticated investors in a private placement, for which he reaps large banking fees. Not long after this--two years, typically--Blech takes the company in which he invested public, earning big fees for underwriting the shares and bagging huge paper profits on his insider's stock. Shares Blech paid pennies for usually go to investors for $6 to $15 apiece in the offering. <p>An investor who met with Blech on a potential financing says, "His group is very aggressive. He was trying to buy us on the cheap, package us, and sell us out." This deal was never done.<p>Although all venture capitalists dream of taking their companies public at enormous profit, doing this within two years of the initial financing is in the best interests of neither the company, its science, nor its shareholders. So says Charles Hartman of C W Group, a prestigious medical venture-capital firm in New York; three to five years is more like it. "If you take a company public too early, management has to take its eye off the ball and watch things other than the science," he says.<p>But why fret about the success or failure of a company's science if you can wring millions in fees and paper profits flogging it to the public? <p>Consider D. Blech's most recent offering: Texas Biotechnology Corp., a Houston-based start-up developing products for cardiovascular diseases. Blech took the company public last December at $6.75, one of a half-dozen to be underwritten by the firm since it became a broker/dealer three years ago. The offering raised roughly $24 million. Three months later, the units remain at $6.75.<p>Texas Biotech has been in existence since 1989, but it had no product to sell until May 1993, when it was granted a sublicense to sell an anticoagulant called argatroban. Since 1989, the company has lost $14 million; revenues in the first three quarters of 1993 declined 32 percent from the year earlier while expenses more than doubled. The company's losses rose 122 percent last year. <p>The company has no marketing, manufacturing, or product-sales experience, and its prospectus says it "does not expect to market any products for several years, if ever." What Texas Biotech has: sublicense to sell argatroban, manufactured by Japan's Mitsubishi Kasei.<p>That's a mighty thin reed upon which to hang a $24 million offering. Yet investors bought into Texas Biotech, even though argatroban is in phase II clinical trials and behind the competition: Biogen and Ciba-Geigy have similar anticoagulants in phase III trials.<p>As investors were snapping up Texas Biotech shares, David Blech was counting up his profits. Between the fees earned on the private placement Blech did for the company in 1991 and on the 1993 IPO, consulting fees, and expenses, D. Blech & Co. made almost $5 million on its relationship with Texas Biotech. There may be more: Any financings, mergers, or acquisitions that Blech arranges for Texas Biotech down the road will earn the firm 2.5 percent of the deal in so-called success fees.<p>That's just what the firm made. The money Blech made personally is another matter. According to the prospectus, in April 1990, David and Isaac Blech bought 1 million shares of Texas Biotech for 3.5 cents each. In addition, the brothers reaped more than 100 percent in paper profits on a $1.85 million loan made to the company in 1990 that was turned into company shares. David also received warrants to purchase another 630,000 shares in Texas Biotech at $3.50 a share, a discount to current market value. At the time of the offering, Blech owned 602,000 shares outright and was the beneficiary of another 686,000 in trusts. All bought at discounted prices. <p>It's not hard to see how Blech has managed to pile up so much dough at such a young age. <p>Now that Blech is opening branches in cities nationwide, it's almost certain that more deals are coming. One Blech watcher says of his expansion, "He needs distribution for his junk."<p>Not just any distribution, mind you. Aggressive, hard-driving salesmen are preferred. So says a broker in Atlanta who has watched Blech hire one big-producing stockbroker after another at the firm's three-month-old office there. According to him, Blech is bestowing huge upfront money upon brokers who join the firm--such as a check for 60 percent of what the broker earned in commissions last year. This practice is much frowned upon by the securities industry, but when it was common, upfront payments never exceeded 20 to 30 percent of a broker's prior year's commissi.ons. Blech brokers also make sky-high net payouts of 50 percent of gross commissions. The industry average is between 30 and 40 percent.<p>What's wrong with Blech being generous to his salesmen? Brokers who are given rich incentives to trade are tempted to trade customers' accounts more frequently than they would otherwise. The risk of churning rises.<p>So if a Blech boy calls you extolling the riches in biotech, tell him you think Blech's got money enough. He doesn't need any of yours.

The political and religious rights want to claim Adam Smith as one of their own; they'd be appalled if they actually read his work<p>By Walter Mead<p>Everybody wanted to climb on the Adam Smith bandwagon in the 1980s. Supply-side crusaders draped themselves in the economist's mantle. Their theory was a "contemporary recasting of the original liberal doctrine expressed by Adam Smith," according to the New York Times. William F. Buckley's National Review counted Smith's posthumous vote for the entire thrust of the Reagan administration's first term, which "quite explicitly repackaged versions of Adam Smith." Too bad Smith wasn't alive to collect royalties from items such as the Adam Smith neckties affected by many presidential advisors.<p>But the effort to expropriate Smith, quite possibly the only economist other than Marx that most Americans can name, wasn't limited to the economic realm. Conservative religious leaders recruited Smith to march with them in favor of a return to what they characterized as traditional American family values. "I believe in free-enterprise capitalism. I believe in the wisdom of the market," Pat Robertson wrote in 1991. Eleven years earlier Jerry Falwell had said something similar: "No nation has survived long when its citizens were denied the free market and individual initiative."<p>By 1992 that party seemed to be over, and no one wanted to invite Smith into the new decade. As the reaction against the excesses of the 1980s gathered force, it looked as if Adam Smith would find himself banished to the back rooms and bad tables along with Michael Milken, Gordon Gekko, and the directors of failed savings and loans.<p>Too bad. The real Adam Smith was a much deeper and subtler thinker than most of his contemporary acolytes. His theories would have indeed shocked many of them--if they had ever bothered to read The Wealth of Nations. The "bubble economies" and the highflying mergers of the '80s would have seemed replays of the repellent speculative excesses of his own time. He would have regarded that decade's economic theories of rational expectations and perfect markets as deliberate misreadings of market history and human nature. And the attempt to legislate or otherwise impose absolute moral standards would have seemed to him, at best, doomed foolishness. Morality, after all, could never be the same for all social classes, he had written. The market simply wouldn't allow it.<p>Investors can still learn much from this Scottish economist who died in 1790. For example, Smith argued that capital markets weren't perfect. Investors were motivated too much by emotion and not enough by rational consideration. They were, in short, consistently too bullish. "The chance of gain is naturally overvalued," he told us, and proved his point with the examples of lotteries and military careers. Lotteries are by definition bad investments: Because of the profits collected by lottery operators and taxes imposed by the state, the lottery pool to be won is always less than the total invested in tickets. But people still buy lottery tickets because the hope of winning a huge jackpot outweighs more rational considerations.<p>A 1980s defender of perfect markets and rational expectations might try to explain away the purchase of lottery tickets by arguing that buyers don't have enough information about how bad the real return on their investment is. But Smith will have none of that. The behavior of the lottery players is the result of human nature, said Smith, not lack of information. Consider another kind of lottery, he urged. Military service is difficult, dangerous, and (especially in Smith's time) poorly paid, but recruiting offices are able to fill out the ranks. Why? Young men dream that they will win the military "lottery," though the chances of fame and glory do not in reality justify the risks of death and dismemberment.<p>This psychological point has important ramifications for Smith--and contemporary investors. Because investors tend to be too bullish, it means that risky or speculative ventures tend to be overvalued compared with conservative ones. Rewards, he tells us, do not rise commensurate with increasing risks.<p>But Adam Smith was more than an economist. His greatest book, "The Wealth of Nations," belongs to a long-lost genre called, in Smith's day, political economy. Smith was one of the most profound social critics in western history. Coming from a country and a time when armed religious upheaval was a constant danger, he was particularly sensitive to the relationship between economics and religion. "The Wealth of Nations," in fact, directly addresses one of the most divisive questions of Smith's time--and ours. Do an individual and a country have to be good to become wealthy? Or are morality and economics entirely unrelated subjects?<p>Smith was one of the first thinkers to question the assumed connection between western religion and western economics. Religious tradition, in Smith's time and ours, tells us why nations rise and fall: Those nations and peoples who observe God's laws prosper; those who sin suffer the consequences.<p>In practice the story was a little more complicated than that. God sometimes tests those he loves. Ask Job. But history--including economic history--was best understood as the direct result of the acts of a personal and vigilant God. This was the view of the Pilgrims. They believed that God had called them to create a new and holy society in America, a city on the hill, and that he would bless America when it obeyed his laws and punish it when it was deserved. As Jerry Falwell once said, "Material wealth is God's way of blessing people who put him first."<p>That's not what Adam Smith thought. Human societies do not work because people are good, but because they are selfish. "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker," he wrote, "that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest." Prosperity is not the result of self-restraint or morality. "It is the necessary, though very slow and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human nature, the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another," according to Smith.<p>If religious fundamentalists such as Falwell really understood Adam Smith, they would hate his economic theories even more violently than they hate Darwin's theory of evolution. Darwin merely evicts God from the primeval slime, substituting the impersonal mechanics of survival of the fittest for God's direct creation. Smith's ideas are much more subversive: They take God out of history and make the rise and fall of nations depend on impersonal and amoral activities like trade.<p>Reading Adam Smith makes us face something that most Americans prefer not to think about: the contradictions between two sets of ideas that inform American society. We want the Judeo-Christian theological tradition as interpreted by the Pilgrims and their heirs and the economic ideas of Adam Smith to be complementary. In fact, they are often diametrically opposed.<p>People operating out of our religious heritage tell us that our society must be good before it can be rich. Liberal religious leaders tell us that this means we must feed the poor and provide universal medical care if our society is to enjoy God's blessing.  Conservative preachers agree, but they emphasize the need to devote our moral attention to transgressions of private morality.  Despite their differences, "theological economists" of all stripes believe that America must purify itself in a moral sense in order to enjoy continued prosperity.<p>Secular economists disagree on which technical remedies are needed, but they all agree that the measures we need are better policies, not better morals. Going to church won't make the economy grow; budget reform will.<p>Adam Smith came down firmly on the secular side of this controversy. His suspicion of the well-intentioned interventions of muddle-headed economic reformers is well-known; he thought that markets can distribute goods more fairly and effectively than do-gooders. But Smith has little respect for conservative meddlers either. Defend traditional moral values? Fight secular humanism? No need to bother, Smith believed.<p>Morality, Smith provokingly wrote, is a creation of the market. Every society has two schools of morality: "One may be called the strict or austere; the other the liberal or, if you will, the loose system." The strict school "is generally admired and revered by the common people." On the other hand, the cultural elite--in Smith's words, "people of fashion"--follow the loose system. Murphy Brown, meet Dan Quayle.<p>But Adam Smith parted company with the Puritans of his time and ours. He didn't think that the difference between the two moralities was a question of right and wrong; rather the two schools were suited to the needs of different people. For the poor, the strict school was an economic necessity. "A single week's thoughtlessness and dissipation is often sufficient to undo a poor workman for ever," Smith reminded his reader, and "the wiser and better sort of the common people, therefore, have always the utmost abhorrence and detestation of such excesses, which their experience tells them are so immediately fatal to people of their condition."<p>Among the affluent, a different set of conditions leads to a different set of morals. The cost of transgression is not so high, and so sin is winked at. There is more emphasis on individual expression, less on abstract moral codes. The members of the cultural elite "are very apt to consider the power of indulging in some degree of excess as one of the advantages of their fortune, and the liberty of doing so without censure or reproach, as one of the privileges which belong to their station."<p>Adam Smith never imagined the kind of mass affluence that we have seen in the United States since World War II, but it seems likely that he would have regarded the general loosening of moral standards since 1945 as the natural and altogether predictable consequence of the improvement in the national standard of living. And it also seems likely that Smith would have seen signs that the pendulum is swinging back in some respects to a stricter moral standard as a consequence of the more recent decline in living standards.<p>Smith wouldn't have been very worked up over either of these rebalancings of the moral scales. Nor would he have seen them as cause for a wave of religious revivalism. Smith, in general, was more worried about too much religion than too little. He thought that the population at large was too liable to manipulation by unscrupulous and ambitious religious leaders. One of the few areas of government intervention he supported was public subsidies for the production of plays and public entertainment that mocked the tactics and absurdities of popular preachers.<p>But Smith didn't worry too much about religious fanaticism in a pluralistic society--a religious free market, so to speak--like the United States. He pointed to the experience of Philadelphia--at the time, the only place in the British Empire that allowed full freedom of religion to all Christian denominations--and prophesied that the competition among religious would lead to something that would look more like liberal Unitarianism--which wags define as the belief that there is, at most, one God--than any of the fire and brimstone religions of Smith's time.<p>What does all this have to do with our own day? The contemporary antiabortion movement is a conspicuous example of Smith's theories at work. Conservative Protestant fundamentalists and Catholics have a long tradition of mutual dislike and suspicion, but the common political struggle against abortion has brought millions of American fundamentalists and Catholics together. Working in alliance for a common, secular purpose, they have come to respect the sincerity of one another's convictions. Although the antiabortion movement challenges an aspect of the American secular consensus, it also strengthens a basic tenet of American secular society: that the political goals we share in common are more important than the religious beliefs that divide us.<p>Perhaps the most telling sign of the "creeping secularization" of the religious right is its embrace of Adam Smith's economics. When Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson adopt the basic tenets of secular humanism--that impersonal forces rather than continual divine intervention determine the wealth of nations--then American fundamentalism has lost its ability to challenge one part of the secular market culture. The end of the 1980s didn't make Smith obsolete; 218 years after he wrote it, "The Wealth of Nations" can still compete.

Figure to earn 15 percent to 20 percent on your money forever? Then you're an investment victim waiting to happen.<p>By Gerald Perritt<p>Lulled into complacency by more than a decade of exceptional returns in stocks and bonds, many investors seeking future riches have built castles in the air. Stock market gains of 15 percent to 20 percent a year have now become expected. High investment earnings have become today's sure thing. <p>Hate to spoil the party, but you know what they say about sure things. Let the others celebrate their rip-roaring returns. Smart investors--those with a sense of history about the markets--will take this time to do a reality check.<p>The facts: Over the past 12 years, returns in stocks, bonds, even Treasury bills have been anything but normal. Blue-chip stocks have returned an average of more than 16 percent per year since this great bull market took off in late 1982. Bond investors have earned double-digit returns during these years as well. Long-term government bonds, for example, have gained an average just shy of 15 percent per year since late 1982. Even the most conservative investors who parked their capital in Treasury bills got rich during the period. Treasury bills returned an average 7 percent annually, handily beating the inflation rate.<p>The fiction: Such rates will continue. <p>Investors have grown accustomed to these extraordinary rates. That's natural. But to count on them continuing is to court big trouble. Whenever investment returns stray above or below their long-run averages for a prolonged period, they tend to reverse for an extended period as well. Therefore, it's exceedingly likely that both blue-chip stocks and long-term bonds will provide returns far below their long-run averages for the remainder of the decade. <p>There are a couple of exceptions to this admittedly gloomy outlook. Small-cap stocks, for example, which underperformed for most of the 1980s, will likely be overachievers. The same is probably true of gold and silver. However, these are guesses, not sure bets. The bottom line is, no one should expect to keep earning the high figures that a broad spectrum of financial assets have provided during the last decade or so. And don't believe anyone who says otherwise.<p>Hordes of people out there are, of course, eager to tell you otherwise. And why not take advantage of investors with unreasonable expectations? Securities regulators say that investors are much more likely to be defrauded by financial scamsters in roaring markets than in dismal ones. <p>Whose mailbox hasn't been crammed with letters sent by investment gurus promising fabulous wealth? Lately, the tone of these pitches has become mighty shrill. The quieter ones promise "safe" returns of 15 to 20 percent per year. Others go further. William M. Seay, editor of The Dynamic Investor, claims that his "system" produces returns of 30 percent or more. The Cabot Market Letter exceeds even that outrageous number: Its stock-picking method can "turn $5,000 into $20,000, even $50,000 or more." That last figure would be a 900 percent gain. <p>These returns are being touted for a reason. Direct-mail experts say that customers are unlikely to respond to marketing campaigns unless promised annual gains of 20 percent or more. <p>This hasn't been that hard to do recently. So some of these folks' claims are probably accurate. After all, the S&P 500 index has returned an average of 16.7 percent since 1985. During the past five years, 84 mutual funds have posted gains of 20 percent and higher. That's about 1 out of every 20 funds that have been around that long.<p>But numbers like these are anything but easy to achieve in the long run. Check out the table below, which lists historical returns and risks of a variety of investments going back to 1945. One thing that's immediately apparent: No category of investment has returned an average of 20 percent annually during that period. Emerging-market stocks, the top-performing asset category, returned an average of 16 percent per year. But, mark this: The asset categories that produced the higher returns carried the highest risks. Finally, note that Treasury bills, the lowest-risk asset category, have barely produced any meaningful return at all; after adjusting for inflation, T-bill rates fall to a meager 0.3 percent annually.<p>Remember, too, that these returns are higher than what we mortals can achieve, even if we pick the right investments. That's because the returns found in the table have come out of hypothetical portfolios and thus have not been adjusted for either transaction costs or income taxes. When you adjust for both of those items, returns are reduced. <p>Consider the portfolio of large-capitalization, blue-chip stocks represented by the S&P 500 index. If you are an active trader and turn over your portfolio once a year, paying 1 percent in brokerage commissions to buy and another 1 percent to sell, your true annual return falls from 11.7 percent to 9.7 percent. Apply a 28 percent tax rate to these profits, and your net gain falls to 7 percent a year. Deduct the annual rate of inflation and you get a 2.5 percent real return. At this rate, it would take 187 years for a $10,000 investment to grow to $1 million. Doesn't sound much like the promises you see in mutual fund advertisements today, does it?<p>History and financial theory will tell you that anyone promising a safe but high--say, 30 percent--average annual return is lying. If you want to believe in such fibs, you are an investment victim waiting to happen. Of the 150 investment newsletters tracked by Mark Hulbert, editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, the top performer, Value Line Investment Survey's portfolio of number-one--ranked stocks, has returned 18.5 percent annually during the 13 years that Hulbert has been ranking newsletters. Take a hint from history: If high-risk equities return an average of 16 percent per year, the only way you're going to earn more is to assume even greater risks. And if you do, you are upping the odds that your hard-earned bankroll will disappear. <p>With all the hype and hoopla that has accompanied the bull market in stocks and bonds, there is no doubt that many investors are at this moment being led, like lemmings, into some very risky portfolios. This is particularly true now that declining interest rates have driven many savers out of bank CDs and money market funds and into dicier venues like bond and stock funds. <p>Take the numbers in this table to heart. Don't allow yourself to be victimized by investment gurus preying on your too-great expectations. Set real and reachable hopes for your portfolio's returns based on historical averages. Then, adjust the hypothetical returns to reflect transaction costs, taxes, and inflation. If you plan properly for the lower rates of return that are almost certainly ahead, you may, ironically enough, wind up with more money in your pocket. <p>Gerald Perritt is a money manager in Chicago and the publisher of The Mutual Fund Letter and Investment Horizons.<p><p>

How's this for unfair? Foreign investors can buy shares in U.S. companies at steep discounts to what American pay.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>American investors pride themselves on having the fairest financial markets around. And for the most part, this is true. U.S. accounting rules and relatively stringent financial-disclosure regulations set up and monitored by the Securities and Exchange Commission make ours among the most level of investment playing fields in the world. <p>But there are exceptions to this general rule of fair play. One of the most troubling: A little-known but increasingly popular practice by U.S. companies selling shares to overseas investors at significantly lower prices than what American investors pay. That's right--foreigners get to buy U.S. shares at 30 percent to 40 percent below what domestic investors are currently paying. Worst of all, few American investors know this is occurring. <p>How could such a practice be permitted to exist? SEC rules governing companies' sales of shares to foreigners--known as Regulation S--are much less rigorous than the laws that apply stateside. When a company sells shares to foreigners, the SEC largely stays out of it.<p>But this doesn't mean that U.S. investors should be blissfully ignorant of overseas stock transactions. Although they're not supposed to affect investors here, they do. And their effects are not always positive. <p>Offshore transactions--the direct selling of shares to overseas buyers--are popular among U.S. companies for several reasons. The deals enable firms to raise money for their operations more quickly and cheaply than they could if they were floating an issue at home. When a company issues so-called Reg. S debt or equity, it deals directly with the buyer; this obviates the need to register the shares and reduces selling costs--such as stockbrokers' fees--associated with public offerings. <p>Such deals are definitely rising in popularity among foreign investors as well. Exact numbers of Reg. S deals and dollars raised through them are unknown because there is no centralized record-keeping on the offerings at the SEC as there is, for example, on transactions made by corporate insiders. But it's safe to say that hundreds of millions of dollars have been raised through these offerings recently. Buyers of discounted shares include private banks in Germany, Switzerland, France, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands. One investor watching the flood of Reg. S deals says, "It's what all the overseas money managers are talking about." <p>The key motivation behind offshore buyers' interest in Reg. S offerings is--surprise--astronomical profits. Investors in the deals brag of doubling their money quarterly. <p>How do they do it? By shooting fish in a barrel--buying shares in companies at deep discounts to their publicly traded prices back in the U.S. Even a baboon could double its money if it could buy shares in an American company at $7.50 while the same firm's shares were trading at $11.50 at home. All it would have to do is sell its stock in the U.S. at the higher price. <p>There is one small hitch, however. A Reg. S buyer is not supposed to sell his holding right away. According to the rule, foreign buyers of both debt and equities are supposed to hold their securities for at least 40 days or, in some cases, a year before they can bail out. The risk to the buyer, therefore, is that his holding will fall--in U.S. trading--below his discounted cost before he is able to get out. <p>This is not an insubstantial risk. But according to money managers familiar with overseas transactions, it is easily gotten around. These folks say that Reg. S lockup rules are often ignored by foreign investors. Instead, the discounted shares migrate back home and are sold to unsuspecting U.S. investors in the open market as if they were normal shares. Foreigners bag the profits. <p>Few investors are aware of the Reg. S game and the extent to which it is being played today. Those who are aware of it find themselves at an extreme disadvantage to offshore players. As one outraged fund manager puts it, "The practice has become so abusive. U.S. investors have no clue that they're being sold shares at big premiums" to other investors. <p>Indeed, why should foreigners get special deals on the same stocks or bonds that Americans pay more for? The notion of granting discounts to some investors and not others is in direct conflict with the fine American concept of the level investment field. Yes, overseas investors who comply with the regulations cannot sell their holdings until the agreed-upon time period is over. But Americans who buy equity private placements typically must wait two years before they can sell, twice the maximum that applies to foreigners under Reg. S. <p>Another concern is how clearly or unclearly the deals are disclosed to existing shareholders. At best, these offerings are difficult to track; investors must slog through annual and quarterly financial statements to find out whether a company they own shares in is raising money through discounted deals. Some companies are quite specific about the discounts granted to overseas buyers of the stock; others provide no details of the prices paid. <p>But even the most diligent document hound will learn about discounted offerings only after the fact. By the time the details of a Reg. S deal show up in your company's 10K, it's history.<p>Very often, Reg. S deals are evidence of a company's weakening financial state. Healthy companies rarely mark down their stock's price in order to attract investors. Yet, because the reporting of Regulation S deals often comes well after they've taken place, concerned shareholders may learn about them only after their shares have started to fall. One reason the stocks may drop? Each time a company floats new shares--whether domestic or foreign--it diminishes the earnings power of the stock held by existing investors. <p>All this spells trouble for shareholders whose companies are raising money in these types of overseas transactions. Consider, for example, <a name="AMEX:IDC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16851"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Interdigital Communications</b></a>, a maker of digital wireless-communications equipment. Though Interdigital has lost more than $135 million in the past five years, the company was able to raise more than $12 million overseas during 1992 and early 1993. Foreigners paid roughly 40 percent less than U.S. investors did for their Interdigital shares. <p>In the third quarter of last year, Interdigital raised another $4.5 million in Reg. S money. Company financials stated that buyers paid around $4.50 per share; U.S. investors, at the time, were paying roughly $9 for their shares. <p>This may have helped Interdigital's balance sheet, but it did little for company shareholders. Since 1992, the stock has sunk from around $11 to a recent $5. American investors have seen their holdings diminish, but overseas buyers, if they're still holding on, are ahead. Not by much, but ahead nonetheless.<p>Another user of private-placement funding is Belmac Corp., a pharmaceuticals concern based in Tampa, Florida. Although the company has lost some $40 million since 1988, it raised almost $25 million in foreign money in 1991 and early 1992. In late '92, Belmac raised another $4 million privately, with foreign investors paying an average $4.80 per share. U.S. investors buying stock at the same time weren't so lucky; they paid between $5.13 and $13.50 per. Belmac's shares outstanding grew by almost half--from 13 million to 19.3 million. Its stock has since plunged to around $2. <p>The effects of Regulation S deals might not be as deleterious to American investors if the discounted shares remained on foreign soil as they should. That many of these shares come back to the U.S. before they are supposed to is not surprising. This is a huge and unregulated arena. The SEC is overworked supervising domestic markets. It can hardly be expected to monitor the activities of foreign investors as well. Still, the commission is aware of the potential for abuse in Reg. S and says it is watchful for companies breaking the rule. <p>Setting up a central system to track Reg. S deals would help investors, if only to shed light on the practice. In the meantime, investors must do their homework. Read all your companies' quarterly and annual financial statements. Pay attention to discussions of financing activities. If the company is selling discounted shares overseas, think about selling yours here at home. <p>The ease with which overseas investors can circumvent SEC rules should serve as a reminder that global markets can be treacherous. Don't assume that because U.S. markets are scrutinized by regulators, other markets are as well. The world of international investing is a wild and woolly place. And until one uniform regulatory outfit is set up to oversee worldwide trading, wild and woolly it will remain.<p>Gretchen Morgenson is the executive editor of Worth.<p><p>

If the government were run like a business, taxpayers would worry about profits, not spending<p>By Walter Mead<p>Deficit hawks have short memories. thirteen years ago, Jimmy Carter was president and the annual deficit was about to hit a mind-numbing $74 billion. The federal budget was out of control, the deficit hawks exclaimed. Inflation was at 12.5 percent per year; interest rates were spiraling into the stratosphere. The horrifying national debt of $908 billion, equivalent to 33 percent of the size of the U.S. economy, hung over the nation like a dark cloud. The sky was falling, said fiscal conservatives, as Ronald Reagan swept into office with a pledge to balance the budget by 1984.<p>Fat chance. Among them, Reagan, Bush, and Congress managed to quadruple the national debt that they had called a crushing burden in 1980, running up deficits that poor, timid Jimmy Carter never dreamed of.<p>Still, the sky didn't fall. Huge government budget deficits are supposed to be bad because they cause inflation, jack up interest rates, and crowd private borrowers out of the capital markets. How odd, then, that none of this happened. Inflation slowed during the Reagan-Bush deficit years--from 12.5 percent in 1980 to 3.2 percent in the 12 months ending in May 1993. Interest rates dropped. The rate that the Federal Reserve charges banks for overnight borrowing fell from 16.4 percent in 1981 to roughly 3 percent today. Private borrowers were not crowded out. Instead, they flocked to the markets during the government's borrowing orgy. Nothing that the deficit hawks predicted came to pass; perversely, this only strengthened their faith in their creed.<p>Now we are in the midst of a new deficit panic. Egged on by Chief Chicken Little Ross Perot, Washington politicians are once more predicting that if the deficit isn't "brought under control," inflation will rise, interest rates will go up, and private borrowers will be crowded out of the credit markets.<p>Wrong, wrong, wrong. The prophets of doom have been warning that deficits would ruin the nation since the British Whigs invented the modern national debt in 1693. They have been wrong for 300 years, and they are still wrong today.<p>One hundred and forty years ago the great British historian Lord Macaulay looked at the long record of predictions that the debt would be ruinous. For 150 years, he noted, panicked members of Parliament and British economists had warned that the debt was leading to ruin. "At every stage in the growth of that debt," he wrote, "the nation has set up the same cry of anguish and despair. At every stage in the growth of that debt, it has been seriously asserted by wise men that bankruptcy and ruin were at hand. Yet still the debt went on growing, and still bankruptcy and ruin were as remote as ever."<p>Predicting deficit disaster has almost as long a history in the United States--and approximately the same track record. In 1791 Thomas Jefferson believed that the national debt of $75 million would destroy American democracy. When the Civil War drove the national debt up to the horrendous and mind-boggling $2.7 billion mark (or about 40 percent of the gross national product), President Andrew Johnson wrung his hands in despair. How ironic it was, he mourned, that the nation had fought a war to free the Southern slaves only to turn all the American people into the debt slaves of federal creditors. This generation of debt peons, of course, built the transcontinental railroads and turned the United States into the greatest industrial power in the world.<p>The cries of doom grew louder when World War I sent the debt to $24 billion, more than 300 times the debt that Thomas Jefferson thought would wreck us forever. Instead of ruin and bankruptcy we got the Roaring Twenties. Then came the Depression, and the Second World War. The national debt soared--$258 billion, almost $1,800 per person, and a whopping 122 percent of gross national product. But disappointingly, ruin failed to arrive. Instead, once again, the increase in national debt set off a new boom, and the United States, crushed by astronomical, unheard-of, criminal levels of debt, staggered off to the most prosperous era in the history of the world.<p>The present panic over the American budget deficit is like all the other debt hysterias over the last ten generations--long on scare talk, short on understanding. We all know the arguments: $4.4 trillion in national debt means that every American owes about $17,000. The interest alone will drive us into the poorhouse, the deficit hawks say. The redistribution of income from wage earners to bondholders will ruin democracy and undermine the middle class. Federal borrowing will crowd out private borrowers from the capital markets and block the investments needed to raise productivity and living standards in the future. No sacrifice can be too great to get rid of the national debt.<p>These arguments, all hundreds of years old, look superficially convincing, but much to the surprise and frustration of generations of Chicken Littles, the damned sky still hangs there. Why? What is it that deficit hawks miss from one decade to the next? Why have so many smart people been so stupid for so long about the national debt?<p>There seem to be two major problems, one arithmetic, one conceptual. Sophisticated deficit hawks don't worry about the absolute level of the national debt. Instead, they study the relationship of the national debt to gross domestic product, the most common measure of the size of the national economy. That makes intuitive sense. Every home buyer knows that the larger a family's income, the larger the mortgage it can afford. This kind of calculation also establishes a baseline for what would be a "prudent" national debt. Assuming 3 percent real annual economic growth over the long haul, the national debt could grow 3 percent a year and still remain a constant percentage of the gross domestic product. Given a national debt of $4.4 trillion, an annual budget deficit of $132 billion would be reasonable; at that level national debt is not growing faster than national income.<p>Most deficit hawks go this far in their reasoning. They've learned something from 300 years of failed predictions. But they forget to factor in inflation. Inflation erodes the value of existing debt by allowing it to be repaid in devalued dollars. Assuming the same long-term average inflation rate of 3 percent per year, the power of inflation means the country can handle another $132 billion or so of annual deficit without any trouble at all. An annual budget deficit of $264 billion would not therefore represent any real deterioration in the fiscal position of the United States government.<p>And thanks to compounding, this "reasonable" annual budget deficit grows every year. In ten years' time an annual deficit of $500 billion would represent the same percentage of the national economy. So would $1 trillion by 2013.<p>So much for the arithmetic side of the argument, but the deficit hawks have an even bigger conceptual problem. They misunderstand the nature of debt.<p>Deficit hawks claim to use hard-nosed business criteria in evaluating federal finances, but this is the last thing they do in practice. No business and no family would ever try to evaluate its financial position by looking only at its debt. But when was the last time Ross Perot talked about the assets of the United States government or--the real bottom line--its net worth?<p>This is the critical factor. <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> owes more money than Joe's Pizzeria, and William Gates probably owes more money than Joe, but given the choice we would all rather own Microsoft and claim Gates's fortune. When we value companies, we don't just look at their debts. We look at the whole picture--assets minus debts--to arrive at a net worth. To truly understand the finances of the federal government, we need to do the same thing.<p>So what is the net worth of the federal government? Unfortunately--and this speaks volumes about the poor quality of our national leadership and the impoverished state of our policy debates--there are no really good numbers available to value the assets of the federal government.<p>The numbers that do exist, however, should give the deficit hawks pause. Each year the Commerce Department estimates the value of the federal government's fixed capital--the military and civilian equipment and structures that the government owns. Subtracting depreciation, and using conservative valuations, in 1992 these assets were worth $1.57 trillion--up from $885 billion in 1980. <p>That isn't the end of the government's assets, either. Estimates of the value of the public lands and the mineral rights associated with them are hard to find, but the best recent figures seem to be those collected by economist Michael Boskin and others in 1981. At that time, Boskin estimated a total value of $992 billion for the government's land and mineral rights. Assuming that the price of these assets simply kept pace with inflation in subsequent years, they are now worth approximately $1.5 trillion. This gives the United States government assets of $3 trillion.<p>These are conservative estimates. The Commerce Department, for example, does not account for revenues that the government's assets bring in. On the kind of valuations used to measure the worth of private companies (multiples of revenues, for example), assets like the U.S. Postal Service would contribute significantly to the net worth of the government. Additionally, the government has a future income stream from taxation--a cash flow--that in private hands would be a significant asset. A very rough estimate of the assets of the government would be closer to $3.8 trillion.<p>In contrast, the total debt of the United States is about $4.4 trillion or about 70 percent of gross domestic product, and $1 trillion of this is owed by the government to itself for things like borrowing from the Social Security trust fund. From an accounting standpoint, this $1 trillion disappears. The result is that the United States has assets of $3.8 trillion and debts of $3.4 trillion for a small positive net worth of $400 billion. The debt hawks, therefore, are dead wrong. Every American child is not born owing $17,000; that child has a tiny silver spoon--a $1,600 trust fund.<p>The positive net worth of the government helps explain why recent deficits have not been disastrous. Assuming that the roughly $3.8 trillion of federal assets appreciates in proportion with the economy (2.5 percent annually) and 2.5 percent inflation, then federal assets appreciated by $190 billion in 1992-93. Thus a nominal budget deficit of $290 billion is partially offset by $190 billion in increases to assets. The real offset is actually somewhat larger, since some of each year's federal spending goes to build new assets or to repair old ones. The net result is that an apparently dangerous budget deficit of $290 billion is actually a deficit of only $100 billion--and as we have seen, a deficit of that magnitude poses no danger whatever to the long-term financial position of the federal government.<p>This isn't to say that everything is rosy and that we can all relax about the federal government's way. Clearly the government is wasting money on useless subsidies, inefficient operations, and pork barrel projects. In these areas it is not getting a positive return on the money it spends. At the same time it is neglecting important investments that could raise the net worth of the government and improve the economic performance of the private economy.<p>Unfortunately, with our current system of government accounting, taxpayers, the people who foot the bills now and in the future, can't tell how well the government is spending their money. We ought to be able to look at the national balance sheet every year and see whether the net worth of the government is increasing or not. We ought to concentrate spending on investments and policies that could enhance that net worth and focus budget cuts on programs that lower our overall rate of return. The results will sometimes be surprising. Raising user fees for federal lands, for example, would not only increase the income of the government; it would also raise the capital value of the range lands.<p>A Congress and a White House competing to raise the net worth of the government through rational management and prudent expenditure would not only increase the net worth of the country, they would probably also reduce the fiscal deficit as expenditures were redirected away from wasteful subsidies to thoughtful and productive investments. Make net worth, not the budget deficit, the centerpiece in the debate over federal finances. <p>And while we're developing the accounting system that makes it possible to calculate net worth, let's not lose our heads. Remember Lord Macaulay. National debt is 300 years old, and the sky hasn't fallen yet. On present trends, it's going to hang there forever.<p>Walter Mead is a senior counselor at the World Policy Institute at the New School in New York City.<p><p><p>

Colorado securities head Phil Feigin goes to Washington in '94 as  a top state regulator. How good a cop will he be?<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>The state of Colorado may be bliss to skiers; to investors, it's anything but. Of all the states in the union, Colorado is one of just seven that has no laws on its books governing the licensing and practices of investment advisors. Not surprisingly, it has been home to more than its share of financial fraudsters, scammers and bucket-shop brokerages. Blinder Robinson--the penny-stock outfit better known as "Blind 'em and Rob 'em"--hailed from Denver, as did commodities scammer James Donahue, who cost investors $135 million in a late 1980s pyramid scheme that proved to be one of the 25 largest securities frauds in the nation. Just last August, a financial planner by the name of Randy Romero was indicted on 23 counts of fraud, charged with falsely representing and selling interests in various risky investments to Denver-area investors. Romero left town last year but was nabbed in Albuquerque in September. <p>You might think that stories like these would embolden Colorado regulators and legislators to collaborate on some tough investment- advisor laws. You'd be wrong. In fact, Philip A. Feigin, the 44-year-old securities commissioner for the state of Colorado, blew a splendid opportunity earlier this year to beef up his state's financial-planning law. Rather than back a piece of very simple pro-consumer financial-advisor legislation that had already passed Colorado's House of Representatives, Feigin joined a handful of financial-industry heavies in stopping the bill in its tracks last session. They will likely oppose it once again in early 1994. In its place, Feigin floated a bill with little bark and less bite, claiming that the enforcement mechanism proposed by the earlier bill was inadequate.<p>Why should anyone outside of Colorado care? Because next year, Feigin is taking his act on the road--to Washington. He has just been elected president, for a term beginning in September, of the North American Securities Administrators Association, a group consisting of state regulators from all 50 states, Mexico, and Canada. For years, NASAA has been the most aggressive pro-investor regulator out there. The question is, given Feigin's recent activities in Colorado on the financial-advisor legislation, will NASAA's tough pro-investor attitude go soft once he takes the helm? <p>Feigin, who has been commissioner of Colorado's Securities Division since September 1988, says he'll work hard for the consumer as head of NASAA. He is especially proud of his work with state legislators that reformed Colorado securities laws in 1990. Those laws helped rid Colorado of a freewheeling atmosphere that allowed exotic securities, penny stocks, and bogus commodity scams to proliferate within the state. As Feigin says, the laws passed in 1990 "brought us back from the brink of financial anarchy."<p>Now, on the equally important issue of creating some meaningful financial-advisor laws for Colorado citizens, Feigin's aggressive stance appears to have softened. He seems to have been convinced by some very powerful financial-services-firm leaders and lobbyists.<p>Here's the story. In an attempt to write some long-overdue investor-protection legislation for Colorado, Representative Doug Friednash sponsored a bill last spring calling for full disclosure of all fees paid by clients to financial advisors. The Friednash bill was simplicity itself; all it required was that any compensation an advisor might earn dispensing investment advice--fees, commissions, tie-ins, referral payments, etc.--be detailed and delivered, in writing, to clients before they received advisory services. Also required: The disclosure of conflicts of interest that might exist between advisor and client. No more hidden insurance commissions and obscured trips to Hawaii won by planners pushing high-fee products. <p>"I figured if we were going to start out with legislation in Colorado, let's do it right," says Friednash. Indeed, had the bill passed, Colorado would have been at the forefront of pro-investor legislation with a truth-in-financial-planning model for other states. <p>Colorado's House passed Friednash's bill almost unanimously last May--the vote was 59 to 3. It then got killed in the Senate, a victim of quickly organized opposition from the financial-services industry. <p>Friednash set out to resurrect his bill and canvassed for help in the Senate during the summer months. Representatives from financial-industry groups, meanwhile, held quiet meetings to craft their own bill, led, surprisingly enough, by Commissioner Feigin. Dominating the meetings: The Investment Company Institute, the Securities Industry Association, Atlanta's International Association for Financial Planning, and Denver's International Board of Standards and Practices for Certified Financial Planners. Only one of the 15 attendees represented the consumer--Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America. <p>What big legislative idea did Feigin come up with to protect Colorado investors from errant financial advisors? A fairly toothless bill that requires an advisor only to divulge the nature of his remuneration, not the amount. The existence of conflicts of interest, tie-ins, or other payoffs isn't included. And if the advisor fails to meet these lax disclosure requirements?He or she gets a slap on the wrist:$1,000 in fines. <p>Missing from Feigin's bill, but very much a possibility down the road if it passes, is a plan to set up an industry-run self-regulatory organization, or SRO, much like the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees the NASDAQ stock market. In the industry group meetings that were held, Feigin floated the idea of an SRO to oversee advisors in Colorado. <p>SROs, not surprisingly, have many fans among the industries they are supposed to be regulating. They have far fewer fans among consumer groups and more aggressive regulators. "Self-regulation is not an effective form of investor protection," says Roper of the Consumer Federation. "In the securities industry, it has been a spectacular failure."<p>James Schwartz, an Englewood, Colorado, fee-only planner who helped Friednash write his bill, agrees:"Setting up an SRO is like asking Dracula to guard the blood bank." <p>One of the groups likely to run Colorado's SRO, should it come to pass is the InternationalBoard of Standards and Practices for Certified Financial Planners, a Denver organization that licenses and oversees the practices of planners who have passed the requirements to become certified financial planners. But Roper believes the IBCFP is woefully ill-equipped to police Colorado's financial advisors. Roper says: "When the IBCFPrecently came up with its own standards of ethics, it failed on two key points--fiduciary duty and compensation. They showed no leadership. In no way did they move to clean up industry standards." <p>Although Roper supports Feigin's bill as a step in the right direction, on the issue of disclosure, Friednash's bill is far preferable, she says, "It gives people the information they need at the time they need it, which helps them make an informed investment decision." It also works well within Colorado's stringent Amendment One rule, stating that no laws can be passed that increase government spending or revenue-raising in excess of the state's real growth rate. Friednash's bill is no-cost largely because it requires no oversight staff to be created. Rather, it gives investors the right to sue an investment practitioner if he or she does not meet disclosure requirements. For repeat offenders, there's the additional threat of treble damages.<p>Feigin says he is against Friednash's bill in part because civil remedies aren't enough to deter the white-collar criminals who perpetrate financial fraud. "We need a lot more than just giving somebody an ability to sue," he says. Friednash disagrees:"We believe the threat of a lawsuit is more effective than a regulatory scheme. Let's put the onus on the financial advisor."<p>Fee-only planner Schwartz says, "All we're talking about here is information. And letting the free market work." But with big industry guns behind Feigin's less stringent bill, Roper and others fear Friednash's efforts are doomed. "This is a pretty serious group," admits Friednash. "They can throw a lot of money at this thing."<p>Ironically, NASAA, the organizationFeigin will soon be running, wants more disclosure, not less, of financial-advisor fees. Furthermore, NASAAhas always believed that self-regulatory organizations are not terrifically effective at regulating the securities industry. Maureen Thompson, spokesperson for NASAA,says:"Our priority is to look out for the small investor.We focus on those people that are the backbone of our country but that can get lost here in Washington." State regulators have rightly felt that there was too much emphasis on the self and too little on the regulatory in the typical SRO. <p>NASAA's pro-investor focus has helped investors mightily over the years. For example, it initiated the collection of detailed information on stockbrokers' histories, which it supplies to investors free of charge. This data can reveal run-ins with regulators and legal proceedings brought by disgruntled investors, information the National Association of Securities Dealers was not in favor of releasing. But NASAAforced the issue and made sure the documentation is available to investors everywhere.<p>If Feigin's recent activities in Colorado are any indication, NASAA could change under his rule. His early opposition to Friednash's bill, calling for detailed disclosure of fees and commissions, is a U-turn on the road NASAAgenerally takes. So is his advocacy of an SRO. Thompson says:"We think better disclosure to consumers is very important. Disclosure of fees--what they're making and who these people are, knowing what's possibly motivating them [advisors]--is critical." <p>If PhilFeigin's bill passes into law early next year, as president of NASAAhe could take his minimalist financial-advisor concept national and advocate its use in all 50 states. Investors deserve more complete disclosure rules than that.<p>Will the Colorado commissioner change NASAA's ardent pro-consumer bent? Feigin says no. But when asked what his biggest concern is, nationwide, his answer was revealing. Feigin's chief worry isn't financial-planner fraud, brokerage-firm indiscretions, or pyramid schemes--it's banks that sell securities. "Banks are looking desperately for a new niche," says Feigin. "After all, who needs banks, except all those bankers?So they're trying to find any fee-based income they can, which includes selling securities."<p>Feigin thinks the comptroller of the currency has been much too lax in allowing bankers to sell mutual funds and stocks. Bank tellers or loan officers ought not to be able to sell securities without being put under some strict regulatory supervision, says Feigin. "There's the potential for a great deal of confusion, error, and misplaced faith here."<p>Maybe so. But isn't it interesting that the first fight Feigin wants to launch as president of NASAA concerns commercial banks, an increasingly tough competitor for the securities and financial-planning industries? True, brokers and planners need all the help they can get in the dog-eat-dog investment world. And as it happens, Phil Feigin is there to offer it.<p>Gretchen Morgenson is executive editor of Worth and will be a regular columnist.<p><p>

But really, what is it on Wall Street with the airs? If the NYSE has any royalty, its name is SuperDot.<p>By John Rothchilde<p>The New York Stock Exchange has a lot in common with the British monarchy. It's housed in a palace. It has its own postage stamp. Heads of state roll in to say hi. <p>The NYSE keeps up its quirky traditions, similar to the Queen Mother's happy-birthday egg roll on the lawn. At the end of each trading session, a fellow climbs into a cuckoo's perch to both ring a bell and whack a big gavel. The memberships to the NYSE are called seats even though hardly anybody sits down. If a member wants to abandon his seat, it is put up for auction. This fall, a seat traded for $775,000, not a small chunk of change. Still, that's down significantly from the almost $1.2 million some eternal optimist paid for a seat one month before the market crash of 1987.<p>Whenever the occupant of a seat dies, the other people with seats are required to donate a bit of money to a "gratuity fund." Other bits of aristocratic weirdness include the moose heads in the members' dining room, which cause it to resemble a lodge in a hunting preserve, and the famous neckwear rule directed at the traders and messengers on the floor, who wear old sneakers and crumpled lab coats but cannot pass through security without a proper tie. When the directors of the NYSE have their pictures taken, they pose under the formal portraits of their ancestors on the board. <p>The most important similarity between the monarchy and the NYSE, however, is that the monarchy puts on a grand show that has little to do with the actual running of the country, and the NYSE puts on a grand show that has little to do with the actual trading of shares. More than 80 percent of the buys and sells on the NYSE are handled by a computer. <p>Thanks to this computer, which is nicknamed SuperDot, the NYSE can trade more than 250 million shares on a normal day, roughly 16 times the average daily volume of 16 million shares it traded in 1973. This proves that the NYSE is not immune to the 20th century. <p>Nevertheless, the NYSE has a very funny relationship with SuperDot. The exchange likes to brag about SuperDot's efficiency (for instance, the average turnaround time for a stock trade will soon be reduced to 15 seconds from 28 seconds), but nowhere in its annual report does it tell us that SuperDot is now doing 80 percent of the work. <p>In the old days before SuperDot, the trading floor was a real place of business. The specialists were installed at their posts, matching buyers and sellers from the crowd that hung around them. Now, with SuperDot doing most of the matchmaking, the specialists merely announce to the crowd the results of the trades the computer already has arranged. The numbers come across the screen that's installed above the specialists' heads. <p>Occasionally, the specialist is called upon to handle a customized order, such as a stop order or a limit order to buy or sell a stock when a certain price is reached. Less occasionally, when there aren't enough buyers to accommodate the sellers, or vice versa, the specialist steps into the market and puts his or her own shares, or capital, on the trading block. Otherwise, specialists do a lot of standing around like Beefeaters. <p>There's a growing faction on Wall Street that wants to do away with the specialist system entirely. That would be a bold and senseless move. The specialist system has its good points, especially as compared to NASDAQ, the upstart exchange where everything is done by computer. <p>On the surface, NASDAQ appears to be an efficient, modern, and highly American institution. It also appears to be growing wildly in popularity. Ten years ago, NASDAQ traded on average just 63 million shares a day. Today, that average is 245 million, close indeed to the NYSE's average daily trading volume of 260 million shares.<p>Whereas in 1992 the president of the NYSE, William Donaldson, made a courtesy call to King Juan Carlos at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid, the head of NASDAQ, Joseph R. Hardiman, has never visited with a single monarch, butterfly or human. NASDAQ whacks no gavels and has no postage stamp, and nobody has to wear a tie on the floor of the exchange because there is no floor of the exchange. <p>The problem with NASDAQ is how the shares are traded by computer. NASDAQ uses the so-called market-maker system, as opposed to the specialist system. Whereas the specialist brings buyers and sellers together at no profit to himself, the market maker gets in the middle of every trade, buying from one party and selling to the other and pocketing the difference, which is called the spread. By keeping the spreads very wide, the NASDAQ market makers are able to afford large quantities of caviar and champagne and frequent flights on the Concorde. <p>In the crash of 1987, the market makers coped with the crisis by going to sleep and taking their phones off the hook. This was very relaxing for them but frustrating to investors who wanted to sell their shares and ran into eight hours of busy signals. (Later, after the stock market rebounded, many of these frustrated investors were thankful they never got through.) At the NYSE, the specialists stood bravely at their posts while the Dow Jones lost 500 points, trading to the last like proper Tennyson soldiers in "The Charge of the Light Brigade." Theirs was not to reason why, theirs was but to sell and buy.<p>So let's not be so quick to do away with specialists. What I'm wondering is why the NYSE bothers to preserve all the royal rigmarole that surrounds the specialists when it could dispense with the trading floor, the traders, and the messengers and sit the specialists down in front of the computer that already does 80 percent of the work. This would be easier on the feet than standing around at the post all day, an ordeal that will require three shifts if we ever get around-the-clock trading. <p>The Toronto Stock Exchange, which was part of the British Empire and knows a lot about royal rigmarole, already has gotten the jump on the NYSE by deciding to close its trading floor (effective sometime next year) and allowing the specialists to do their work from the comfort of their own home offices. Canceling the trading floor will save Toronto plenty of money on salaries and janitorial services, not to mention the heating bill and the light bill and the upkeep on 30,000 square feet of expensive downtown real estate. <p>If the NYSE abolished its trading floor, it could sell its huge palace--perhaps to the Yankees for a new stadium--move into a loft in Soho and put the profits in the gratuity fund. <p>In not-so-Great Britain, they've already turned Buckingham Palace into a tourist attraction, charging the British people a lot of money to see the royal artwork and to learn how the royals used to rule the world. Perhaps Disney, a company that already trades on the NYSE, could buy the stock exchange and run it as a tourist attraction to show capitalism at work. Aspiring actors could play the part of the specialists. <p>

 THE CASE FOR SHORT-TERM INVESTING 
<p>
When does speculating become investing? Perhaps when the economy's
flat and the market's going nowhere.  
<p>
 By Contrarious  
<p>
 When I was growing up, the jungle was considered a forbidding
place, full of poisonous snakes, giant insects, and other hostile
creatures. No one in his right mind, except for someone like
Ernest Hemingway, actually wanted to go there. Then, one day,
an unheralded genius of public relations (my candidate for the
first Nobel Prize in Public Relations, if one is ever established)
got the idea of renaming the jungle the "rainforest." Almost
overnight, all of the threatening creatures that I had been taught
to fear as a child became threatened themselves, and mankind
became the villain. Never mind the wonders of bio-technology
and genetic engineering; we were soon told that the miracle drugs
of the future might well be based on the spores of flora and
fauna rapidly being eradicated in the primeval rainforest.  <p>
<p>
 I am not going to try to defend the Philistine position that
the jungle is bad. I am, in fact, neutral on the jungle, having
spent a few days in one recently (the Darien Jungle, in Panama)
without any obvious ill effect. But there may be a lesson here
for investors.  
<p>
 We who inhabit the planet Wall Street are often told that "speculation"
is bad while "investment" is good, and never the twain shall
meet. To most people, "speculation" is the jungle of money management,
a forbidding domain where ordinary people are apt to lose their
shirts. In contrast, "investment" describes a benign and friendly
territory full of promise and "profit" (the miracle drug for
those who want to enhance their financial well-being).  
<p>
 To be sure, the parallel to jungle and rainforest is not precise.
Speculation at its extremes, and particularly when it involves
a lot of leverage, does differ materially from investment. But
there is a large gray area, where speculation and investment
overlap and are, for practical purposes, the same thing. Each
entails substantial risk and the possibility of great gain. <p>
<p>
 Was there less risk a decade ago investing in IBM at $125 per
share than in speculating in Microsoft at a tenth of its recent
price? Is there less risk today investing in Wal-Mart or Bristol-Myers
than in speculating in some newly emerging company that promises
to reduce the cost of health care? Risk is often in the eye of
the beholder, and investors are often ambushed by a paradox:
Very often the stocks perceived as "safest" are risky because
they are already universally accepted and richly priced, while
a great many stocks that are perceived as "risky" are, in fact,
quite safe because they are owned by investors who are aware
of the stocks' problems but feel these are already well discounted.<p>
<p>
 The jungle/rainforest paradigm may have its most telling application
in the contrast frequently drawn between the alleged vice of
short-term investment, otherwise known as "trading," and the
process of long-term investment, which carries with it the happy
connotations of patience, wisdom, and prudence, not to mention
profitability.   
<p>
 Great profits are frequently earned over the long term. But
what of the silent legions of long-term investors who are underwater
on their favorite growth or undervalued stock? They may only
be waiting to get out even, but will the gods hear their plea?
And what about the round-trippers who have patiently watched
their stocks go sky-high and then return to earth, or worse?
Are they not also long-term investors?  
<p>
 For years, Kenneth Olsen, the founder and very able chairman
of Digital Equipment, sternly lectured security analysts who
had the temerity to inquire about the possibility of his company
declaring a dividend. "We don't pay dividends; we are a growth
company," was the gist of his reply. Of course, when things turned
badDigital lost $5.08 per share in 1991 and $18.50 per share
in 1992the company couldn't afford a dividend. Its only declaration
was of a new CEO to replace Olsen.  
<p>
 One could have bought Digital at $50 per share in the spring
of 1981 and watched it quadruple in six years; it sold at $19912
in October of 1987, just before the crash. If one were a contrarian
and a student of thin reeds, one might have noticed that Digital
revealed its hubris by hiring the QE2 for a great celebration
in Boston Harbor at just about the time the stock was making
its all-time peak. But if you were a patient, long-term investor,
you might have ridden Digital all the way down to $3038 in late
1992, and never even once received a dividend for your troubles.
No wonder the furies turned on Ken Olsen, the once and future
founder.   
<p>
 A major question for the current market is whether investors
should continue to follow a long-term strategy that has worked
relatively well for quite a while, or shift to a strategy of
taking some short-term gains when they occur. It is always hard
to make a case for trading the market, and it is certainly difficult
for most investors to trade successfully. But a trading strategy
might well turn out to be the Northwest Passage to a profitable
1993-1994-1995.   
<p>
 A classic thin-reed indicator seems to confirm the wisdom of
this theory. Politicians in Washington are often one of the great
contrary indicators, reflecting as they do prevailing public
sentiment. When Washington zigs, it often pays to zag. At the
moment, the prevailing powers are urging us to be long-term investors
rather than short-term traders: The tax on short-term gains is
being raised sharply for many investors while the rate on long-term
capital gains remains largely untouched. This creates a powerful
incentive to hold for long-term gains. But as I learned a long
time ago, it doesn't always pay to do what you're told. And in
the investment markets, it frequently doesn't pay to take the
easy, obvious, or broadly recommended path; it may lead over
a precipice.  
<p>
 We have already seen opportunities in 1993 that had to be seized
short-term: lightning surges in gold, technology, and energy.
This in contrast to losses or, at best, wheel spinning in many
of the now well-defined, universally accepted long-term blue-chips
Kellogg, Coca-Cola, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Heinz, McDonald's,
and Pepsi; not to mention the major drug stocks.   
<p>
 The Atlantic Monthly recently ran a piece on George Soros, the
legendary speculator and head of Quantum Fund, calling him an
"investment genius and philanthropist." Soros has been a "jungle"
creature all his professional life, living by his wits and trading
for enormous profit. A year ago, he made more than a billion
dollars in a bet against the British pound.  
<p>
 Today, it would seem he is less "jungle" and more "rainforest,"
having quite literally earned respectability. The jungle-to-rainforest
conversion has occurred before. Fifty years ago, it was Bernard
Baruch who went from "Wall Street speculator" to "financier"
and Washington insider through his financial success and political
connections.   
<p>
 The average investor cannot hope to emulate these men, and shouldn't
try. For one thing, in the investment business, by the time they
call you a genius, you are often only a few steps from the banana
peel. Even Soros may slip one of these days. Nonetheless, there
is a message here: Successful trading beats patient long-term
investing without profit.   
<p>
 So what should the individual investor do? My advice is, if
you can't be a trader, hire a trader. Look at your money managers
in a new light. Are they capable of trading the market successfully?
If not, you might consider removing them from your portfolio,
at least for the short term.

					</center>
					<font size=4>
						 <p>By John Rothchild<p>Unlike the cynic, who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing, the curmudgeon--like me--knows the value of being contrary. If a truth is self-evident, the curmudgeon tries to debunk it; the more widely held an opinion, the more pleasure he gets from taking the opposite stance.<p>When decent folk everywhere are holding hands across America, the curmudgeon keeps his in his pockets. It's not that he's against peace or justice or harmony per se, but he can't stand vapid commemoration. He sees his role as a counterbalance to whatever the prevailing idiocy happens to be.<p>In this time of political, cultural, and environmental correctness, the curmudgeon gets a perverse pleasure out of investing incorrectly. In fact, given the astounding unanimity of public and editorial opinion and the decline of offbeat journals that accept letters from curmudgeons, incorrect investing is the curmudgeon's only worthwhile form of protest.<p>Curmudgeon investing is different from contrarian investing, although the two are related. A contrarian investor, like a bargain hunter at an off-season resort, looks for opportunities that are being ignored by Wall Street. A curmudgeon investor looks for opportunities that are so out of favor politically that the very thought of them makes right-thinking people cringe.<p>The core holding in a curmudgeon's portfolio is South African gold mining shares, followed by the cigarette companies, the polluting industries, and the weapons manufacturers. <p>These long-term incorrect positions are supplemented by the occasional short-term incorrect positions taken after toxic incidents, gas leaks, and radiation emergencies that bring various companies--usually ones that have a bad reputation to begin with--into sudden and utter disfavor. <p>After the Alaskan oil mishap, every friend of the earth and lover of wildlife, including those who drive gas-guzzling cars, turned on Exxon with such zeal that even the Ku Klux Klan had a higher public approval rating. <a name="NYSE:XON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10537"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Exxon</b></a>'s highest-paid executives couldn't have been less popular if they'd been caught on camera shooting at parakeets from the boardroom window. This was a buy signal for curmudgeons.<p>The curmudgeon also bought Union Carbide after the release of a fatal toxic cloud at its chemical plant in Bhopal, India. No matter that this was an accident, or more likely an act of sabotage carried out by a disgruntled employee who twisted the wrong valve. In the hootenanny of recrimination, Union Carbide became a gang of heartless fiends who had adopted asphyxiation as a worldwide corporate policy; similar to another gang of fiends at General Public Utilities, who tried to poison Pennsylvania and make cows glow in the dark. A right-thinking person would no more have bought shares in GPU after the Three Mile Island accident than he would have goose-stepped through a Veteran's Day parade.<p>As it turns out, an investment of equal amounts in each of these incorrect enterprises one month after they had suffered their disasters (by then, the drumbeat of public censure had reached ramming speed) has produced a 189 percent return to date. This is slightly better than the return from investing the same amounts at the same intervals in the Dow Jones. Curmudgeons are not in this simply for the profit, however. They are also in it to serve as the yang for the growing yin of ethical investors, who buy shares only in companies in clean industries that are nice.<p>To the curmudgeon, ethical investing is worse than being shipped off to Disneyland and then having to spend an entire day circling around in swan boats, listening to "It's a Small World After All" sung over and over by the United Nations of dolls.<p>It is particularly gratifying to the enemies of ethical investing whenever a hand-picked portfolio of socially irresponsible investments not only outperforms the Dow Jones, but also the ethical mutual funds such as Calvert Social Investment, Dreyfus Third Century, and Pax World. The managers of these funds devote much of their effort to screening out objectionable stocks, so the fundholders can sleep with clear consciences, knowing their money is safe from contamination by despicable elements.<p>Ethical-investment advisors spend a great deal of time worrying about whether it is morally okay to own IBM, given the fact that <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> computers are installed in the Pentagon war rooms; or about whether Aetna is tainted by its insuring of nuclear power plants; or whether an otherwise good company has debased itself by having <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a> bonds in its own portfolio. Given the large numbers of crucial industries that are dirty industries (coal, oil, gas, nuclear, and the like), and the many interrelationships between companies of all kinds, the logical end to ethical investing is no investing at all. Without the curmudgeon and his willingness to invest incorrectly, the entire financial system might be brought to a halt.<p>My own curmudgeonish character was revealed very early, when I raised the Union Jack in our front yard on the Fourth of July. Later, in college, when people were fasting in opposition to the Vietnam War, I supported an eat-in to back the troops. But in my investment life, my repeated attempts to buy Exxon, Union Carbide, and Philip Morris were frustrated by my wife and children, who would never allow such rats into the family portfolio.<p>The invention of the individual retirement account was a great help to curmudgeons. The IRA, and after that the self-directed pension plan, gave me the freedom to invest as wrongly as I chose, in the privacy of my own brokerage statement. <p>A second great help was the invention of the country fund, which opened up a whole new range of irresponsible picks. There are few if any politically correct countries, unless you count Switzerland, and the Swiss until recently denied women the vote in their cantons. In the so-called developing world, where most of the country funds are concentrated, it's hard to find a country with an acceptable ruler who doesn't try to loot the national treasury or to silence his opponents by doing away with them, or both.<p>Between Jakarta Growth, the Malaysia Fund, the Korea Fund, two Taiwan funds, two China funds, the various Latin American funds, and ASA, which is a collection of South African mining shares, there is plenty of opportunity to "buy on the sound of cannons," as my ancient forebears, the Rothchilds, used to do, or to "buy on the sound of the Bronx cheer," whenever a government does something so terrible that it rises to the top of the world's black list.<p>My first foray into incorrect country investing was purchasing the Thai Capital Fund the day after Thai troops had killed about 50 pro-democracy demonstrators in Bangkok. Whereas ethical investors might call this a vote for brutality, I thought of it as a vote of confidence for Thailand, just when that country needed it most. I assumed that this murderous incident was no reflection on the Thai people, who are very friendly, nor on the various corporations whose shares are peddled on the Thai stock exchange, and which after the massacre were selling at an intriguing discount. Naturally, I bought Thai Capital in my retirement account.<p>"That will fit in quite nicely with your New Germany Fund," my wife, Susan, who is Jewish, said matter-of-factly, when I informed her of my latest purchase. "What are you suffering from, financial Tourette's syndrome?"<p>In my defense, I have to say that the whole business of refusing to do business with certain countries to put pressure on their brutal regimes (Cuba, South Africa) while trading with other countries (China) in order to put pressure on their equally brutal regimes strikes the curmudgeon as quite silly, and deserves to be undone.<p>I sold Thai Capital for a nice profit (a 40% gain in six months), and then took a brief look at the India Growth Fund, after Hindu militants demolished an important mosque and riots broke out across the country; and also at the Brazil Fund after the president was impeached for stealing billions of cruzeiros (pennies to us) from that nation's coffers. Neither of these opportunities had the appealing perversity of DeBeers, a South African diamond mining company whose stock was recommended by Peter Lynch last January in Barron's. <p>To find a stock that Lynch likes and that also makes right-thinking people cringe is a curmudgeon's dream. Naturally, the curmudgeon believes that the anti-apartheid campaign has been ruined by the company it keeps. Particularly Paul Simon. I realize this is childish, but everytime I see that obnoxious twit prancing around on a South African stage, it makes me want to go out and buy shares in Dreifontein, DeBeers, and Blyvoor. <p>This time it wasn't my family who got in my way. It was my stockbroker. Actually, the broker himself was amenable, but he said that the firm had not yet lifted its own ban on trading in South African stocks, pending further civilized developments. <p>As an alternative to the gold mining shares, I've been thinking about Singapore. Singapore is a place where everything works--the trains run on time; the schools are excellent; the hospitals are first-class; crime, by U.S. standards, is nonexistent; the government keeps a balanced budget. <p>In short, Singapore is everything the good old U.S. of A. hopes to become, except that it isn't politically correct. What makes Singapore P.I. is that its prime minister rules like a sort of CEO of the people, without the benefit of democracy. Laws are strictly enforced, to the point that jaywalkers think twice about crossing against the lights, even when there are no cars in sight. This is a system that begins to appeal to a curmudgeon every time he sees a jaywalker holding up traffic. <p>John Rothchild is the author of Going for Broke, about Robert Campeau.

						 <p>By Contrarious<p>How much do political factors affect the destiny of individual common stocks? <p>Ask <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a>. In January 1992, apparently confident of George Bush's re-election, the company made a fateful decision. It hired Craig Fuller as its senior vice president for corporate affairs. Fuller had served as chief ofstaff under Vice President Bush from 1985 to 1988 but was replaced in this role by the political Doberman, John Sununu, when Bush became president. Nonetheless, Fuller remained close to the upper echelons of the Republican Party__so much so that he was asked by Bush to organize last summer's Republican convention in Houston. <p>Remarkably, Fuller retained his position with Philip Morris during the convention and throughout the campaign. Shortly before the election, I was surprised to see him acting as a Bush spokesman on ABC's "Nightline" in a debate on the issue of Bush's possible involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. Just as I was starting to doze off, I heard Fuller proclaim that Iran-Contra didn't matter in the outcome of the 1988 election "and it won't matter in '92."<p>These events paint a remarkable picture. Philip Morris, for many years one of the nation's most successful corporations, quite literally bet the store on George Bush in 1992. For Philip Morris, Bush__pork rinds and all__was the real Marlboro Man. When he lost, the company lost, and it has been losing ever since.<p>It is probably not a coincidence that Philip Morris stock reached its all-time high of 86 5/8 at the end of September 1992, at about the last moment when the investment markets thought Bush might win. (As one indication of this, long-term interest rates rose throughout October as the bond market began to discount what it then feared would be the inflationary impact of a Clinton victory.)<p>How could Philip Morris, normally so street-smart, have taken Fuller, a modern-day Jonah, aboard ship just as the tempestuous 1992 campaign was about to begin? They undoubtedly thought Bush would win, and like any investor buying into a long-term bull market (in this case the Republican political bull market of 1980-1992), they probably didn't consider the downside risk of being wrong. In all likelihood, Philip Morris had worked closely with the Bush and Reagan administrations over the years, developing cigarette markets in China and elsewhere. In hiring Fuller, they were simply following a well-established trend.<p>But when you bet heavily on the loser in our democratic-capitalist system, you have a problem. I would not expect the Clinton people ever to admit they have a score to settle with Craig Fuller or with Philip Morris. That would appear unseemly and unpresidential. But political leaders have been taking their revenge for a long time. Machiavelli thought it was a good idea; and so did the Kennedy patriarch, Joseph P. Kennedy, who is said to have proclaimed: "Don't get mad, get even." <p>Much of the American public has probably forgotten last summer's bellicose Republican convention. But I suspect that James Carville and the other Clinton "bad cops" remember quite clearly. It is a fair guess that a portion of the vastly increased cigarette tax that looms ahead has Craig Fuller's and Philip Morris's names on it. <p>I recognize that not every reader will endorse this analysis of what has happened to Philip Morris during the past year. It is, after all, like the investment markets themselves, somewhat speculative in nature. But for those who do accept this analysis, here are some further conclusions.<p>* Politics does matter, to individual companies, to industries, and occasionally to the markets as a whole. Philip Morris would have had problems with its cigarette business even with the Republicans in the White House. But not the kind of trouble the Clinton anti-smoking campaign creates. <p>* If politics matters, it surely matters who is president of the United States. I make no brief for or against Clinton. That is the reader's business to decide. But I suggest that investors start to formulate a judgment as to the odds of Clinton winning a second term. Many investors seem to find obnoxious the idea of starting to think about the outcome of the 1996 presidential election so far in advance. The irony is that many of those same people call themselves long-term investors. They think nothing of assuming results for their favorite growth stocks three-and-a-half years ahead, even though such results (witness Philip Morris, again) are hardly guaranteed. <p>* A case can be made that the odds already favor Bill Clinton's re-election, notwithstanding all of the water that will go over the dam between now and then. The press, the Republicans, and some of the public may grumble, but Clinton is a smart politician with the common touch, surely a formidable combination. He seems to be positioning himself along the lines of Franklin D. Roosevelt, formulating a long-term plan and taking it to the people. What looks like a blunder, or is a blunder in the short term, may often be part of a trial-and-error process, a probing of the political terrain. <p>To my eye, Clinton is a political chess player, thinking many moves down the board while his critics concentrate on the here and now. It is surely not an accident that his major efforts__health care, deficit- reduction, worker-training__all have a long-term cast to them. We will not know whether he has been truly successful in any of these efforts until after the 1996 election, and that is surely by design. <p>The health-care program is a good example. Much is made of the fact that it has been delayed and won't, in fact, take effect for some time. But this is undoubtedly what Clinton intended from the beginning: a health-care program to be passed in 1994, effective in 1995, but not vulnerable to an effective postmortem until 1997 or later.<p>Clinton also seems to be emulating Roosevelt in his relentless wooing of key constituencies: working women, minorities, big labor, gays, the MTV set. This will be his version of the famous FDR coalition, and it is likely to allow him more leeway for error than many observers seem to acknowledge. Clinton knows that Roosevelt won 46 of 48 states in 1936 despite the fact that the New Deal wasn't really working and that the country was still mired in the Great Depression. Clinton won the presidency last year as an outsider slogging uphill through the mud. It would be surprising if a man with these skills and this resilience couldn't use the awesome power of the presidency to win again, notwithstanding all the problems that lie ahead. <p>I suggested some months ago that a proactive President Clinton would yank the markets around a lot. Thus far, this has happened. Clinton has been good for semiconductors, natural gas, building materials, and utilities; and bad for tobacco, health care, cable tv, and, arguably, retail stocks.<p>What might he impact in the future? It is certain that some time before 1996, Clinton will spend big money in California, the nation's most important electoral state. We don't know yet whether it will be high-speed trains for Southern California, information highways for Silicon Valley, or some totally new program. But one way or another it will benefit companies that already have a large stake there. <p>Whatever he does, remember that Bill Clinton is the only portfolio manager in America today who really counts. Whether one likes him or not, investors may well have to reckon with his presence for the rest of this century. <p>Contrarious is the pseudonym of a person who has been observing markets__with a skeptical eye__for many years.<p> <p><p><p>

						 <p>By Walter Mead<p>Americans have only themselves to blame. After all, they were the ones who in the middle of the last century originally insisted on trade between the United States and Japan. Now that the Japanese trade surplus has resumed its seemingly inexorable rise, many Americans in senior policy positions seem to think that Commodore Perry made a ghastly mistake. <p>A generation of Americans who grew up thinking of Japan as a tiny, poor country that made paper umbrellas and bad cameras was shocked as the island nation competed successfully against the United States in one key industry after another. Baffled by Japanese successes in industries ranging from automobiles to fiber optics, amazed by a Japanese economy that consistently grows faster than that of the United States, and frightened by the rise of a new economic superpower in the Pacific Rim, American industrialists and policy experts could only explain Japan in mythological terms. They dredged up World War II stereotypes of the Japanese soldier__fanatically devoted to the cause, brutally efficient, willing to break any law of man or God to achieve his leaders' purposes__to portray the "salaryman," the intrepid foot soldier in what many see as a new economic war between the Rising Sun and the Stars and Stripes. <p>The collapse of the bubble economy in 1990 put an end, at least temporarily, to the Japanese economic conquest of the world and even fostered the growth of a new, Japan-in-decline school of thought. The miracle is over, say the new skeptics. The Japanese hour has passed. The Japanese population is becoming older, grayer, and less productive. The new generation of Japanese workers, raised to take prosperity for granted, is almost as lazy and greedy as its American counterpart. The rapidly progressing economies of its Asian neighbors__Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, and above all China__are putting new pressure on Japan. <p>But this new view of Japan is just as mythic as the old, and the swing between these two portraits tells us more about American observers than about Japan. The island nation was never quite as formidable as it looked in the '80s, and it is not in as much trouble as the skeptics now think. Nevertheless, the real Japan is changing, and Americans need to understand why. The reality is complex: In some ways Japan will become an even more formidable competitor and in other ways Japan will have less global economic clout in the future. Moreover, Japan will chose to project that power in different ways and in different directions than it has during the last two decades. <p>Japan, for all its vaunted strengths, has a basic structural economic problem. As a major exporting power, it cannot grow much faster than its principle trading partners. The Japanese economy cannot expand at five and six percent while Europe and the United States are only growing at two and three percent. This is Japan's long-term problem, and so far, its economic wizards have been unable to find a solution. <p>Japan's most recent strategy for attacking this problem has been to look west. Japanese financial bureaucrats seem to believe that the country can reduce its direct dependence on the American market by consolidating its position as the economic center of East Asia. Japanese companies are relocating production to low-wage sites throughout East Asia, partly to reduce the nominal U.S.-Japan trade deficit and partly to take advantage of the low costs associated with producing in countries such as China and Indonesia. Meanwhile, the need for these countries to import capital goods and high-technology equipment and know-how creates an expanding market for high-value- added goods. Japanese patterns of investment ensure that much of this market will go to Japanese suppliers. <p>This strategy can, at best, be only partially successful. Japan's East Asian partners are still dependent on the U.S. and European markets and, therefore, while Japan will be one step removed, this strategy does not in the end eliminate Japanese economic dependence on the American consumer market. But adding those East Asian markets does diversify Japan's economic risk. Perhaps more important, this strategy reduces the risks of a major political rupture with the United States over trade. <p>This shift however has profound implications for Japan's political agenda. It will give Japan a much higher profile in the region and make East Asia even more of a diplomatic priority for Japan. As Japanese investment grows in the region, Japan will inevitably be less willing to remain passive in its regional diplomacy. Already Japanese troops have gone to Cambodia, in the first deployment of Japanese forces abroad since 1945. Look for continued Japanese political and military involvement in East Asia and for a Japanese foreign policy that is increasingly distinct from that of the United States. <p>Distinct, but not completely different. Japan is surrounded by nations that fear and resent it, and that fear will force the Japanese to continue to link their policy to the United States, perhaps more than they might like. North and South Korea, divided across a tense and highly militarized border, are yet united in their fear of Japan, and in their hatred of the Japanese colonialism that oppressed both halves of Korea until 1945. China__already armed with nuclear weapons and one day likely to become the greatest power on earth__remembers Japanese atrocities during World War II and believes that it, and not Japan, ought to be the center of the new Asian order.<p>Japan's economic and diplomatic program in East Asia will not be able to ignore the regional competition over arms sales and aerospace. East Asia is the world's leading growth market for aerospace and weapons technology. With China posting double-digit increases in its defense budget from year to year, and with civilian air traffic exploding as the region continues to grow, these markets are likely to be a major battleground between Japanese and American companies in the '90s. Investors in such companies as Boeing and in the American defense industry should be sure to factor in the effects of stiff Japanese competition when they value their shares. Japan has the technological ability to compete with the United States in these industries, and it is likely to use its privileged position in Asia to leverage its technological skills into the basis for a new and profitable export market. <p>The best and the brightest in the ministries of trade and finance may have devised a regional strategy, but the financial markets have other plans for Japan. While Japan's manufacturing economy is becoming more Asian, its financial economy is becoming more international. An influx of foreign investors helped the Tokyo stock market to claw its way back from its lows of 1991-92 this year, but what foreigners can buy, they can sell. To an extent almost unbelievable to an American investor, the Japanese government can control the behavior of Japanese financial institutions and investors. This spring, for example, arbitrary changes in accounting rules discouraged institutions from selling shares. But foreigners aren't subject to the same pressures. The result? Japanese financial markets in the future will be driven more by market forces, less by the decisions of the bureaucrats. With Japanese banks and insurance companies weakened by their heavy losses in stocks and real estate, there are fewer obstacles than ever before to international penetration of Japan's once-closed financial system. Over time, this should bring Japanese stock prices and values closer in line with global norms, which is not necessarily good news for investors in Japanese equities.<p>A new generation of leaders is coming to power in Japan, and it is this generation that will have to cope with the stresses and strains brought on by these economic and financial shifts. The present Japanese political system works a little like China's: Wily old faction leaders control the political life of the country. But the old guard of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled Japan since the end of the U.S. occupation, is under increasing pressure from Young Turks who are perhaps less opposed to the current corruption scandals than to the domination of Japanese political life by men in their seventies. <p>Americans instinctively cheer when Young Reform takes on Old Corruption and, to some extent, the generational shift in Japan will be good for American interests. The new leaders are much more interested in urban consumers than in such old fashioned constituencies as farmers. Consequently, they favor many of the things Washington wants Japan to do__like opening up more discount stores and reducing both formal and informal barriers to trade. The new generation is also more simpatico with American values of other kinds: Younger Japanese are, for example, less committed to the work ethic of their parents and grandparents. Lacking memories of wartime deprivation, younger people want to live more like Americans and Europeans__with longer vacations and less pressure on the job. Japan is likely to become superficially more like the West: more consumer oriented, more "laid back." <p>This does not mean, however, that the new generation of leaders will improve relations with the United States. The older generation of leaders still looks at the United States with the respect, even the awe, born of the Second World War and of the Occupation. Men in their seventies began their civilian careers under MacArthur's post-war rule; for them, it is second nature to consult with the United States and to defer to its wishes. The new generation, whose impressions of the United States were shaped by Vietnam and this country's economic decline, is if anything liable to go too far in the other direction. It is not uncommon to hear open contempt for the United States among the new leaders, and as a group they are liable to underestimate the strength and the staying power of the United States.<p>This generation welcomes what their elders most feared: an independent Japanese foreign policy that, while linked in some ways with that of the United States, pursues frankly Japanese goals. This group will continue Japan's rearmament and will seek a significantly larger role for Japan in Asian security questions and on the world stage. Unlike the Germans, who have confronted the legacy of their nation's tragic past, many of the younger Japanese leaders consider Japan's war crimes to have little relevance to the contemporary scene.<p>Japan is not about to fade away, but in the '90s it will be walking a new and more difficult path. Economic growth will be harder to come by and slower. Friction with the United States__still Japan's most important ally and trading partner__and with the rest of East Asia will increase. Only one thing is really certain: The political history and the economic development of the Pacific Rim will continue to be shaped by the uneasy but inescapable relationship between the United States and Japan, as it has been since Commodore Perry paid his visit back in 1853. <p>Walter Russell Mead is a senior counselor at the World Policy Institute at The New School in New York, where he works on international economics.

 THE CREED OF THE CURMUDGEON  
<p>
 By John Rothchild  
<p>
 Unlike the cynic, who knows the price of everything and the
value of nothing, the curmudgeon--like me--knows the value of
being contrary.  If a truth is self-evident, the curmudgeon tries
to debunk it; the more widely held an opinion, the more pleasure
he gets from taking the opposite stance.  
<p>
 When decent folk everywhere are holding hands across America,
the curmudgeon keeps his in his pockets. It's not that he's against
peace or justice or harmony per se, but he can't stand vapid
commemoration. He sees his role as a counterbalance to whatever
the prevailing idiocy happens to be.  
<p>
 In this time of political, cultural, and environmental correctness,
the curmudgeon gets a perverse pleasure out of investing incorrectly.
In fact, given the astounding unanimity of public and editorial
opinion and the decline of offbeat journals that accept letters
from curmudgeons, incorrect investing is the curmudgeon's only
worthwhile form of protest.  
<p>
 Curmudgeon investing is different from contrarian investing,
although the two are related. A contrarian investor, like a bargain
hunter at an off-season resort, looks for opportunities that
are being ignored by Wall Street. A curmudgeon investor looks
for opportunities that are so out of favor politically that the
very thought of them makes right-thinking people cringe.  
<p>
 The core holding in a curmudgeon's portfolio is South African
gold mining shares, followed by the cigarette companies, the
polluting industries, and the weapons manufacturers.   
<p>
 These long-term incorrect positions are supplemented by the
occasional short-term incorrect positions taken after toxic incidents,
gas leaks, and radiation emergencies that bring various companiesusually
ones that have a bad reputation to begin withinto sudden and
utter disfavor.   
<p>
 After the Alaskan oil mishap, every friend of the earth and
lover of wildlife, including those who drive gas-guzzling cars,
turned on Exxon with such zeal that even the Ku Klux Klan had
a higher public approval rating. Exxon's highest-paid executives
couldn't have been less popular if they'd been caught on camera
shooting at parakeets from the boardroom window. This was a buy
signal for curmudgeons.  
<p>
 The curmudgeon also bought Union Carbide after the release of
a fatal toxic cloud at its chemical plant in Bhopal, India. No
matter that this was an accident, or more likely an act of sabotage
carried out by a disgruntled employee who twisted the wrong valve.
In the hootenanny of recrimination, Union Carbide became a gang
of heartless fiends who had adopted asphyxiation as a worldwide
corporate policy; similar to another gang of fiends at General
Public Utilities, who tried to poison Pennsylvania and make cows
glow in the dark. A right-thinking person would no more have
bought shares in GPU after the Three Mile Island accident than
he would have goose-stepped through a Veteran's Day parade. <p>
<p>
 As it turns out, an investment of equal amounts in each of these
incorrect enterprises one month after they had suffered their
disasters (by then, the drumbeat of public censure had reached
ramming speed) has produced a 189 percent return to date. This
is slightly better than the return from investing the same amounts
at the same intervals in the Dow Jones. Curmudgeons are not in
this simply for the profit, however. They are also in it to serve
as the yang for the growing yin of ethical investors, who buy
shares only in companies in clean industries that are nice. <p>
<p>
 To the curmudgeon, ethical investing is worse than being shipped
off to Disneyland and then having to spend an entire day circling
around in swan boats, listening to "It's a Small World After
All" sung over and over by the United Nations of dolls.  
<p>
 It is particularly gratifying to the enemies of ethical investing
whenever a hand-picked portfolio of socially irresponsible investments
not only outperforms the Dow Jones, but also the ethical mutual
funds such as Calvert Social Investment, Dreyfus Third Century,
and Pax World. The managers of these funds devote much of their
effort to screening out objectionable stocks, so the fundholders
can sleep with clear consciences, knowing their money is safe
from contamination by despicable elements.  
<p>
 Ethical-investment advisors spend a great deal of time worrying
about whether it is morally okay to own IBM, given the fact that
IBM computers are installed in the Pentagon war rooms; or about
whether Aetna is tainted by its insuring of nuclear power plants;
or whether an otherwise good company has debased itself by having
Philip Morris bonds in its own portfolio. Given the large numbers
of crucial industries that are dirty industries (coal, oil, gas,
nuclear, and the like), and the many interrelationships between
companies of all kinds, the logical end to ethical investing
is no investing at all. Without the curmudgeon and his willingness
to invest incorrectly, the entire financial system might be brought
to a halt.  
<p>
 My own curmudgeonish character was revealed very early, when
I raised the Union Jack in our front yard on the Fourth of July.
Later, in college, when people were fasting in opposition to
the Vietnam War, I supported an eat-in to back the troops. But
in my investment life, my repeated attempts to buy Exxon, Union
Carbide, and Philip Morris were frustrated by my wife and children,
who would never allow such rats into the family portfolio.  
<p>
 The invention of the individual retirement account was a great
help to curmudgeons. The IRA, and after that the self-directed
pension plan, gave me the freedom to invest as wrongly as I chose,
in the privacy of my own brokerage statement.   
<p>
 A second great help was the invention of the country fund, which
opened up a whole new range of irresponsible picks. There are
few if any politically correct countries, unless you count Switzerland,
and the Swiss until recently denied women the vote in their cantons.
In the so-called developing world, where most of the country
funds are concentrated, it's hard to find a country with an acceptable
ruler who doesn't try to loot the national treasury or to silence
his opponents by doing away with them, or both.  
<p>
 Between Jakarta Growth, the Malaysia Fund, the Korea Fund, two
Taiwan funds, two China funds, the various Latin American funds,
and ASA, which is a collection of South African mining shares,
there is plenty of opportunity to "buy on the sound of cannons,"
as my ancient forebears, the Rothchilds, used to do, or to "buy
on the sound of the Bronx cheer," whenever a government does
something so terrible that it rises to the top of the world's
black list.  
<p>
 My first foray into incorrect country investing was purchasing
the Thai Capital Fund the day after Thai troops had killed about
50 pro-democracy demonstrators in Bangkok. Whereas ethical investors
might call this a vote for brutality, I thought of it as a vote
of confidence for Thailand, just when that country needed it
most. I assumed that this murderous incident was no reflection
on the Thai people, who are very friendly, nor on the various
corporations whose shares are peddled on the Thai stock exchange,
and which after the massacre were selling at an intriguing discount.
Naturally, I bought Thai Capital in my retirement account.  
<p>
 "That will fit in quite nicely with your New Germany Fund,"
my wife, Susan, who is Jewish, said matter-of-factly, when I
informed her of my latest purchase. "What are you suffering from,
financial Tourette's syndrome?"  
<p>
 In my defense, I have to say that the whole business of refusing
to do business with certain countries to put pressure on their
brutal regimes (Cuba, South Africa) while trading with other
countries (China) in order to put pressure on their equally brutal
regimes strikes the curmudgeon as quite silly, and deserves to
be undone.  
<p>
 I sold Thai Capital for a nice profit (a 40% gain in six months),
and then took a brief look at the India Growth Fund, after Hindu
militants demolished an important mosque and riots broke out
across the country; and also at the Brazil Fund after the president
was impeached for stealing billions of cruzeiros (pennies to
us) from that nation's coffers. Neither of these opportunities
had the appealing perversity of DeBeers, a South African diamond
mining company whose stock was recommended by Peter Lynch last
January in Barron's.   
<p>
 To find a stock that Lynch likes and that also makes right-thinking
people cringe is a curmudgeon's dream. Naturally, the curmudgeon
believes that the anti-apartheid campaign has been ruined by
the company it keeps. Particularly Paul Simon. I realize this
is childish, but everytime I see that obnoxious twit prancing
around on a South African stage, it makes me want to go out and
buy shares in Dreifontein, DeBeers, and Blyvoor.   
<p>
 This time it wasn't my family who got in my way. It was my stockbroker.
Actually, the broker himself was amenable, but he said that the
firm had not yet lifted its own ban on trading in South African
stocks, pending further civilized developments.   
<p>
 As an alternative to the gold mining shares, I've been thinking
about Singapore. Singapore is a place where everything worksthe
trains run on time; the schools are excellent; the hospitals
are first-class; crime, by U.S. standards, is nonexistent; the
government keeps a balanced budget.   
<p>
 In short, Singapore is everything the good old U.S. of A. hopes
to become, except that it isn't politically correct. What makes
Singapore P.I. is that its prime minister rules like a sort of
CEO of the people, without the benefit of democracy. Laws are
strictly enforced, to the point that jaywalkers think twice about
crossing against the lights, even when there are no cars in sight.
This is a system that begins to appeal to a curmudgeon every
time he sees a jaywalker holding up traffic.

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:jwestman@westmanrealty.com">John Westman</a> on January 23, 1997 at 00:40:55:<p>
My current portfolio consists of 6 funds which morningstar ascent shows is 41% large value, 41% medium growth, 5% medium blend and 5% small value - foreign % is 17.<p>I'm considering adding Fidelity low priced stock which changes the allocations to 31, 31, 4 and 23% with 18.5% foreign.   Avg. Beta drops from 94 to 90 while return stays almost the same.   Is this a good move in this market or should I be looking at something more conservate?  My time line is roughly 15 years.

Peter; I am experiencing the wild matket ride og '96.  My broker has my assets spread out strategically within the AIM family ofmutual funds. What I want to insure is that my funds are placed well enough to realize the most optimal gain.  I was watching Ruykeyser's WSW last night and the panel was optimistic that internayional funds deserved close attention.  I can instruct my broker to increase my positions in those mutuial funds that invest in international funds more,  What do you suggest?  If you can, could you pls. mail your response to my mailbox.  Thank you.   MJB <br>

Is anyone using a switching technique with PBHG? i.e. running average,( in the fund when the share price is above and out when it is below)

Re your comments on TRP and Invesco: I <br>deal with each of them and have been <br>very pleased, both with performance of <br>the funds (TRP MidCap Growth, <br>Captital Appreciation, New America, <br>Europe; INV Technology, Health and <br>Financial) and the services provided.  I <br>like Invesco for sector funds, which I <br>will move around a bit; I like TRP for <br>buy and hold funds, although as they <br>move more into sector funds (new, <br>unproven as yet, funds in Heath and <br>Finance; excellent Science and <br>Technology fund) I may revise that.<p>Cheers, Veronica<p>TRP has excellent on-line services (PC <br>Access is great) and investing with <br>Invesco has been hassle free.  I will <br>continue working with both companies.

I'm curious what funds other people are considering being in for the next few years.  My gut says a good combination of equity income, biotech, value, energy, small caps, and very selective high-techs.<p>Also, do other people stick with one family of funds, and if so, which ones?  If I had to pick only one fund family, it would probably be T Rowe Price.  Invesco runs a very close second though.  Price seems to have the best set of consistent performers.  On the other hand, I like dealing with  Invesco because they are less rigid and they make it easier for a small guy to get started.

It had been a while since I checked the Worth message board, so I just saw your response dated 10/13 to my message.  I appreciate your comments.  I'm just a regular guy trying to learn this investing game.  The more I listen to the "experts", the more I am convinced that some of them have no better grasp of what is going on than you or I.  I am looking for dabblers like me to converse with about this stuff.  I had not been to the Worth site, because for some reason it didn't seem like a lot of people were not participating.  Maybe word just hasn't gotten around, or maybe some people are a little afraid that some so-called "expert" will criticize their thinking.  My thinking is that if the experts were THAT smart, they wouldn't be wasting their time with commoners like us.  If they REALLY had a handle on the best place to put their money, they would be too busy grabbing every last penny they could get their hands so they could multiply their money faster than we could imagine.  The truth is, they are just taking their best guesses like us.  I'm sure they mess up big time, but we don't hear them talk about that much.  I don't over-analyze the massive bundles of data like some seem to.  I just try to use a little common sense (what little I have).  I would be very interested what your take is on the market, mutual funds, the economy,...whatever.  Looking forward to continued exchanges.

Between now & the end of the year I expect to be a good point to exit aggressive equity mutual funds.  I think they can be bought back later at a lower price.  Of course I'm sitting in a gold mutual fund & wondering when/if gold stocks will begin a sustained upward move so my prescience comes & goes.

<p>Message Posted by <p>SpaceGhost on September 02, 1996 at 14:23:45:<p>
I have done a pretty good deal of research into mutual funds in the last couple of years (for a casual dabbler) and I thought I might share some of my  insights and experiences (good and bad) with anyone willing to listen.  I'm not a pro or an expert, but
 you certainly can't beat the price of my advice.  I've known people who paid CFPs big bucks to direct them to the poor house.  With a little basic knowledge and common sense, you can roll your own and probably come out better.<p>I use mutual funds primar
ily as long-term investment instruments.  For short-term investing, I prefer individual stocks - you have a lot more control when it comes to getting the desired price.  When you  "trade" in mutual funds, you always (to the best of my knowledge) get the d
ay's closing price which is determined by the price of all of the indivual securities in the fund (which obviously can change from day to day). <p><br>Diversification:<p>When investing in mutual funds, I honestly evaluate when I would actually need the mo
ney, and consequently my tolerance for risk.  Then I select a handful of funds that together should meet the return/risk requirements.  Even if my timeframe for the investment is many years (such as retirement), I don't put everything in aggressive growth
 funds, for example.  I try to get a good mix of fund types, that together will give the desired return along with at least some price stability and diversification.<p>Why?  I thought you would never ask.  When I got in my company's 401K plan a few years 
back, with my retirement horizon 25 years in the future, I thought "Why would I even consider anything but the most aggressive growth fund(s) available in the plan?  Who cares if the market takes a few corrections along the way - all I really care about i
s the number of eggs in my basket when I get ready to kick back and enjoy my golden years."  No matter that I had to pay a 2-3% load on the most aggressive funds in our plan - that was chicken feed compared to the fantistic returns I would enjoy in the lo
ng run.  We are in this for the long run, right?  Maybe.<p>Caca happens - last year my company was acquired by a bigger fish.  Our old 401K plan was being replaced by the new and improved one that the big fish subscribed to.  We had no choice but to move 
our existing savings into the new plan, or take a distribution.  Keeping existing money in our current funds was not an option made available to us.  On close of business on the last day that our money was to exist in the old funds, those shares were sold
 at the closing price and new shares were bought in the new funds we chose a month or 2 earlier.  It didn't matter what the market was doing that day - we had no control over the timing.  Suddenly, my 25-year horizon was temporarily interrupted by a horiz
on of a few months.  True, many funds with similar goals frequently contain the same securities, but that's not always the case - just look at the route the Magellan Fund took within the last year.  To add insult to injury, we still had to pay the load(s)
, for funds with a load, up to the very last payroll deduction/fund share purchase in the old funds.  Ouch - consider that money gone!  I didn't go broke in the transition, but there was a very noticable loss of momentum for a few months, even though the 
market as a whole was doing pretty well.  The chances are that this will not happen to everyone, but it does point out that events beyond your control can disrupt the best long-term strategies.  I don't suggest you put everything into fixed-income vehicle
s, but I am now diversified in the following fund types:  Aggressive growth, foreign equities, equity index, equity income, global allocation, and even some of my company's own stock.  With this mix, it seems like something is always in bloom.  There are 
still no guarantees against an overall market crash, but now I enjoy good overall returns with a little more price stability.<p><br>Fund hopping:<p>Outside of my retirement money, I decided to invest for the short- to intermediate-term for things like a b
etter home, land in the country, etc.  I picked a mix of funds within the same family, and tried to move money between the funds every few months to take advantage of changing market conditions.  Sometimes I was right and sometimes wrong - it was generall
y a wash (If you don't take into consideration the time, energy, and frustration of trying to time the market).<p>I should have picked the funds that could best meet my goals and stuck with them taking full advantage of :<p><br>Dollar cost averaging:<p>To
 my surprise, I actually read an article in which the author dismissed the benefits of dollar cost averaging.  Does this guy really do this for a living?  True, it is not a guaranteed road to accumulating untold wealth, but not only does it smooth out the
 risks in a volatile market, it actually increases your overall returns by automatically taking full advantage of market down swings and buying more than when the share price is higher.  Yes, ideally you would perform best if you could buy shares at the a
bsolute bottom price and sell them at the absolute top - that's every investor's fantasy!  But how many people have been really been successful at that.  Come on now, be honest!  If you picked the best fund for your goals in the first place, then why not 
set up an automatic investment for the amount you can afford (putting your investment on auto-pilot), and then focus on your day job?<p>Thanks for listening!  No charge!  I welcome any "constructive" criticisms or comments.

Hold five to seven funds is  a good <br>strategy to follow.  To aid in this <br>strategy it would be good to have an <br>electronic means to check which stocks <br>each fund holds to avoid funds that hold <br>the same stocks.<br>

The S&P 500 has a 3-year average<br>annual compound return of 21%<br>(expressed in Cdn $, to 12/96).<p>None of the sixty-plus actively <br>managed US equity funds available<br>up here in Canada were able to <br>beat that return. (The best was <br>20.6%). <p>It must be nice to be a fund manager<br>for a living! You can be the best and<br>be beat by a passive fund.

There is a very interesting article on <br>the Mutual Fund Cafe website <br>(www.mfcafe.com) about the pros and cons <br>of index versus actively managed mutual <br>fund accounts.  Vanguard has certainly <br>been getting alot of well deserved (in <br>my opinion) press about their S&P 500 <br>Index fund.  The only deterrant to some <br>is that the fund has a $3,000 minimum <br>investment.

I would like to find information about <br>foreign country index fund. I do not <br>mean closed end country funds, but funds <br>that are indexed around certain <br>investment themes, like value, micro <br>cap, the premier index of the country <br>etc. I am especially interested in funds <br>of smaller countries with established <br>stock markets like New Zealand, Finland,<br>South Africa etc.  thank you

It appears to me that so much time is <br>invested to research out good stocks, <br>top mutual funds, etc. that for the <br>average person not familiar with <br>technical analysis why waste all that <br>time when you can buy mutual funds that <br>mirror most of the major market indexes. <br> So many studies have been done on <br>indexing that prove their value as an <br>investment. Now there won't be any high <br>flyers but I want to sleep at night and <br>get comfort in the effienciey of the <br>overall market.  Most index funds come <br>without sale charges and their annual <br>expenses tend to be amoung the lowest in <br>the industry.  Index funds typically <br>out-perform a large percentage of the <br>actively managed funds.  It seems like a <br>no brainer.<br>You can start with a S&P500 index(or a <br>50/50 combination of a growth and value <br>index funds).  You can add a small <br>cap and an international index fund.  <br>As time goes on the indexing concept <br>will most likely lead to a myriad of <br>investment options as fund companies <br>develop more and more index funds.<br>

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:jmartin@platinum.com">SpaceGhost</a> on November 03, 1996 at 17:06:44:<p>
There are a couple of things I really like about index funds.  One is that they are "no brainers".  You don't need a wiz kid managing the fund in order for it to "perform" as expected.  Second, there is not a lot of turnover of stocks, meaning less tax bite.  Besides, I think it is very possible for both individuals and fund managers to over-manage money.  I've done it before myself.  I've spent time "thrashing" in my brokerage account before, making a little for myself and a bunch for my broker (I'm expecting at least a fruit cake from them this Christmas, but I'll go ahead and buy a couple of pumpkin pies just in case). A lot of non-indexed funds don't perform much better, if at all, than indexed ones.  I think they are great for cases where you want to park your money and forget about it for a good while.  They make great additions to retirement vehicles.

Any thoughts on international <br>funds for 1997? I read an <br>article that said you should <br>have 40% of your money on <br>international funds.It makes <br>kind of sense since the USA <br>stock market is overpriced and <br>you could pick up cheaper <br>stocks overseas.  <br>

I'm tired of hearing the word VOLATILITY<br>I'ts just another excuse for under<br>performance. PBHGX is down A full 7% <br>since The top of June despite a 1500 pt.<br>rise in the Dow. -----I know when to <br>pull the trigger when I make a miscue --<br>Lets compare returns, instead of trying <br>to play catch up with Mr Pilgrim.------<br>FTCHX vs. PBHGX-- A difficult tech mkt.<br>it is ---check the difference and maybe <br>we can again join Mr Pilgrim in Jan -or <br>whenever the mkt is going "my way"<br>

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:AlexNC@cris.com">Herbert Alexander</a> on February 08, 1997 at 15:14:00:<p>
Shouldn't there be an investment paradigm or strategy that addresses the retirement needs of a new generation of investors, the Tweeners?  Today's market is driven by the retirement savings plans of the Baby Boom generation.  Boomers, who are now advancing in years and income, have a tremendous appetite for stocks (and bonds) as they build reserves for the looming winter of retirement years.  This heavy demand by a huge cohort of the population has created the persistent bullish trend of the market.<br>The 'Tweeners, that cohort of the population born between the Boomers and their Generation X progeny, will likely face an entirely different market as the comparatively affluent Boomers begin to convert savings to income for retirement expenses.<br>'Tweeners face the challenge of being in a trough of the population-wave in the US.  With adequate information, they should be able to employ this unique position in a successful retirement-savings and investment strategy.<br>Please offer your comments.

Would I be better off holding the mortgage when I sell my home or taking the proceeds and reinvesting in another vehicle for income?

<p>Message Posted by <p><a href="mailto:sammy2@execpc.com">Dick Voigt</a> on January 06, 1997 at 22:22:54:<p>
At age 56 1/2 I'll be retiring next <br>month after 31 years of employment with <br>the State of Wis.  I need to choose an <br>annuity option.  <p>the option many "young" retirees take is <br> one which pays an extra amount (in my <br>case $600 monthly)over the basic option <br>until age 62(when social security can <br>kick in) and than a decreased amount  <br>from then on (in my case 286 less than <br>the basic)ie: under the basic option I <br>would receive approx $1900/month for <br>life (yearly increases/decreases based <br>upon investment results) or $2600/mo <br>until age 62 and then approx 1625 for <br>life; again changed yearly based upon <br>investment returns.<p>Any advice on how to analyze whether to <br>take the accelerated version vs the <br>"basic".  My preliminary analysis <br>indicated that if I live beyond age 73 <br>I'd receive more in total $'s under the <br>basic.  On the other hand, the <br>accelerated version would enable me to <br>continue my current monthly mutual fund <br>investments.<p>Advice will be appreciated!!  Thanks
