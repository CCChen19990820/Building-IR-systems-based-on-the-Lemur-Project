Policy</FONT></H1></DIV>

<PRE>  </PRE>



It is not unusual to find community gardens in major cities. What is hard to find
is an officially adopted "policy" which supports and encourages community
gardens. The City of Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation approved such a
policy this spring (April, 1996). <P>

The vast majority of people support the policy. However there are a few people
who oppose the decision. Some of their comments are attached at the bottom of
this page

<H1>The Policy</H1>

<P>


<H3>Definition:</H3>

<P><BR>


The Board recognizes community gardening as a valuable recreation activity that
can contribute to community development, environmental awareness, positive social
interaction and community education. The Board will collaborate with interested
groups in assisting the development of community gardens. <P>


For the purposes of this policy, a community garden is defined as a community
environmental education program operated by a non-profit society.  The program
has the following features: <P>


<UL><LI>A piece of land is utilized by the society to produce food and flowers
for the personal use of society members. <P>


<LI>A community education program is in place which encourages the involvement of
schools, youth groups and citizens who do not have an assigned plot in gardening
activities. </UL> <P>

<H3>Clause One:</H3>



The Board will support the development of community gardens in Vancouver through
the following means: <P>


<UL><LI>Providing access to information on the development and operation of
community gardens. <P>


<LI>Assisting interested groups in searching for suitable land for the
development of community gardens. This inventory must include City-owned land;
land controlled by other government agencies, and privately owned land.

<P>

<LI>Assisting in the development of user agreements with the owners of sites
chosen. <P>


<LI>Assisting with the development of a community environmental education
program. <P> </UL>

<H3>Clause Two:</H3>



If it is determined that park land is the most suitable site for community
gardens, the following conditions will apply: <P>


<UL><LI>The garden is developed at no cost to the Board, except that prior to the
first season, the Board will, at its cost, prepare the site for planting by
removing grass, ploughing the soil and adding compost.

<P>

<LI>A community consultation process indicates neighbourhood support for the
garden.

<P>

<LI>A garden site plan must be drawn up and approved by the General Manager. The
plan must include the layout of the plots and indicate any proposed structures or
fences.

<P>

<LI>A non-profit society agrees to develop and operate the gardens according to a
users agreement which will specify the term of use, management responsibilities,
user fees and access procedures including the following specific terms: <P>


<UL>a)	The term of the user agreement will not exceed five years.

<P>

b)	Allotments of space must be made from a waiting list on a first come first
served basis. <P>


c)	Membership in the Society, and the opportunity to be allotted a plot, must
be open to any resident of Vancouver. <P>


e)	No pesticides are to be used. <P>


f)	Allotment fees charged by the society must be approved by the General
Manager. <P>


g)	The Society must adhere to maintenance standards set by the Board. <P>


h)	No barriers to general public access to the site can be erected.
<P></UL></UL>

<HR>


<H3>Further information on the policy.</H3>



<H3>Discussion</H3>



The policy commits the Board to helping groups find resource information on
gardens and locate suitable sites in the City. It also describes the conditions
that must apply if it is determined that a park site is to be used for a
community garden. <P>


It is the intention of the policy that groups interested in establishing
community gardens prepare an inventory of all land in the neighbourhood that
might be suitable for such a purpose. Board staff will assist in this search.

<P>

If it is determined that a park is the only suitable site for a garden, the
policy also recognizes the need to ascertain if there is neighbourhood support
for the project. This is consistent with the process used for all park
development projects.

<P>

As a result of the public consultation process, a number of changes have been
made to the policy. <P>


<OL><LI>The original proposal contained a requirement that "Use of an allotment
plot cannot exceed two years. At the end of the second year, the holder of the
plot can have his or her name added to the bottom of the waiting list." Garden
enthusiasts objected to this clause stating that the 2 year tenure was too short
in terms of the effort and commitment necessary to develop a mature plot. Members
of existing gardening societies also made the point that there is a reasonable
natural turn-over of plot holders that occurs each year. Also, staff, in
reviewing all of the material collected from Municipalities across Canada and
part of the U.S. could not find any examples of community gardens where such a
clause was considered necessary. As a result this item has been deleted from the
proposed policy. <P>


<LI>During the consultation process many supporters of community gardens made the
point that there is a difference between an "allotment garden" and a  "community
garden" While an allotment garden may in fact be defined as only a piece of land
used by individuals to produce food and flowers for the personal use of society
members, a community garden goes beyond that to include common areas that are not
allotted to individuals, and education programs that involve schools and youth
groups in gardening activities. As a result of this input, the definition of the
policy has been changed to reflect this concept. <P> </OL>

The proposed policy also recommends a number of specific terms that should be
included in any lease with a society. The rational for these items are outline
below: <P>


<UL>a)	The term of the user agreement will not exceed five years.

<P>

When the Board has permitted an organization to operate a public facility, it has
been the normal practice to limit the term of the agreement to five years.  This
ensures that the Board has the ability to regularly review these operations to
ensure that they are being administered in the public interest. <P>


b)	Allotment of space must be made from a waiting list on a first come first
served basis. <P>


This condition is to insure that the allotments are made on a fair and equitable
basis. The waiting list will be maintained by each operating society. <P>


c)	Membership in the Society, and the opportunity to be allotted a plot, must
be open to any resident of Vancouver. <P>


Although the initial impetus for the establishment of a community garden usually
comes as a result of local interest, parks are paid for by all residents of
Vancouver, and any interested citizen should have the right to apply to receive a
plot. There is opposition to the requirement from all community garden
supporters. They maintain that in order for the gardens to be tended and
developed and maintained to a high standard, it is crucial that the plot holders
live in the community where they have easy access to the garden. <P>


d)	No pesticides are to be used. <P>

This is consistent with the Board's Integrated Pest Management Policy. <P>


e)	Allotment fees charged by the Society must be approved by the General
Manager. <P>

This is to ensure that fees are kept to a reasonable limit. This is a standard
clause in all agreements with groups permitted to operate Board facilities. <P>


f)	The Society must adhere to maintenance standards set by the Board.

<P>

This is to ensure that the gardens are maintained in a manner that is consistent
with the level of maintenance on the park. <P>


g)	No barriers to general public access to the site can be erected. <P>


The gardens must not appear to be an exclusive area where the public is made to
feel unwelcome.<P> </UL> <HR>


<H3>The opinions of those opposed to the policy.</H3>


"Park gardens are a misuse of public lands. Parks are established for the use of
all. Many of our lovely public parks have children's playgrounds, tennis courts,
bowling greens, soccer fields, tracks, picnic tables and beautiful gardens and
trees. <P>

"But cut any of this into a garden allotment, and it is now for the use and
enjoyment of only one person. It becomes, in effect, a piece of private land.
This is wrong, unethical and absolutely contrary to the intent of the charters
which gave us our parks." <P>


"It seems to be a 'feel-good' type of thing on the face of it, but it is very
wrong. When you look at it closely, you have to ask how many people can benefit
from it. There are other public lands we could utilize. Let's get away from,
every time we want land, looking at public parks."

<H3>Summary</H3>



The presentation addresses four points. It starts with a few quantitative data
about community gardening in Germany and gives an example which relates to the
difficulties to provide urban land for small gardens in Berlin, Germany.

<P>

The second point refers to the zoning law in Germany. This law affects community
gardens with respect to their legal status. Since the plans which this law
requires must become approved by a local council, the provision of land for
allotment gardens is a concern for local elections also. Here the long-standing
democratic traditions in many community gardening associations prove to be very
helpful. This includes various commissions on local and state level which have
become established as a consequence of the first 'Small Garden and Small-Rent
Land Law' of 1919. In this context a special dimension of open space politics
during the Weimar Republic (1919-1933) and its meaning for community gardens is
shortly sketched. It is the idea to integrate community gardens into people's
parks. Much later, in the 1970s, community garden development plans were
commissioned as part of comprehensive open space plans in order to get an
overview over local conditions, and help to meet the demand for small gardens.
Here again the city of Berlin serves as an example of the ongoing struggle for
urban land for gardening.

<P>

The third point has a closer look at the contributions of community gardeners to
a democratic urban culture. It includes a short reference to the consequences of
party-political streamlining during National Socialism (1933-1945) for community
gardeners associations. Another aspect relates to various public celebrations
organized by allotment holders. Additionally the meaning of community gardens as
expressed in literature and in songs is briefly addressed.

<P>

The presentation concludes with a few remarks to the future of community gardens
in Germany as part of an urban culture. Here, again only briefly, the meaning of
gardening as a leisurely activity for people in a highly industrialized society
and the need for organized action is pointed out.

<P><BR>


<A NAME="introgerman"><H3>Introduction</H3> <P>

More than 150 years ago a special garden arrived in many European cities, the
community garden or as it is also called the allotment garden, the jardin
ouvrier, the volkstuin, the Kleingarten, and so on. Given the long history of
cities this may be regarded as a fairly short period.

<P>

<I>Image: garden areas in the surroundings of Athens, Greece, around the 4th
century B.C. (Carroll-Spillecke 1989:29)</I>

<P>

So we know from antiquity, for example from the city of Uruk in Mesopotamia, that
about one third of the total area was covered with gardens. We also know that the
citizens of ancient Athens in Greece had their gardens along the shores of the
rivers at the periphery of the city. Nobody called these gardens community
gardens or allotment gardens or the like. Nevertheless I believe we are not
completely off the track if we imagine these gardens similar to the community
gardens which we are accustomed to see for more than 150 years in cities.

<P>

<I>Image:medieval garden work</I>

<P>

Now, I do not plan to go through the cultural history of small gardens as part of
the worldwide process of civilisation. Rather I want to focus on a fairly recent
aspect of gardening.

<P>

<I>Image: Japanese community gardens / allotment gardens in Fukuoka, Kyushu, site

phenomenon.    <FONT SIZE=2>{cf. Gr&ouml;ning, Gert and Joachim WOLSCHKE-BULMAHN:
Von Ackermann bis Ziegelh&uuml;tte, Ein Jahrhundert Kleingartenkultur in
Frankfurt am Main, Studien zur Frankfurter Geschichte, Band 36, Frankfurt am Main
1995}</FONT> They are part of Chinese as well as Japanese, Russian, Brazilian,
American, Canadian, and, since I want to talk about that, of German, and many
other cities around the world. Allotment gardens in German cities, such as
Berlin, Hannover, Leipzig, and elsewhere, are the result of a multitude of
interests. Private as well as municipal, and state interests are involved.


<P> In Germany the private interest in a community garden is often associated
with the name of Daniel Gottlieb Moritz SCHREBER (1808-1861). In the first half
of the nineteenth century SCHREBER was the head of the orthopedic clinic at
Leipsic, Saxony in Germany. This association is misleading since SCHREBER himself
had nothing in mind with community gardening. If, then SCHREBER may become
connected to community gardening since he demanded outdoor physical training for
children, and this was an early interest in community gardening in some areas in
Germany.


<P><I>Image: sign Kleingarten Schreberverein, community gardening association,
Leipsic, Germany</I>


<P> Since open space for children's play had become reduced considerably within
the inner city quarters in Leipsic, several citizens formed an association on 10
May, 1864 and decided to have a children's playground established somewhat
further out of the city. This goal was achieved on 22 August, 1864.<FONT SIZE=2>
{for a history of the early garden associations in Leipsic, Germany, see BERTRAM,
Christian and Gert GROENING: Leipziger Schrebervereine und ihre
gesellschaftspolitische Orientierung zwischen 1864 und 1919, Frankfurt am Main
1996}</FONT> In 1868 Carl GESELL (1800-1879) who supervised the activities of the
children, had the idea to subdivide part of the playground and provide the
children with small garden beds. The children, however, were not as patient with
gardening as was needed, so soon their parents took over and enlarged the tiny
beds of their children to somewhat larger lots which were called 'Familienbeete',
i.e. family beds. They were dedicated on 7 June, 1869. Soon after it was decided
to fence them in and have little arbors or huts erected. A first set of rules for
conduct was developed and by 1870 around 100 gardens were established. Since
these gardens were located around the playground area, which the association had
rented, and since this association had named itself "Schreberverein", i.e.
'Schreber Association', the gardens there became known as "Schrebergärten",
'Schreber gardens'. This association still exists today in Leipsic, although they
once had to move their gardens and their playground from one location to another
in the city.

<P>Oviously the community gardeners in Leipsic have been quite successful. A
statistical survey of 1890 may indicate this.

<P> <I>Image: 'Schrebergärten' and 'Familiengärten' in Leipzig 1890, Hasse 1891.
So much for the private interest.</I>

<P> Then there is a municipal interest in community gardens. It is reflected in
various ways of communal self administration. The municipal parks department, the
planning department, the real estate department and other municipal authorities
deal with community gardening.


<P> The state interest precipitates in acts and successive orders. So there is
the federal law for community gardens of 28 February, 1983 and the most recent
amendment of 1 May, 1994. This amendment provides new rules for the rent which
may be collected from allotment gardeners. <FONT SIZE=2> { The amendment changed
paragraph 5 of the 'Bundeskleingartengesetz', the federal law for allotment
gardens, such: "As rent, related to the total area of the garden site, not more
than the fourfold amount for what amount may be taken for local professional
growth of fruit and vegetable may be taken"; the German original is: "Als
Pachtzins darf h&ouml;chstens der vierfache Betrag des orts&uuml;blichen
Pachtzinses f&uuml;r erwerbsm&auml;ßigen Obst- und Gem&uuml;seanbau, bezogen auf
die Gesamtfl&auml;che der Kleingartenanlage, verlangt werden".}</FONT> For the
new states which joined the Federal Republic of Germany an especially added
amendment to paragraph 20, paragraph 20a,  rules a time differentiated rise of
the rent. F&uuml;r die neuen Bundesl&auml;nder gelten folgende in § 20 a
getroffene &Uuml;bergangsregelungen: Ab 1.1.1996 darf h&ouml;chstens das
Dreifache, ab 1.1.1998 h&ouml;chstens das Vierfache dieses Pachtzinses verlangt
werden. All these interests are related to each other and ultimately shape the
politics of community gardening in Germany. If the interests of allotment
gardeners are served or not depends upon their strength as an organisation. And
this is what community gardeners in Germany have understood quite well early on.

<P>

<I>Image: First Reichs-community gardeners conference in Berlin-Neukölln in 1921
</I>

<P> Generally one cannot buy an allotment garden, although quite a few people own
their lot. Usually one rents an allotment garden by joining a community gardeners
association and signing a sub-lease with this association, like you rent an
apartment from a housing corporation. The municipal union of the allotment
gardeners associations rents all of its land via a general lease with the
municipality. This lease rules, among other things, that the municipal rule for
gardening,  the 'städtische Gartenordnung', must be followed. Not only lower
courts (Amtsgerichte), but also administrative courts (Verwaltungsgerichte), and
even the federal constitutional court, the Bundesverfassungsgericht, <FONT
SIZe=2>{So hat z.B. das Bundesverfassungsgericht in seinem Urteil vom 12.6.1979
die Chancen, einkommensschwacher Bev&ouml;lkerungsgruppen einen Kleingarten zu
pachten, die ohnehin gering waren, weiter verringert. Das
Bundesverfassungsgericht stellt in diesem Urteil zwar fest, daß "die
Bereitstellung von Kleingartengel&auml;nde zu den Aufgaben der Gemeinde
geh&ouml;rt", nimmt gleichzeitig aber auch eine "erzwungene Mangellage" (BVG
1979:48) der Gemeinden zur Kenntnis, die es ihnen unm&ouml;glich mache, "dieser
Verpflichtung - gleichg&uuml;ltig aus welchem Grund - nicht oder nicht in
ausreichendem Maße nachzukommen" (BVG 1979:47).}</FONT> decide on legal matters
which concern community gardens.

<P> I do not want to go into the manifold branches of legal debates which relate
to allotment gardening in Germany. I will rather address some more general
political aspects of community gardening as part of an urban culture in Germany.

afterwards:

<LI>The development of the number of allotment gardens in Germany and a few
examples

<P> <LI>The reflection of the meaning of community gardens in municipal planning
and citizen participation in urban politics

<P><LI>One example for the urban dynamics of allotment gardening

<P> <LI>The contribution of community gardeners to a democratic urban culture

and finally

<P> <LI>a few remarks with regard to future prospects of allotment gardening in
Germany

</OL> <P><BR>

<H3><A NAME="develpgerman">1. The development of the number of allotment gardens
in Germany</H3>


<P><I>Image: allotment gardens in the site 'Lindener Berg' in Hannover, um
1910</I>


<P> From a few hundred lots in early nineteenth century the number of allotment
gardens in Germany rose to about 450 000 in the early 1930s. In 1949, four years
after the end of World War II the number was about 800 000. Today, in 1996, the
federal union of allotment holders, Bundesverband der Gartenfreunde e.V. counts
about one million members, <FONT SIZE=2>{cf. GARTZ 1995:20}</FONT> who have
organized themselves in about 14 000 associations all over the country. <FONT
SIZE=2>{cf. WALZ 1994:63}</FONT>


<P> In the old states of the Federal Republic the statistical figure  is one
allotment garden for 120 inhabitants. In the new states this ratio is about one
garden for 30 inhabitants. Given that the ratio in the new states gradually
approaches the one in the old states then there will be about 650 000 households
who have organized themselves in an allotment gardening association.


<P> <I>Image: Leipsic Johannistal, community gardens established in 1832, still
on the old site of 1832 near the observatory, X 1993</I>


<P> For various reasons quite a few of the community gardeners do not join an
association. Around 1960 their number was believed to be as high as the one of
those who were organized.<FONT SIZE=2> {cf. HESSING 1958}</FONT> Although there
are no statistics available for those gardens I assume that their number has
decreased considerably over the past decades and may now be near 100 000 in
Germany. Many of these gardens belonged to what was called railroad-agriculture,
"Bundesbahnlandwirtschaft" because they were established on lands which the
state-owned railroad company holds as reserves for future railroad purposes.<FONT
SIZE=2> {In the 1990s the railroad company felt it would no longer need this land
and offered many of these community gardeners, who often were employees of the
railroad company, to buy the land for their garden, and many did.} </FONT>In 1990
such community gardens counted for about seven percent of the total area in
Berlin (West). <FONT SIZE=2>{about 3 500 allotment gardens on about 150
hectares}</FONT> Other non-organized community gardens are located on areas which
belong to private land owners, public institutions, churches, and large
companies.

<P> In 1996 about 78 000 allotment gardens belonged to the state-wide
allotmentholders union. <FONT SIZE=2>{cf. the table 'Kleingaerten im Bezirk' ,
Berliner Gartenfreund, 5/5, May 1996, which counts 78 043 allotment gardens for
Berlin. The number of inhabitants was 3 475 392, this is one allotment garden for
44 to 45 inhabitants} </FONT>This is about 10 000 more than in 1931 for the
'Provinzialverband Groß-Berlin', the provincial union of Greater Berlin. In the
same year the union merged with the allotmentholders union in the state of
Brandenburg, and now represents the people who operate some 160 000 small
gardens.<FONT SIZE=2>{this number was given by FRIEDRICH, the head of the
Brandenburg union of allotment holders, at a meeting by the Naulin-Stiftung,
Naulin-Foundation, in October 1995; in 1931 about 10 000 allotment holders (cf.
GUTMANN 1931:89), in 1995 about 75 000 (cf. GARTZ 1995 and membership table in
Der Fachberater, 43, August 1994, 145), were organized in the provincial union of
Brandenburg} </FONT>



<P> As part of the urban culture allotment gardens mirror the dynamics of urban
development. So their number decreased between 1950 and 1960 since the need to
produce fruit and vegetable for economic reasons on one's plot gradually ceased.
If community gardens vanished after 1960 because the land was needed for new
schools, for new residential developments, for new roads, new commercial and
industrial districts, for new track and field facilities, and even for new urban
parks,<FONT SIZE=2>{cf. GRÖNING, Gert: Tendenzen im Kleingartenwesen, dargestellt
am Beispiel einer Großstadt, Beiheft zu Landschaft + Stadt, 10, Stuttgart
1974}</FONT> then they re-emerged somewhere else in town with the help of the
municipal authorities.


<P> <I>Image: allotment garden site 'Am Segen' in Dortmund, established in 1959
</I>

<P> Where municipalities had no strategy for the acquisition of municipal real
estate, conflicts with allotment holders associations tended to become harsh, and
sometimes lead to organised political protest.<FONT SIZE=2>{Minor demonstrations
for the preservation of community gardens are common.The most recent
demonstration occurred in July 1996 in Berlin. It related to a fairly large
number of allotment gardens which should become destroyed for the widening of a
shipping canal and a sluice as a consequence of increased ship traffic due to the
German unification in 1990.}</FONT>


<P> As one example for the reasons which endanger existing community gardens in
Germany in late twentieth century I refer to a once fairly large area in
Berlin-Charlottenburg.

<P> <I>Image: considerations for relocation of allotment gardens in Berlin (West)
1985, e.g. Charlottenburg-Nord</I>

<P> In the early 1950s there were about 15 000 allotment gardens in this area in
Berlin-Charlottenburg. More than 12 000 were lost over the years. Residential
areas such as the satellite town of Charlottenburg-Nord, the Paul-Hertz-Siedlung,
the Berlin wholesale market  (Großmarkt an der Beusselstrasse), the prison for
women, the fire engine station Siemensstadt, the James-Moltke-School, the
highschool center (Oberstufenzentrum) am Halemweg, several industries
(Industriebetriebe), a comprehensive road network (the Rudolf-Wissel-Bridge, the
Kurt-Schumacher-Damm, the Goerdeler Damm, the Jakob-Kaiser-Platz, the enlargement
of Heckerdamm, the Friedrich-Olbricht-Damm and the connection road to Tegel
airport) were all constructed on earlier community gardens. <FONT SIZE=2>{ cf.
Berliner Gartenfreund 1985:3, 13}</FONT>


<P> The remaining 3 000 allotment gardens on about 115 hectares suffer extreme
pressure since several years. The blueprint for the land use plan of 1984 - a
zoning plan which covers the entire territory of a city - dedicated about 40 of
these 115 hectares to industry and commerce. If implemented about another 1000
gardens would have been lost since there was no land available in those days for
the walled-in city of Berlin (West). However, the gardens still are  there and
their holders still fight.

<P> It is the city, however, which also offers chances for community gardens.
These chances must be recognized and they must be used creatively for the
establishment of gardens. Allotment holders in cities in Germany know that. Time
and again and with admirable perseverance they publicly announce their interest
to garden in an urban environment, especially when local elections are ahead. So
far they have been fairly successful. Part of the success story is their
publicity work.<FONT SIZE=2> {cf. the volume 'Kleingaerten and Kleingaertner im

that the journals which the allotment holders produce are helpful.

<P><I>Image: Berliner Gartenfreund, title cover, April 1993, We celebrate and we
demonstrate together</I>

<P> Early in May 1993 z.B. the Berlin Senate approved of a program to secure 85
percent of the allotment gardens in Berlin. Without constant and massive presence
of the representatives of the organized allotment holders such a decision would
not have been taken. In 1994 the Berlin Senate approved of the land use plan for
the entire city which showed these 85 percent.

<P> - Point to the motto 'Gemeinsam feiern und Demonstrieren'

<P> There is no end and there will be no end for the fight for community gardens
in cities. Urban land use always was a fight for various interests. When
community gardeners feel they must no longer fight for their gardens other urban
land uses will take over.

<P> Now, my second point.


<P>



<H3>2. <A NAME="reflectgerman">The reflection of the meaning of allotment gardens
in urban zoning planning and citizen participation in urban politics </H3> <P>
The zoning law in Germany requires public authorities only to follow the land use
plan but not private companies and private people. Nevertheless it serves as an
overall guide line for land use. Therefore it is essential to secure areas for
community gardens in the zoning plan (Bebauungsplan), which is the legally
obligatory  (rechtsverbindlich) plan.

<P> This double-bind system of land use planning has been called into question
for a long time. In Berlin about 80 percent of the building acticity in recent
years needed exemptions from valid zoning plans.

<P><I>Image: blue print for a zoning plan for allotment gardens, publicly
announced in a local newspaper with a city-wide distribution, publicly laid out,
citizens invited to participate, announcement in the newspaper 'Der
Tagesspiegel', Nr. 14004, 18 October 1991</I>

<P> Community gardens which have become part of a zoning plan are harder to
relocate. With respect to community gardening this means that only where gardens
are shown in a zoning plan a certain medium to long range, five to twentyfive
years, guarantee for their use is given. Most of the allotment gardens in Berlin
do not have such a permanent status. <FONT SIZE=2>{cf. GROENING et al.
1985}</FONT>


<P><I>Image: different status of allotment gardens in Berlin (West) 1985,
Gr&ouml;ning 1985</I>

<P> In 1985 in Berlin (West) only 112 hectares, i.e. only 2 779 lots, or less
than six percent of the entire area for allotment gardens were granted that
status. The legal term for these gardens is 'Dauerkleingaerten', i.e. permanent
allotment gardens. However, since many of the other gardens are included in the
urban land use plan, they are believed to be fairly safe. With that in mind the
importance of local elections becomes obvious. The Berlin Senate coalition
between Christian Democrats and Free Democrats had to step down in 1989 not the
least because it could not offer satisfactory answers to the questions the
allotment holders had asked with respect to the provision of sufficient land for
gardens in the 1984 land use plan. The following coalition of Social Democrats
and Greens did better work but had to step down as a consequence of the
re-unification of Berlin. The  coalition of Christian Democrats and Social
Democrats which rules since then approved of the land use plan which saved 85
percent of the allotment garden area in Berlin.


<P> Nevertheless much tension hangs around in urban community garden matters in
Berlin. There is no longer the need to find land for gardens within the territory
restricted by the wall which defined Berlin (West) until 1989. However, since the
recent question whether the states of Berlin and surrounding Brandenburg should
merge or not was clearly answered with 'no' by a majority of about 60 percent,
strategies which would allow for an inter-state plan for the provision of land
for community gardens need considerable sophistication.

<P> Who wants to preserve and develop community gardens for the future as part of
an urban culture, must engage well equipped and well prepared in the permanent
debate about urban land use.

<P> <I>Image: session of the urban committee for environmental protection and
green spaces in Hannover, 1989, Gr&ouml;ning und Wolschke-Bulmahn 1989 </I> <P>
This includes to recognize and make use of the chances for citizen participation
in urban open space politics. Democratic decision processes are essential. For
the first time in Germany such procedures could be followed during the Weimar
Republic in the years between 1919 and 1933. They were immediately reflected in
allotment gardening. Self responsibility and self administration became
important. <FONT SIZE=2>{ cf. PAULY 1930:630-631}</FONT> Strong political
associations of community gardeners and a state interest in allotment gardens
made for the first act for allotment gardens, the KGO, the "Kleingarten- und
Kleinpachtlandordnung", the allotment-garden-and-small-land-rent-law of 31 July,
1919, and the rules for implementation which followed on 27 January, 1920. The
Prussian version of these rules advised all larger communities, especially the
large cities, to establish a local authority for community gardens and
recommended it to work in close co-operation with municipal authorities which
were there already, and which had to do with real estate and residential
housing.<FONT SIZE=2>{"Allen in Betracht kommenden größeren Gemeinden,
insbesondere den Großstädten, ist die Einrichtung solcher Kleingartenämter
eindringlichst nahe zu legen, die ihre Tätigkeit in enger Fühlung mit den sonst
vorhandenen städtischen Aemtern, deren Aufgaben mit der Boden- und Wohnungsfrage
in Beziehung stehen (Tiefbauamt, Wohnungsamt, Grundstücksamt) auszuüben haben und
gegebenenfalls mit einem dieser Aemter verschmolzen werden können"FÖRSTER
1924:13}</FONT>

<P>Further on these rules demanded to establish expert commissions who would have
to present opinions with regard to all rent prices, and other important matters.
Consequently such authorities and commissions became established in most major
cities. In Hannover e.g. a municipal authority for small garden horticulture and
the promotion of allotment gardening became established in summer 1919. A
commission, who operated as commission for the promotion of small garden
horticulture, "Ausschuß zur F&ouml;rderung des Kleingartenbaus", was also
established. <FONT SIZE=2>{the commission started to work in 1925, cf.
WOLSCHKE-BULMAHN, Joachim and Gert GR&Ouml;NING 1989:207}</FONT> The city of
Frankfurt on Main established 'a mixed commission for small garden horticulture
and small animal breeding', "Deputation f&uuml;r das Kleingarten- und
Kleintierzuchtwesen", who had to deal with all questions related to small garden
horticulture and small animal breeding  on 14 February 1921.<FONT SIZE=2>{ cf.
GRÖNING and WOLSCHKE-BULMAHN 1995:17}</FONT>



<P> Whereas democratic rules seem to have been observed in community gardening
relatively early, the Weimar Republic seems to have been crucial for the
establishment of democratic planning procedures.

<P> <I>Image" demand for an eight-hour-work-day, poster Weimar Republic, 1920
</I> <P> In 1920 e.g. the 'German Society for Garden Art', "Deutsche Gesellschaft
f&uuml;r Gartenkunst", which had lay persons and experts as members, combined the
demand for an eight-hour-work-day with the demand to provide allotment
gardens.<FONT SIZE=2>{ cf. ANONYM 1929:165}</FONT>




<P><I>Image: Gartenkunstbestrebungen auf sozialem Gebiete, garden art on social
territory, title cover of a brochure which assembled lectures with that topic.
The lectures were given at the annual meeting of the German Society for Garden
Art in Nuremberg in 1906</I>


<P> Other people believed in the educational value of  allotment gardening. They
felt that the more the allotment holders associations shape themselves according
to their special needs and bring the individual gardeners together as a team, the
more they will contribute to an education which is needed for the citizen of a
republic. <FONT SIZE=2>{ cf. SILLER and SCHNEIDER 1920:6}</FONT> So the
organization of small garden holders in local associations, in state-wide and
nation-wide unions, serves as means to enliven the democratic constitution of a
country. In Germany the state of Schleswig-Holstein has the oldest allotment
garden state law. It dates back to 1948. Based on it a state-wide small garden
commission, "Landeskleingartenausschuss" became established. The commission
advises the state ministry for food, agriculture, forestry, and fishery. The law
rules that the voice of the members of this commission should be heard in all
basic administrative matters with regard to community gardening.<FONT SIZE=2>{

<P> It is a prejudice that gardeners tend to neglect politics. Rather one must
point to the engagement in democratic elections in the associations and unions of
the community gardeners. <FONT SIZE=2>{ cf. KAMPFFMEYER 1926:72-73}</FONT>


<P> In late twentieth century there are more than 100 000 persons in
allotmentholders associations in Germany who serve as presidents, vice
presidents, cashiers, certified experts in plant protection, in commissions for
the evaluation of gardens and arbors, gardening consultants, and volunteers in
various other matters of community gardening self administration.<FONT SIZE=2> {

<P><I>Image: my arbor is my castle, Lindener Berg, Hannover</I>


<P> Some even discover a creative dimension in the construction of their arbor.
Although arbor construction has to follow a set of rules nowadays, there is still
some chance left to follow unconventional ideas not only in arbor construction
but other areas as well. This interest was seen early on in the Weimar Republic
<FONT SIZE=2>{cf. BEHNE 1920:439}</FONT> and then even stimulated architects to
support this creativity as a means to promote the art of people.<FONT
SIZE=2>{This was the 'Arbeitsrat f&uuml;r Kunst', the work-council for art, who
had leading architects of the 'Neues Bauen' as members  cf. BEHNE

<P>A special dimension of open space politics in the Weimar Republic was to
integrate allotment gardens into the publicly accessible open space of cities.
Thus community gardens could no longer fall prey to other land uses. They served
as supplement to the various attractions public open space provided. The paths
which lead through the gardens and to the playgrounds were opened to the public.
Additionally the provision of open space in densely populated areas was
guaranteed by community gardens. They proved productive both for their private
operators and for the cities because the rents brought some municipal income.

<P> A new concept for peoples parks combined playgrounds, track and field areas
and allotment gardens. The "Zentralverband Deutscher Arbeiter- und
Schrebergärten", the Central Union of German Workers- and Schreber-Gardens,
demanded in 1919, "to save from future building activities, in the interest of
the state and the municipalities, such small garden areas with especially
favorable location and infrastructure if they are ready to offer their
infrastructure in a mutual benefit way to the public. As play- and work-parks
they must become part of the new urban land use plan, as are the public sites,
and must be given to their operators in hereditary tenure". <FONT SIZE=2>{ cf.

Landscape architects such as Ludwig Lesser (1869-1957), Harry Maasz (1880-1946)
and Leberecht Migge (1881-1935) repeatedly published articles about community

<P> For the first time the interests of community gardeners became visible in
urban politics during the Weimar Republic in Germany and became part of the
struggle for urban land use.

<P>- another example for the municipal interest in community gardens during the
Weimar Republic


<P> Anger, frustration, and feelings of loss which were associated with the
unexpected cancellation of contracts and relocations of small gardens which often
have been cultivated on barren land early on elicited the demand for permanent
garden areas.


<P><I>Image: water provision, Sillergaerten in Vienna, Austria, XVI. district,

<P> In 1911 already the "Verband der Laubenkolonisten Berlins und Umgegend", the
'Union of  Arbor Cultivators', jointly with the "Gemeinn&uuml;tzige Gesellschaft
zur Hebung der Lage der unteren Klassen", the 'Charitable Society for the
Improvement of the Situation of the Lower Classes' had voiced such a demand.


<P> In Frankfurt on Main Otto Ernst SUTTER claimed that the main task of the
municipal community gardens authority which he demanded was the "establishment of
permanent sites for small gardens which must be taken into account for future
urban land use plans". <FONT SIZE=2>{SUTTER 1917}</FONT> Nevertheless thousands
of small gardens were lost over the years but re-emerged time and again elsewhere
in the cities.

<P> The community gardeners stuck to their demand for permanent land for small
gardens and gradually succeeded. Around the 1970s the first municipal plans for
the provision for allotment gardens were made in some cities in Germany. The more
complex the urban structures had become in the course of the twentieth century
the more difficult it became to solve a land use problem on a given spot. More so
many municipalities had no overview of who provided what land where for whom for
small gardens.


<P><I>Image: community gardens development plan with a set of goals, Wuppertal
1978</I>

<P> So  "Kleingartenentwicklungs-plaene", community garden development plans,
were commissioned, which should help to get an overview over local conditions and
which should suggest how the existing demand for small gardens could be met.
Although these plans did not answer all of the questions related to the provision
of land for community gardens, for this kind of open space, they demonstrated a
new quality in the struggle for urban land use.


<P><I>Image: Logo, Gr&uuml;n f&uuml;r Berlin, title of a brochure which
communicated the value and meaning of small gardens to the public, 1994</I>


<P> Before the wall came down in Berlin a program for the provision of allotment
gardens was part of the political debate. All of that then became superseded by
the events of 9 November, 1989, when the wall was opened, which consequently led
to the re-unification of the city. Now there were thousands of community gardens
in East-Berlin as well, and they still are there. The city then had to develop a
new land use plan. It was approved in 1994. The community gardeners then were one
of the most active groups who fought for their interest in urban horticulture and
ultimately succeeded in an unprecedented way. They were able to secure 85 percent
of the land which was used for allotment gardens in this new land use plan. They
showed that for them gardening on small lots is a major asset of life quality in
a big city.

So much for the second part of what I wanted to communicate. And now a few words
about the contribution of community gardeners to a democratic urban culture.

<P> The states in Germany support community gardening in various ways.
Additionally the cities support allotment gardening with millions of Deutschmark.


<P> Democratic procedures have a long tradition in many of the allotment
gardening associations. However, this has not been so ever since. When the
National Socialists took power on 30 January, 1933 they required National
Socialist streamlining and enforced it on 29 July, 1933. Consequently the
articles of the associations were changed. This meant blood-and-soil-ideology, no
more elections, the NSDAP, National Socialist Workers Party, appointed the
'leaders' for the community gardening associations, and no Jews as community
gardeners, only 'Germans of Aryan descent' could operate a garden. <FONT

organisation.<FONT SIZE=2>{ cf. WOLSCHKE-BULMAHN und GR&Ouml;NING 1989}</FONT>


<P> This helps to explain why after the liberation from National Socialism the
administration under Allied command in Germany had to specify that  "democratic
procedures must be observed, i.e. secret elections at a membership meeting, for
the election of a president of a community gardeners association, must be
guaranteed".{GR&ouml;NING und WOLSCHKE-BULMAHN 1995:37}



<P><I>Image: school garden lessons in Zdar nad Sazavou 1992</I>


<P> An important meaning of community gardens as part of an urban culture is to
introduce into the consciousness of a city and of a society values that are
associated with gardening. Values which show that gardening is an enjoyable
activity, it makes life outdoors enjoyable, it is a social activity. In more
generic terms, community gardens can help to become sensitive for a proper
handling of non-human nature in an urban environment.

<P> Community gardens are much more than just an assembly of lots and arbors.
They are important spaces for the garden facet of urban culture. Politics-related
activities of organized allotment holders or community gardeners serve their
political representation as part of the urban fabric. They serve, however, also,
to provide a social frame for a number of garden-related activities which many
perceive as enhancement of their quality of life in an urban environment.


<P><I>Image: summer party in allotment gardens, Sommerfest in der Laubenkolonie,

<P> In Berlin the community gardeners celebrate once a year with the help of the
Wilhelm-Naulin-foundation. Their festival for everybody is called in Berlin slang
the 'Laubenpieperfest'. It is just one example of such acticities. For a long
time after World War II, Wilhelm NAULIN was head of the state union of the
allotment holders in Berlin. Additionally, as long as Bonn was the capital of the
Federal Republic of Germany, the community gardeners organized a 'Laubenpierfest'
in Bonn and invited all the politicians there.

<P><I>Image: summer party in Berlin-Charlottenburg-Nord, Kolonie Bismarcksruh,

gardens and celebrate with the community gardeners is very much alive and a
well-known part of the urban culture in Berlin</I>


<P> In recent years quite a few of the allotment holders associations celebrated
their 25th, 50th, 75th, or even 100th anniversary and for that reason published
the histories of their associations. We have documented some of these in our
study on allotment gardening in Frankfurt on Main which was published in
1995.<FONT SIZE=2>{cf. GR&Ouml;NING, Gert and Joachim WOLSCHKE-BULMAHN: Von

<P> Such histories show, not only for the members of the association but also for
a larger public, the many aspects of social life in a community gardening
association. The Berlin magazine for the friends of gardens, "Berliner
Gartenfreund", is full of such historic accounts.


<P> One such history discovered the Berlin singer Claire WALDOFF as a community
gardener on a still existing site 'Kissingen' in Berlin. WALDOFF was a very well
known singer in the days of the Weimar Republic. She sang in shows and her songs
are still known in Germany. The community gardeners at "Kissingen", named one of
the paths which leads through their gardens, "Claire-Waldoff-Weg",
Claire-Waldoff-Path, and a building which the community gardeners had built for
their own social activities was named "Cafe Claire". The building is also used as
a meeting point for senior citizens in Berlin-Wilmersdorf.<FONT SIZE=2>{cf.
KLEMKE, Rainer E. (ed.): 70 Jahre Kleingartenverein Kissingen e.V., Kissinger
Gartenhandbuch, 107, Berlin-Schmargendorf 1989}</FONT>


<P> In a line of her song "Wat braucht der Berliner, um jl&uuml;cklich zu sein?",
'What is it a Berliner needs to be happy?', Claire WALDOFF answered:

<P> "-'ne Laube, n' Zaun und n' Beet!", an arbor, a fence, and a flower bed.<FONT

<P> In her song about allotment gardens, "Laubenkolonie", her sympathy with this
kind of gardening is obvious. The second stanza reads:


<P> <I>Image: lovers, perhaps on their way to a community garden, painting by

<P><I>Image:  allotment garden of butcher master Ernst Schäfer, painting by

expressed in the painting by Liselotte Schramm-Heckmann, which shows the garden

<P> Literature also reflects social and cultural aspects of community gardening.
In 1936 Paul GURK wrote a novel "Laubenkolonie Schwanensee". It was reprinted in
1987.<FONT SIZE=2>{cf. GURK, Paul: Laubenkolonie Schwanensee, Ravensburg
1987}</FONT> GURK tells a story about  community gardens which gradually vanish
since their land is needed for the construction of a new road. In another novel
by Georg LENTZ, life on the allotment garden site "Tausendschön" between the end
of World War II and the building of the Berlin wall in 1961 is the main issue. It
appeared in 1989. Here the gardens were replaced by a residential
development.<FONT SIZE=2>{cf. LENTZ, Georg: Weisse mit Schuss, Berlin 1989;  "Muckefuck" and
"Molle mit Korn", are the other two earlier parts of the LENTZ' trilogy. In 1989
they were made into a ten-part TV series. The film was made in an old allotment
garden site in he southwest of Berlin, which was located immediately next to the
wall, Kolonie Schlachtensee-Süd. The series was first shown on 12 May 1985, the
40th anniversary of the Berlin blockade by the Soviet Union. On 6 May 1995 the
series was repeated in the B1 program for Berlin.}</FONT>


<P> Why some architects and landscape architects tend to despise allotment
gardens may illustrate a sentence from the novel by LENTZ: "For the international
building exhibition SCHAROUN and GROPIUS made their residential machines out of
concrete. At the same time Buseberg (one of the allotment gardeners, G.G.), tried
to glue upon the facade of his arbor a fake of panel-work. A philistine? (Ein
Banause?) After that it was warmer in Busebergs arbor. The next summer arbor
vitae climbed the white areas between the dark beam-work (Einen Sommer darauf
rankte sich wilder Wein an den weißen Flächen zwischen dunklem Balkenwerk)".

<P> Especially community gardeners who had to relocate their garden have a deep
rooted distrust in planners.

<P> <I>Image: Kleingartensanierung Mecklenheide Tannenkamp, Hannover
1974-77</I>

<P> This holds true even if renewal programs for old community garden sites try
to find a compromise between the manifold urban claims to land use. A rhyme, which I am unable to translate appropriately into English, voices this
distrust. I will read it first in German and then try an English translation:

<P>

Gott sch&uuml;tze uns vor Not und Feuer May God protect us from emergency and fire

<P>

Vor der Stadtplanung und der Steuer. From city planning and tax.

<P> This is the end of my third point and I will now conclude with a few remarks
to the future of allotment gardening as part of an urban culture in Germany.


<P>

<H3>4. <A NAME="remarkgerman">A few remarks to the future of allotment/community
gardening in Germany as part of an urban culture</H3>

<P><I> Image: he says his position as president of our association has
contributed considerably to the development of his self!, Fachberater fuer das
deutsche Kleingartenwesen, 1994:64</I>


<P> A less prejudiced, sober, self-critical approach to community gardening seems
appropriate and necessary. It is not just physical design and planning but always
the social and historical and urban context of community gardening which matters.
Only this approach allows for adequate solutions to urban horticulture which must
become developed in a mutual process of exchange and learning by the allotment
gardeners and other urban groups.


<P> - an example for self-critical assessment of small gardeners

<P><I>Image: a delightful garden dwarf - this is a compliment I can
return, Fix und Foxi 1986</I>
<P>
 On the occasion of a garden
competition a member of the jury is surprised by the beautiful garden dwarf and
the speaking dwarf returns the compliment "Whatever may be said against community
gardening as an ideology - one can not say that it is indecent to ask for one
location on earth where one can prove one's identity". <FONT SIZE=2>{cf. SACK 1972:14-17}</FONT>
I would be delighted
to learn about many community gardens where the wealth of chances for urban
gardening is explored.


<P><I>Image: standardized arbors, Frankfurt standard 1931</I>

<P> An attitude which finds that community gardens are only acceptable to the
public if they follow a uniform design, can be looked at from every corner, needs
to be changed. Economic reasons may advise to use standardized materials, as a
basic guideline standardization is misleading, however.


<P> Many allotment gardens express joy of life and originality, some even
caricature mildly a society where consumption seems to be the only standard.


<P><I>Image: the chain dog in an allotment garden may be this is a hint
for dog owners who visit this garden to attach the leash to this chain
</I>

<P> Such caricatures are an indicator for tolerance. Some of the
constructive work in allotment gardens communicates to me that here at least, a
job situation, which has become meaningless for whatever reasons, is compensated
for in a kind of 'Gesamtkunstwerk'.


<P> Even if some of the attempts to give meaning to leisure at least may appear
clumsy, what is wrong with it?.


<P> <I>Image: an allotment garden as a 'Gesamtkunstwerk' in
Leipzig-Johannistal, 1993</I> 


<P> One could argue that here people try to make sense of their lives in the
field of reproduction, whereas it is more important to make sense of one's life
in the field of production. But is that not miles away from social reality? Not
to mention that many of those who ridicule community gardens show no interest to
have a closer look at this context?

<P> <I>Image: allotment holders enjoying their garden, Dr. Schreber site, Leisic,
Germany 1996</I>

<P> The sphere of production tends to loose meaning for many people in the highly
industrialized countries of Europe and North America. The hopes of full
employment for all seem fairly futile. It may be an illusion to assume that the
job in a factory or a commercial business will remain the central contents of a
life. Times of unemployment tend to become longer and longer and in certain city
quarters become more and more publicly visible.





<P> The interest of the industrialized societies as such will be to allow all of
their members to survive on a minimum scale, which means the more affluent will
pay for a certain 'income' for those unemployed for whatever reasons. Interests
to spend leisure in an autonomous way may then be followed. There will be,
however, strong other interests which will do all to prevent such autonomous use
of leisure and try to allow for it in a very restricted way only.


<P> One field which can develop enough power for autonomous use of leisure may be
the community gardening of the 21st century. This needs organized activities of
self conscious citizens in a more and more urbanizing world.

<P>While many organizations in cities in the United States, Canada and
Europe have been networking to develop their inner city garden projects,
important work has been going on in cities that are part of what is
often called the "developing world". Many opportunities exist in Urban
Agriculture for joint projects between the richer and poorer nations.
Information on this work has been hard to find but recently a number of
excellent publications have come out which show International Urban
Agriculture being treated very seriously by development professionals.

developing world were required to import half of their food supply.
Urban agriulture, it is argued, can reduce this dependency. But most
Southern governments do not support it...<B>Cities Feeding People</B>

agriculture should have a larger role in feeding the urban
population."</BLOCKQUOTE>

urban farming in China, Bolivia, West Africa, Uganda, Ethiopia,
Tanzania, and Kenya. <BLOCKQUOTE>"Millions of people in the growing
cities of the South have become urban farmers in recent decades. They
grow vegetables, raise livestock, poultry and fish, and practice many
other types of agriculture. Researchers are paying increasing attention
to a sector often neglected by governments, one which can contribute
greatly to the sustainability of cities. The practitioners of urban
agriculture need no convincing about its merits. They enjoy better
diets, higher income, employment or combinations of all these
benefits."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<TT>By Alyson Chisholm B.Sc.(Agr.) (C) 1996<BR>

<P><BR>

I have just recently returned to Canada after three years of living and working in Albania. For those who have never heard of Albania, it is a tiny, formerly communist country bordered by Montenegro, Serbia, Greece and the Adriatic Sea. It was the last of the Eastern European countries to end communist rule and it did so relatively peacefully. The country is now experiencing a transition to a free market economy and democratic government after 50 years of centralized control and a harsh dictator. As you can imagine, the transition is a gradual and often painful process for the Albanian people. This transition period is especially difficult because the level of isolation and oppression experienced by the average Albanian under communism was greater than anywhere else in Communist Europe.</P>


<P>During the rule of Enver Hoxha, Albania's version of Joseph Stalin, all land and possessions were collectivized and controlled by the State. People could own nothing and had no say in their lives; people were not allowed to travel outside the country except under special circumstances, and then those who returned were watched very closely to make sure they told no one of their experience. They were, however, allowed to lie and tell people that Albania was the most developed country in Europe. The arm of the "Sigurimi", or secret police, was long and the arrest of one person usually resulted in the internment or persecution of his/her entire family.</P>


<P>Following the end of communism, Albania's population went wild and destroyed as much of the communist-built infrastructure as they could. They destroyed schools, hospitals, irrigation systems, greenhouses, government buildings and industrial sites. Now, this struggling country is trying to build an economy and is also having to deal with rebuilding destroyed and decaying infrastructure. The jobless rate is very high, corruption is endemic, services such as hospitals and schools barely function and water and electricity flow erratically. The lack of law and order allowed for the development of illegal trade with Serbia during the war, and this has changed focus nowadays to concentrate on illegal traffic in drugs and people. The Mafia is a significant force in the country and people have little recourse to justice. Albania has gone from being a communist country to becoming a developing country, as the gap between the richest and the poorest grows greater every day.</P>


<P>I lived initially in Tirana, the country's capital city, and later in Shkodra, a large city in the country's North, I witnessed an incredible amount of initiative in people while I was there; people knew that there was no one to help them but themselves. People sold everything imaginable, either on the streets or through holes cut in their walls. The preferred commodities were bananas, cigarettes, alcohol, fruit and vegetables as well as an assortment of other consumer items. The social welfare system supported unemployed people by paying them $5.00/person of working age per month. This would buy about 14 loaves of bread, to give you an idea as to the cost of living, and most people had to rely on the support of the extended family to keep them fed and clothed.</P>


<P>People also supported themselves by raising their own food, in the cities as well as the rural areas. Many people lived in apartment buildings and had no access to land, so they grew tomatoes in old bowls and paint cans on their balconies.  People who did have an enclosed yard would often plant vegetables in the small space of soil that may be available. The preferred crops were onions, garlic, tomatoes, cucumber, cabbage, leeks and peppers. Onions and garlic would be hung up to dry and last throughout the winter, whereas tomatoes, peppers, cucumber and cabbage were usually pickled in brine or vinegar, when they were not being eaten fresh in salads.</P>

<P>Many people only had space on their roof for gardening, so would often plant grape vines in the ditch outside their house, train the vines up the side of the house and then onto a rooftop trellis. This way the harvest was safe and accessible to the family, though the root stock was often at risk to vandals and bad drivers. The most impressive example I had seen of rooftop gardening was at the home of a 70 year old man who lived near us. His house was built of plastic, wood and metal sheets, covering a concrete frame, and he and his 40 year old wife cooked and heated on a wood stove. He had no yard at all but managed to create a bountiful garden on the roof using any available container which could hold soil. Onions, garlic, tomatoes and grapes transformed what is usually an uninspiring cement structure, into a wonder of greenery and sustenance.</P>



<P>Leonora, a woman I worked with in Shkodra, lived with her husband's family according to Albanian tradition, and helped her father-in-law raise two pigs in the unused downstairs of their house. The pigs ate the family's kitchen waste: bread, leftover food, vegetable parings, etc. The pigs were kept for special occasions, for example to supply meat for Leonora son's birthday feast. If their neighbours minded the smell or noise, they said nothing; most people are in the same situation and understand that people do what they have to in order to survive.</P>


<P>Another neighbour in Shkodra kept chickens in her back yard for eggs and meat and fed them on food scraps. People coming to stay with us from out of town always complained about the noise of the neighbour's rooster, but I was never very bothered about it myself. Unfortunately, the rooster did not have a good fix on day break, and crowed whenever the mood hit it. Otherwise, though, it seems to have served its purpose.</P>


<P>Every small space of land was put to use and an empty lot with grass growing in it would soon be grazed by urban sheep. I used to go running early in the mornings and met a lot of livestock on my way. Horses usually grazed in the park across from the Town Hall, the park having the benefit of available drinking water in the fountain. Sheep picked daintily off of garbage heaps which were located at almost every residential street corner and smelled strongly of decay. Cows would be herded along the quiet, early morning roads to take advantage of grassy verges, playing fields, cemeteries and empty lots. Livestock in the city did make for a few inconveniences for drivers and pedestrians, but considering all of Albania's problems at the time, this was not a high priority issue.</P>


<P>Working in developing countries has allowed me to witness what good use people can make of their local environment, if they are left to their own devices. there is so much around us which we can use in a sustainable fashion, but our society has brought us up not to recognize or utilize these resources. In many parts of the world people are raising food in urban environments and, with some forward thinking, planning and consultation with one's neighbours and town council, this is a perfectly feasible way of supplementing one's diet with high quality food, anywhere in the world.</P>

<P>
We consider urban agriculture to be a truly important instrument for increasing food production in our cities, for providing better nutrition to the urban poor and for increasing their revenue.
</P>



<P>
In 1992, by order of the National Development Board, part of the Prime Minister's Office, we started a program to improve the food/nutrition situation in our country, giving special emphasis to the question of involving residents of urbanized areas in vegetable production. 
</P>



<P>
Based on our program, 1993 was proclaimed "Food Year in Mongolia", however due to inefficient management by the government, the tasks to be accomplished were not implemented. 
</P>



<P>
From 1994 to the present we have been running an Agricultural Consultancy Exhibition, out of our Metropolitan Library. This acts as a one-stop extension service centre where beginning gardeners can learn the basics of vegetable growing, and buy seeds/seedlings, fertilizers and tools for their garden. 
</P>



<P>
In 1990/1991, 850 families grew vegetables in the city. This year (1996) the number has increased over 20 times reaching 21,000. More and more families have begun to realize that home gardening might be a way to improve their standard of living. Raising sheep and other traditional domesticated animals is no longer possible for many people. 
</P>


<P>
However, major changes in the economy have meant that the food situation is not improving. On the contrary, the number of extremely poor families has been rapidly increasing as a result of high inflation.
</P>



<P>
During the "command rule period" all foodstuffs were delivered cheaply from state farms, and citizens were not permitted to grow vegetables to sell. Now a difficult transition period is occurring as the old central supply system is breaking down and puzzled people know very little about how to maintain a sustainable, small-scale agriculture business. 
</P>



<P>
The recent "shock therapy" measures taken by the Government have created great hardship as prices for consumer goods rise while salaries remain unchanged. This coming winter and spring are expected to be extremely difficult for the poorest  families. Average salaries are 30 USD while 1 kg of potato costs approximately $0.4, cabbage - $0.5, wheat flour - $0.4, meat - $0.7, and the  prices for coal, wood, electricity, transportation, etc. are skyrocketing.  
</P>
<BR>



<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>The Project</H3>



<P>
Mongolia is the only developing country whose territory is situated in extremely cold and dry weather conditions nearly 1,000m above sea level (Ulaanbaatar is at 1,300m). Wind erosion is a dangerous factor and in the spring, our "storm  season", the wind speed frequently reaches 18 to 20m per second. 
</P>

<P>
For 7-8 months of the year, our temperature stays below the freezing mark, and in spring and early summer when we need moisture most, precipitation is very rare. 
</P>


<P>
The "Model Ger Area" sub-project ("ger" is a felt-covered traditional nomadic dwelling) is one of the most important components of our program. In 1994 ten poor families in the Northern part of the city suburb were given seeds, tools and on-the-spot consultation. In 1996 we expanded these activities to 10 different ger micro-districts in Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western parts.  Teachers working there were selected from gardening experts living in these places, each having his own plot of cultivated land. 
</P>


<P>
Responsibities of the teachers: 
</P>


<P>
<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
	<LI>they must grow plants on their own premises;
</P>


<P>
	<LI>they must organize training classes and allow visitors to come to see their garden;
</P>


<P>
	<LI>they must teach 10 of the poorest families in their area who want to start a garden;
</P>


<P>
	<LI>they must distribute and sell seeds/seedlings, fertilizer, tools and educational materials.
</P>
</OL>



<P>
As well as staying in contact with each other, the voluntary teachers maintained continuous contact with the Exhibition Hall opened in the city's Central Library where they received, if necessary, advice from professional agronomists working there on a rotational basis. 
</P>



<P>
This past summer, weather conditions created problems for the 100 families taking part in our program. (10 families supported by every teacher.)  In the early growing period, which is May and the beginning of June, almost no rain fell. This was followed by forest fires. Precipitation began in July. Heavy rains started in mid-July causing flooding which badly affected the vegetables growing in the suburban districts. Also hail destroyed a number of cabbage fields. Lastly, on July 31 there was a sudden frost and snowfall in some regions. 
</P>



<P>
We are now registering families who wish to develop home gardens in 1997, and in cooperation with the newly elected city council we hope to develop a comprehensive program to promote city farming in the coming years.  
</P><BR>




<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Request</H3>



<P>
We would like to ask urban agriculture organizations to send us photos of hydroponic, roof, balcony and other appropriate technologies already in use in other countries for an Exhibition named "City Families Feeding Themselves". This Exhibition will be important for making the Government, the City Mayor, district governors, as well  as UNDP, World Bank and other donor organizations in Mongolia, regard urban agriculture as a top priority in their effort to eradicate poverty and malnutrition.
</P>

<P>
Because residents are predominantly of nomadic background, there is a strong need to display agricultural tools and short-season seed varieties which can grow under Mongolian cold/dry weather conditions, etc. If different types of seeds become available, we will establish a kind of Demonstration Garden, like in Vancouver, of plants that can be grown under severe conditions.  
</P>



<P>
Major co-operating organizations for our work were: the Agro-Biology Faculty of the National Agriculture University, the Plant Protection Board, the Seed Control Board, the  Food and Agriculture Board of the city municipality, the "Mother Nature" Centre,  ADRA and others.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Excerpt from Growing Food in Cities (footnotes removed)</FONT>
</P>



<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Cities and the Environment</H3>



<P>
At present. most cities are highly unsustainable, Although they only cover 2% of the earth's surface, cities consume 75% of its resources. The social, environmental and economic impact of a city, country or even an individual upon world resources has been described as its "footprint''.
</P>



<P>
London's total footprint extends to about 125 times its surface area of 159,000 hectares, to nearly 20 million hectares. Home to only 12% of Britain's population, London nevertheless requires the equivalent of the entire productive land area of Britain to sustain itself.
</P>



<P>
Why is this so? Partly because we use more than we need and partly because we do not use what we do need efficiently. According to Ministry of Agriculture  Fisheries and  Food calculations, London requires 2,400,000 tonnes of food a year. which it imports from all over the world. Every day, London disposes of 6,600 tonnes of household waste of which only some 5% is recycled, even though much of this is compostable organic matter.
</P>



<P>
In effect, in their present form. cities are like parasites. feeding upon a global hinterland which is increasingly unable to sustain them. But the relationship is not intrinsically an exploitative one, Indeed, cities are potentially highly sustainable, and one aim of this report is to show that through urban food growing. the country can, in a sense, be brought to the town - to the advantage of both. In the words of the European Union Green Paper on the Urban Environment  "Recreating the diverse multi-functional city of the citizen's Europe is . . a social and economic project for which 'quality of life' is not a luxury but essential."

<DIV ALIGN=LEFT><H2><FONT COLOR="RED">How Does Your Garden Grow 
</FONT></H2></DIV>

<TT>by Patima Tha Hla<BR>
excerpts from an article in the Bangkok Post, August 20,
1994</TT> <P>

About 50 vegetable lovers from all walks of life gathered at a
seminar entitled <I>Khrob Khrua Diao Kan</I> (United Family), held at the
Bangchak Petroleum Public Company's headquarters earlier this month.
The seminar aimed to teach members of the public how to grow their
own vegetables.
<P>
Most of those who attended the seminar have tried their hand at
planting their own vegetables, whether they live in extravagant
homes, small townhouses without much vacant space, or commercial
buildings with no soil in sight.
<P>
They had all managed to find some small corner of their home for
vegetable cultivation.
<P>
Asst. Prof. Thawat Lawapaoraya, one of the seminar's two speakers,
assured his audience that the amount of space is not the main factor
in growing healthy vegetables. With the right treatment, vegetables can flourish
even in the most confined areas.
<P>
Vegetables do not need to be planted on land or in earthenware pots.
They can be grown in gasoline containers, cement basins, plastic
baskets, or even the hanging earthenware pots normally used for
decorative plants," said the researcher for the Royal project on
agriculture.
<P>
Thawat also introduced the "vegetable condominium" method for those
who are pinched for space but still want to grow a variety of
vegetables.
<P>
He said vegetables like <I>khuenchai</I> (celery), <I>tang-o</I>
(galand-chrysanthemum), parsley, and lettuce can be planted in square
plastic baskets lined with six to seven centimetres of prepared soil.
The baskets can even be stacked on top of each other up to six or
seven high. This method is suitable for certain types of vegetables
which do not require strong sunlight.
<P>
"If you grow an assortment of vegetables with different harvesting
periods, you will have ripe vegetables to pick all year round,"
ensured Thawat.
<P>
Based on his study, the ideal garden is one sized 36 square metres in
which 32 kinds of vegetables can be planted. The vegetables should be
a mixture of short-life and long-life types, he suggested.
<P>
Short-life vegetables are lettuce, <I>phak khana, khuenchai, phak bung</I>
(morning glory), <I>tang-o</I>, scallions, cucumber, and cauliflower, while
long-life vegetables include <I>krachai</I> (galangal), parsley, sweet
basil, cha-om, and ginger.
<P>
Starting with the most basic requirements to produce good crops,
Thawat revealed that soil preparation is the most important. He said
the soil found in Bangkok markets is not fertile enough and its cost
is unreasonably high.
<P>
Mixing your own fertile soil is the best way to ensure that seeds
will sprout. Perfect soil consists of four components: sand, loose
soil, chaff ash, and compost fertiliser, mixed together in equal
amounts.
<P>
Fertile soil lies at the heart of planting success, but methods and
technique are other major factors gardeners should not overlook.
<P>
Thawat suggested vegetable seeds should be nurtured temporarily in
sand mixed with chaff ash until their first leaves sprout, when they
can be transferred to prepared soil.
<P>
He added that vegetable seeds are best brought during the winter
season, because they are newly picked and can be stored in the
refrigerator until their planting seasons. Seeds that are sold during
their planting seasons are usually old ones from the previous
planting and are not likely to yield good results.

<H3>Planting Times</H3>

The following are planting times for a variety of homegrown
vegetables:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>November to January: for onions, garlic, tomatoes, celery,
cauliflower, <I>phakkat khao</I> (white cabbage), and <I>kuichai</I> (Chinese
leek).

<LI>February to April: coriander, lettuce, cucumber, <I>phak bung, thua
yao</I> (long beans), and <I>phak khana</I>.

<LI>May to September: <I>phak khana, kuichai</I>, sweet corn, scallions, and
<I>buap</I> (loofah or dishcloth gourd).

<LI>August to October: Laotian coriander, lettuce, chili, <I>kuichai,
phakkat khao</I>, and <I>phak bung</I>.</UL>

<H3>Pest Control</H3>

Thawat offered some additional tips for creating optimum vegetable
growing conditions:
<UL>
<LI>Place a black or blue neon light above containers which contain
water mixed with sulphur powder to attract night insects, some types
of which like to lay eggs on vegetable leaves. The insects will fall
in the water.

<LI>Spray water mixed with detergent or dish-washing liquid on
vegetable leaves to prevent disturbances from insects.

<LI>Vegetables which do not need the use of pesticides are lettuce,
coriander, and parsley, because they are too bitter for insects.

<LI>Sprinkle lime powder around each vegetable to prevent fungus.

<LI>Water vegetables with the last water from clothes-washing, or any
water containing a small amount of detergent, which contains the
fertiliser phosphorus.

<LI>Make sure that vegetables receive direct sunlight at least half the
day, preferably all day. They should be planted or placed at the
north or south end of the house to avoid its shadow.

<LI>For houses with pets or other animals, fences should be installed
around the garden to keep vegetables from harm.

<LI>To avoid using chemicals, plant herbs like marigold, galangal,
ginger, sweet basil, holy basil, lemongrass, <I>sap suea (Eupatorium
odoratum), boraphet (Tinospora tuberculata), cha ploo</I> (wild betal
leaf), and <I>sadao</I> (nim tree) among other vegetables to keep pests
away.</UL>

<H3>Natural Ecology in the City</H3>

"The urban environment is not really appropriate for growing
vegetables," said speaker Asst. Prof. Charnchai Limpiyakorn of
Chulalongkorn University's Engineering Faculty, who focused on
reviving natural ecology in the city.
<P>
Many people give up trying to grow vegetables due to the many
difficulties involved. Some lack the proper methods, while others
find it difficult to overcome physical problems of the urban
environment.
<P>
Charnchai, who grows vegetables at home and surveys vegetable
gardens, shared common problems urban growers might encounter.
<P>
He said those who live in congested areas might find planting
vegetables difficult. People who live in new housing estates may also
have problems, as the soil may be infertile as the result of being
dug up from too deep underground.
<P>
While outside physical factors are essential to planted vegetables'
survival, biological factors also play an important role in nurturing
vegetables.
<P>
"Successful planting requires a biological environment which includes
various microbes and insects. But sadly, all of these have
disappeared from Bangkok," he said. "This is nature."
<P>
To revive land successfully, three to five years are needed for
organic matter to digest itself, according to Charnchai. "It's quite
a long time to wait, but the results will last a long time."

<P> Much of Philadelphia was built after the turn of the century, with
the population finally peeking in 1950 at about two million. Since then
it has dropped back to just over one and a half million, not much more
than in 1900. <P> This loss of people and housing leaves a lot of open
space for urban agricultural development. The hundreds of garbage strewn
vacant lots (sometimes constituting 50 percent of a city block's area)
have stimulated citizens to create what has been called "the largest
comprehensive urban greening program in North America." <P> According to
Libby J. Goldstein, president, Food & Agriculture Task Force, Philly's
501 community vegetable gardens produced $1,948,633 worth of fruit and
vegetables in 1994. A total of 2812 families (12,093 individuals) are
involved in the vegetable gardens. <P> Philadelphia has a wide range of
service groups dedicated to helping urban food gardeners, most acclaimed
being Philadelphia Green, Penn State Urban Gardening Program and the
Neighborhood Gardens Association. <P>

<TT>By Sean Cosgrove<BR> From his presentation to Habitat 94<BR>
Edmonton, September 20, 1994, <BR>as reported in <B>Cities Feeding
People: <BR>Urban Agriculture and City Planning <BR>in North &
South</B>. An IDRC Panel (papers). <BR>Presented by IDRC</TT>  <P>

The Island of Montreal, with a population of 2 million, has one of the
best community gardening programs in North America. <P>

<H3>Community Gardening Profile</H3>

Montreal began its community gardening program in the post-OPEC 1973
period, like most new wave community greening programs. Montreal has a
very extensive, well-organized and supported community gardening
program. Metro Montreal includes 15 municipalities which support over
100 community gardens. <P> The City of Montreal maintains the most by
far, and has some 75 garden sites, in many sizes, containing 6654
allotment plots. The largest garden site has 255 plots. I am going to
speak mostly about the City of Montreal program. <P> Their program is
run by the Department of Recreation, Parks and Community Development.
Soil, manure, fencing, water, tools, toilets, clubhouse/toolsheds and
ongoing maintenance are provided by the City. In addition, there are
five paid horticultural animators who are responsible for a group of
sites. These resource people answer any horticulture inquiries, work
with the executive of each garden group, and report on any maintenance
problems. Maintenance is then provided by the Public Works Department.

<H3>History</H3>

In the early 1970's, Italian and Portuguese immigrants in North Montreal
were guerrilla gardening. Noticing this, the City tried to regulate the
activity, and these regulations began to formalize a process to permit
and organize community gardens. The City soon found itself stuck in a
competition as neighbourhoods and groups fought to get land for gardens.
<P> The community gardens then found a political champion at the
Montreal Botanical Garden in Pierre Bourque, who sheltered the fledgling
program under his wing. There was a great expansion until the program
grew so large that administration bogged down. A complete review of the
program by the City of Montreal took place in 1985, the year of the
departure of Montreal's long serving boss-mayor Jean Drapeau. <P> The
review was very significant and resulted in the establishment of clear
policies for the establishment and operation of the gardens. The review
mandated that all gardens use organic methods. It created the role of
horticultural animator to help ensure a transition to organic gardening.
<P> The Department of Recreation and Community Development was given
over-all responsibility for the program. They co-ordinate several other
Departments who work on different facets of the program. These include:
Habitation & Urban Development; Provisioning and Buildings: Public
Works; and Planning and Policy.

<H3>Current Situation</H3>

The community gardening program is especially popular with senior
gardeners, age 55 and over. They are the majority in 39 gardens (and in
2/3 of the largest gardens). There is a multi-cultural presence in many
gardens, and eight gardens have a majority of neither "anglo" nor
"franco" citizens. <P> The gardens are very productive and have a long
waiting list. Inscriptions cost $5.00 per year and solicitations are
sent out in the monthly hydro bill. The City could site 12 new gardens
on the basis of their waiting list of 25%. <P> Every gardener must agree
to the rules of the garden program, such as the insurance stipulation.
Insurance is provided in the City program. Gardeners are grouped in lots
of 10 or 15 for insurance purposes. There is some flexibility in respect
to how each garden is organized. Gardeners must grow, however, at least
five different types of vegetables. They are now being allowed to grow
flowers in the common areas along the fenced borders. <P> Many of the
sites are on institutional land. Montreal relocated 12 gardens
(1986-89), at a capital cost of $400,000. They estimate costs of
$20,000. for the establishment of a new garden site of 90 plots. There
is official community gardening zoning for 13 garden sites. 22 gardens
are situated in City parks. <P> This is by far the largest, best
organized program in Canada, owing, no doubt, to their community
development goals and objectives. They are planning strategically to
improve the program.

<H3>Key Challenges in the 90's</H3>

In the 90's the program has conducted composting experiments in
one-third of the gardens, is donating food to community kitchens, and is
ensuring better access for disabled gardeners. It has also suffered
funding cuts and has lost half of its important horticultural animators.
<P> Other challenges that the program faces are the permanence of garden
sites, finding land for new  gardens, expanding existing ones and
replacing gardens that have been lost to development. Also needing to be
resolved is inter-departmental confusion about the availability of
resources and each department's working role.

<H3>Future</H3>

Pierre Bourque, community garden champion and a 30 year veteran of
Montreal's civil service, was recently elected Mayor of Montreal.
"Bourque has earned a reputation as a builder, be it the Biodome,
Botanical Gardens, or dozens of parks he's helped create or improve
during his tenure as the City's chief horticulturist and associate
director of parks." His victory could mean more resources for community
gardens. He has already called for more horticultural therapy projects
in the City.

Council is a Board Member of the American Community Gardening
Association. He wrote <B>Metropolitan Agriculture in Victoria B.C.</B>

<CENTER><H3>From the Editor:</H3></CENTER>

In 1977 a classic gardening film titled <B>The Vacant Lot</B> featured a
Montreal community garden. This 16 minute National Film Board of Canada
production is still available as part of a compilation video named
<B>The Plot Thickens</B> along with two other Canadian gardening shorts.
<P>

<DL><DT><B>The Vacant Lot</B>

<DD> The charming story of how a group of 176 senior citizens managed to
transform a useless vacant lot in Montreal into a garden of delights -
vegetables, flowers, and parties. It has completely changed their
attitude about inactivity and retirement. (16:15) </DL>

<DL><DT><B>My Urban Garden</B>

<DD>In a backyard plot the size of a living room, Halifax gardener Carol
Bowlby grows enough vegetables to last a family of five for seven
months. Her wealth of practical information will delight and inspire.

<H2>The Food Gardens Foundation</H2><BR>


<TT>(C) Copyright: City Farmer 1995</TT>

<P>Food Gardens' Director, Joy Niland, reports that her Foundation came
into being in 1977 and from small beginnings in Soweto its work spread
to countless numbers of people in urban and rural communities throughout
southern Africa. <P> Although the Foundation has about 1500 members who
live in the more affluent areas, the main focus of its work is with poor
and hungry people in urban and rural communities. For people in such
circumstances they teach only the simplest, grassroots, virtually
no-cost methods of restoring life and fertility to poor soil and
producing food. <P> People who follow the Foundation's gardening methods
discover that they can find all the needed resources close at hand, and
all they have to buy are a few packets of seeds. A low-cost Seed Service
is provided by the organization. <P> "As well as helping people to help
themselves and provide good food for their families," says Niland, "food
gardening can be a means of earning much-needed money. Children see it
as a way of earning pocket money!" School gardens  are a very important
part of the Society's work. <P> "We provide training courses for
community leaders and community development workers, enabling them to
promote and teach food gardening in their communities and set up
projects that have our ongoing support and guidance. <P>

<IMG  ALIGN=center WIDTH="471" HEIGHT="198" BORDER=2 HSPACE=6
SRC="afrbeds.GIF" ALT="garden beds"> <P>

<H3>FGF Method</H3>

The FGF (Food Garden Foundation) Method is a special method of growing
vegetables with very definite advantages. It is especially useful if
there is a shortage of land, water or money. <P> Briefly, the method
involves digging a trench, which is then half filled with "rubbish"
(organic matter) and topped up with dug-out soil. Seeds or seedlings are
planted immediately on top of this "compost heap". <P> The FGF Method
succeeds and gives better results than the "Scratch and Plant" method.
<P>

<H3>Resources</H3>

The Foundation sells a wide variety of resources in a number of
different languages including <B>English, Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa,
Tswana, and S. Sotho</B>. These resources include a video, slide
presentation, handbook for growing food in times of drought, and comic

<B>Australian City Farms, Community Gardens, & Enterprise Centre
Inventory (1996)</B> <BR>Dr. Darren Phillips of Hobart, Tasmania has
written and produced this timely 64 page booklet on city farming
"down-under". Copies of the booklet can be obtained from: <BR>Darren P.
Phillips <BR>Symbioun Australia, <BR>2nd Floor, 158 Collins St.<BR>
Hobart, Tasmania 7000<BR> The cost is Australian $15 per copy, plus
postage and handling of $5 within Australia and $7 (Overseas surface
mail) (though this charge may be adjusted for posting multiple copies.)


<P> "This inventory currently lists over 40 centres for Australia, drawn
from all six States and the Australian Capital Territory, bar the
Northern Territory. Many other centres are believed to be in existence
or in very early formative stages of development. The centres listed
vary widely in size, number of active site users, focus and range of
activities undertaken, period of establishment, etc. They extend from
large, highly organised centres with government support (usually local
government), to the communal gardening efforts of small groups of people
or small demonstration sites, through to exciting new 'Community
Supported Agriculture' business ventures such as that undertaken by
Lismore Challenge City Farm. This extraordinary range, highlights the
fact that it is not so much the size of the centre but the 'principles'
and methods of resource management being practised on-site that matter,
and that food production systems if well designed and maintained can be
highly productive in both small and large areas."

<P>There's a 'city farm' in Western Australia in the small city of
Perth. Clayton Chipper has e-mailed us about his group's attempt to
create a community green space in Perth's "sprawling, low density
suburbs built for cars."


<P>"We all wanted to move out of the city and find some greenery. Then
we thought, 'Why not bring the greenery to the city?'"


<P>Planetary Action Network set up this garden on a site in East Perth
that used to be a scrap metal, battery, and train recycling yard. "It is
about 7600 sq. meters in size and has three huge warehouses which have
been divided into education areas, artists studios and storage space for
all the strange and bizarre things people give us." says Clayton.


<P>"As one would think, with the site's history, our community garden
was very contaminated with heavy metals and hydrocarbons (oil), so we
removed about 60 cm to 1 meter off the top. Now what's left is white
'gutless' sand that we are helping along with some lovely compost and
bentonite clay which should provide us with a nice growing medium."


<P>On another area which includes the courtyard, all the gardens are
built on top of solid concrete and surrounded by tires. However because
there are no gutters or drains, this does not seem to work too well
during the rainy winter months.


<P>The organization runs environmental courses for unemployed people and
will soon be setting up an environmental resource centre which will
include computers and net access for environmental research and
communication.

<CENTER><IMG  ALIGN=left WIDTH="347" HEIGHT="223" BORDER=2 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10
SRC="perth2.GIF" ALT="Planted Tyres "></CENTER> <P>


<P>"We are mainly reliant on volunteers," (volunteer ages range from
young kids to retirees and pensioners) says Clayton. "Much is learnt by
interacting with such a large range of people.

plants,<BR> we grow people!"</B>

<P>Requests for information about school gardening, come in almost as
often as those for community gardening. <P>

<UL> <LI>"What do we do with the garden during the summer holidays?"
<LI> "Are there any curriculum materials written for school garden
projects?"<LI>"What other schools are doing this?"</UL>


<P></P> Lucky for the callers, there are many books, organizations
and even conferences that address these questions. When we began City
Farmer, we looked covetously at barren boulder dust and asphalt
school yards and envisioned food gardens as learning centres. Obviously
we weren't alone in these dreams. Now children's gardens can be found in
schools all over the world both outdoors and in the classroom under
'growing' lights.


<P></P> We took part in the development of one such school garden at  <A

Elementary School</B></A> in Vancouver in 1986 and from that experience
published a 16 page booklet titled <B>School Garden Guidelines - How to
Teach Children about Nutrition and the Environment</B> <BR>($6.00 from City
Farmer)


<PRE>  </PRE>In England <B>Learning Through Landscapes</B> publishes a

They learn about the similarities and differences among themselves
through the experience of growing, cooking, and eating food; important
elements in all cultures. The garden further helps students respect and
nurture the Earth and its peoples.

Before you begin this adventure you must have an idea of what you want
to share with the world. City Farmer, a non-profit society, started in
1978, promotes urban agriculture and has collected valuable information
that is difficult to find in libraries, bookstores or at other
information outlets.

<P> For us to be able to post information about our resources in a place
that is quickly accessible to people everywhere in the world is
appealing. On the Web we can update our material as often as we like so
that the latest information is always available. We can put up colour
photos, pictures, sounds, and short movie clips to make our
"publication" a multimedia event .

<P> Links can be made from our pages to pages of other groups anywhere
in the world so that readers get a broader picture of urban agriculture
than just ours. And these links are accessed by simply clicking the
computer mouse.

<P> City Farmer doesn't need a mailing list, a layout artist, a printer
or publisher, a distributor, tons of paper or postage to produce this
new publication. Readers can respond to our work effortlessly on the
Internet using E-mail. And we can question our audience using "Forms", a
special feature, that will allow us to gather statistics and views on
various subjects.

<P> Unlike Usenet where postings are removed each week, World Wide Web
pages remain up as long as the bills are paid.

<P> All the above can be accomplished by just one individual working
from home using a computer, colour scanner, modem and WWW account at a
Web server. This author used a Mac LC575 (1995), Microtek ScanMaker IIxe
and US Robotics mac&fax 14.4 modem.

<tt>By <a href="mailto:mlevenston@canadas.net">Michael Levenston</a>
<br>May 13, 1996</tt><p>

As Executive Director of City Farmer, based in Vancouver, I was responsible 
for preparing from scratch our Web publication <a href="http://www.cityfarmer.org">
Urban Agriculture Notes</a>.  The pages have been up on the Net since October 1994. 
Last month over 40,000 file were transmitted from our site, readers visited 
from 50 countries including Swaziland, Slovenia and Uruguay, and our 
Internet presence was noted in a front page story in The Globe and Mail. We 
are also listed in many books including the 1996 Canadian Internet Directory 
and Que's Mega Web Directory.<p>

We are included in 1000 Best Sites on the Internet published by New Rider 
Books, have been 'linked' by well over 100 other Web sites and we get an 
average of ten E-mails a day from readers who want to know everything from 
where to buy worms in Columbia for composting blood waste to Israelis 
wanting to know about ranching in Australia.<p>

The site has succeeded in helping us promote our work, gather information 
from around the world and get in touch with like-minded people. This article 
describes what has gone into creating and maintaining our site.<p>

<h2>Why Do It?</h2>

Before you begin this adventure you must have an idea of what you want to 
share with the world. City Farmer, a non-profit society, started in 1978, 
promotes Urban Agriculture and has collected valuable information that is 
difficult to find in libraries, bookstores or at other information outlets. <p>

Once you know you have something to say you must get down to the technical 
nuts and bolts of getting your documents on-line. <p>

Finding an Internet Service Provider (ISP) who is also a Web Server is 
first on the list. <a href="http://www.interchange.ubc.ca/index.html">The 
University of British Columbia</a> was our choice because they had already 
served us well for some months as a connection to the Internet. Local 
computer papers are full of ads describing similar services. Call a few and 
tell them what you plan to do and ask them what they charge. As well a list 
of ISP's can be found in @canadas.net <a href="/Maple-Square/Computers_and_Internet/isp.html">
Maple Square</a> by Province and City.<p>

<h2>Learning HTML for Web authoring</h2>

Once you have your account, it's time to learn how to write up your pages. 
You need an editing program and some knowledge of HyperText Markup Language 
(HTML).<p>

For the Mac I use a program called <a href="http://www.barebones.com/freeware.html">
BBEdit Lite</a> with either <a href="http://www.uji.es/bbedit-html-extensions.html">
BBEdit HTML Extensions</a> or an alternative <a href="http://www.barebones.com/third-party-extensions/HTML_Tools_v1.3.hqx">
BBEdit HTML Tools</a>.  But any word processor or text editor can assist you 
in your coding tasks. <p>

New programs to help you mark up your pages with HTML tags are uploaded to 
the Net almost every week so keep a lookout. Right now <a href="http://www2.apple.com/pagemill/TryDemo.html">
PageMill</a> from Adobe is a popular WYSIWYG Web page layout program. I'm 
testing out <a href="http://www.dsv.su.se/~jerry-am/pagespinner.html">Page 
Spinner</a> and <a href="ftp://cs.dal.ca/giles/">HTML Editor 1.1.4</a> having 
heard good things about them. Another extremely useful editor is <a href="http://www.sausage.com/">
Hot Dog</a> which is available for a variety of platforms.<p>

Lots of discussion about these programs and other Web publishing matters 
can be found on these very active Usenet newsgroups:<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="news:comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html">comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html</a>
<li><a href="news:comp.infosystems.www.authoring.images">comp.infosystems.www.authoring.images</a>
</ul>
<p>

<h2>How do you learn HTML?</h2>

When we began our site in 1994 there wasn't one book on publishing on the 
Web. Now there are dozens written on every aspect of the subject. 

Two new ones for example are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.webcom.com/taketwo/samstyn.htm">Teach Yourself Netscape 2 Web Publishing in a Week by Wes Tatters (Sams-Net)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.lne.com:80/Web/Books/Premier/index.html">Teach Yourself Web Publishing with HTML 3 in a Week by Laura Lemay (Sams-Net)</a>
</ul>
<p>

There are at least 4 magazines on the subject:
	
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.webtechniques.com/">Web Techniques</a>
<li><a href="http://pubs.iworld.com/wd-online/">Web Developer</a>
<li><a href="http://websight.com/">Websight</a>
<li><a href="http://www.ssc.com/websmith/">Websmith</a>
</ul>
<p>


There are also hundreds of documents on-line on the WWW that approach the 
subject from a variety of angles and these are free. Examples of these are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://miso.wwa.com/~boba/tips1.html">Bob Allison's Home Page- Tips For Web Spinners</a>
<li><a href="http://www.littleblue.com/webpro/">Web Professionals' Digest</a>
</ul>
<p>

The easiest method of learning HTML authoring is to find someone who will 
sit with you and show you the secrets. This will save you hours and hours 
of "what do I do next?" <p>

<h2>Putting Your Stuff in Your Directory</h2>

Once you have tagged the text, images, sounds, or movie clips in your 
editing program, these files are put in a folder. <p>

From your desktop you have to get these files to the Web Server. For me 
that means from my home computer to UBC's machine. I do this by simply 
connecting to the Internet and using an FTP [File Transfer Protocol] program 
to reach the directory at UBC where my Web documents reside. Then it's just 
a matter of selecting the files from my desktop, clicking twice and watching 
them upload to the UBC server where they are ready for the world to see. 
Changes can be made using this method in a matter of seconds.<p>

Your system administrator will get you started on all the correct procedures 
and then leave you to publish day and night. He will give you your home page 
address known as a URL. Ours is a "custom domain name" 
meaning we had to get it approved by Internic a central Internet naming 
office. We were charged $100 Per Year U.S. for the privilege and now no one else can 
use our name. <p>

	
We've been publishing on-line for almost two years now. What does that mean 
in terms of time and effort?<p>

Maintaining your pages can be a full time job. Experienced Webmasters are 
paid anywhere from $30,000 to $80,000 per year. <a href="http://www.hotwired.com/">Hotwired</a> 
one of the premier Web E-zine's, employs a staff numbered over 100.<p>

I maintain our site from home before work, evenings and on the weekend. You 
have to love your work to do this. Writing, editing, gathering images, 
tagging and laying out new pages all take hours. E-mail can come in seven 
days a week and you don't want to leave it sitting for too long unanswered.
Old links need to be updated. New software innovations have to be tested and 
promoting your site is a constant task...  you want new readers to know you 
exist.<p>

We are now placed as a link on an unknown number of sites in the world by 
people who want their readership to find us. For instance <a href="http://www.ceresgroup.com">
Ceres Online</a>, a searchable database of Web sites relevant 
to agriculture, lists us a link. That helps increase our traffic. <p>

Having custom domain status at UBC gives us access to fascinating statistics 
about those who visit our site. Every day we learn how many hits are made on

<TT>by Shirley Buswell(C) Copyright <BR> <P> This article is reprinted<BR>
from a 1980 issue of City Farmer<BR> (Vol. 3, Number 2), <BR>a newspaper we
printed in the early days<BR> before WWW publishing. <BR>We reprint it now <BR>on
the 50th anniversary <BR>of the end of the Second World War. </TT>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P></P>

When Charles Barber, MLA, remarked recently on the immediate necessity
for officialdom to take the idea of urban gardens seriously and to
encourage us to grow as much of our own food as possible, he at one
stage drew a parallel with the "Victory Garden era".

<P> City Farmer has long held the opinion that those wartime Victory
Gardens were in essence created by people who thought much as we
ourselves do - that urban gardens have the potential for making a
valuable contribution to our food supply, and that they may one day
become a necessity rather than a hobby. But what we didn't know before
we began extensive research into the subject was that for the first
three years of the war, Victory Gardeners faced a severe test of their
sincerity. Officialdom, it appears, greeted their ideas not merely with
apathy, but at times with downright hostility.

<P> City Farmer sometimes encounters a story which requires research
into many scattered sources. What follows has been pieced together from
public archives, and from the files of the <B>Vancouver Sun, Province,
the Victoria Daily Times, Saturday Night, Canadian Home Journal, and
Canadian Horticulture and Home</B>. Our special thanks are due to Terry
Cook (Archivist, National Resources Records) of the <B>Public Archives
of Canada</B>, and to Ainslie Helmcken,<B> Archivist of the City of
Victoria</B>.

<P> Think back, if you can, to life in Canada in 1942. Imagine, then -
in the phrase of the time - a country involved in "total war".

<P> A country at war is, as we can easily understand, a country which
suffers commodity shortages and demands a great deal of personal
sacrifice on the part of its people. What most of us who have grown up
in postwar years would have found hard to accept, had we been adults in
the 40's, is the extent to which, in time of war, the normal process of
democratic government is suspended. This is done so that leaders may
take charge of the country's entire output, and may direct it totally
toward the achievement of victory.

<P> In such a situation, individual voices have difficulty making
themselves heard: in 1942, many of those voices belonged to British
Columbia's urban gardeners.

<P> During July, 1942, the "Victory Garden Brigade" of Victoria began
petitioning J.G. Gardiner, Federal Minister of Agriculture, for
governmental support for the Victory Garden movement. Victory Gardens
were needed, they said, to offset labour shortages in the food industry,
and to release food supplies for shipment overseas. They asked their
Member of Parliament, R.W. Mayhew, to intervene on their behalf. Mr.
Mayhew's efforts met with rebuff.

<P> H. Barton, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, replying to Mayhew on
behalf of Gardiner, enclosed a pamphlet entitled <B>"Home Vegetable
Gardening"</B>. City Farmer was not able to obtain a copy of this
pamphlet, but from references made to it in correspondence now in the
Public Archives in Ottawa, it is clear that its tone was similar to one
issued that same year by the Ontario Department of Agriculture.

<P> "Unless conditions are favourable," warned this later pamphlet
sternly, in a section set off in boldface type, "a vegetable garden
should not be undertaken. We cannot afford to waste seed, fertilizer,
equipment and energy unless location and soil are suitable and the
gardener is determined to follow through to harvest and use."

<P> The admonitory tone was softened a little by advice on what tools to
buy, what to plant and where to plant it in a garden "where only" (the
pamphlet's words) a space 20' x 30' was available.

<P> Such halfhearted support did not impress Victoria's intrepid Victory
Garden Brigade.

<P> Together in October 1942, Emily Schofield (president) and Elizabeth
MacKenzie (secretary) wrote again to Gardiner.

<P> During the month of April, 1942, the women pointed out, only #3
grade potatoes had been available in local markets. At one stage, onions
had been unobtainable. The year's mainland potato crop had been reduced
50% by late blight; carrot supplies had suffered due to carrot fly.
These disasters, added to a vegetable shortage caused by the now-famous
relocation of coastal Japanese (the traditional market gardeners of the
area) and to various transport difficulties facing the food industry,
had jeopardized B.C.'s urban food supply.

<P> Then the women expressed their patriotic feelings. Archival records
take no sides, make no comments. What is there to speak for itself?
Almost forty years later, no musty filing system can stifle the
personalities of Schofield and MacKenzie, two women who refused to be
daunted by red tape or silenced by official handouts, even in time of
war. They wrote:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE> The pamphlet further says, "Could I help the war effort
by planting a vegetable garden?" Ans. "If you have not had one before,
and have not had previous experience, it is not urged that you plant one
this year." (1942) In Victoria we have proved that amateur gardeners,
even on land newly broken, have been able to keep themselves in fresh
vegetables for the last two or three months, to have some for winter use
and some to give away. In addition, the money saved has been used to buy
War Bonds, or put towards increased taxation. The general verdict has
been "Well worth while". But every citizen must endeavour to grow more
vegetables in order to make an appreciable difference in the situation
that confronts us, and we claim that this is a war effort of primary
importance. </BLOCKQUOTE> <P> City Farmer took the matter to Ainslie
Helmcken, Victoria's archivist. Did any of Victoria's official records
show official discouragement of the Victory Garden idea?

<P> Helmcken was surprised at the question. As grandson of Dr. John
Helmcken, coastal pioneer (who gave his name to streets in both
Vancouver and Victoria), his knowledge of the city is privileged and
extensive. In World War I he had been a pilot in the Royal Flying Corp.;
World War II found him working for Yarrow's shipyards. He remembered the
enthusiasm with which employees and their families created Victory
Gardens from the yards of the small houses that were quickly built for
them.

<P> "It seems now that everyone had a Victory Garden in those days,"
Helmcken said. He added after reflecting a moment, "But it wasn't a new
idea. Those gardens go back to World War I."

<P> He found for us, in the Mayor's Annual Report of 1917:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P> Early in 1917, in view of the world-wide shortage of
food stuffs, an active campaign was inaugurated by the City Council to
stimulate production by means of cultivation of vacant lots and
backyards. Briefly, the campaign was extremely successful; the response
of the citizens generally was beyond expectation, and, in addition, many
individuals freely gave their time and services in connection with the
various committees. The campaign also had a stimulating effect upon
production in the country districts adjacent to Victoria.

<P> ...Much greater necessity exists for increased food production
during 1918. All authorities agree that the world supply of food is
reduced to famine conditions in many countries, and to within a fraction
of the famine line in the most favoured localities. "Every little bit
counts," and it is earnestly to be hoped that in response, in Victoria,
of the "Back-yard and Vacant Lot Brigade," during 1918, will greatly
exceed the excellent record of 1917. </BLOCKQUOTE> <P> Hopes for 1918
were justified. The following year, the Mayor's report stated that "The
patriotic response of such large numbers of the citizens of Victoria has
been most gratifying." In this year, too, the City Council had persuaded
the Provincial Government to pass <B>"The Greater Food Production
Act."</B> This Act, described as "a radical and progressive departure in
legislation", <B>enabled cities and municipalities to take possession of
vacant, unused tracts of land for cultivation purposes, without paying
compensation to the owner.</B> Such an Act was also passed in Ontario
that year.

<P> After we left him, Helmcken considered the matter of World War II.
He called back. "You need to talk to Herb Warren," he said. "He was
Superintendent of Parks in the 40's. He'll remember something of
interest, I'm sure."

<P> Warren now works for Butchart Gardens. He does indeed remember those
wartime years.

<P> The city, he recalled, had kept sheep in MacDonald Park at one
stage. In Beacon Hill Park, the "Bantams" (a battalion formed from men
who hadn't met the Army's original standards of weight and height, but
who were physically fit) had had their parade ground ploughed up for
potato fields.

<P> "Then the city offered concessions to people who wanted to grow
gardens on vacant lots," Warren added. "The rent was $5 a year and water
was supplied at half normal rates."

<P> City Farmer returned to the records for details, but was surprised
to read, in the Parks Report for 1942:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P> The desirability of cultivating home vegetable gardens
was strongly urged throughout the year in the press, on the radio, and
in addresses to organizations. Lots were made available, ready plowed
and cultivated, for $5, but ... the response on the whole was so poor
that a contest for the best Victory Garden had to be abandoned. There
should be no doubt to the value of growing vegetables at home in these
times. Every effort will be made in the coming year to encourage and
facilitate cultivation of Victory Gardens.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> This made us wonder - because of grave national emergency, Ottawa
had assumed powers over many areas in which the individual would
normally make his own decisions. Where you would live, what you would
eat, what kind of work you would do was in many cases no longer up to
you. Had people actually begun to think that unless Ottawa said so,
Victory Gardens should not be planted? The war was entering its fourth
year, and still, it seemed, in spite of the successful examples of
British, United States and Australian Victory Garden campaigns, no one
in Ottawa cared very much for the idea.

<P> But there were always those who, like Schofield and MacKenzie,
didn't mind what level of officialdom they tackled, what ministerial
pronouncements they scorned, when they believed their cause to be
justified.

<P> Austin Spencer, Vancouver Sun garden columnist, CBC radio
broadcaster and, by his own definition, one who spoke "to the working
man and the small gardener in his own language, not like a professor but
as one working stiff to another", had been trying to persuade the
Minister of War Services for over a year that he should sponsor a
Victory Garden campaign, particularly in large urban centres. Mr.
Justice Davis, Acting Deputy Minister, had supported the programme, but
it had been rejected at the departmental level.

<P> In December, 1942, Spencer took his suggestions to another
Department. Like Schofield and MacKenzie, he wrote to Gardiner. In 1941
he had suggested the Sun sponsor a Victory Garden Competition, and there
had been over 500 entries. He answered 20,000 letters a year on garden
problems. He had wanted air time for a Victory Garden programme, but had
been told that in wartime people wished to hear only about "music,
literature and art." He refused to believe this. He placed his expertise
at the Minister's disposal.

<P> "Yours for winning the war by every method possible, including
getting people to grow their own vegetables." he concluded.

<P> And Barton replied to him, as he had done to the women from
Victoria, that no Victory Garden Campaign was contemplated at this time.
Spencer's offer to help with it was rejected, because the Department had
"a number of officials who are qualified to undertake such a campaign,
should one be decided upon."

<P> But the year ended with a slight ray of hope for people like
Spencer, Mackenzie and Schofield. The matter, Barton added, was shortly
to be reviewed.

There are very few sources which describe the most important elements
for getting a rooftop garden off the ground. Perhaps the best
information is available from <B>Toronto's Rooftop Garden Resource
Group</B>, a relatively new organization, which offers an excellent
series of Fact Sheets for just $I0.00. Not only do they include the
expected tips on what plants to grow, soil mixes, and environmental
considerations, but also rarely seen and important advice on roofing,
structural considerations and building codes. Buy this collection, you
won't be sorry.  And if you have roof garden resources of your own,
they'd welcome your input.

<PRE>  </PRE> <H3>What Kind of Roof Would Be Suitable for a Rooftop
Garden?</H3>

Theoretically, any roof surface can be greened - even sloped or curved
roofs can support a layer of sod or wildflowers - look at Scandinavia!
Switzerland has just passed a bylaw which states that new buildings must
be designed to relocate the green space covered by the building's
footprint to their roofs - even existing buildings -including historical
buildings - must now green 20% of their rooftops. This has created an
increased demand for research and material/product design, which will
soon be available to North American markets.

<P> There is a cable/tent structure over a school in Lyons, France which
is covered with grass - the grass provided a refreshing green view from
the urban classrooms as well as enough weight to eliminate some of the
cables otherwise required to hold down the tent on windy days! The
question is how to keep the soil from washing away while you're waiting
for the plant roots to grow enough to hold the soil. Plants can grow in
a medium of gravel - double duty for a layer of gravel ballast - easy,
instant, and no additional weight. Rainwater was sufficient to keep the
plants alive. It depends on how the garden is to be used, what you want
to grow, and how often you will need to access the roof. Certainly, a
flat roof, approximating level ground conditions, would seem to be the
easiest to work with and on.



<PRE>  </PRE> <H3>Does the Roof Garden Increase the Risk of Water
Leakage or Damage to the Roof?</H3>

No. In fact, planting beds/surfaces are often used to protect and
insulate roofing systems. However, problems could arise if, <P>

<OL> <LI>the membrane isn't protected from point-loading, shovels, shoe
heels, and dropping equipment. A protective drainage layer between the
soil and the membrane under planting beds, and raised surfacing
treatment for non-planted areas should avoid damage.

<P> <LI>the roof drainage system gets clogged with sand, soil, or
vegetation, and water is forced to sit on the roof for long periods of
time, allowing it to either break down the membrane or work its way
through the seams. Some waterproofing systems are designed for holding
water, others are not. Ensure that your roof drains have the proper
covers, and that your planters are lined with a layer of filter cloth
and gravel to keep the soil from draining out with the water. Often a
layer of filter cloth or drainage mat is laid over the whole roof, just
on top of the waterproofing, to avoid this problem - especially if there
is the likelihood of soil being spilled from planters, or sand removed
from sandboxes!

<P> <LI>leachate from plants, fertilizers, and/or composters comes in
contact with certain roofing membranes, leading to possible membrane
breakdown. If, after researching, you find that your existing membrane
is not compatible with these chemicals and organic compounds, your
containers and planters could be lined with a continuous membrane, or
placed on overflow trays; composters should never sit directly on the
membrane because of their requirements for aeration and turning/working.

<P> <LI>a leak must be located and accessed after the garden is already
in place - moveable planters/containers, modular walkways/surfacing
treatment, and compartmentalized planting beds could solve this problem.
</OL>



<PRE>  </PRE>

<H3>How can rainwater falling on a site be used most effectively?</H3>

Slow it down to enhance absorption by texturing, terracing, planting and
ensuring permeability of surfaces, especially on slopes (which should be
as gradual as possible). <P>

Direct the flow of runoff to planted areas and detention areas so that
as much water as possible can be retained on the site. Do not direct
water to inlet drains unless essential due to weight limitations or
inadequate waterproofing.

<P> Retain and store rainwater in a covered reservoir/cistern for later
distribution to plants (watering by hand or by a "leaky pipe" irrigation
system). Ideally, runoff could be directed to a subsurface reservoir to
provide water to plants on an "as-needed" basis.

<H3>Structural Considerations of Rooftop Gardens / Summary </H3>

Remember there are two sides to this issue: there is the new loading
exerted by the garden (the size and distribution of which can be altered
by altering the layout of the garden) and there is the load carrying
capacity of the structure (which can be enhanced by increasing the
strength of existing load bearing members or by adding new ones). When
designing a roof garden consult with a licensed engineer regarding the
load carrying capacity of the building you are working with and ensure
that the garden design and the structural capacity are compatible.

<H2>Foreword</H2>

Sometime in the next decade, a migrant or new-born will tip the balance of human population distribution in favour of cities for the first time in history.  Ours will become primarily an urban planet.  The massive social, economic, and ecological pressures associated with this trend are worthy of attention.  Indeed, they were the focus of the second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II), convened in June 1996.
	
	
<P>	One item on the Habitat II conference agenda was urban agriculture.  The phrase conjures contradictions in most minds, but further reflection reveals the vital role it has in the development of sustainable human communities.
</P>	
	
<P>	This document explores one type of urban agriculture, viz. rooftop gardening.  Roof space immediately comes to mind when one considers opportunities for urban agriculture.  Rooftops are generally unused spaces, they often have excellent exposure to sunlight and rain water, and they are found in the centre of even the densest urban areas.  The initial objective of the project summarised in this report was to explore the economic potential of cultivating these spaces.   I have made an effort to explore other issues as well; in fact, I believe that these other issues illustrate the true value of rooftop gardening.</P>



<P>	My own interest in this topic followed naturally out of my studies of sustainable agriculture at York University.  It was there that I first encountered Bill Mollison's idea of permaculture, which is dedicated to the design of sustainable systems of food production that are integrated with human settlements.  Wes Jackson's advice to become native to a place also resonated with me,   and I decided to undertake a project in Toronto where I was living and studying during my programme.</P>



<P>	The project described in this report is the culminating experience of my Master in Environmental Studies programme.  It represents the synthesis of the learning objectives described in the Plan of Study that guided my academic efforts.  Two of the procedural issues related to my studies and outlined in the Plan are the need to seek alternatives to the modern industrial food production system, and the need to test the practicality of those alternatives.  Much of my work has focused on the first of these issues, and this project is an attempt to address the second.  It is my firm belief that agricultural production practices must be dictated by a local environmental context.  To test and synthesize the knowledge I have gained, I must therefore seek to apply it in a given setting.  My efforts on the rooftop represent this attempt.
</P>	

<P>Naturally, the conclusions drawn from this inquiry are specific to both the season and the site which hosted the study.  Reductionism is one of the great faults of modern agriculture, and attempting to make sweeping conclusions from this small exercise would only perpetuate that folly.  What, then, is the use of this investigation?  Well, for one it raises some questions about the practice of rooftop gardening, it also illustrates some potentially useful techniques and materials that could be adopted elsewhere in the appropriate circumstances, and finally it illuminates some of the potential pitfalls and benefits associated with this type of cultivation.  It is my hope that it will prove useful to anyone interested in undertaking a similar enterprise.</P>



<P>	What follows is an account of my experiences gardening on a rooftop in the summer of 1996.  The text is more or less narrative, describing my plans, their execution, and general observations.  No attempt was made to record data in a scientific fashion.  To be of any use, this type of information would need to be collected over numerous seasons, and would require a fairly narrow focus for the activity.  I have instead followed the advice of Fukuoka (1978) who suggests that we should train our minds to become like those of children -- not by thinking simply, but ratherby expanding our usual, limited scientific perspective.   </P>



<H3>Acknowledgements</H3>


<P>	I would like to thank Rodger Schwass and Anders Sandberg, my advisors at York University, who greatly assisted me in the development of my Plan of Study; Michael Hough, my project supervisor, who provided valuable guidance and advice; and Mary Lou Morgan and the staff at Field to Table, without whose kind indulgence, this project would never have got off the ground.</P>



<H3>Author's note</H3>

<P>	Gardeners and people in the building trades have been slow to adopt the metric system.  Plant spacing is still given in inches in most garden literature, feet are still used to measure lumber, and pounds per square foot is the unit used to describe roof loads.  I have not made an attempt to convert all units into metric, but for those who are interested, the relevant conversion factors follow:</P>


<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
	<LI>1 cubic foot = 28.3 l		
	<LI>1 inch (")= 2.54 cm		
	<LI>1 foot (') = 12 inches = 30.5 cm
	<LI>1 pound (lb.) = 0.454 kg		
	<LI>1 pound per square foot (p.s.f.) = 4.9 kg/m2
	<LI>1 gallon (U.S.) = 3.79 l
</UL>

<P>
The Roof Top Gardening Program started in St. Petersburg in 1993. The main goal was to investigate roof top gardening techniques developed by Dr.Martin Price of  
<B><A HREF="http://www.xc.org/echo/">ECHO
</A></B>

('Educational Concerns for Hunger
Organization' based in the USA) and introduced to St. Petersburg by Martin's assistant Mary Cochram. 
</P>


<P>
The Russian people have experienced shortages of basic food stuffs and many hardships over the past decade. Roof top gardening is considered a novel idea for producing greens and vegetables for urban people who have no access to land outside the city. It makes it possible for them to garden even downtown. 
</P>


<P>
The potential of roof top gardening is huge. We have done research, conducted tests and now have excellent information for interested Russian city farmers. For example in just one district (St. Petersburg has 12) it is possible to grow 2000 tons of vegetables. Our climate is approximately the same as Anchorage, Alaska, and we have an average of 60 sunny days a year. Our vegetation period is approximately 4 months (mid-May to mid-September). We grow leafy greens, potatoes, tomatoes, etc. We cannot grow corn, buckwheat, or water melons. 
</P>



<P>
The total number of participants in our program is about 100. There are about 15 rooftop gardens in St. Petersburg (nobody knows the exact number because some people prefer not to advertise themselves for security reasons). There are also 2 gardens in the biggest prison in St. Petersburg named "Kresty" (one rooftop and another  ground level). They help feed 10,000 prisoners. We started them a year ago and last summer we received three crops of greens. And you know, prisoners are the best gardeners! They prefer to be in the open rather than stuck in a cell and their gardens were in excellent shape! 
</P>

<P>
This year we also started a ground level garden in the Artificial Limb Institute which rehabilitates invalids who lost legs or arms in the War in Chechnia (mostly boys of age 18-25). Now we are working with the administration of the Artificial Limb Institute on a program of rehabilitation. Our idea is to provide the invalids with basic knowledge of agriculture and at graduation present them with a certificate. 
</P>


<P>
So, our roof top gardens continue to grow. This year (1996) the weather was good for gardening. There was lots of rain and moderate temperatures and we harvested good crops of salad greens, parsley, tomatoes and peppers. The cuttings for propagation of gooseberry and cranberry were also good. In summary we are satisfied with the accomplishments of this past season.
</P>


<P>
We used a shallow bed method for growing our plants recommended by Dr. Martin Price of ECHO. Soil mix is critical because we cannot use organic matter from polluted city lawns and parks (it is not recommended by our ecologists). The peat moss, ceramsit (?) (special insulation material consisting of balls of different size up to one inch), sawdust and perlite can all be used but are relatively expensive. 
</P>


<P>
It is remarkable that vegetables tested for heavy metals from roof top gardens have lower levels of metal contaminants than vegetables bought and tested from city markets. Ground level gardens have slightly higher levels than in rooftop produce but still less than vegetables from market.
</P>



<P>
The city administration does not support us but the citizens of our city express a tremendous amount of interest in our work. Last spring we took part in an Exhibition "City and Flowers, City Design" where more than 2000 visitors came to our display. A week ago Kostia Ushanov (roof top gardening activist from Moscow) visited and told us about the developments in that city. We like what he is doing in Moscow. 
</P>



<P>
We have published a book this year titled "Rooftop Gardens" and more than 800 copies have been distributed to administrators, health departments, architects, and heads of industry. We plan to organize a press conference soon to focus attention on city farming. In our book we describe the idea of blocks of apartments coming together and jointly recycling their kitchen wastes using Red Worms. It is already happening in one large 300 home apartment  in St. Petersburg. Alla Sokol, our roof top gardening coordinator, (and author of the book) manages it.

<P>

People are often surprised to learn that someone gets paid full-time for
doing something as unusual and pleasurable as running <B>City
Farmer</B>. Others assume that we are a government department and
address their letters to "The Minister of Urban Agriculture".


<P> City Farmer is both a registered charity and non-profit society and
must fund-raise to pay its bills. One of the secrets of keeping our
office going for almost 20 years is keeping overhead costs to a minimum.


<P> For the first 12 years our 250 square foot office cost us $50. per
month due to the kindness of the building owner. When you add on the
cost of one business phone line and a tiny utilities bill, you are up
and running for less than $1500. a year. Our Demonstration Garden, a ten
minute drive from the office, sits on City property which we use in
exchange for maintaining a beautiful landscape.


<P> Wages is another important expenditure item. For many years we
received short-term Federal Government grants to administer job training
projects which were environmental in nature. For over ten years we were
able to offer gardening classes, start a large community garden, a
rooftop garden, a school garden and a horticulture therapy garden with
just two to three trainees working up to six months at a time. The
remainder of the year was spent producing literature describing the
projects just completed, with funds coming from the private sector and
charitable foundations.

<P> The nature of most granting systems means that we have to be
creative and find new projects every couple of years. Each new project
adds to our goal "to promote urban agriculture".


<P> For the past five years we have delivered compost education
programs, the core funding coming from municipal government sources.

<P> Regardless of what our major focus is for any given year, we make
time to research and promote the wide variety of subjects that make up
urban agriculture.


<H3>Some advice for staying afloat:</H3>

<UL> <LI>Keep your overhead low.

<P> <LI>Keep your organization small and don't expand just because you
have a good year.

<P> <LI>Pay your bills, keep a close eye on your accounts and always put
some money away in savings for those times when grants aren't coming in.
Then you can still pay your bills while hunting for new sources of
funding.

<P> <LI>Pay good wages to a well chosen staff. Our ads for employees say
"Must love gardening, must love working with people." At present we have
one full-time and two part-time staff and a handful of workshop leaders
who work now and again.

<P> <LI>Develop a good name by completing successful projects.

<P> <LI>Be creative and find new projects to capture the public's
imagination.

<P> <LI>Take advantage of the free publicity the media can offer you.
They will deliver your message and at the same time help the public and
funders become aware of your good name. </UL>

<H3>On Display at the National Arboretum <BR>Washington D.C.<BR>
March-April, 1996</H3>



An exhibition of 43 colour photographs commemorating the fifteenth
anniversary of New York's Operation GreenThumb. GreenThumb is the
largest municipally run gardening program in the United States. Its 700
gardens have replaced more than 125 acres of garbage strewn land
throughout New York. <P>


An important source of food, Green Thumb gardens annually produce fruits
and vegetables valued at more than $1,000,000.

years and Curator of the Photographic Exhibition, introduces the exhibit
in the text below.</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Fiercely proud of their efforts, New Yorkers of fortitude
and grit bestow such evocative names upon the city's most hidden and
beloved treasures - GreenThumb community gardens. By dint of imagination
and hard work, thousands of neighborhood activists have transformed
vacant, derelict land into beautiful gardens overflowing with
vegetables, flowers, laughter and love. From the South Bronx to South
Jamaica, from East Harlem to East New York, GreenThumb's 700 community
gardens represent the dreams, traditions, aspirations and cultures of
the people who create them.

<P>

Operation GreenThumb is sponsored by New York City's Department of
General Services and funded by federal Community Development Block
Grants. Since 1978, GreenThumb and hundreds of community groups
throughout the city's five boroughs have worked together, turning
neighborhood eyesores and dens for vermin, drug dealers and stolen car
rings into safe, thriving and productive oases of green.


<P> GreenThumb leases city-owned land at no charge to neighborhood
groups and trains them in garden design, construction, and horticultural
techniques. GreenThumb provides gardeners with tools; fencing; lumber to
build growing beds, picnic tables, gazebos and grape arbors; soil;
ornamental and fruit trees; shrubs; seeds and bulbs. The gardeners, in
turn, are responsible for developing and maintaining their garden sites.


<P> How gardeners design, plant and use their gardens reflects their
cultural and ethnic backgrounds as much as their needs for open space.
There is no typical GreenThumb garden. Community gardens, in their
exuberance and rakish beauty, celebrate in their quirkiness and
individuality. GreenThumb gardens require commitment and dedication
rather than grand plans and major financial investment.


<P> Gardeners do, of course, require assistance and New York is indeed
fortunate to have so many greening, open space and citizens
organizations, all eager to offer materials and advice. Yet, these
resources are for naught unless they are matched by the assets every
neighborhood can supply in abundance ... the people who live there.

<P>

Successful community gardens prosper because they are initiated and
sustained by neighborhood residents. Grass roots efforts. From the
bottom up. Operation GreenThumb gardens thrive because New Yorkers have
made the gardens their own, on their own.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If you had seen that trash filled lot, you'd've said it
would take a miracle to make a garden. In time and with much hard work
we accomplished the impossible. Now we have something beautiful to look
at ... flowers, fruits and vegetables for the community.

<P> When people walk by, they compliment the garden. One surprised
person said, "It's magic." So we called the garden The Magic Garden. But
in reality, the magic is within us. <P><TT>Lydia Roman<BR> The Magic

<P> <BLOCKQUOTE>When we first started cleaning out our lot, the morning
dew wet my hands and legs. I sat down on a rock and seeing that the dew
still covered the weeds around me, I started remembering my childhood in
Puerto Rico. I used to follow my mother into her vegetable garden where
she grew yautia. It had round leaves which, in the mornings, were
covered with dew. To me, it looked like pearls. I stared at it a long
time and then I drank those water drops from the leaves of the yautia
plant.

<P> My mother used to help the poor people, giving them fruits and
vegetables she grew to eat. Reminiscing of my childhood in Puerto Rico,
I wanted to do as my mother did and help needy people. Soon my garden
started to look like my mother's garden. I planted recao seeds which is
used to flavor many Spanish foods. In 1981, many Spanish speaking people
did not know that you could grow recao in New York. Now many Spanish
ladies plant their own recao.

<P> Now this garden is my pride and part of the community where I live.
It is also a part of the school across the street, CES 73. The children
learn to plant fruits and vegetables. They play a great role in helping
in the garden.

<P> Once I have departed from this earth to another, may this garden
into which I have put so much work and pride keep going for the
community and for other children to come.

<BLOCKQUOTE>My husband is a busy man with a no-nonsense high stress job.
Just about every day, he drinks quarts of coffee, smokes packs of
unfiltered Camels and yells until he's hoarse. He's overweight and has
mild diabetes as well as a "touchy" stomach.

<P> Yet, on his days off, he drags out his tools and sweats and swears
under the hot sun working with neighbors in the garden. Incredibly
though, his blood sugar and blood pressure drop to acceptable levels. He
smokes less. No doubt he's too busy with his hands. In general, he seems
calmer and happier.

<P> I guess hard work is like hard sex. It leaves you sweaty, exhausted
and completely satisfied with your accomplishments. And it's good for
you, too.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Before starting our garden I longed for a place of my own to
grow flowers and have a vegetable garden like my grandfather had when I
was a little girl.

<P> My grandfather came from Italy. We enjoyed homegrown vegetables all
the time.  Grandma made her own spaghetti sauce from the garden's
tomatoes, basil and peppers. Grandpa even made his own wine from the
grapes that he grew. We also loved his corn, garbanzo beans and,
especially, his figs.

<P> Planting flowers around the street trees in front of our building
wasn't enough. I started reading up on gardening and was determined to
have a garden some day, some how, some way. Now we have our community
garden ... a wonderful place where we can go and enjoy being outdoors
with our family and friends, friends that only a short time ago were
neighbors whom we would just see in passing.

<P> The garden has brought us all close together.

<BLOCKQUOTE>I like going to the garden early on Sunday mornings. I slap
on my headphones, listen to Mozart and putter.  After a while, I take a
breather and sit in the gazebo, just watching the flowers grow.

<P> One Sunday, there I was with muddy knees and bits of weed in my hair
when a very proper lady wearing little white gloves passed by. I must
have startled her when she spotted me. Quite loudly, she commented about
my sitting around instead of going to church.

<P> I didn't say a word. How could I explain that I was already there?

<TT>By Su Decheng<BR>


 <a
href="mailto:Su Decheng <SDECHENG@admin1.csd.unbsj.ca>">Su Decheng <SDECHENG@admin1.csd.unbsj.ca></a><BR>
5 Skaling Ct. Apt. 9<br>
Saint John, New Brunswick<br>
Canada E2K 4G8</TT>


<P>
<TT>Su Decheng is a visiting scientist in the Mycology  Lab. of the Biological Department at the University of New Brunswick, Saint John. His work involves growing mushrooms on by-products of the agriculture and forest industry. 
</P>


<P>
The mushrooms Su Decheng grows are shiitake (Lentinus edodes), maitake (Grifota frondosa), enokitake (Flammulina velutipes), oyster mushroom (Pleurotus osteas), lion's mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus), and Ling-zhi (Ganoderma lucidum). These mushrooms are able to decompose  polymer, cellulose , lignum, and hemicellulose from agricultural and forest residues and at the same time produce a valuable mushroom crop. The substrate, once the mushrooms have been harvested, consists of mushroom mycelia and is an excellent fertilizer.</TT>
</P><BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Su Decheng describes his background and work</H3>


<P>
I was born in a mountainous area of Fujian province, in the south-east of China where I lived my first 16 years in poverty. I went to Xiamen University, and spent 4 years majoring in biology with the idea that one day I could help my countrymen get out of poverty. </P>



<P>
When I found that my undergraduate knowledge was not enough to fulfil my ambition, I took another 3 years at Beijing Agricultural University, (The University is now renamed the Agricultural University of China), and completed a masters program studying the molecular genetics of fungi, graduating in 1987. Since then I have been working as Associate Professor of Mushroom Science in the Land and Environment Department of Fujian Agricultural University. 
</P>





<P>
On receiving my Master of Agriculture (Microbiology) degree at Beijing Agricultural University in Beijing, in 1987, my friend took me out to a restaurant to celebrate and ordered "monkey head" from the menu. I wasn't happy when the waitress brought an unusual vegetable dish named "Here is the Monkey Head". On seeing my expression my friend explained to me that <B>monkey head</B> is the name of a mushroom. This surprised me because I had graduated in microbiology, and yet I knew nothing about this variety. I decided to study mushroom science and for the past 9 years, my work has involved research on the technology of growing mushrooms.
</P>


<P>
<B>Monkey head</B> also called <B>bear's head</B> or <B>lion's mane</B>, is one of a group of mushrooms known as tree mushrooms. Tree mushrooms have been grown for hundreds of years in China and Japan. They are different from white mushrooms (button mushrooms) in that they grow in nature on fallen logs in the forest. 
</P>


<P>
These mushrooms have a pungent, woodsy flavour, and have good nutritional value. They provide high levels of protein, minor elements, vitamins, amino acids, and have low fat content and few calories. Most of them have natural anti-viral and immunity-boosting properties that are used to fight viruses, lower cholesterol and regulate blood pressure. Besides <B>monkey head</B>, there are <B>maitake</B> or <B>hen sitting in the wood</B>, <B>shiitake</B>, <B>oyster mushroom</B>, <B>phoenix-tail mushroom</B>, <B>ling-zhi</B> or <B>reddish</B>, <B>enokitake</B> or <B>golden mushroom</B>.
</P>


<P>
Although they grow on wooden logs, we can cultivate them on a variety of substrates. Inedible biomass such as sawdust, crop stalks and other agricultural and forest waste can be used to grow mushrooms. This technology is called "bioconverting technology".
</P>


<P>
Growing mushrooms can be a valuable method used to fight poverty and starvation. It can make agriculture more efficient and make money for farmers. In 1989 I took part in a project to help people in poverty stricken areas of China learn how to grow mushrooms for self-sufficiency. I was chosen as a mushroom expert because of my success running the Youxi Shanglin Mushroom Farm (cultivating <B>shiitake</B>).
</P>


<P>
I went to Nanpin county with 20 mushroom science students, to train the local people on how to grow <B>shiitake</B> on sawdust. We took 4 months and helped local people one by one. I also established a mushroom farm as an example.
</P>


<P>
In Shouling county in Fujian (another place in which I helped), there were 70,000 people in 14,000 families living well below the poverty line with a yearly income of less than 300 Chinese yan (CN$50), 
</P>

<P>
Their land grew lots of scrub wood but little grain. In 1989 we trained them on how to grow mushrooms. 94% of the families were involved. Since then, mushroom cultivation in that county has become more and more economically significant. The average annual income per capita reached 1,800 Chinese yan (CN$300) in 1993, and 75% of it came from mushrooms. The inhabitants are now emerging from extreme poverty to where they can live in more comfortable conditions.
</P>

<P>
Tree mushrooms can be cultivated in buildings constructed of brick and cement. A heating/cooling system, a ventilation system and shelving are also necessary for indoor cultivation. Alternately they can be cultivated outside in an open field or in the forest, however this type of cultivation is  dependent on the climate.
</P>


<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>How to grow the mushrooms</H3>


<P>
To grow tree mushrooms on sawdust is a complicated process, but success will come if procedures are followed carefully. There are 4 stages in the growing cycle:
</P>


<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<P>
	<LI>spawn running stage, 
</P>

<P>
	<LI>substrate preparation stage,
</P>

<P>
	<LI>inoculation stage 
</P>

<P>
	<LI>incubation & fruiting stage.
</P>
</UL>


<P>
The first stage is the most important and needs the most expensive equipment. An expert or a professional institute usually manages this stage. Growers simply buy the spawn from the experts.
</P>


<P>
The substrate preparing stage is where the hard work begins. We mix the substrate (sawdust, wheat bran and other supplementary material) and put them in plastic bags. The bags are cooked at 100C for 12 hours, or they are autoclaved at 121C for 2 hrs. The cooking and autoclaving is done to sterilize the substrate and make the media contaminant free. This step is very important. 
</P>


<P>
When the bag is cool, it is ready for the inoculation stage. We use pure spawn to inoculate the substrate. This stage demands a very clean environment and care in handling. During incubation, we check the temperature often and watch the bags for pests and pathogens. When the spawn has run through, they are ready for fruiting.

<P>
During fruiting, humidity,temperature and air are all important factors. And for shiitake, lion's mane, and Ling-Zhi, the light intensity is also important.
</P>



<P>
In summary, tree mushroom production can produce healthy food, create jobs and provide income from agricultural and forest waste. It is a profitable investment for city farmers.

Most people who garden in the city eat their own produce marveling at
what they've accomplished . Sometimes they share their harvest with
friends, or perhaps the Food Bank. But those ripe red tomatoes and
artichoke heads represent dollars when priced at the supermarket and
it's fun to dream about how much all that food is worth. <P>

We had an neighbour who supported himself through university growing
just garlic in his backyard. He braided it and sold it at a premium
in local stores. Another friend grew edible flowers and herbs and
then sold them to local restaurants.

<P> Fifteen years ago City Farmer published  a short article titled
<A HREF="arable65.html#arable"><B>Arable Acres Within City
Limits</B></A> in which we attempted to add up the number of acres
of vacant land in Vancouver, determine how much produce could be
grown on it by city folk and then put a price on the total. It became
our most quoted and requested piece. <P>

Though the research was simply a rough estimate, it got readers
dreaming about growing all their own vegetables and soft fruit. <P>

A number of publications continue to whet our appetite for the gold
that might be lying on the back 1000 sq. ft. <P>

<P> <BR>
Fun with figures, some might call it. It is fun and more. It's amazing to
discover that the City of Vancouver has enough land available so that its
inhabitants can grow all their own vegetables within city limits.

<P> The area in back and front yards, on boulevards and on various vacant lots is
all the land required. There are 6515 acres ready for planting which is, in
intensive city farming terms, 283,793,400 square feet.

<P> Golf courses, cemeteries and parks haven't been included in these
calculations, nor has the land in the more spacious municipalities of Greater
Vancouver such as Burnaby, Surrey and Richmond.

<P> If man, woman and child power were applied to the task of growing family food
gardens, how much food, hypothetically, could be grown?

<P> Bernard Moore, a local garden expert, says that 2400 square feet of land (40'
x 60') will provide a family of four with "more than enough fresh vegetables plus
sufficient to can or freeze for the winter." <P>

Alan Littler, a senior Ministry of Agriculture horticulturist says that 1000
square feet will feed the same family. <P>

The U.S. National Garden Bureau believes that the family of four can be fed from
only 600 square feet.

<P> But even Moore's seemingly conservative estimates could produce enough
vegetables on Vancouver's available 6515 acres to feed all 427,000 inhabitants of
the City with some to spare.

<P> If  the  National Garden Bureau figures are used, it would seem that
Vancouver's city farmers could feed the whole Lower Mainland. <P>

<B>And  the  worth  of this food is truly unbelievable at well over $100,000,000
retail.</B>

<P>




Information on the use of composting toilets in cities is not easy to
find. Building and plumbing codes don't encourage installation. Compost
toilet systems are more common in parks, roadside facilities and
vacation homes.

City of Vancouver Engineering Department <BR> Solid Waste Management
Branch

<P> Presented at:  <BR> Composting Council of Canada Annual
Conference<BR> Aylmer, Quebec,<BR> November 1-4, 1995.


<PRE>  </PRE> <P> <H3>Vancouver's Composting Strategy</H3>

<P> In 1989, Vancouver City Council set a 50% waste reduction goal. At
the same time, a waste reduction strategy was laid out to achieve the
goal.  The strategy included multi-material recycling and composting.
Since 1989, Vancouver has been implementing components of the waste
reduction strategy.

<P> The composting component of the waste reduction strategy has been
implemented with three principles in mind. The principles are source
separation, incremental implementation and the use of a multi-component
strategy.

<P> Source separation has been a fundamental component of all of
Vancouver's waste reduction and recycling programs.  Source separation
ensures high quality and consequently high value products, and also
includes residents in the waste reduction system.

<P> Vancouver has implemented its composting strategy incrementally by
continually building on programs. Centralized composting for example
began with the composting of leaves collected from City streets using a
minimal technology approach. The following year drop-off and residential
collection systems were added to the program.  In 1995, Vancouver has
just completed a 2.4 million dollar yard and garden waste composting
facility, which is designed to process approximately 22,000 tonnes per
year of yard waste.

<P> Other components of Vancouver's composting program include backyard
compost bin distribution, composting education and worm bin
distribution.

<P> Subsequent to Vancouver setting its 50% waste reduction goal, the
Province of British Columbia has set a 50% per capita waste reduction
goal and mandated that all Regional Districts develop a Solid Waste
Management Plan predicated on achieving the waste reduction goal. The
Greater Vancouver Regional District (G.V.R.D) has just completed stage
three of the Solid Waste Management Plan, and submitted the Plan to the
Minister of Environment Lands and Parks for approval. Stage three
includes strategies and specific program requirements to achieve the
Provincial Goal.    The G.V.R.D Solid Waste Management Plan includes
further expansion of backyard compost bin distribution programs,
additional composting education, and the provision of convenient yard
waste composting facilities to all Regional residents. Vancouver's
strategy is consistent with the Solid Waste Management Plan.

<P>

<PRE>  </PRE> <H3>Home Composting</H3> <P>

Since 1990, Vancouver has been promoting backyard composting by offering
composters for sale to the public and by offering composting education.
<P>

The backyard compost bin distribution program has provided backyard
composters to approximately 16,000 Vancouver households (18% of
Vancouver households) for $25 per composter.  The composters are
estimated to divert approximately 250 kg per unit per year from the
waste stream, for a total of 4,000 tonnes per year. Vancouver City
Council  has approved the distribution of an additional 8,000 composters
through a truckload sale to be held in the spring of 1996.

<P> An innovative feature of Vancouver's program is that composters
purchased for distribution are required to be rodent resistant.
Accordingly, they have a secure top and bottom, have no holes exceeding
1.3 cm, and are made of durable, rodent resistant material. This
requirement has been important in ensuring continued support for the
program from both the public and environmental health professionals. <P>

The City of Vancouver also provides an extensive backyard composting
education program.  The education program provides ongoing support to
residents who have purchased backyard composters plus provides promotion
for the City's composting programs.  The City funds City Farmer, a
non-profit urban agriculture advocacy society, to deliver composting
education to Vancouver residents.  Funding to City Farmer is also
provided by the Greater Vancouver Regional District. <P>

City Farmer staffs and maintains a Compost Demonstration Garden and
Compost Hotline telephone service year-round.  The Garden and Hotline
not only provide information on composting to residents, but also act as
a resource centre for industry and government.  City Farmer conducts
composting workshops for groups ranging from school children to seniors
through-out Vancouver.  In a year, approximately 6,500 people either
visit the Garden, call the Hotline, or attend a workshop.  Many more
people are reached through City Farmer's media interviews and contacts
which in 1994 exceeded 70 and included Sesame Street, W5, Canadian
Gardening and many local media.

<P> In 1993, Vancouver provided 200 residents with worm composters for
use in homes without yards.  Each participant was provided with a 50
litre worm bin, worms, bedding, Mary Applehof's book on worm composting,
"Worms Eat My Garbage",  and a one-hour instructional workshop.  The
workshop was conducted by City Farmer and is considered critical in
ensuring continued use of the worm bins.  The workshop focused on all
aspects of worm composting from worm anatomy and life-cycle to castings
harvesting.

<P> Approximately six months following distribution of the worm bins a
follow-up survey was sent to all of participants in the program. The
survey showed that approximately 70% of the participants were using
their bins. <P>

Vancouver's worm bin distribution program is being expanded by 500 bins
in 1995. <P> <PRE>  </PRE>

<H3>Leaf Composting</H3>

<P> Since 1990, Vancouver has been collecting leaves each fall for
composting.  Leaves are collected in paper leaf collection bags, by
front-end loaders from City streets, or dropped off at depots.  In 1994,
a total of 5,000 tonnes of leaves were collected for composting.

<P> Leaves are processed at the City's composting facility. Processing
involves windrowing, periodic mixing with a front end loader or
excavator, mixing with a windrow turner, and screening with a trommel
screen.  The total process takes just under one year and produces a 2 cm
minus compost that is essentially free of foreign matter.  The compost
meets the criteria for unrestricted distribution as described in  B.C.
Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks' "British Columbia Production
and Use of Compost Regulation". <P>

Up to 1995, leaves have been processed on a hog fuel (shredded wood
waste) base.  Hog fuel is used because it is inexpensive and provides a
relatively good working surface.  Some problems that have resulted from
working on a hog fuel surface are the loss of compost into the working
surface, and restricted equipment use during wet weather.

<P> Another potential problem is contamination of the compost by hog
fuel getting mixed into the compost.  If mixed compost and partially
decomposed wood waste are applied to plants, soil bacteria use all of
the available nitrogen, essentially robbing the plants of nitrogen. This
process is called nitrogen immobilization, and can result in reduced
plant growth or potentially death. Contamination of the compost is
avoided by minimizing windrow turning, careful equipment operation, and
by putting a layer of sand on top of the hog fuel prior to constructing
windrows.

<P> Following processing, the compost is sold to the City's Park Board
and landscapers primarily as a landscape mulch.

<PRE>  </PRE> <P> <H3>Yard and Garden Waste Composting Facility</H3>

<P> In December 1992, Vancouver City Council approved the construction
and operation of a yard and garden waste composting facility at the
City's Landfill in Delta. The facility represents a 2.4 million dollar
capital investment, and is designed to process approximately 22,000
tonnes per year of yard and garden waste. <P>

The composting facility includes a 1.8 hectare roller compacted concrete
paved surface, a 400 hp electric grinding plant, a front-end loader, a
windrow turner and a trommel screen.

<P> A paved surface was selected for several reasons:

<P> -    increased windrow management to ensure rapid decomposition and
the maintenance of aerobic conditions results in a requirement for all
weather site access.  Under Vancouver's climatic conditions all-weather
access for wheeled vehicles can only be assured by having a paved
surface.

<P> -    a paved surface ensures that the product is not lost into the
surface and also that the product is not contaminated by the base
material. <P>

-    the maintenance costs of a paved surface are low since frequent
regrading and addition or removal of material are not required.

<P> -    surface water can be controlled , thus avoiding ponding

<P> -    site clean-up is much easier.

<P> Both the maintenance of aerobic conditions and surface water control
are requirements of the "British Columbia Production and Use of Compost
Regulation". <P>

The design and construction of the composting facility paved surface has
been a relatively complex task due to the geotechnical characteristics
of the site and the requirement for a heavy duty pavement structure on
which to conduct composting operations. <P>

To provide a paved surface, designs were developed for two alternative
systems; either a roller compacted concrete (RCC) surface or a
combination of conventional concrete and asphalt. RCC is an industrial
pavement used extensively in extreme duty applications such as log sort
and log storage areas.  RCC has been used at four other composting sites
in Canada.  Tenders were sought for both options.  Following receipt of
tenders, an evaluation of the two options was conducted. The City, in
cooperation with the pavement design consultant, determined that over
the design life of the surface, the RCC option was least expensive due
to reduced long-term maintenance costs.  This was in spite of an initial
10% capital cost premium for RCC.

<P> The final design for the surface included 200 mm of 20 mm minus
gravel overlaid by 250 mm of RCC in the initial processing area and 200
mm of RCC in the windrow composting area. A site plan showing the
facility layout is provided in Figure 1.  The total cost of the paved
surface excluding site preparation was approximately $35 per square
metre.

<P> The other key capital component of the composting facility is an
electric yard waste grinding plant. The plant is similar in design to
that used in the wood processing industry.  The system was constructed
by a local company, and was selected through a City issued request for
proposals.

<P> The grinding plant includes an infeed hopper, an infeed conveyor, a
vibrating finger screen, a metal detector, a 400 hp fixed hammer hog,
and outfeed conveyors. The system is designed to remove fine materials
prior to grinding to reduce energy consumption and striker plate
(hammer) wear. The metal detector protects the striker plates from
ferrous contaminants. The design also allows metering of material into
the grinder to reduce surge loading.  The system is designed to produce
7.5 cm minus material (7.5 cm maximum in any direction) at a minimum
rate of 25 tonnes per hour.  The total cost of the grinding plant was
$750,000.  A photograph of the grinding plant is provided in Figure 2.
<P>

A breakdown of the facility capital costs is provided in Table 1. The
total capital cost of the facility was approximately 2.4 million
dollars. <P> <PRE>  </PRE>

<H4> Figure 1: Vancouver Composting Facility Site Plan</H4></DIV>

<PRE>  </PRE>

The material flow for the facility is shown in Figure 3.  Source
separated yard and garden compostables will be dropped off at the
Vancouver South Transfer Station and Vancouver Landfill.  Landscapers
and residents dropping off yard waste will be charged a disposal fee.
The fee is lower than the fee for refuse disposal to encourage source
separation.  On-site staff will check material quality.

A list of acceptable and unacceptable material is provided in Table 2.
The material will be delivered to the composting facility and dropped
off in front of the grinding plant.  Material will be loaded into the
grinding plant with a front end loader.  Following grinding, the
material will be ferried into windrows with a front end loader. If
required, water will be added to the ground material with spray nozzles
located on the grinding plant.  Windrows will be mixed on an
approximately weekly basis for approximately eight weeks.  Windrows will
be combined as required to account for shrinkage and to maximize space
utilization.

<P> Following windrowing, the material will be stockpiled for up to six
months to cure.  The material will then be screened with a trommel
screen to 2 cm minus prior to distribution.


<P> Both curing and screening will be conducted on rock surfaces rather
than the RCC pad because these operations will be less likely to result
in contamination or loss of the compost, and screening can be conducted
during dry weather thus reducing trafficability concerns.

<P>

The compost will be used within City operations and sold to landscapers
or to the public.

<P> Annual operating costs are not currently available as the facility
is just commencing operation. The facility will be operated by 2-3 City
staff depending on material quantity and time of year. <P> <PRE>  </PRE>

<H3>Future Direction</H3> <P>

The City of Vancouver will continue to include composting in its waste
reduction strategy. This is consistent with the requirements of the
Regional Solid Waste Management Plan, which has composting as a
fundamental component. <P>

Vancouver's composting strategy will continue to be based on source
separation, incremental implementation and a multi-component approach.

<P> To date Vancouver has only included food waste composting in its
composting strategy through the promotion of backyard and worm
composting. It is expected that Vancouver will not expand its
centralized composting program to provide food waste composting due to
the additional collection and facility requirements. Food waste
composting will be left to the commercial sector, which currently
processes food waste from restaurants, food processors and grocery
stores throughout the lower mainland. Centralized composting of
residential food waste is not a component of the Regional Solid Waste
Management Plan. <P>

The next expansion of Vancouver's program will likely involve an
extension of yard waste collection systems. The current system requires
that participants drop-off their compostables at either the City's
Transfer Station or at the composting facility. Two potential expansion
options are the addition of residential collection or additional
drop-off depots. These options will only be considered once City staff
gain operating experience with the composting facility.

In 1988 City Farmer built five raised wooden beds at our Demonstration Garden to
accommodate people in wheelchairs. We invited people from a variety of healthcare
facilities to come and take part in horticultural activities such as watering,
seeding, and making crafts from plants in the garden. Quadriplegic children,
adults in their 90's and people with a variety of disabilities were brought in
special buses to our new "Ability Garden" by their care givers .

<P> After two years of work with the pilot program, we concluded that everyone
loved the experience whether because they enjoyed being out in the fresh air,
smelling the flowers, tasting the just picked vegetables and berries, or because
of the physical activity of gardening and the social interaction with their
fellow gardeners and our horticultural animators. <P>

Our enthusiasm for horticulture therapy encouraged us to produce a short handbook
titled <B>Gardening With People With Disabilities</B> and send it out to all the
health care facilities in the Province.

Having had cancer has allowed me certain freedoms I never had prior to my
illness. One of those freedoms is the ability to talk openly and candidly about
my experience. This piece entitled <B>The Spirit of Healing</B> comes from a
place deep inside. A place from which we all have the ability to seize and
harness energy, but a place few of us tap into until we are confronted with a
crisis in our lives. How each person harnesses his or her ability to heal is as
different as each person is different.

<P>

From my experience with discovering the spirit with which I could heal, I have
come to realize that there is a code of silence which surrounds life threatening
illnesses, especially cancer. Nobody wants to hear about it, nobody ultimately
wants to talk about it. There is a superstition that by talking about cancer, it
will invite the illness into our lives. If we invite cancer into our lives, come
in contact with it, we may contract it ourselves. People fear what they do not
understand and often are not willing to educate themselves to overcome their
fears.

<P>

I believe it is imperative to hear the voices behind that code of silence. Part
of the impetus for this piece is to be one of those voices - to share with you my
illness and the aspects of the environment which, I feel, affected its course.

<P><BR>

<H3>Background And Context</H3>

<P><BR>

In the fall of 1991, at twenty nine years of age, I was diagnosed with lymphoma,
a cancer of the lymph system. As some background, there are several types:
carcinoma's, sarcoma's, Ieukaemia's and lymphoma's. Cancer is an abnormal mutant
cell whose rapid division is dangerous to our physiology. Contrary to popular
belief cancer cells do not grow more rapidly than normal cells. They merely
divide more rapidly causing the malignancy to advance faster. Carcinoma's are
cancers related to the skin. Sarcoma's are cancers arising in the bone and their
connective tissues. Leukaemia's affect the blood system and lymphoma's are
cancers of the lymph system.

<P> Many lymphoma's are manifested in the lymph nodes and are characterized by
enlarged or swollen lymph nodes and glands. My lymphoma affected my entire lymph
system and manifested itself as small bumps just below the surface of the skin.
Although the prognosis for lymphoma is usually good, I had a rare and aggressive
form which was difficult to treat. I did, however, have two things going for me.
I was young and in excellent shape. I had exercised regularly all my life, eaten
well, never smoked and I drank moderately. I was not what one envisions when one
thinks of a candidate for cancer.

<P> My treatment for lymphoma began in the late fall of 1991 using chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy is a specialized drug treatment to eradicate the rapidly dividing
cancer cells. After my first round of chemotherapy I landed in the hospital with
pneumonia. During that time, my cancer advanced and several new bumps were
discovered on my abdomen. This meant that the chemotherapy had failed. My doctor
decided to scrap my original chemotherapy regime for a new one and from December
to March of 1992 I went through four additional rounds of a new chemotherapy
regime. This new regime barely eked me into remission.

<P>

Ever since the failure of my first chemotherapy regime in the fall, my doctor had
begun preparing me for a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow transplants are
highly dangerous procedures due to the high level of toxic drugs infused through
your body with the potential to cause permanent damage to your organs. In my
particular case it was my only hope for a cure.






<P>

In May, just prior to beginning the bone marrow transplant process, I relapsed.
My skin nodules resurfaced larger, in greater number than ever before. My doctors
decided, however, to continue with the first stage of a two stage bone marrow
transplant in the hope that the higher doses of chemotherapy would achieve
another remission. My cancer receded but did not disappear. I still had many
nodules all over my body. They were smaller but not gone.


<P> After a month long stay in the hospital, I was elated to get out but
uncertain about my future. We had not been successful in our pursuit of a
remission, therefore, a transplant was no longer possible. There was talk of
maintenance chemotherapy to prevent the cancer from metastasizing further. There
was talk of cell re-engineering, a new and highly experimental procedure. My
options were very limited and a cure unlikely. It was a very difficult period for
me, my family, friends and my doctors too. <P>


At that juncture there were several things which were important to me. During my
month long hospital stay I had weakened, I had lost weight and my legs had
atrophied. I had not eaten because of the high doses of chemotherapy, I had lost
my sense of taste and smell, as well as all my hair. I'd been on intravenous food
and various other drugs hooked up twenty four hours a day to a machine that
constantly ticked and hummed like a metronome. My ability to concentrate and
remember was poor and I had been in a very confined and sterile environment.

<P>

At the time, I was living, working and being treated in San Francisco. I
desperately wanted and needed a break from everything. I needed to regain some
equilibrium in my life. Since the onset of my cancer my life seemed to be
continually spiralling out of control. My need for solace and escape was
heightened because of my illness. I escaped the City and spent some time in the
Wine Country and then retreated to Stinson Beach with my family.

<P>

What took place in the ensuing weeks away from doctors, hospitals and treatments
is considered by many, including myself to be a miracle. As I recovered from my
month long hospital stay, I focused my energy in very beautiful and natural
environments. During that time I stopped worrying about a cure and redirected my
energy into healing and what that meant to me. For my body, I walked the beach
twice a day. I ate fresh fruits and vegetables, many out of the garden. For my
mind, I meditated and visualized my body without cancer three times a day. I read
anything and everything, from fiction to non-fiction to the magazines on gardens,
antiques and architecture lying around the house. For my spirit, I watched the
sunset every day and tried to breath some life back into a very tired soul. I
tended to all the sides of my nature, the physical, the spiritual and the mental
sides which needed to be attended to, to regain balance. During that time I went
from my suspended state of life in limbo, into remission with the possibility to
continue with the transplant. What took place during those weeks I strongly
believe was influenced by my surrounding environment. I was at a critical
juncture in my illness and that seaside and garden setting played an major role
activating healing processes.

<BR>Will Live in Urban Centres by 2015,<BR> UN Report Says

<P></P><BR>


<TT>Excerpted from the Canadian Press<BR>Friday, November 10, 1995<BR></TT>

<P></P><BR>




A majority of the world's population will live in crowded urban areas in 30
years, with some cities becoming magnets for the homeless and pools of infection
for resurgent diseases, the United Nations says.

<P>

The grim prognosis is contained in the <B>Global Report on Human Settlements</B>,
to be issued in early 1996 by the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements.
With urban populations growing 2.5 times faster than the rural population, the
report draws a grim picture of housing shortages and poor housing conditions,
perfect breeding places for diseases.

<P>

There will be 500 million urban people who will be totally homeless unless
governments come to recognize that lack of housing leads to social costs that are
much worse.


<P> Projections show that by 2015 all 10 of the world's largest cities will be in
Asia, Latin America and Africa, and of those only one, Tokyo, will be in an
advanced developed country.


<P> The list of the 10 largest urban areas in the year 2015 is:

<OL>

<LI>Tokyo, 28.7 million; <P>

<LI>Bombay, 27.3 million; <P>

<LI>Lagos, 24.4 million; <P>

<LI>Shanghai, 23.4 million; <P>

<LI>Jakarta, 21.2 million; <P>


<LI>Sao Paulo, 20.8 million; <P>

<LI>Karachi, 20.6 million; <P>

Food gardens need water and what better way to give plants a drink than
with soft, warm, oxygen-filled rainwater straight from the rain barrel.
Even just a wee bit saved in a barrel after a storm, then transferred to
a watering can, will slake the thirst of a balcony of plants. And you,
the recycler, will feel especially good knowing that you are diverting
water that would otherwise flow out into the storm sewers. <P>

City Farmer has been chosen by Vancouver's City Hall to display and help
promote a rain barrel distribution program. <PRE>  </PRE>

<P><BR>

The City of Vancouver is providing subsidized rain barrels for up to
1,000 residents under a pilot program to conserve water. <P>

The Green Barrel pilot program will offer Vancouver residents a
75-gallon plastic rain barrel for $67 including taxes. This is half the
regular cost. <P>

Residents can use the specially-designed barrels to collect rain water
from downspouts for lawn and garden irrigation.

<P> Lawn and garden watering make up almost 40 per cent of total
household water use during the summer. It's expected that each barrel
will save about 1,300 gallons of water during the peak summer months
when demand for water is high and precipitation is low. <P>

The barrels are easy to install. They come with outlets for both
watering cans and hoses, and are designed with child-proof openings.

<P> Vancouver residents can call the City's Water Conservation Hotline
at 873-7350 for information on obtaining a barrel. Residents can also
visit City Farmer, at the City of Vancouver's Compost Demonstration
Garden, at 2150 Maple Street to see the rain barrels in use. <P> Further

Edmonton has the distinction of being the first city in Canada to
promote the use of rain barrels as well as offering her citizens the
largest barrel, the <B>RainCatcher</B>, 220 gal or 160 gal, pictured
here. (Available from Rototech Plastics Inc. (403) 962-8812, Spruce
Grove, Alberta.)

<P>

"Summer outdoor water-use by Edmonton homeowners is a big part of the
City's peak demand for water. Peak water-use in the summer determines
when the City must expand its water treatment plants. If homeowners use
rainwater for their outdoor water needs, peak water demand can be
decreased and water treatment plant expansion can be delayed. Big
increases in water rates will then be avoided. This is why the City
decided to investigate rain catchment!

<P> "A study by Edmonton Public Works and Stanley Engineering Ltd. has
shown that, in the Edmonton Region, a simple rain catchment system can
keep a large residential garden healthy and growing all summer. An
average house system would catch up to $60 worth of rain water a year at
current prices. If a homeowner irrigates efficiently and "stretches" the
captured rain water to meet all their irrigation needs, they can
potentially save between $100 and $160 each year - which is the average
household cost for summertime outdoor water-use."

<H3>The International Rainwater Catchment Systems Association
(IRCSA)</H3>


<BLOCKQUOTE>The IRCSA is a new association aiming to link those with an
interest in the direct collection of rainwater and its storage for
domestic and agricultural supply. The seeds for the establishment of the
Association were first sown when the first International Rainwater
Cistern Systems Conference was convened in Hawaii in June 1982 by Prof.
Fok. Subsequent International Conferences have followed on a two-yearly
basis and were held in the US Virgin Islands (1984), Thailand (1987),
Philippines (1989), Taiwan (1991), Kenya (1993) and China (1995). <P>

"Whilst rainwater catchment systems have long been utilised in some
parts of the Caribbean, Middle East and Australia, in other places its
potential has only recently been realised. During the last decade,
Thailand and Kenya, for example, have led their respective continents in
demonstrating the enormous potential of this technology. In Thailand
more than 10 million two thousand litre ferrocement roof catchment tanks
have been constructed since 1985 for domestic water supply, while in
Kenya the construction of large (10 to lOOm3) ferrocement tanks has
gained popularity in many regions with thousands being built at schools,
clinics and private homes. <P>

"Utilisation of rainwater catchment systems has also been spreading in
other parts of Asia (e.g. Nepal, Bangladesh, India and the Philippines)
as well as in Africa (e.g. Botswana, Mali and Tanzania). In
industrialised countries too interest in rainwater collection is growing
as demonstrated by recent developments in Australia, Hawaii and
Singapore. Japan has traditionally used rainwater catchment systems and
is currently making adjustments to meet the requirements of urban
environments." </BLOCKQUOTE> <P>

Downspout Disconnection
Program</FONT></H1></DIV>



<P> <BR>



<TT>Copyright (C) City of Vancouver 1996</TT><BR> 

<P></P><BR>

Disconnecting residential roof
downspouts from the combined sewer system may be an important way to reduce water
pollution caused by Combined Sewer Overflows. Participating in the pilot project
can contribute to a cleaner Burrard Inlet and English Bay. Please help protect
our environment by taking part in this program.

<P></P><BR>

<H2>The City of Vancouver<BR> Downspout Disconnection Pilot Project</H2>

<P>

The City of Vancouver wants to reduce the environmental problems associated with
Combined Sewer Overflows. Disconnection of residential roof downspouts from the
combined sewer system may help us to come closer to that goal. This information
package is intended to answer some of the more common questions that homeowners
may have regarding the City's Downspout Disconnection Pilot Project.

<P>


<H3>What are Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs)? </H3>

The City of Vancouver has, like many other cities, a sewer system that combines
sanitary sewage from homes and storm sewage from street drains and roof
downspouts. During heavy rainfall, the pipes that carry this combined flow are
often not large enough, and the sewer system may overflow into Burrard Inlet,
False Creek, and English Bay.


<P>

<H3>What is the City doing to protect the environment? </H3>


The City is working to reduce the frequency and impact of CSOs. The major part of
this work is the replacement of the current combined sewers with separate
sanitary and storm sewers. Each time an aging sewer pipe is replaced, separate
pipes are installed for sanitary sewage and storm water. As well, the City is
trying to reduce the amount of flow entering into the system. One way to do this
is to disconnect roof downspouts from the sewer system, allowing the relatively
clean water from the roof to flow onto the ground. This reduces the total amount
of water flowing into the sewer system while spreading the flow over a longer
period of time and has the added benefit of reducing flooding potential. Your
neighbourhood (area around Vandusen Botanical Gardens and Shaughnessy Hospital)
has been chosen for a pilot project that will help us determine the feasibility
of large scale downspout disconnection.

<P>


<H3>Why has this area been chosen? </H3>


A recent soil survey of Vancouver showed that your area, among others, rests on a
layer of porous soil. This means that the ground in your neighbourhood will
absorb large amounts of water quite quickly.



<H3>How do we disconnect downspouts?</H3>



<IMG BORDER=3 WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="358" HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 SRC="fig1dwnsp.GIF" ALT="downspout image"
ALIGN=left>


<IMG BORDER=3  WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="348" HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 SRC="fig2dwnsp.GIF" ALT="downspout image"
ALIGN=right>

The City of Vancouver is looking at two methods for the disconnection of
downspouts. The simplest method, shown in <B>Figure 1</B>, is to cut the
downspout just above where it runs into the ground, extend the downspout away
from the house, then allow the water to flow onto a concrete or plastic splash
block to prevent erosion. This permits the water to flow directly onto the ground
to be absorbed by the soil, and is the best method in most situations.



<P> In some unusual cases, where releasing the water onto the ground is not
feasible, a covered gravel trench can be used. The downspout is cut just after it
enters the ground. A trench or pit is excavated, lined to prevent sediment
movement, filled with gravel, then covered with soil to match the surrounding
landscaping. The cut downspout is extended underground so that the water from the
roof flows into the gravel to be absorbed by the soil. This type of disconnection
is shown in <B>Figure 2</B>.





<H3>How does the City's pilot project work?</H3>


If you would like to participate in the pilot project, call<FONT SIZE=4> <B>(604)
873-7325</B></FONT>. An inspector will visit your house to determine the number of roof
leaders that can be disconnected and the best method for disconnection in each
case. The City will provide you with a set of instructions and any necessary
technical assistance. After the disconnection is complete, a follow-up inspection
will ensure that the system works properly. The City will then provide a subsidy
of up to $100 towards the cost of the installation for those who participated in
the pilot project. There are, however, a limited number of spaces available in
this pilot project, so if you wish to participate, please phone quickly!

<TT>Cartoon: <BR><I>Chickens Forced <BR>Out Of Town</I></TT>

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<P></P><BR>


<B>This was the cover story of our first issue of <B>City Farmer
Newspaper</B> way back when. People are still trying to figure out how
to beat City Hall's by-laws. If a neighbour complains, health officials
are forced to investigate, but most of the time chicken owners are left
undisturbed for years. Check your city bylaws, keep your yard tidy and
offer your neighbours fresh eggs every now and again. </B>


<P></P><BR>



Growing your own vegetables in the city rarely makes the front page of
the daily newspaper, but producing your own eggs and meat does. The
<B>Sun</B> and <B>Province</B> newspapers have given a lot of coverage
to the story of Gabriella Centenary who keeps chickens illegally at her
Vancouver home.

<P>

Mrs. Centenary is on welfare and says, she must be resourceful.
"Chickens make a lot of sense - I've got hereditary anemia and I need
eggs and chicken meat for protein. I grow most of my own vegetables too,
and the chickens are good for my garden."

<P>

For over two years Mrs. Centenary has been doing battle with the City.
Just recently in provincial court she was given a suspended sentence and
put on probation for six months for breaking the by-law which makes it
unlawful for any person in Vancouver to keep horses; cattle, swine,
goats, ducks, geese, chickens, turkeys, pigeons or bees.

<P>

It is lawful to keep hamsters, guinea pigs, tame mice, chinchillas,
cats, rabbits or other small animals, snakes and other reptiles to a
maximum of six each.

<P>

D.A. Morgan, Director of the Division of EnvironmentaI Health in
Vancouver, is the man who must answer a complaint about a rooster
crowing at four in the morning (and every five minutes after for several
hours). He is not unfamiliar with chickens. At one time he raised them
in the city. Now he raises them at his home on Bowen Island.

<P>

Mr. Morgan believes that the city is not the place for chickens, their
manure attracts flies and their feed brings rats to the yard. The odour
isn't pleasant and slaughtering the birds can frighten a neighbour's
children. He says that there just isn't enough room in the city for
people to raise chickens.

<P>

But there are citizens in Vancouver who believe that chickens have a
place in our city. They feel that barking dogs and noisy lawnmowers have
less value than a high-protein, egg-producing hen. They say that most of
their neighbours enjoy the chickens, which remind them of a peaceful
country farm.

<P>

In the city the chickens must be kept in a clean environment, fed an
adequate diet and given all the fresh pure water they will drink. These
precautions ensure healthy animals.

<P> Flies which are attracted to the ammonia in chicken wastes are put
to good use. They are captured in traps and fed to the hens. Some
studies have shown that at least a quarter of a chicken's diet can be
flies, another half weeds and other plant wastes, and their egg laying
will still continue to equal that of chickens raised entirely on
commercial feed.

<P>


Chicken manure is extremely rich in nitrogen which is needed in all
plant life. It makes an excellent addition to the compost pile, which in
turn helps produce better vegetables.

<P>

The inhabitants of a house in the city of Berkeley, California, who
raise chickens, slaughter one per week in their backyard, yielding 16
ounces of meat. They estimate a production cost of 35 cents per pound.
Their layers produce approximately 30 eggs per week at an estimated 40
cents per dozen.

<P>

Before chicken raising can become legal in Vancouver, it is necessary to
begin a calm, intelligent exchange of information between those who are
convinced that chickens have a place in the city and those who are not.

<P>

Correct standards for the management of chickens will have to be drawn
up to ensure a healthy  environment and permits should be sold to pay an
inspector's salary.

HREF="http://www.realaudio.com/contentp/npr/ne6n07.html"> National Public Radio's "Talk of the Nation"
</A> via Real Audio over the Internet. Hosted by Ray Suarez, this hour long interview originally played on radio on November 7, 1996. A tape is also available from NPR.</TT>
</P>

<BR>

<P> <A
HREF="http://www.intellinet.com/Heifer/"> Heifer Project International (HPI)
</A> is a 52-year old organization
which combats hunger and poverty and restores the environment by
providing appropriate livestock, participatory training and related
services to small-scale farmers worldwide. </P>





<P> Traditionally HPI's outreach has been to rural communities, but in
September of 1996 a pilot-project in urban agriculture was launched in
the city of Chicago.  HPI will work with poor urban communities to bring
about food and economic self-sufficiency through agriculture-related
micro-enterprise.  Currently one group is hoping to raise a small breed
of dairy goats for cheese sales.  Another group is exploring raising
honeybees on rooftops. </P>


<P> The project is being implemented by Alison Meares, Chicago Field
Rep, and supervised by Skip Polson, Director of HPI's USA/Canada
Program.  Alison can be reached at <B>773-395-9330 or via e-mail at
105260.1711@compuserve.com</B>  Skip can be reached at HPI's headquarters
in Little Rock, Arkansas at <B>1-800-422-1311 or via e-mail at
75244.1045@compuserve.com</B> </P>


<P> In Paris, a bee hive on the roof of the Paris Opera produces a
superb honey sold in exclusive shops. In London, once desolate land is
animated by vivacious youngsters who come to a working farm to learn
from horses and marshes and toads that plants, animals and humanity are
interdependent. In Rome, sheep graze contentedly in public parks,
unfazed by the mad traffic nearby. Europe is, in fact, so committed to
and at ease with urban agriculture that it is home to 850 city farms.
</P>


<P> Throughout the world, the rural tradition of householders' keeping
one or two livestock has been carried into urban areas. For millions of
urban poor who know hunger and poverty, city farming means survival. For
others, it means income. In Jakarta, for example, a teenaged
entrepreneur launched an international food export business by selling,
door-to-door, eggs from chickens raised in his parents' backyard. In
Chicago a few years ago, a group uniquely aware of urban issues as well
as the advantages of livestock farming began to wonder whether animal
agriculture might benefit the American city. </P>


<P> The questioning led to the <B>March 1995 Urban Animal Agriculture
Seminar</B>, the first U.S. conference to explore that issue. Organized by
the Chicago office of Heifer Project International (HPI), the seminar
raised the questions: </P>


<UL TYPE=SQUARE> <P> <LI>Is there a place for animals in the American
city? </P>


<P> <LI>Does urban animal agriculture make sense? </P>


<P> <LI>Is it viable? </P>


<P> <LI>What are the potential benefits? </P>


<P> <LI>What are the constraints? </P>


<P> <LI>Is there interest or energy for such projects? </P> </UL>


<P> The gathering concluded that U.S. cities need the nutritional value,
economic benefits and healing presence of animals. The group took a
realistic look at the potential obstacles, but determined that none is
insurmountable. Further, the seminar demonstrated that the resources,
interest and energy necessary for implementation are abundantly
available. Thus, HPI's Chicago Urban Animal Agriculture Project was
launched. </P>

<DIV ALIGN=LEFT><H2><FONT COLOR="RED">Urban farmers working with a condo developer?<BR><P> This could only happen in
Victoria</FONT></H2></DIV>


<P><BR>



<TT>By James MacKinnon <BR> 
 With the author's permission. <BR>Originally printed In Monday
Magazine<BR> February 1, 1996</TT>


<P></P><BR>



"I never thought I'd be collaborating with people who are building condos." says
Paul Winstanley, sitting an arm's length away from dozens of anti-development
petitions he helped fill with signatures.


<P>
Winstanley is one of a handful of urban farmers who tend a four-lot farm tucked
between Balmoral Road and Mason, Cook and Vancouver streets in Victoria, British
Columbia. Even in winter, the plot is a mosaic of green-bright garlic shoots,
deep, olive rosemary shrubs and winter broccoli with leaves the colour of a
tarnished copper roof.

<P>

But more has grown here than the makings of a good soup. This urban farm long ago
blossomed into a symbol of the clash in values that development brings out in
Victoria.

<P>

Since its founding by Brett Black in 1989 (Black now tends land in Saanich), the
farm has faced constant challenges. There was a move to evict most of the farm's
chickens. The compost has been sniffed at. High-density condo schemes have come
and gone. Even now, the land-leasing farmers could be asked to move on with just
two months' notice. Their protection has been the people in the area, who in most
cases chose to risk siding with the farmers.

<P>

Standing where steamy compost has melted away the snow, Winstanley says the site
may have been an urban farm as long ago as the 186Os. He connects his hopes for
the farm's future to its history. "There's been a continuity of food gathering
here that we'd like to see go to perpetuity."


<P>
So how is it that Winstanley and other urban farmers have ended up involved in -
even giving conditional support for - a condo development proposed for the lots?

<P>


Food is a key ingredient.


<P>
The vision goes something like this. Where the farm is now, a 34-unit,
three-storey condominium development would go up, made neighbourly with a
walkway, a small courtyard restaurant and front door access to every suite.

<P>

Much of the landscaping would be "edible". That is, tomatoes, kale or kohlrabi
might grow in planters, hops vines could crawl over the buildings, bay leaf trees
might line a walkway. On the south side, where two old houses now stand, there
would be a private farm for the condos - a greenhouse and a garden.

<P>

Further south still, Mason Street, presently one-way, would be cut off mid-block,
providing more greenspace. This would also create a pedestrian connection to
Franklin Green, where there is now a small, underused city park. The existing
farm, chickens, compost and all, could replace the park while retaining a public
walkway.
<P>


There is plenty of tinkering to come with this idea. But let's be clear about
what this means. First, it would keep the urban farm close to its roots, in a
place where it is clearly wanted. Second, it would make room for an innovative
development; experts that I called had never heard of farming being planned into
a condo scheme in Canada.
<P>

Third, and most important, it would represent the gains that can be made through
collaboration. in a neighbourhood that faces enormous pressure to change because
of its nearness to the downtown core.
<P>

Gene Miller, the "alternative developer" who came up with the condo plan, recalls
his favourite response to the idea so far: "It's all pie in the sky."


<P>
It's the commitment to the imagination that the idea requires that Miller seems
to like best. As I conjure up images of condos as Babylonian gardens, he says:
"I'm not only not ruling it out, I'm saying that's what should be done. "If the
farm had not existed, I'd have had to create it," Miller says. Later he adds:
"I'm in love with this one."

<P>

Miller, also the founding publisher of Monday Magazine, knows his New Landmarks
design firm has a long ways to go with this proposal. He also recognizes that
some of the farm supporters have a "reasonable fear" that the whole thing could
be a charade.
<P>

"You say 'developer', they think 'spawn of the devil'," he says. And the urban
farmers still hope to make their own deal to buy up the land. They are wary: the
condo proposal is their contingency plan.
<P>

I'm wary too. But something unusually interesting is happening here. I like to
think about this plan. I like the fact that the farm-condo idea cannot be
dismissed in a knee-jerk reaction. It reminds me of how healthy choice can be.
And it reminds me that developing a community is all about risk. Once we realize
that, the risks become easier to take.

<P><BR>



<TT>(C) 1996, Jim Mumm<BR> Mumm's Sprouting Seeds<BR> Hazelridge
Farm, Box 268<BR> Shellbrook, SK, S0J 2E0
</TT>



<P></P><BR>

<H3>Why Sprout at Home?</H3> <P>

Most of us in North America depend on fresh produce that is transported across
half a continent. Though we may garden in the summer, winter stops all but the
most dedicated, or most southern, gardeners. Home sprouting can supply delicious
fresh food, without the environmental drawbacks of the Mega-farm produced fresh
produce, and at a fraction of the cost. <P>

Sprouting at home takes only a few seconds a day and can produce a good part of
your daily requirements of the nutrients you need from fresh produce. The hassles
are minor, the costs are low, and the freshness is wonderful. <P>

If you can supply a jar, some screen or netting, and rinse the sprouts twice a
day, you can grow delicious organic sprouts in 4 to 6 days. <P>

<H3>Sproutable Seeds</H3> <P>

Most seeds can be sprouted and eaten, but avoid sprouting any seeds from plants
that may have poisonous parts. Common seeds for sprouting include alfalfa,
fenugreek, lentils, peas, radish and red clover. Mung beans have been sprouted in
Asia for thousands of years, but take more equipment and time than other seeds.
Other less common seeds include cabbage, garbanzos, mustard seed and quinoa. Most
grains can grow chlorophyll rich grass crops in soil, and grains without hulls
can be used as short sprouts. <P>

Save garden seeds (radish is easy, just let them go to seed and harvest when dry
and ripe). Caragana seeds make delicious sprouts. Spread a blanket or tarp by the
bushes just before the pods pop open to catch the seeds. <P>

<H3>What You Need</H3>

<P> <OL>

<LI>A jar, 1 liter to 4 liter size, depending on your appetite for sprouts and
size of your family. <P>

<LI>A bowl of the right size or weight to prop up the jar.

<P> <LI>Some screen or netting and a rubber band, either nylon tulle from a
fabric shop or gray fiberglass screen from a hardware store, will work fine.

<P> <LI>Fresh water. <P>

<LI>Seeds with good germination, preferably grown organically. Avoid purchased
garden seeds unless you know they aren't treated. Most natural food stores have
the common sprouting seeds; if in doubt, ask if it's organic. If you know a
farmer who grows the seeds you want without chemicals, buy in bulk. Most seeds
keep for a year or more in a cool dry place. </OL>

<P><BR>

<H3>Easy Sprouting Directions (for most small seeds)</H3> <P>

<DL>

<DT><B>Soak</B>

<DD>Put 1 to 4 TBS. seed in a wide mouth jar. Cover with mesh and secure with
rubber band. Add water, swirl and drain. Add 1 cup cool water and soak for 4 - 8
hrs. <P>

<DT><B>Rinse</B>

<DD>Twice a day, refill jar with cool water, swirl and drain. Invert jar and prop
at angle in sink or bowl. <P>

<DT><B>Enjoy</B>

<DD>In three to six days, when sprouts are 3 to 5 cm long, enjoy. Cover the jar
with plastic and a rubber band, or transfer to a covered container, and
refrigerate to store.

</DL>

<P><BR>

<H3>Hints and Options</H3>

<P> <UL>

<LI>You can grow alfalfa, red clover, radish, fenugreek, and other small seeds up
to 1.5 inches long. A 250g bag of alfalfa seed can grow 45 cups of sprouts, or
even more.

<P> <LI>Lentils and peas are best small, with sprouts 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. They
get tougher with more growth. <P>

<LI>	Miss a rinsing? Just continue normally if the sprouts appear alive and
show no signs of mold. The sprouts should be fine. If you do see a spot of mold
or rot, remove it with a good margin of healthy sprouts and discard. Don't
mistake the fuzzy white root hairs of radish, canola, mustards and other
crucifers for mold. <P>

<LI>Be sure to taste sprouts as you go along; use them when you like them. <P>


<LI>To green up sprouts, leave them without a cover for a few hours in bright
light, but not direct sunlight. <P>

<LI>Sprouts grow best between 18C and 25C (65F and 75F). Use luke-warm water for
soaking and rinsing in cool room temperatures, and cold water in hot room
temperatures. <P>

<LI>Drain the sprouts well before they go in the fridge. Rinse in the morning,
cover and refrigerate in the afternoon. <P>

<LI>Mung beans (for Chinese bean sprouts) grow best in a drainable tray or
basket. They like extra rinsing, and are best grown in complete darkness to
prevent bitterness.

</UL>

<PRE>  </PRE>

<H3>Soil Sprouting</H3>


<P> Soil sprouting can be used to produce lettuce-like buckwheat greens or pea
shoots, crunchy sunflower greens, or chlorophyll rich wheat or barley greens. <P>

<OL>

<LI>Fill pots, trays, or other containers (with drainage) 1/2 to 2/3 full of
soil, compost, or potting mix. Ensure that the growing medium doesn't contain
artificial fertilizers or chemicals. <P>

<LI>Soak wheat 8 hr., buckwheat or sunflowers 12-18 hr., and spread on the soil
surface just touching. Water the soil well and cover with plastic. Leave one side
slightly loose for ventilation.

<P> <LI>Mist or sprinkle daily; uncover after three days. <P>

<LI>Put the container(s) in sunlight or bright light for 5-8 days, until the crop
is 5-6" tall. Keep growing medium moist.

<P> <LI>Cut as needed, but before plants become too old and tough.

</OL> <P><BR>

<H3>Hints and Options</H3>


<UL> <P> <LI>Wheatgrass may be left for a smaller second crop. Buckwheat, peas
and sunflowers cut only once. <P>

<LI>Spent soil and roots can be composted or dug into the garden.

<P> <LI>These crops can also be grown in baskets or tray type sprouters, but are
more trouble to take care of.

</UL>

<PRE>  </PRE>

<H3>Serving Suggestions</H3> <P>

<B>Grilled Cheese</B> - liven up a grilled cheese sandwich with your favorite
sprouts and a tomato slice. <P>

<B>Tacos</B> - Use sprouts instead of shredded lettuce in tacos. <P>

<B>Hamburgers & Hot dogs</B> - sprouts can replace lettuce in these kid's
favourites. <P>

<B>Sandwiches, Subs and Pitas</B> - sprouts are a delicious addition to any of
these. <P>

<B>Salads</B> - add fresh sprouts to just about any salad, or create your own
sprout salad. (hint -- radish sprouts are great in coleslaw or potato salad, or
anyplace you'd use radishes. <P>

<B>Omelettes</B> - Add a half cup of sprouts to your omelettes just before
folding. Sprout mixes or alfalfa are great for this. <P>

<B>Breads</B> - a half cup of sprouts per loaf makes a tasty, nutritious addition
to homemade breads. (Add with the liquids) <P>

<B>Soups</B> - a few sprouts added just before serving are great in many soups.

<P> <B>Peanut butter sandwiches</B> - Believe it or not I love sprouts in peanut
butter sandwiches!

<P>

Use your imagination. Please let us know when you find a new use for sprouts.

<P><BR>

This training package,<B> Improving Nutrition Through Home
Gardening</B>, is for the instruction of agricultural extension, home
economics and community development agents working with households and
communities in Southeast Asia to promote home gardening for better
nutrition. <P>

In rural and peri-urban areas of Southeast Asia, families often farm 500
to 1500m<SUP>2</SUP> of land around their home. This area offers great
potential for improving household food supplies: the home garden can be
used to raise many kinds of fruit, vegetables, staple food crops,
medicinal plants, spices and sometimes farm animals and fish. <P>

The training package integrates food production and nutrition issues and
provides a comprehensive set of materials with which extension workers
may assist families in improving food production and adding nutritional
value to their diets.

<H3>Excerpt from Home Garden Technology Leaflet 8</H3> <P> <P> <H2>Using
Wetland</H2> <P> <P> Low-lying and swampy land can be very productive
for many crops, including rice. In a home garden, even a very small area
of wetland, such as the banks of a drain, can be used for growing food
all year. <P>

<H3>The Swamp Garden And Fish Pond</H3>

<P> <IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="wetgarden.GIF "WIDTH="273" HEIGHT="233"
HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=2 ALT="wet garden image"> Where there is a
gully or small creek, a pond can be dug out and allowed to fill with
water. If it is necessary to make a small dam, use clayey soil (subsoil)
in the dam wall because topsoil and any organic matter, such as sticks
and plant stems, will let water through. Also make sure there is an
overflow channel which guides water around the dam wall if there is very
heavy rain and the pond floods. Without an overflow channel the dam wall
may weaken and collapse. <P>

Cover the banks of the pond or channel with useful crops to prevent the
soil from washing into the pond and to make use of the land. Depending
on the water depth, set some plants in the bottom of the pond. Climbing
plants, especially pumpkins and gourds, can be grown on a trellis over
the pond to shade the water and keep it cool. <P>

Fish such as tilapia and nila will grow well feeding on tiny organisms
in the mud at the bottom, but they also must be fed daily with soft
green leaves such as cassava. Growing plants such as water spinach in
the pond will provide a place for the fish to hide from the sun or from
predators.

<H3>The City of Vancouver Water Conservation Program</H3>

<P><BR>

Two hundred years ago, Captain George Vancouver's ship Discovery sailed towards a
land of towering coniferous trees, flowing streams and leaping salmon.  The city
of Vancouver was founded in the midst of this place -- Pacific Coastal Temperate
Rainforest -- where trees grow large through typically cool, wet winters.  Much
of the forest and streams that once were found in Vancouver have since been
destroyed.  The rain endures, however, and sometimes it seems to Vancouverites
that it will never end ...


<P> The Pacific Coast, however, is not always wet.  Summers in the Northwest are
often extremely dry and then one is reminded that water is an essential element
of life.  There are often great demands placed by homeowners on the city water
supply at these times.  By working with the land in a more sensitive manner that
is water-conserving, Vancouverites can ensure that fresh water will continue to
flow well into the future.

<P>

The City of Vancouver has developed its Water Conservation Program to educate
citizens about the principles and practices of natural cultivation of the land
that conserves water.  These methods include contouring of the ground, soil
conditioning using compost, collection of rain water, the use of native plants,
and passive watering.  Rediscovering the importance of water to life in Vancouver
will help us to cultivate a society that is water-conserving ... and waterwise.


<P><BR>

<DL> <DT><H3><FONT color="#8B0000">Follow the Land</FONT></H3> <DD>by attending
to its form and observing the rain as it falls onto it.  The contours of the land
can be changed to catch the rain water, slow its flow, and hold it in the ground
for use by plants.




<P>


<DT><H3><FONT color="#8B0000">Care for the Soil</FONT></H3> <DD>by adding compost
to improve its condition. Compost -- decomposed organic matter -- will help the
soil to hold the rain water when it falls and will add nutrients necessary for
plant growth.  Mulches will prevent the soil from overheating drying out.




<P>


<DT><H3><FONT color="#8B0000">Gather the Rain </FONT></H3> <DD>by catching it in
rainbarrels when it falls and holding it for later use.  The rain water that is
collected costs nothing and it can be used in the garden during the summer when
the ground is dry.



<P>




<DT><H3><FONT color="#8B0000">Plant Naturally </FONT></H3> <DD>using species that
are native to this land. These plants are naturally rain-watered and are adapted
to wet winter and dry summer conditions.  Plant only those that have been grown
in the nursery from collected seeds or cuttings ... leave the wild plants in
place in their natural habitat.




<P>

<DT><H3><FONT color="#8B0000">Water Wisely </FONT></H3> <DD>with a gentle hand
and passive watering methods. Use a watering can which softly sprays water onto
the plants or a soaker hose which will slowly drip water into the ground when it
is needed.  Many plants that are adapted to dry summer conditions do not need
much water a few years after planting.




<P>

<DT><H3><FONT color="#8B0000">Tend Patiently</FONT></H3> <DD>by planting with a
sparing hand and bearing in mind that the plants will become much larger.  Plants
that grow in dry summer conditions will use the nutrients that occur naturally in
the soil and in the compost that is added to condition it.




<P>


<DT><H3><FONT color="#8B0000">Share the Fruits and Spread the
Seeds</FONT>	</H3> <DD>by gathering the crop and sharing the harvest within
the community.  Spreading the fruits of our labour and sowing the seeds of a
water-wise society, will ensure that our city will be a healthy one with food and
water for all.

<p>Welcome to City Farmer's home on the World Wide Web. After 19 years
digging in the fields of Urban Agriculture, we want to share with you
what we have learned. The Web makes it possible for us to reach a much
larger audience than we were reaching before the arrival of on-line
publications.<P>

Our non-profit society promotes urban food production and environmental
conservation from a small office in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia
and from our <A HREF="demogarden2.html#Garden"><B><FONT
SIZE=4>demonstration food garden</FONT></B></A> in nearby Kitsilano, a
residential neighbourhood. <P> Urban Agriculture is a new and growing
field that is not completely defined yet even by those closest to it. It
concerns itself with all manner of subjects from rooftop gardens, to
composting toilets, to air pollution and community development. It
encompasses mental and physical health, entertainment, building codes,
rats, fruit trees, herbs, recipes and much more.<p>


<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE= 5> Please note our new web address<FONT
COLOR="#8B0000"> http://www.cityfarmer.org </FONT></FONT></DIV>


<P>

Our Office wants you to know about some of the issues we deal with from
day to day. There are very few offices in the world that have our
experience serving city farmers all year round or have done so for as
many years as we have.

These pages will grow as we select the latest breaking information that
comes to us, as we review our large library of resources for useful
documents to put on-line, and as we hook you up with other Urban
Agriculture Web sites that most certainly will emerge.<p>

<B>Urban Agriculture Notes</B> is written for those who want to start up
their own "Office of Urban Agriculture", for those who have already done
so, and for gardeners who are curious about what we refer to as
<B>political horticulture</B>.

So sit up, bear with us as we add to this site week by week and listen
to the birds singing in our garden.<p>

<P>
This study examined urban food producers and their households.  The producers resided in Kibera, a large informal settlement of Nairobi.  Fieldwork for the study was carried out between August and October of 1994.  Four types of food producers took part in the study: case study informants (4), focus group participants (a total of 12 individuals in three focus groups), open-ended questionnaire respondents (7), and special interest interviewees (2).  The fieldwork also included seven short interviews with Kibera residents not involved in food production and conversations with representatives of four non-governmental organizations and two government ministries.  Considerable emphasis was placed on the four case studies as they provided an opportunity for observation of individual producers within the context of their households.  This observation took place over a three week period and allowed the researcher to take an in-depth look at how producers with limited material and monetary resources engage in urban agriculture.
</P>



<P>
One of the main features of this study is the addition of a qualitative dimension to urban agriculture research in East Africa.  The study explored various aspects of food production at an individual, household, and community level.  Previous research has not permitted an examination of the producer as a member of a household, nor has it given insights into differences between producers within the low- and very low-income categories.  Valuable empirical evidence is provided on gender relations, labour relations, and the multiple uses of produce.  The results also indicate that food production is only one of several livelihood strategies used by urban households.  The critical issue of access to land for food production is brought to the forefront as the assumption that there will be abundant open space land in Nairobi for many years to come is challenged.
</P>



<P>
The practices of urban food producers provide a useful entry point for the examination of producer decision making.  Practices are in fact decisions which have been implemented and that they are a reflection of the complexity of the decision making process.  Some of the main considerations which producers take into account are the availability of cash within the household (generated by the producers and by other household members), the value of produce for home consumption, the availability of labour, and the risks associated with insecure land tenure, theft, and land degradation.  Relatives and friends help urban food producers with seeds and money during the early stages of food production.  Few producers receive labour assistance from relatives or friends in the fields.  Kibera producers must rely in large part on their own labour.  Close ties with family in rural areas are maintained through gifts of food and cash.  Interestingly, there is a net flow of food and money from Kibera to rural areas.

<P>
As there are some foods which producers cannot produce at all (e.g., rice) and others which they cannot grow enough of (e.g., dry maize which is a staple), some cash is always needed to buy food.  Although Kibera producers are primarily engaged in subsistence production, they sometimes have surplus produce for sale or have crops which are grown specifically for sale.  The revenues derived from these sales are used to buy food and meet other basic needs.  The food produced by Kibera residents has a high value to them and their households.  By reducing their dependence on market bought food, producers become less vulnerable to changes in food prices and can free-up cash for other uses.  When produce supplies are low, the availability of cash from non-agricultural sources becomes a key determinant of household food availability.
</P>



<P>
Tenure issues emerged as the important constraint for Kibera food producers.  The urban food producers in the study have their plots in the 'Langata' area (a large open space across from Kibera and near Nairobi Dam).  Since 1989, most of this area has been privatized and new rental units are being built on some of the plots formerly used for food production.  The urban food producers who devote the most time to agriculture are those who have resided in Kibera for more than eight years and have a large number of dependents (6 children on average).  Because access to land depends primarily on when the producer started growing food and on who the producer knows, longer established food producers have three or more plots compared to the one or two plots of more recent arrivals.  It is very difficult for individuals outside the existing kinship and ethnic networks of established producers to obtain land for cultivation.
</P>



<P>
Although most producers face similar problems like insecure land tenure, theft, and labour constraints, there are relatively few organized groups of producers.  Lack of time and money and a sense of powerlessness for resolving the tenure and theft problems were cited and major difficulties for group formation and participation.  It is at the level of producer organization where non-governmental organizations can provide the most valuable assistance to urban food producers.

"Urban Food Producer Decision Making" by Pascale Dennery.. A 10,000 word article in <B>African Urban Quaterly</B> in a special issue on urban agriculture.

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Abstract</H3>

<P>
This paper presents findings from a study of decision making by urban food producers.  The food producers resided in Kibera, Nairobi's largest informal settlement.  The study used primarily qualitative methods to investigate how food producers with limited material and monetary resources engage in urban agriculture.  The practices of urban food producers served as the entry point of the examination of decision making processes.  The availability of cash within the household; the value producers place on food for home consumption; the availability of labour; and the risks associated with insecure land tenure, theft and land degradation were the factors which most influenced the practices of urban food producers.  Examples from the study will be used to illustrate the effect of these factors.  An overview of the types of relationships urban food producers have with other household members and with the community at large will be touched on in the latter sections of the paper.

This is just one of the more bizarre questions Spring Gillard answers as the GVRD
Compost Hotline Operator. "My answer was, well, if you mean the cereal no, grains
can attract rodents. If you mean the man, no, because we don't recommend
composting meat - again because it will attract rodents with the smell as it
breaks down!"

"Probably the question most often asked", says Gillard is, 'I've got millions and
millions of flies, they fly into my mouth every time I open the lid, what do I
do?' The problem is usually that they're not burying their food scraps well
enough. So we go over the correct formula: alternate layers of brown and green
and whenever it's a food scrap layer, give it a sprinkling of dirt. And make sure
you mix it up at least once every two weeks with a pitch fork or compost
aerator."

<P>
"Lately, we've been getting a lot of calls about the <B>Earth Machine</B> as a lot of
municipalities are offering this bin through their compost bin distribution
program. People think it's an actual machine that you plug in and it compacts
your food for you or something! But it's just a plastic container, not much
bigger than a garbage can. In a way it's better than technological wizardry -
it's like magic. You put all this garbage in and a few months later out comes
this black gold - an incredibly rich, organic fertilizer for your garden or house
plants!"

<H3>Compost Hotline Hot Tips on Composting</H3>

<OL>

<LI>Start with a layer of straw or twiggy material on the bottom for good air
circulation.

<P>
<LI>Alternate 2 to 4 inch layers of green (grass, food scraps, garden waste) and
brown (straw, dry leaves, stripped up newspaper) materials. Store up leaves in
bags in the fall for a good brown supply.

<P>
<LI>Sprinkle every food scrap layer (uncooked fruit and vegetables, no meat, fish,
dairy, oils, grains) with a light covering of ordinary dirt. Keep a bucket handy
by your bin.
<P>

<LI> Always cap off food scrap layer with brown layer after dirt has been added.
This will smother fly eggs and smells.

<P>
<LI> Mix contents of bin at least once every two weeks with a pitch fork or compost
aerator.

</OL>

<H3>Six Most Asked Hotline Questions</H3>

<OL>

<LI> <B>Q:</B> I've got millions of flies, what do I do?

<P>
<B>A:</B>	Cover your food scraps with a light layer of dirt, then a layer (2 - 4
inches) of brown material (leaves, straw or stripped up newspaper) or a 2 to 3
inch layer of dirt only.
<P>

<LI><B>Q:</B> Nothing is happening in my bin, what do I do?

<P>
<B>A:</B>	Chances are the balance is off in the bin and you may need carbon material
(brown). Add more brown and mix thoroughly.

<P>
<LI><B>Q:</B> My bin smells, now what?

<P>
<B>A:</B>	Add some dirt, mix in some brown material, aerate (mix up), and then cap it
all off with a brown layer.

<P>
<LI>	<B>Q:</B> Where do I get worms and how do I start a worm bin?

<P>
<B>A:</B>	The hotline maintains a complete list of worm farmers and can tell you how
to set up a bin. Call the hotline for a worm supplier in your area.
<P>

<LI>	<B>Q:</B> Where can I get a compost bin?

<P>
<B>A:</B>	Call the hotline to see if your municipality is offering a bin distribution
program.
<P>

<LI>	<B>Q:</B> Where can I get rid of my heavier yard waste - shrub and tree trimmings,
etc.?

<P>
<B>A:</B>	Call the hotline for green waste sites in your area.

</OL>

<PRE>  </PRE>

If you have a question for the <B>Compost Hotline, call 736-2250</B>. It's a seven day
service - so even if you don't get a live operator, someone will get back to you
very quickly. Happy composting!

<P> Developed in Vancouver, British Columbia by a team of compost
educators as an addendum to the popular Eco Education Program, the
Compost Module will help bring children, teachers, parents and the
community into the compost picture.

<P> Through a number of engaging activities, children (K-7) learn that
composting is a personal and social responsibility. They learn how much
garbage they produce, what it's made up of and how to reduce, reuse and
recycle it through composting.

<P> A light-hearted video (optional), entitled <B>Do the Compost
Scene</B>, gives composting the good rap it deserves and introduces
students to the basics. Teacher directed activities in the module range
from making <B>Compost in a Cup</B> to comparing <B>Apples and
Oranges</B>. Field trips, question and answer sessions and a variety of
experiments on the <B>Fine Art of Decay</B> will keep students absorbed
for many happy hours.

<P>

Vancouver teachers are taking advantage of a great program subsidized by the
City: <B>Wormshops City Farmer style</B>, offered at the Vancouver Compost Demonstration
Garden. That's right. It's a specialized form of composting for apartment
dwellers or classroom situations - and a great vehicle to teach kids about
composting - nature's way of recycling.

<P>

Hilary Pada, a biology student at UBC is one of City Farmers' certified wormshop
instructors. She gives wormshops in your classroom or at the garden. "Each
wormshop is an hour long and very hands on", says Pada, "which means the kids can
get a bit wild and have a lot of fun. The bins are ideal for classrooms because
they will fit neatly onto a shelf or under a table."



<H3>Garden Field Trips</H3>


While setting up the worm bin for their classroom, the group learns about
composting, waste reduction and the science of worms. "Many teachers build a
whole unit around the wormshop and a field trip to the garden, with follow-up
activities and on-going worm bin monitoring", says Pada. A garden wormshop
includes a five senses tour of the garden. Of course the optimum time is late
summer when there's plenty of raspberries, strawberries and cherry tomatoes, but
there's always something interesting. Lemon Balm is a big hit for some reason.
The kids love to rub the lemony leaves on their hands", Pada explains.



<H3>Affordable!</H3>

Here's the best news of all for teachers (community groups, daycares, adult
groups, gardening clubs, welcome too), the cost to Vancouver teachers is just $20
for the bin, worms and bedding materials. The instructor's fee is subsidized by
the City of Vancouver. Teachers outside of Vancouver can still partake in the
program, but the total cost will be $60.


<H3>Harvest Time</H3>

In about three months time, the worm bin is ready to be harvested. This means the
worms need to be separated from the finished compost (or worm poop as it's also
called - the nurseries call it worm castings or Black Gold and it's priced
accordingly!). "In the past, a lot of teachers didn't really want to deal with
this side of worm composting, so we lost a lot of bins and worms - or they just
weren't sure how to go about it. So now we offer a harvesting workshop ($ 15.00)
so that teachers and kids learn this procedure properly as well. It's really
important because if the worms are left in their own waste, they would die",
warns Pada. With the finished compost, each child plants a flower or vegetable to
take home.


<H3>How to Book a Wormshop</H3>


If you're interested in booking a worm shop, call the Compost Hotline at
736-2250. Or drop by the Vancouver Compost Demonstration Garden for a look at the
Worm Corner. They're located at 2150 Maple Street at 6th Avenue in Kits and
they're open Wed. through Fri. from 9 to 4 (Apr-Nov); Fri and Sat. 9 to 4
(Dec-March).

<P>


So says Wes Barrett, head gardener at Vancouver's Compost Demonstration
Garden. "The recycled plastic bin retails for around $100", says
Barrett, "and having tested many of the plastic bins ourselves, we think
it's one of the best." The City of Vancouver continues to offer compost
bins to residents of Vancouver for a subsidized price of $25.


<H3>Continuous Composting</H3>


Here's why it's one of the best according to Barrett. "The Soil Saver is
shorter and squatter than some of the other bins so it's easier to work
with and get into and turn the materials. It also has sliding doors on
adjacent sides for easy access to finished compost. These doors allow
for continuous composting - you just keep adding to the top and taking
from the bottom."


<H3>Looks aren't Everything</H3>


"The bin is esthetically pleasing, too", says Barrett. "Many of the
people who come to the garden like the look of the compost bin. It's
nice and compact, black and not much bigger than a garbage bin, so it
tucks nicely into the corner of a yard or patio. But the bin has a 12
cubic foot capacity which amounts to about 300 and some odd litres of
food and yard waste. So it can do the job for a family of say, five
people easily."


<H3>City Farmer's Special Recipe</H3>


"Looks aside", Barrett says, " it's really how you manage the bin that
counts." The special recipe that City Farmer stands by is the old 'wet
and dry, brown and green'. For example, if you start with a layer of
straw (dry) or twiggy material on the bottom, you allow air to circulate
up through the bin. Then you continue with alternating layers of brown
(fall leaves, straw, stripped up newspaper) and green (grass, garden
waste, food scraps). Generally, green materials tend to be wet as well,
and brown materials are dry. Keep a bucket of dirt next to your bin so
that when you add a layer of food scraps (uncooked fruit and veggies, no
meat, fish, grains, dairy, oils), you can sprinkle it with dirt (kills
smells and fly eggs), and then top it off with a brown layer. If the
food is well buried each time, you won't attract rodents with the
smells. <P>

And make sure you mix everything up well at least once every two weeks
with a pitch fork or compost aerator (available at most nurseries and
hardware stores now)."


<H3>More Tips from the Master</H3>


"Store up your dry fall leaves in garbage bags or cans so you always
have a brown source on hand. Keep a bucket of soil handy, too. Just
store up food waste in a covered bucket under your kitchen sink, and add
your scraps to the outdoor bin once or twice a week. We recommend
setting the bin up in a sunny spot right on the soil, but if a shady
area on the patio is all you've got, go ahead."


<H3>Extra rodent protection</H3>


For added rodent resistance, Barrett recommends a sheet of hardware
cloth (1/2", 20 gauge wire mesh) which you can lay on the ground, then
set your bin on top of it.  That way rodents can't burrow up underneath.


<H3>Where do you sign up?</H3>


Just drive out to the Vancouver Transfer Station at 377 West Kent Avenue
North (down Cambie, cross S.W. Marine Drive, turn left). They're open 9
to 5, 7 days a week. Bring $25 cash and ID. to show you live in
Vancouver. The bin comes in a box and will fit into your trunk. There is
a bit of assembly involved but we promise, you won't need a city
engineer to put it together. If you don't live in Vancouver, call the
Compost Hotline to find out if your municipality is offering a bin
program; most of them are.


<H3>Personal Instruction and Hotline Service</H3>

If you want a personal workshop, come by the Vancouver Compost
Demonstration Garden at 2150 Maple Street in Kitsilano. They're open
Wed. through Sat. from 9 to 4. Or call the Compost Hotline at 736-2250
and ask about Demonstration Gardens in your area.

<LI>2	or 3 buckets for finished compost and worms (one should have a cover to
set on loosely) <P>


<LI>Worms favorite sweet snacks (kiwis, apples, melons)<P>


<LI><P> Plastic sheet or large garbage bag for harvesting area <P>

</UL>

<PRE>  </PRE>

<H3>Steps to Harvesting</H3> <P>

<OL> <LI>Feed your worms one last time before harvest and leave them for at least
10 days (you want to starve them a little). <P>


<LI>Get a small onion sack or laundry bag with holes large enough for worms to
crawl through. Fill bag with some of worms favorite foods, sweet things like
apples, melon peels, kiwis, etc. <P>


<LI>Bury bag with food in next corner as you would their regular feeding. Leave
for a day and a half (check) to two days. <P>

<LI>After two days, the worms should have migrated into the onion bag. If so,
remove the bag and set in a covered pail for the moment. Make sure you leave air
venting. <P>


<LI>You may want to put down a plastic sheet or bag in the harvest area as there
will be some mess. Now, beginning in the opposite corner to where you last fed,
start to pull out handfuls of the finished compost and dump into an empty bucket.
You should find very few worms. Place any you might find into the covered bucket
with the bagged worms or another smaller bucket if you like.


<P> <LI>As you get nearer to the area where you had the bag buried, you may find
a few more straggler worms. You may want to do a dump and sort with this last bit
of compost - or build a small mound of finished compost, exposed to the light and
sift off the top so that the worms dive down. <P>


<LI>Once you have all the compost and worms sorted, rebuild the bed with your
moistened leaves, newspaper, and couple handfuls of dirt. <P>


<LI>Take the bag of worms and bury them in the first corner. This will be their
first feeding. Make sure you put all the stragglers that were outside the bag in
too.

<P> <LI>In a week or a little less depending on how much food was in the bag,
feed your worms in the next corner. In a few days, you should be able to lift the
bag out of the first corner and shake it free of castings. Most of the worms
should have migrated to the next feeding area and voila you've just harvested
your bin!

<P>

<LI>By having all your worms in a bag, it is also easier to see how many you
actually have so that if necessary you can divide the population at that time -
and start another worm bin for yourself or a friend.

<P>
<TT>By Alexandra Woodsworth<BR>
May 18, 1995<BR>
</P>



<P>
Alexander wrote this paper for a Grade 10 high school project in the Trek Program at Prince of Wales High School in Vancouver. Alexandra's father, Bob Woodsworth, is a founding director of City Farmer.
</P><BR>

</TT>




<P>
Imagine a vacant lot between two run-down buildings. Imagine it filled with old newspapers, empty wine bottles, needles and condoms.  Then imagine this barren, depressing scene five years into the future.  It is filled with grass, vegetables, flowers and trees.  It is filled with beauty and children and laughter.  This once-vacant lot is now a flourishing neighbourhood garden, and it has a purpose.  These community gardens reach across the barriers of age, race, sex, ability and economic status.  The participants range from troubled young people to elderly retirees to large families.  The gardens vary from small patches of earth to acres of plants, trees and ponds. 
</P>


<P>
The increased growth of urban gardens is vital for many reasons. To begin with, communal city gardens foster a strong sense of community and pride in one's neighbourhood.  Equally important are the strong economic advantages of urban gardening.  In addition, community gardens are extremely healthy, both physically and psychologically.  Finally, city gardens provide a much-needed oasis for a wide variety of wildlife and plantlife. All in all, it is overwhelmingly obvious that community gardens should be developed in vacant lots and parks in cities and towns throughout the Lower Mainland.
</P>



<P>
One of the major reasons for the development of urban gardens is their effectiveness in enhancing community development and morale.  Neighbourhood gardens nurture not only food and plants, but people and local culture as well.  Amateur plays and festivals, as well as painters, musicians and other artists, often make their homes in the gardens.  
</P>


<P>
Even though every member of the community may not be a gardener, the benefits of urban gardens can be felt by each citizen. For example, in 1991, a Seattle community garden produced 8 tons of food for the local food bank (Urban, 1994, 9).  As well, recycling programs, improved air quality and a lower crime rate all contribute greatly to an ameliorated feeling of community (Huff, 1990, 24-25).  
</P>



<P>
Sam Snobelen, a Downtown Eastside Residents Association community worker in Vancouver, corroborates this idea: "The garden has had a marvelously positive impact on the community. It's built cohesiveness.  It's really brought people together in a very positive way" (Sinclair, 1994, 8).  The gardens are often built on vacant lots which were previously used by drug dealers, gangs and squatters (Sarti, 1991, B6).  When these people no longer frequent the neighbourhood, it becomes a safer, happier, more pleasing place. 
</P>



<P>
One of the products of this more positive atmosphere is the presence of horticultural therapy in community gardens.  Gardening is becoming recognized by academics and doctors alike as a spiritually uplifting occupation (Jobb, 1979, 37).  Restless teenagers, bitter old people, the unemployed and the handicapped find gardening enjoyable and rewarding.  A plant doesn't nag or reprimand, and it "repays everything, and more, that a caring gardener gives it" (Huff, 1990, 24).  While sowing and raking and harvesting, these unhappy people talk to other gardeners and are often drawn into the community and made to feel welcome and happy. As urban gardens work to increase  these unhappy people's sense of well-being, as well of that of each other neighbourhood member, the community as a whole benefits accordingly.
</P>



<P>
As well as bolstering community pride, neighbourhood gardens make economic sense, for both poor and middle class citizens. Indeed, the first community gardens were started by the mayor of Detroit in the 1890's as a result of a major economic depression (Huff, 1990, 29).  The gardens were abandoned when the economy stabilized.  
</P>



<P>
However, throughout history, whenever there have been food or money shortages, community gardens have resurfaced. The Liberty Gardens of World War I, the Victory Gardens of World War II and the many gardens which sprang up during the Great Depression serve as examples of these 'emergency' gardens (Coe, 1978, 14).  Today, 69 percent of community gardeners in the U.S. say that saving money is the primary reason for gardening (Sommers, 1984, 15).  
</P>


<P>
For needy people who are homeless or just barely surviving on welfare, urban gardens can provide a vital source of almost-free nutrition.  It costs next to nothing to garden, and the average plot in a community garden yields about 540 pounds of food annually, which translates into $470 in savings (Sommers, 1984, 14).  To someone who lives in poverty, this is an enormous gain to their lifestyle.  Even for those people who are not destitute, growing their own food cuts back tremendously on costs.  A massive percentage of the price of store-bought food is "determined by advertising, packaging, and many other processes - things you can't see" (Jobb, 1979, 17). 
</P>



<P>
The actual food product has changed hands so many times, and has been transported and stored for so long, that by the time the consumer buys it at the supermarket, the price has inflated immensely.  All in all, the economic benefits of community gardening are enormous.
</P>




<P>
The advantages of urban gardens extend beyond the economy to the physical and spiritual health of the individual.  Simply being outside in the fresh air and sunshine with a little bit of raking and hoeing as exercise can improve your fitness, as well as your mental attitude.  The health of the body is directly related to what goes into it, in other words, food.  For a city-dweller, it is difficult to find fresh foods which are organic and free of other "supermarket stabilizers, emulsifiers, preservatives, artificial flavourings, and other nonfood additives of dubious nutritional value" (Jobb, 1979, 21).  The few organic stores that exist have exorbitantly high prices. Growing one's own edibles is a cheap, simple and easy way to insure that the food is fresh and nutritious (Sommers, 1984, 19). 
</P>



<P>
Experimentation is also an important  advantage of community gardening.  Many types of vegetables and fruits are unavailable in cities - for example chayote, amaranth, winged beans, bitter melons, balsam pears, and taro (Jobb, 1979, 38).  As well, many ethnic foods are hard to find in North America and are easy to grow.  Although immigrants often do feel transplanted from their native lands, they are not the only people who feel rootless.  In contrast to olden times, when a person usually was born and died in the same town or farm, humans today can live in many countries, let alone cities, in their lifetime:
</P>




<P>
Without roots in land or family, many modern folks feel estranged from basic human rites, unsettled, rootless, restless.  People removed from relatives and seasonal fluctuations are not humbled by nature.  Modern writers speak of the "necessity of wildness" or "rituals of return to the human condition."  Others talk simply in terms of getting "back to the land" (Jobb, 1979, 36).
</P>




<P>
These "drifters" end up feeling as though they belong nowhere, as though they have no space to call their own (Sommers, 1984, 14). While being small and sometimes temporary, a neighbourhood garden plot can help alleviate this feeling.  On the whole, community gardens can greatly improve the healing of the body and mind.
</P>



<P>
Added to their positive health aspects. community gardens help to create new wildlife and plantlife habitats and protect disappearing ones.
</P>



<P>
Augmenting the widespread formation of community gardens in British Columbia is essential for numerous purposes.  First, they are a practical and pleasant method of strengthening community pride and cohesiveness.  Furthermore, an urban garden can be a major economic boon to any citizen.  Community gardens can also contribute greatly to a physically and mentally healthy lifestyle.  Moreover, neighbourhood gardens are sanctuaries for many varieties of animals and plants.  During the past century, community gardens have been started many times.  Until the late 1970's, however, these gardens would be abandoned  as soon as they were no longer needed.  Today the popularity of community gardens are increasing rapidly as people realize their many benefits.  There is much work to be done:
</P>

<P>
We praise the person who had the sense to set aside Stanley Park years ago.  We need to set aside pieces of land in Greater Vancouver for future community gardens.  We need to do it now, before it's too late (Urban, 1994, 9).

<PRE>  </PRE>

<B>May 5, 1996.</B> Crocuses are finally blooming!  Patches of snow remain only in shady areas. Heard the sound of ducks in the bay, and picked a bonquet of pussy willows , so maybe its spring! This author lives by a lake about 20 minutes from the Town of Kenora. The ice on the lake is beginning to look blue and is melting along the edges, so perhaps in a week or two we might get breakup  and see the water flowing once more.
<P>


Hello and greetings from the <B>Kenora Community Gardening Coalition</B>!  Kenora is the last town in Ontario before the Manitoba border. We are 2 hours from Winnipeg, Manitoba and 6 hours away from our closest Ontario city, Thunder Bay. Our population, including adjacent towns,  is approximately 24,000. Our winters are long, and severe. We started this past winter in October and we had our last snow storm April 25th!
<P>


This will be <B>our first year for a community garden</B>!  We are renting 10' x 12' plots for $5.00. Over 30 people have registered to date, some are even asking for double plots. So, who is gardening in Kenora?<BR>
<P>
 The gardeners are as diverse as our population base.
<UL><LI>retired folk wanting to explore new techniques of growing with mulch; <P>

<LI>backyard gardening enthusiasts, who along with their neighbours or relatives, want to grow extra food for the winter;<P>

<LI> first nation people who want to rekindle their lost art of growing potatoes and corn; <P>

<LI> apartment dwellers anxious to get their hands dirty and reap the pleasures of homegrown produce;<P>

<LI>parents who want to share the gardening experience with their children. </UL>
<P>


Our Coalition began this project in March and already we have had requests from Ear Falls, Sioux Lookout and Geralton on how to get started and where to access money. We anticipate that in a few years, all our communities in the Northwest (Ontario) will have their own community gardens up and running, but currently, we have the only site in the region. We have contacted people in both Winnipeg and Thunder Bay to determine the scope of their gardening activities and build our outreach network.
<P>


We hope to be in our gardens by the end of May. The ground has not thawed yet, but we have already begun clearing . An adjacent municipality has donated the land  and they will be doing the initial site preparation work in partnership with some people who need to work off some community service time. 
<P>


One of our biggest  concerns is damage to our gardens from bears.  Last year, <B>officials moved 60 bears out of Kenora</B>! Homeowners were reluctant to walk down their street after supper for fear of running into a black bear!  At our house, our dog's barking  kept bears up trees for hours. We were fortunate that the bears did not do any damage to our garden, but they have destroyed our composter. All our guests last summer  were delighted to see bears  closeup, but although they look so cute and cuddly, they are very dangerous ! This winter was so severe, some believe that many bears did not make it through the winter. One can only hope!
<P>
We would be pleased to hear from other community gardening projects.

<TT>by Libby J. Goldstein</TT><BR> <P></P>

In 1897, 56th & Haverford was divided into 1/5th acre plots by the
Philadelphia Vacant Lot Cultivation Association to afford gardening
space in Philadelphia because "great distress prevailed in our city on
account of lack of employment". <P> The Vacant Lot Cultivation
Association provided land and technical assistance through at least
1919, encouraging children to garden and adults to begin for-profit
market gardens on lots throughout Philadelphia. <P> From 1976 until
1989, Penn State Urban Gardening Program sponsored a half-acre community
garden at 56th & Haverford. The area was gardened, developed,
de-developed, gardened and, finally, redeveloped in one century. <P>
During both World Wars, the government advocated vegetable gardening so
that more farm products could be sent to the military. I remember 200 to
300 square foot plots in Fairmount Park not far from the old Woodside
Park. Not so generous as the early "farms", but big enough for a family
of four. <P> In 1953, Louise Bush-Brown organized settlement house
workers, and garden clubs into the Neighborhood Gardens Association to
sponsor horticultural beautification programs in low income
neighborhoods and at public housing projects. Neighbors on the 700 block
of Mercy Street, became "The first Garden Block in America" when they
planted window boxes built at St Martha's Settlement. <P> Vacant lot
gardens were added in 1960 through 4-H, Cooperative Extension's youth
program led by William A. White. Some of today's active community
gardeners like Alta Felton and Mabel Wilson began gardening in public
with NGA. It had seen 850 blocks planted by its 25th anniversary in 1978
shortly before becoming part of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society's
Philadelphia Green Program. <P> The most recent rash of "farming out" on
vacant lots began in the Green 70's. 4-H gardens were growing vegetables
as well as flowers. The Recreation Department was helping neighborhoods
change vacant lots into flower and vegetable gardens, tot lots and
basketball courts. The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society began
developing community vegetable gardens, and Penn State Urban Gardening
Program provided technical assistance. By the late 80's, over 1000
vacant lots had become vegetable and ornamental gardens. <P> Farming out
in the 90's is more than a great way to keep vacant lots clean, more
than a source of food and flowers. It is a strategy for neighborhood
development and organization. <P>

<H3>Pigeon Peas and <BR>Banana Trees </H3>

<TT>by Libby J. Goldstein </TT>

<P> You can see the flow of people and their plants in gardens. Fava
beans arose in Egypt and moved to China, Italy and Britain. Gardeners
with roots in all those countries grow them here. I grow the black
radish, sorrel and pattypan squash we ate at home. <P> Southeast Asians
brought seeds with them in the 1970's. They plant lemon and Thai basil
in "crazy mixed up" beds with mustards, ginger, gourds and beans. Their
gardens, and many more, can be seen at Common Ground community garden at
Island Avenue and Bartram Rd., in Southwest Philadelphia. Farther along
Island Avenue, are traditional Southern Italian gardens. <P> At 64th and
Market Streets, you can see African American and Korean gardens and
their interplay. Many African Americans plant peanuts, collards and,
sometimes, cotton and tobacco "for the kids to see and remember" on
raised rows, a West African style. Korean garden beds include hot
peppers, huge radishes and greens in profusion. <P> 2305-13 N.
Palethorpe Street is Puerto Rico in Philadelphia: a poultry casita,
containers, pigeon peas, even bananas. While on 6th Street just below
Lehigh, Filipino gardeners grow bitter melon on overhead trellises with
yardlong beans. <P> Philadelphia gardens, like their gardeners, spring
from diverse roots. <P>


<TT>Libby J. Goldstein was a founder of the Southwark/Queen Village
Community Garden in 1976 and became the first coordinator of Penn
State's Urban Gardening Program in 1977. She assisted in the development
of over 100 community vegetable gardens in Latino neighborhoods between
1983 and 1987. Goldstein wrote the weekly "City Gardener" for the
Philadelphia Daily News from 1977 to 1987 and is now president of the
Food & Agriculture Task Force.</TT>

<H3>Grow Your Own Money </H3>

<TT>Excerpted from<BR> Top Club Report<BR> July, 1994</TT> 
<P>


All over South Africa, door-sized plots of lush vegetables are flourishing. Their
vivid green brings colour to a dull environment, and the plants bring nourishment
to many a family. The plots are a tribute to a dedicated group of hardworking
people who are teaching communities that growing your own vegetables is almost
like getting something for nothing.
<P>
Victoria Seramie, an energetic grandmother from Johannesburg's Kliptown, is a
star gardener and an example to many others of what can be done. Her neat garden
boasts a wide variety of healthy vegetables, ranging from beetroot and lettuce to
carrots and green peppers.
<P>
"We have vegetables all year round, and it costs us nothing," Victoria told us as
she busied herself among the beds. Well, not quite for nothing because she may
have to spend as much as R5 now and then! Victoria is an old hand at growing: she
has been producing vegetables since 1986.
<P>
Apart from her own garden Victoria helps supervise a community project. In the
back yard of Mrs. Evelyn Ndlovu's property there are dozens of vegetable plots
cultivated by nearby residents. "These people do not have enough space, so I let
them garden in my place," says Evelyn, a retired sister.
<P>
Men and women were busily watering and weeding when Top Club visited the project.
Children played among the plots, and they benefit too, because they are from
Evelyn's creche and get vegetables from time to time.
<P>
Joe Mobango, one of a very few trained black horticulturists, says that older
people take more readily to growing vegetables than the younger generation.
"People tend to think that vegetables are something you should simply buy - they
don't think of them as something you can grow for next to nothing," Joe says. He
is a field worker for the Food Gardens Foundation, an organization which for 17
years has been promoting vegetable growing.
<P>
"People often say that they do not have enough space, they have not got water,
they cannot afford fertilizer and they don't know how to grow things. But there
are easy answers to all these problems," says Joy Niland, Co-director of Food
Gardens Foundation, and one of its founders with Pauline Raphaely.
<P>
"Many thousands of people are successfully growing their own vegetables. You
need only a small space, it does not take much time, no fertilizer is necessary and
the method is easy to learn," Joy says.
<P>
You will probably not have space to grow traditional crops such as maize, but you
don't need a huge piece of ground to grow useful crops - it can be as small as
two metres by one metre, the size of an average door. For a family you would need
four door-sized plots, and lots of people have access to that amount of space.

<TT>by Bruce Whyte <BR>(From School Garden Guidelines, City
Farmer, 1988)<BR>
(C)Copyright: City Farmer 1995</TT>
<P></P>

<BR>"Our class has learned all about gardening. I planted
vegetables. I like gardening." Hannah, Grade 2.


<P>Eager, energetic, and excited, an after-school crowd of children
clusters around the fenced enclosure within the schoolyard of Lord
Roberts Elementary School in Vancouver's densely populated West End.


<P>The object of their attention is the school's food garden, an
incongruous oasis of greenery in the midst of the high-rise apartment
blocks which make this one of the most populous neighbourhoods in the
country. The kids are waiting their turn to join in the fun of urban
agriculture, and later this June afternoon near the end of term,
they'll proudly bear off harvests of fresh radishes, lettuce and
other vegetables, boasting, "I grew this myself!"


<P>The 250 enthusiastic students of Lord Roberts have been learning
valuable lessons about science, nutrition and how their environment
works by planting, tending and harvesting vegetables. At the same
time, they've helped beautify their concrete neighbourhood, while
gaining a new understanding and respect for the miracles of nature.


<P>A simple 5 by 15 meter (18 by 50 foot) garden has been the classroom
for this pioneer project in learning, its raised growing beds and
borders serving as the practical laboratories providing the children
with the chance to gain hands-on understanding of the growing world
which once seemed so foreign to their city centre way of life.


<P>"One of our goals as a school board is to introduce science into the
elementary school classrooms in a hands-on way," says trustee Bill
Darnell of the Vancouver school district. "As a gardener myself, I
like the idea of a school garden."


<P>Lord Roberts principal Al Hasley is another booster. "It has really
livened up the science program," he says of the garden. "Now instead
of being just theoretical, science is something they can see and feel
outdoors. Anything that you can do that's practical like this has
tremendous impact."


<P>"It was perfect," adds Donna Christie, who teaches Kindergarten.
Christie says sessions in the garden seemed to help calm the active
Kindergarten children. "The garden was really good for them," she
notes. "They seemed to become more aware of trees and plants, and to
have more respect for them. Before, when we were on outings, I used
to have to keep them from pulling and picking things in other
people's gardens. Now they know growing things is a lot of work."


<P>The concept of using a school garden to help teach city kids about
growing plants evolved out of a project begun by neighbours who
sought to beautify the grounds of Lord Roberts.


<P>Their group, The West End Playground Society, adopted a proposal
which would see a large portion of the gravel-covered schoolyard made
into a grass playing field, trees and flowers planted all around the
school, a large adventure playground built in a "king of the castle"
style, and along one perimeter fence, a food garden.


<P>Gary Pennington, a University of British Columbia professor of
education, assumed the job of coordinating the playground project for
the society, and under his leadership school board approval for the
plan was achieved.


<P>City Farmer, a non-profit group promoting urban food gardening, was
invited to help develop the food garden. Michael Levenston of the
organization introduced the garden program by taking City Farmer's
urban agriculture slide show into the classroom to help prepare the
students for the physical gardening to follow in the spring.


<P>With his slides he showed the kids how plants grow from seed, how
gardeners tend them, and how they're eventually harvested for the
dinner table. During his talks he explained why City Farmer advocates
organic techniques over chemical fertilizers and pesticides. He
introduced them to the radical idea that people in the city can grow
food, not just farmers in the countryside.


<P>Long before the first seed was planted, Levenston knew the garden
project was going to be a success, at least with the children. "When
the bell sounded to end the class, the kids didn't want to go to
recess, they wanted to ask me questions about growing things."


<P>Meanwhile Pennington and his volunteers, along with workers hired
under a training grant from Employment and Immigration Canada, had
begun to prepare the garden. After students had marked out the bed
sites with string, the workers split old cedar poles donated by B.C.
Telephone and cut them to shape the forms. As the weather warmed, the
students began hauling topsoil and manure into the bed forms with
wheelbarrows and buckets.


<P>The crews added a high chain-link fence to discourage vandalism, then
ran a 38 millimeter (1 1/2 inch) water line to the garden from the
school building, eliminating the need to haul buckets of water across
90 meters (100 yards).


<P>When, in May, City Farmer hired Bev Weber to serve as garden
instructor, the Lord Roberts food garden was ready to begin teaching
the eight classes of Kindergarten through Grade 7 students.


<P>"They did everything - prepared the beds, planted seeds, transplanted
seedlings, weeded, watered, fertilized and harvested. They got the
experience of the whole garden cycle, "says Weber. She notes she
found it important to explain to the city-bred children why they were
performing each task. "The secret is that if you explain things to
them, if they understand why they are doing things and they can get
results, there interest is there to carry them through."


<P>The detailed and basic explanations, probably not as necessary for
rural or suburban children, were essential for the West End kids.
"Ninety-five per cent of these kids are apartment dwellers, and a lot
of them didn't even know what a plant was," she says. "I've had to
explain to them that food doesn't come from the supermarket - it
grows."


<P>Parents of Lord Roberts students are unanimous in their approval of
the garden project. Catherine Wiseman, whose son Michael is entering
Grade 5, was typically enthusiastic at a recent party to celebrate
the garden's success.


<P>"I grew up on a farm in Northern Ontario, but Michael has lived his
whole life here in the West End. I think it's just great for the kids
to get this experience digging in the ground – it's like growing up
on a farm," Wiseman says. "The garden is good because children in the
West End don't get the experience of how things grow. They see these
vegetables are more nutritious than the foods they get at the
supermarket."


<P>And Gary Pennington, the professor of education, sees the food garden
as being able to provide benefits which reach beyond the hard facts
of science. Gardening can help teach an environmental ethic he
contends, but it can also do something more important – stimulate the
children's curiosity.


<P>"The food garden increases their sense of wonder. It's pretty
magical, but at the same time, it demystifies the concept of food
production."

<TT> by Michael Levenston<BR> Executive Director<BR> City Farmer<BR>
(From School Garden Guidelines, City Farmer, 1988)<BR> (C)Copyright:
City Farmer 1995</TT>

<P>A recent North American survey concluded that 78% of Kindergarten to
Grade 8 teachers already garden at home. Most British Columbia teachers
possess the skills needed to set up either a container or raised bed
garden in the playground, or a light table unit in the classroom.

<P> There are over 1100 elementary schools in B.C. and over 290,000
children enrolled in these schools. Creating school gardens and giving
students the opportunity to produce and eat fresh vegetables and fruit
will ensure that all students are aware of nutritious food.

<P> Asian development planners use school gardens to supplement ricebox
lunches. They have found that a one-half cup portion of vegetables from
one garden can provide significant amounts of a child's recommended
daily intake of iron and vitamins A and C.


<P>The school garden is an excellent aid for teaching not only
nutrition, but also the life sciences, environmental studies, current
issues such as agriculture and food supply, reading, writing, language
skills and math. A school garden demands activity-based learning.


<P>Successful garden programs already exist in many cities in the United
States. In Hartford, Connecticut, for example, indoor growing frames are
now being used in every elementary and secondary school. California's
Life Lab Program is presently cultivating outdoor gardens in over sixty
schools. On standardized science achievement tests given six months
after participating in Life Lab, students scored "significantly greater
gains", compared to a comparable group involved in traditional science
instruction.


<P>One hundred years ago most Canadian children were part of the rural
farming population. They ate well and were aware of where their food
came from because they helped produce it.


<P>Today with over seventy-five percent of Canadians living in cities
this is not the case. However, by creating school gardens it is possible
to once again show children the fundamental connection between plants
and fresh food that will in turn lead them to pursue a healthy diet.

<P><BR>Nutrition educators are well aware of the need to make nutrition
more tangible. Vitamins and minerals are just too abstract. Food
gardening is a way to see and touch, smell and taste "nutrition".


<P>If there was only one message I could give about diet, it would be
"to eat more fruit and vegetables daily." Why? Because our Canadian diet
needs this change in order to help prevent heart disease, cancer, bowel
problems, dental disease and obesity.


<P>A rule of thumb for basic nutrition is 5,5,2,2. Five servings of
vegetables and fruits, five servings of cereals and breads, two
servings* of milk and milk products, two servings of meat, fish,
poultry, dried beans, peas, lentils, nuts, seeds. Notice that over twice
as many servings are recommended from the first two groups.


<P>Do children like vegetables? Research in children's food preferences
indicates that simple exposure to a food will enhance liking.
Familiarity tends to increase the perception that a food tastes good.
Children also like to eat foods eaten by those they admire. Teachers and
fathers are strong models. Peer support is another influencing factor.
Children are proud of having grown a garden and they support each
other's liking to eat the vegetables, which taste fresh and flavorful.


<P>Teachers have found that children involved in gardening projects are
more interested in nutrition and food labels. The garden also provides a
link with families who are often influenced by the children to grow food
at home!


<P>Nutritionally, a school garden project is a winner!


<P>*2-3 servings for children, 3-4 for teens and pregnants, 2 for
adults.

B.C. <BR>(From School Garden Guidelines<BR> City Farmer, 1988<BR> (C)
Copyright: City Farmer 1995</TT> <P></P> <BR>Educators in British
Columbia have a marvelous opportunity to enrich the education and the
lives of the youngsters they serve through the use of school gardens.
All that is required is the renaissance of the time honoured practice of
having young people become conversant with the land and its riches under
the tutelage of teachers.


<P>Well developed curriculum materials are available in both Canada and
the U.S. to help teachers make school garden programs flourish.
Precedent has been established at a few schools in the province, and the
University of British Columbia now has a model children's garden to
which teachers can turn for example.


<P>Fragmented curricular offerings in schools can become focused and
integrated through school gardening programs. The children's drawings
and writings which illustrate this booklet are an example of the
language arts potential inherent in the school garden. Science,
mathematics, art, industrial education, environmental studies, health
and home economics curricula can all be enriched through garden related
units and activities.


<P>Education philosophers have enunciated a number of simple yet
profound principles that converge when we discuss children and
gardening:

<OL> <LI>Learning is most effective when the subject matter is
"demystified", that is, when it is immediate and familiar to the
learner. (Illich)

<LI>Exploration, selection, and refinement are the essential education
processes through which learning occurs. (Laban)

<LI>Equality of opportunity and cooperation optimize conditions of
learning. (Rogers)

<LI>Nature, simplicity, time for reflection, and self-reliance are the
essence of the learning process. (Thoreau) </OL>

<P> Gardening can be a transforming activity for young and old. It can
move us from ignorance to understanding and appreciation, from passivity
to action, from consumption to production, from silence to dialogue, and
perhaps most importantly, from a state of dependence to one of
independence with nature and others in our community.

<P> Those of us fortunate to have been involved in the resurgence of
urban agriculture in schools have come to know children's gardening as a
wondrous phenomenon. In school gardens we see a great potential for
learning and for more full, healthy lives for our children.

<TT>By Wei Fang (C) Copyright, 1995</TT>

<P>
<TT> Wei Fang is a sophomore at Brown University, concentrating both on Visual
Arts and Education (public policy). He was born in Montreal, but grew up mostly in
Portland Oregon. This is Wei's "research as service" paper for his course <B>The
History of American Education</B>.
<P>
"Most of the research I did showed that elementary school gardens were over
represented in comparison to high school gardens. I had a garden at the K-12
school that I went to, although it was not very well kept or used."
</TT>



<P>

Imagine cultivating a vegetable garden. The soil and plants involve physical
contact with nature, reveal biological processes, and provide concrete examples
of theoretical principles.  The garden can serve as a source of artistic
inspiration and as a means of creative expression. Now consider how a gardener
and a student can be one. A garden and the knowledge gained by gardening can be
incorporated, integrated, and used to its fullest academic, experiential, and
social potentials, not only outdoors, but also inside a high school classroom.
<P>

Gardens are unique to their place and time, as are the schools and students that
create them. This means that gardens can be tailored to meet the educational
needs of different students and adapted to fit different high school curricula.
Gardens are very flexible in their form and function, and as such can be shaped
by the style and goals of individual teachers. Since methods of planning,
planting, and maintaining of a garden are unique to the particular garden and
gardeners, the gardening experience itself is a fundamentally unique learning
process. While developing and caring for a garden requires hard work and is by no
means an easy task, the benefits to teachers and students are outstanding and
well worth the commitment. <P>

While the use of gardens as educational resources has been predominantly limited
to primary schools, the skills gained through gardening are beneficial to
students of all ages.  Since they involve experiential and cooperative learning,
school gardens have long been advocated as effective learning tools by many
educational philosophers and reformers.  The high school garden serves as a
foundation from which valuable lessons about the environment are learned.  In
doing so, it fosters and strengthens a community.  The communal, environmental,
and social discoveries made in growing a vegetable garden provide academic and
personal challenges for high school students.  We want to plant seeds in people's
minds about how a garden can work for students, teachers, their school, and their
community. 
<PRE>  </PRE>


<H3>The History Behind School Gardens:</H3> <BR><H3>Why They Came to
Be</H3>

<P></P><BR>

Schools and gardens became affiliated during the first decade of the twentieth
century as educational reformers and philosophers began to stress the correlation
between learning and personal, active experience. They were conceived as a means
of "bringing boys and girls into closer relationship with their environment," but
educators recognized that "the development of strong-bodied, efficient, and
contented citizens is the real purpose and the main result of this work" (Jarvis
10). This type of experiential learning developed momentum across the country; in
1910 there were approximately 80,000 school gardens maintained in the United
States (Conference on Agricultural Education 4). Gardens, and in the larger
context, nature, have long been a component of what educational progressives have
associated with "real life" or "hands-on" learning.

<P> 
In the mid 1800s, Francis Wayland, former president of Brown University and
educational reformer, advocated the active acquisition of knowledge through
experimentation in the physical world. In <B>The Pursuit of Knowledge Under
Difficulties</B>, he discussed how, rather than simply using principles to disprove
theories, great thinkers learned directly from the natural world, or as he refers
to it, "the book of Nature": "Newton pursued it [the book of Nature] as a volume
altogether worthy of being studied for its own sake" (Wayland 12).
<P>

Another advocate of experiential learning, John Dewey, believed in creating a
community within the school where a child's individuality could be continually
cultivated in the social context:
<P>

...freedom is power: power to frame purposes, to judge wisely, to evaluate
desires by the consequences which will result from acting upon them; power to
select and order means to carry chosen ends into operation (Dewey 64 ).
<P>

As a leading educational reformer and philosopher in the early 1900s, Dewey
sought to educate through "social occupations"--learning fundamental principles
and skills through practical efforts. He found it essential to connect academic
subjects with students' own experiences. In creating opportunities for students
to have such experiences, Dewey encouraged teachers and students to get out into
nature, to touch it and to feel it; at his University of Chicago Laboratory
School, students maintained a garden. As Herbert Kliebard noted, at the Dewey
School "reading, writing and arithmetic were things that occurred naturally in
the course of building a clubhouse, or cooking, or raising a pair of sheep"
(Kliebard 67).

<P>
A distinction has long been made between the implementation of gardens in rural
and city schools: "the rural school garden should form a laboratory for the
practice of problems..." (Conference on Agricultural Education 5). When gardens
began appearing in urban elementary schools during the early 1900s, they were a
response to teachers' acknowledgment that  "the traditional methods of training
are not meeting effectively...the ever-changing industrial and social conditions"
(Jarvis 9).

<P>
Currently, school gardens are more likely to be found in suburban communities.
One cause for this lack of gardens in city schools is noted by Running-Grass,
executive director of the Three Circles Center for Environmental Justice. He
says, "even where environmental education is available, it largely bypasses
children of color and their communities...environmental education for most
children is a privilege and not surprisingly, it is often found in privileged,
suburban settings rather than low income, urban core or isolated rural areas"
(27). By dealing directly with the earth, city students come into contact with
healthy environmental practices to which they might not otherwise have access.
<PRE>  </PRE>

<H3>Why Aren't There More High School Gardens Now?</H3>

<P></P><BR>
From an uninformed perspective, gardens might be seen as lacking in academic
value, function, and relevance. They might be too expensive, take up too much
time due to their labor-intensive demands, or require enthusiasm from students
and teachers to maintain them. However, some of these objections can be avoided
in the way the garden is planned and implemented, and while others may indeed be
valid difficulties, depending on the individual school and its shortcomings, the
benefits of gardens to students, teachers, and the community far outweigh their
costs.

<P>
The expense of a garden depends on the nature of the garden: its desired crops,
expected yield, location and availability of land, and design can all affect
cost. With any garden there will be some expenses incurred, but there are
organizations and people that can help. Local clubs and gardening associations,
parents, and local businesses are often willing to donate seeds or gardening
tools. Local government and neighborhood organizations can lend money to fund the
project, and there are many private foundations that offer grants for innovative
education programs. Since gardens produce a material commodity, they can be
designed as a for-profit business venture. With time, patience, and commitment,
school gardens have made money.

<P>
Gardens are hard work, for they are a group project: "the advantages of project
teaching are that a project frees, interests and occupies the individual
worker...a project awakens initiative, responsibility, and ingenuity...the
project method means less teacher and more pupil; it means learning by living"
(Kilpatrick 69). The planning and preparation, organizing and funding, designing
and building, planting, cultivating, and maintaining of a garden require a great
deal of time, energy, and effort. It is therefore essential that the school
supports the effort of the students and teachers involved in this venture, and it
is helpful, but not necessary, for the teacher to have some knowledge of, or
experience in gardening.

<P>
Considering the use of gardens in high schools, Lawrence Wakeford, a Professor of
Educational Studies at Brown University and former high school science teacher,
notes a possible obstacle in the fact that secondary school curricula are often
more structured than those of primary schools. A highly-structured curriculum can
mean less flexibility in lesson plans, which could pose difficulties for the
teacher. Contrary to this, historically, elementary schools' curricula have
largely been centered around the education of the whole child. While high school
curriculum "derived its impetus from the standards of adult living" and worked
"in the direction of preparing children and youth for a distinct adult role,"
elementary school curriculum "took the immediate life of the child as the
starting point... and conceived of the curriculum as the forum where the child
can realize his or her own purposes" (Kliebard 158).
<P>

For the most part, high schools separate and classify students by their ability
to perform on academic tests, their grades and past school experience, and their
goals and possibilities for the future. "The subject designations in English,
social studies, science and mathematics were maintained [at the secondary level]
whereas in the elementary school curriculum, an attempt was made to integrate all
subject areas" (Kliebard 192). Gardens, unfortunately, are not the end-all
solution for detracking, but they do provide intense challenges for all students
and a technique for high school teachers to use the ideas of experiential
education that past- and present-day educational reformers have advocated.

<PRE>  </PRE>

<H3>Types of Learning Incorporated in Gardens</H3>


<P></P><BR>

Learning from direct experience is fundamental in school gardens, as students are
involved in the activity hands-on. Jane Potter, author of <B>Teaching in the Whole
Garden</B>, wrote that "children learn best by doing. Doing requires motivation,
curiosity, some freedom to experiment and explore, and an opportunity to put
basic skills to practical application" (39). This type of hands-on learning was
recently advocated by a panel of the U.S. Government's National Assessment of
Education Progress, who argued that "to foster the types of learning desired,
teachers will need to act more as facilitators of learning and students will need
to become more active doers and thinkers in the classroom rather than simply
passive recipients of information"  (Sizer 149).  Dr. Gary Pennington, a
Professor of Education at the University of British Columbia, cites Illich's idea
that through gardens, "learning is most effective [because] the subject matter is
'demystified', ...it is immediate and familiar to the learner" (1).
<P>

Through gardens, high school students deal directly with the abstract scientific
equations, mathematical calculations, and problem-solving that are taught in the
classroom. They also utilize various forms of writing, such as descriptive,
persuasive, and analytical styles. Students are able to see, touch, and analyze
the processes that created and support the theories they read about in textbooks.
The subject matter is brought closer to the students as they keep working with
and learning from it. While "no one set of teaching strategies will work best for
all students at all times" (Armstrong 65), gardens present a variety of ways that
students can demonstrate their ability, effort, and knowledge. Coinciding with
Howard Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligences, gardens incorporate the
opportunity for high school students to solve problems and create products in
"context-rich and naturalistic settings" (Armstrong 65), while using their
linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, and interpersonal
intelligences. This is experiential learning in its essence; real life
experiences, gardens draw together skills from many different disciplines.
<P>




In addressing the educational needs of a student, Dr. George Wood, principal of
Federal Hocking High School, says: "...math, science, English, social studies,
blend into one another, which is, after all, the way the world really works...to
assume that teaching [students] a fragmented curriculum will lead them to a
unified sense of place and person is unrealistic" (177, 183). Parallel to this is
Potter's assertion that "curriculum design in schools should recognize that
education addresses the whole child as well...there is not a math child, a
reading child, or a science child, but rather one person absorbing all the
subject areas into one brain which attempts to organize the input into some
meaningful pattern" (Potter 29). Gardens connect different disciplines and
learning methods. They serve as outdoor classrooms where the amount of rainfall
effects the growth of the vegetables. The spatial design of the garden helps
students relate to the slope of the land and the pH of the soil. Bacteria, cells,
insects, and the physics of geology can be studied in a garden. They illuminate
the essential nature of water and its impact on all living things. From a garden,
students can maintain a daily journal that explores and describes how living
things grow and change with nurturing care.
<P>

At Dorchester High School in Massachusetts, an interdisciplinary course centered
around a school/community garden is part of the academic curriculum. Within the
course the students learn to use technology through the composition of daily
journals and records on computers. In tending the garden, they also deal hands-on
with concepts in botany and ecology. Students are "made more aware of science and
the natural world and... have a better understanding of science and technology"
(Barr 10).
<PRE>  </PRE>

<H3>Environmental Values</H3>

<P></P><BR>
High school gardens also afford a greater understanding and awareness of the
environment, and particularly, one's place within that environment. "While 90% of
our children feel it is the major issue in their lives, ... few adults follow
their earlier inclinations to be involved with the natural world"(Nabhan &
Trimble 40). If we are to believe that nature revolves around cycles, it is
imperative that we, as humans, see ourselves as part of those cycles. Barbara
Earnest, director of the Green Guerrillas, a nonprofit gardening group in New
York City, believes that exposure to gardens promotes an environmental ethic:
"adults can't expect kids to grow up to care about the environment...if they
haven't experienced nature as children" (Dwight 33). In many ways, gardens can
help students realize their place in nature.

<P>
Since a healthy garden requires planning, maintenance, and nurturing, students
must involve themselves with it intimately. "It is impossible for a child to work
[in a] garden without tuning himself to certain universal laws...while he is
grubbing in the earth, stirring the soil untiringly so as to let in the moisture
and the air, nature's secrets are sinking deep into his heart" (Williams 7). By
engaging students in such ways, gardens help students see directly that their
interactions with the garden can either help or hinder the growth of other living
things. They see that their energies and contributions to the garden will in
turn, yield them material benefits such as vegetables to eat and flowers to
smell. Furthermore, they will gain a greater sense of appreciation and value for
that which grows out of the garden because they understand that they play a
crucial role in its production; they were part of its cycle of growth. As L.
Jackson Newell said, "A breakfast table looks different to someone who has milked
cows, churned butter...and dug potatoes" (Nabhan & Trimble 128).

<P>
Environmental education should "illuminate the essential idea that all cultures
have a relationship with the natural world which they and all others can draw
upon for understanding and inspiration" (Running-Grass 29). Since high school
gardens are located near or at the schools, they encourage students to experience
and learn from nature within a familiar setting. They help students realize that
their community is also part of the environment, thus fostering connections
between the two.
<PRE>  </PRE>

<H3>Cultivation of Personal Skills</H3>
<P></P><BR>

The work that goes into a high school garden teaches lessons with applications
outside the classroom as well. Karneal Thomas, a landscape architect who helped
students design Harlem's Success Garden, cites "values of hard work, discipline,
being prompt, following directions, and making decisions" as the "basic practices
of living" are reinforced through gardening (Dwight 32). High school gardens can
provide students with "lessons in business integrity and moral courage, and at
the same time show children how they may, in one way, at least, earn an honest
living" (Jarvis 18).
<P>

Cooperation is certainly necessary for a successful garden, and the value of
teamwork has been noted by many educational reformers. Ted Sizer, Professor of
Educational Studies at Brown University and founder of the Coalition of Essential
Schools, stresses the importance of providing opportunities for students to gain
these skills:

<P>
The real world demands collaboration, the collective solving of
problems...learning to get along, to function effectively in a group, is
essential...the act of sharing ideas, of having to put one's own views clearly to
others, of finding defensible  compromises and conclusions, is in itself
educative  (Sizer 89). Generation One, a program run through Providence's Smith
Hill Community Center, enlisted teenagers from the neighborhood to plan and
maintain a community garden. Tom Twitchell, director of the program, said in a
telephone interview that the teens overcame their cultural differences to form "a
cohesive team", thus fulfilling one of Sizer's goals for education. He also
stressed the importance of the "adult challenge" of maintaining the garden in
fostering a sense of independence in the gardeners.
<PRE>  </PRE>

<H3>Community Values</H3>
<P></P><BR>

In addition to the development of personal and interpersonal skills, gardens also
promote a sense of community and can contribute to the improvement of the area in
which they are located. As students learn that a healthy garden takes thought and
care, they can translate that knowledge into improving their surroundings. For
instance, in New York City in the early 1900s, Mrs. Henry Parsons recognized how
in the place of vacant lots, a beautiful and fruitful garden can be part of
community empowerment. She said, "The dumping ground of material refuse and the
dumping ground of fallen humanity became on the one hand a garden; on the other,
an uplifted community" (Conference on Agricultural Education 4).
<P>

The Success Garden, planted and maintained by students and residents in Harlem in
1990, also gave the community "a new sense of itself" (Dwight 32). As Karneal
Thomas, a landscape architect who helped sixth and seventh graders design the
garden, noted: "it has to do with the self-confidence and pride of the
kids...they now feel 'we are worthy of this beautiful garden across the street'
-- not just a vacant lot where people deal in drugs" (Dwight 32).  The garden
served as a site for many neighborhood functions, such as picnics and concerts.
In this way, the community was brought together.
<P>

"The natural world does not judge. It exists" (Nabhan & Trimble 23). A high
school garden allows everyone to contribute to its growth and production. The
challenging learning opportunities that stem from these gardens are inclusive of
all students, regardless of age or academic skill. They do not discriminate based
upon race, class or physical ability. "Access to appropriate environmental
education is a civil rights issue connected historically to the struggle for
equal access to educational opportunity and resources" (Running-Grass 28). Nancy
Schniedewind and Ellen Davidson noted the benefits of diverse groups in
educational situations: "in heterogeneity is strength...in mixed groups, students
have the chance to learn from others with diverse life experiences, perspectives,
and skills" (40).
<PRE>  </PRE>

<H3>Conclusion: High Schools Need Gardens</H3>

<P></P><BR>
History shows us that gardens have been successful tools for cultivating
academic, personal, and interpersonal skills in primary schools. Educational
philosophers, reformers, and teachers have long advocated the experiential
learning undertaken in school gardens. Starting and maintaining a successful high
school garden takes time, energy, and funding. However, there are resources
available to overcome these obstacles. Moreover, there is an undeniably
significant amount of growth in educational, environmental, and communal learning
that stems from high school gardens. They are an underutilized resource whose
implementation benefit all who are involved.

Once you know you have something to say you must get down to the
technical nuts and bolts of getting your documents on-line.

<P>
Finding an Internet Provider who is also a Web Server is first on the
list. There's no point in preparing all your material if you can't
find somewhere to put it where it can be accessed from all over the
world. The University of British Columbia was our choice because they
had already served us well for some months as a connection to the
Internet. Also an article in their fine publication, <B>Campus Computing
& Communications</B>, about writing Web documents pulled us in.

<P>
However they had never before allowed an outside community group to
use their Web site. Letters of support from four professors in
different faculties who liked our work got us the green light.

<P>
To place our documents on the Web we would need a special account
that allowed us to go into our directories whenever we put in
documents. UBC's name for this account is "Legacy" and with it came
our new account name which appropriately identifies us as
<B>cityfarm@unixg.ubc.ca
</B>
<P>
Before deciding to publish on the Web we had previously learned how
to connect to the Internet using a <B>14.4 bps modem, Mac TCP, SLIP</B> and
the variety of software used when on the Internet. UBC support staff
helped us through this maze as did the many excellent books available
on the topic.

<H2>Learning HTML</H2>

<P></P><BR>

Once you have your account, it's time to learn how to write up your
pages.

<P> For the Mac I used a program called <B>BBEdit Lite 3.0</B> with
either <B>BBEdit HTML Extensions</B> or an alternative <B>BBEdit HTML
Tools</B>. They can be found on the Internet. There are a number of
editing program out there but this program was most often recommended
for use on the Mac at the time I began. New programs are uploaded to the
Net almost every week so keep a lookout. Lots of discussion about these
programs and other web publishing matters can be found on these very
active Usenet newsgroups... <UL> <LI>comp.infosystems.www.misc
<LI>comp.infosystems.www.providers <LI>comp.infosystems.www.users

<LI>comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html
<LI>comp.infosystems.www.authoring.images
<LI>comp.infosystems.www.authoring.misc </UL>


<P> HTML are tags that are attached to your text to make it do special
things when put up on the Internet. For example, when I put &lt;H1&gt
and &lt;/H1&gt around some text that is a heading, it will show up in a
certain font at a specific point size on the Internet. Other tags make
photos appear on your page and still others, provide instant links to
other people's pages around the world. <P>

<IMG  WIDTH="502" HEIGHT="212" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=2
SRC="HTMLtags.GIF" ALT="html tag graphic"><P></P><TT>HTML Tagged Page
</TT><P>



<P> How do you learn HTML? There are many documents on the WWW that
approach the subject from a variety of angles. Read as many of these as
you can. Also new books focusing on writing HTML are arriving in
bookstores as you read this. Two just out are <B>Teach Yourself Web
Publishing with HTML in a Week</B> by Laura Lemay, Sams Publishing,
1995; and <B>HTML For Fun and Profit</B> by Mary E.S. Morris, SunSoft
Press, 1995.

<P></P> <IMG  BORDER=2 WIDTH="394" HEIGHT="276" HSPACE=10
VSPACE=10 SRC="MacWeb.GIF" ALT="MacWeb graphic"><P></P><TT>Seen on a Web
Browser</TT> <P>


<P> Netscape, an excellent WWW reader (available free on the Internet as
are MacWeb and Mosaic), links you to many HTML teaching sites. When you
first open Netscape's Homepage, read <B>"How To Create Web Services"</B>
and follow the links.

<P> Also, try copying other people's work by looking at their HTML
source code. This can be done simply by going to the appropriate command
in the menu of your favourite Web reader.

<P> Easiest of all, find someone who will sit with you and show you the
secrets. This will save you hours and hours of "what do I do next?"

<P> There are a few courses being offered, one at UBC's Continuing
Education and another at Wimsey, a local Internet provider.

<P> Very simple pages can be created using just a few tags that will
make headings, separate paragraphs and format lists. More difficult to
learn are the hypertext links which take the reader from one page to
another.

<P> All of the 'pages' (files) you write in BBedit must be named and
kept in one folder. For instance we have: <UL> <LI>urbagnotes1.html
<LI>demogarden2.html <LI>seinfeld3.html <LI>in a folder titled:
WWWcityfarm.html</UL> (Leave no spaces when you create these names.)

<P> In that same folder can be put all sorts of pictures brought in with
a scanner. I took a colour photo of our new garden sign, scanned it into
<B>Photoshop</B> in my computer, cropped it, saved it as a Pict, then
opened it in a shareware program called <B>GIFConverter</B>. Here I
produced a smaller sized image and named it GARDENSIGN.GIF

<P> Now for the real fun and under-documented part of the adventure.

<H2>Putting Your Stuff in Your Directory</H2>


<TT>Michael Levenston<BR>  Executive Director<BR> City Farmer<BR> (C)
Copyright: City Farmer 1995 </TT>


<P></P><BR> From your desktop you have to get your material into your
Web server's machine. That meant for me from my home computer into UBC's
machine. You can do this on the Mac by connecting to the Internet and
using a program named <B>Fetch</B>.

<P> <IMG  BORDER=2 WIDTH="345" HEIGHT="189" HSPACE=10
VSPACE=10 SRC="filesonMac.GIF" ALT="files on Mac graphic">
<P></P><TT>Files on my Mac</TT>

<P> But before uploading your files you must first get into your
directory (a "folder" in Mac terminology) to set up a special directory
where you can put your material.

<P> <B>Telnet</B> is the software of choice for this. It allowed me to
go into our cityfarm account and work with my directory as if I were at
home on my own machine. However you must learn a peculiar language
called <B>UNIX</B>. to do the job. (Get the book UNIX for Dummies.)

<P> Here are some of the commands you need.

<P> Once inside your main directory, the command <B>ls</B> will "list"
the directories already there. Then you must <B>mkdir public_html</B>
that is "make directory" plus the name of your new directory. Go out of
Telnet and back to Fetch. You are now going to upload (send) your
material.

<P> Don't ignore these tips. <UL> <LI>None of your file names can have
spaces in them. <LI>As you are about to upload files, delete either .bin
or .txt from the name. <LI>For GIFs send them as Raw files from the
Mac.</UL>

<P> Once you've sent your files, use Telnet again to go into your
directory. Type <B>ls</B> then <B>cd public_html</B> to "change
directory" to your html material and then <B>ls -l</B> to list more
details about your files. Finally type <B>chmod a+r plus name of the
file</B> for each of your files. This will allow the outside world to
read your material. <P>

<IMG ALIGN=middle BORDER=2 WIDTH="495" HEIGHT="126" HSPACE=10
VSPACE=10 SRC="filesonServer.GIF" ALT="files
on Server graphic"><P></P> <TT>Files uploaded to UBC</TT>


<P></P>

What you have essentially done in the above is put your pages in a
folder at your Web server and made them readable to those looking in
from outside. Once you get the hang of it you can put up new pages using
Fetch and Telnet in a matter of seconds. That's unbelievably quick when
you consider that you are publishing to a world audience.

<P>

<H2>The Final Link</H2>

Finally your Web administrator will mysteriously link you to the rest of
the world so that everyone will see the files in your directory. You
will be presented with a special address, your URL, so that others can
find you. Ours is
<B>http://unixg.ubc.ca:780/~cityfarm/urbagnotes1.html</B>

<P> Now you can be seen, by those who know about your site, from any
place in the world with the appropriate Internet connection.

<P>

<H2>It's Never The End of Course</H2>

Sometimes your server will be down and no one will be able to access
your pages. Ominous reasons for such occurrences include "forgot to
start the 'daemon' that controls access to WWW homepages" which will
leave you feeling helpless. However you can trust that these down times
will be corrected and your pages will sail happily around the world.

<P> And of course you have to keep writing new pages!  This will keep
your audience coming back for more. You will also have to be creative to
let other people know that your pages are available. For instance you
can post a note in an appropriate Usenet group, or send out a press
release to magazines whose readers might be interested.

<H2>For Windows Users</H2>

<P></P><BR>


<TT>by Eldon Wong<BR>
(C) Copyright:1995</TT>


<P></P>

Now that you have read Michael's article, you think to yourself,
"Great, I'm ready to put some Web stuff up for myself!" But wait a
minute; you don't own a Macintosh. Now what? Most of Mike's article
is still useful for Microsoft Windows users, but here's more
Windows-related information.

<P>
First of all, you need a Web browser. Fortunately, there are many
available (NCSA Mosaic, Netscape WinWeb, etc.) and many of them are
identical in looks and operation to those on the Macintosh.
Currently, the most popular browser is Netscape.

<P>
Now you are ready to create HTML documents. HTML is an acronym for
HyperText Markup Language. There are many ways of creating the
documents. For the true programmers out there, you can use a plain
text editor and type all of the text and embedded tags as you type.
For the rest of us, there are many tools at our disposal.

<P>

<H2>HTML Tools</H2>

These packages are specifically designed to help you create HTML
documents. Some of the packages that I have tried are: <B>HoTMetaL, HTML
Assistant and HTML Writer</B>. They all have their individual merits
(i.e. HoTMetaL checks to make sure you don't have mismatched HTML
tags), but all of them are very useful, and I would recommend any of
them.

<P>
In a short time, there will be add-ons for word processors like
Microsoft Word for Windows. Microsoft is currently beta testing its
Internet Assistant product. This product adds a toolbar with the
different HTML tags on it. You can simply add HTML tags by choosing
the one you want from the toolbar. When you are finished, all you
have to do is save the file as a HTML document. Quarterdeck also has
a MS Word add-on product in beta version.

<P>
When working with graphic images, a couple of applications that I
find very useful are <B>WinGif</B> and <B>LView Pro</B>. WinGif can produce
interlaced GIF files while LView can save a GIF file with a
transparent background. LView pro can also save files in JPEG format.
This format compresses images smaller than GIF files. HTML documents
can handle both GIF and JPEG file formats for images.

<P>
Once you have your files created, you need to put them up on your
account. To access your UNIX account, you can use any communications
package (<B>Windows Terminal, Procomm</B>, etc.). If you are already
connected to your UNIX account using SLIP or PPP (communication
protocols), then you can use terminal packages like <B>EWAN or Trumpet
Telnet</B> to log onto your account in order to create directories and
change file permissions. To transfer your files, once again you can
use a communications package or you can use <B>Winsock FTP</B> which works
with your SLIP or PPP connection.

<P>

<H2>HTML hints</H2>

Please keep these factors in mind when you are creating and
transferring your HTML files:

<P>
- Because DOS limits your filenames to a maximum of 8 characters and
a 3 character extension, your filename will likely have the extension
.htm. UNIX systems usually don't recognize this as a HTML file and
needs an extension of .html. After transferring your files from your
machine to the UNIX server, you must change the extensions so that
they are .html instead of just .htm otherwise it will be read as a
text file (at least this is the case with the University of British
Columbia's Web server).

<P>
Before transferring any of your files to the server, you should
also check any links referencing other HTML documents to make sure
they have the filename extension .html. If you are testing the links
and files on your computer, you will be using .htm as the file
extension, but when you are ready to transfer the files you should go
through your documents and change all of the extensions. Once that is
done, you can transfer your files, change all of the filename
extensions on your UNIX account (see above) and all of your links
will work, otherwise you will have to make all of the changes using
an editor on your UNIX account.

<P>
Transfer your HTML files as ASCII text and your image files (GIF,
JPEG) as binary files

<P> Urban agriculture (UA), also called urban food production or
urban farming, can be defined as the growing of food and nonfood
plant and tree crops and the raising of livestock (cattle, fowl,
fish, and so forth), both within (intra-) and on the fringe of
(peri-) urban areas (Ganapathy, 1983; Ford Foundation 1993, as per
Siau and Yurjevic, 1993: 45).

<P> Horticulture is only one of the many farming systems, in any
given city, for practising UA. UA is more than just the production of
food and it is being recognised in most of the South and in at least
some countries in the North as an integral part of urban food
systems.

<P> Other components of UA include: <UL> <LI>food supplied from rural
areas, <LI>urban storage and transportation, <LI>processing and
marketing, <LI>distribution and consumption of food in urban areas.
</UL>

Vennetier's 1958 survey of Pointe Noire, Congo, is often credited for
having launched a new field of inquiry into urban farming in West
Africa, and beyond: a sample of 1 013 households enabled him to
estimate that UA was being practised by 30.6% of Pointe Noire's
population (Vennetier, 1961: 84).

<P> Ganapathy (1983) submitted a short, comprehensive, definition of
the concept; Smit and Nasr (1992) developed a very complete typology
of farming systems, based on observation in 40 cities and towns in 18
countries. Sawio's Ph.D. dissertation (1993) reviewed previous
research on the rapidly evolving field of city farming in anglophone
Africa.

<H3>2.0 EVOLUTION OF URBAN AGRICULTURE</H3>

<H2>2.1 Pre-Industrial Revolution City Farming</H2>


<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR> International
Development Research Centre </ADDRESS>


<P>


The coupling of urban and agriculture into a single expression may seem
contradictory, but in fact agriculture as a basic urban function is nothing new
(Mlozi, 199?: 105-106; Lee-Smith and Memon, 1994: 70).

<P> Archaeological fieldwork and aerial imagery have unveiled massive and
ingenious earth and waterworks, within and on the edge of the urban settlements
constructed by ancient civilizations. Many of these facilities and infrastructure
were used wholly or in part to produce food, feed, and fodder crops; to provide
wood for fuel, building, shade, fencing, and windbreaks; to grow shrubs,
ornamental, medicinal, and other useful plants; and raise livestock for food,
materials, traction, transport, and trade, sacrifices and status.

<P> <B>Uruk</B>, the most important city in <B>fourth-millennium Mesopotamia
</B>(with possibly 50 000 people), extended over 1100 acres, a third of which was
covered with palm groves; the large majority of Uruk's working adults were
engaged in primary agricultural production on their own holdings, on allotments
of land from temples or as dependent retainers on large estates; they also had
other occupations (Adams, 1994: 18). The <B>Neolithic Egyptia</B>n settlement of
<B>Knossos</B> developed mixed farming (wheat, barley, lentils, sheep, goats,
pigs and some cattle); the Minoan town spread over 75 hectares with pop. 12 000;
Knossos had isolated farms on its edge (Rodenbeck, 1991: 124, 129). Minoan
palaces had a central court around which were grouped storage and production
areas; rulers probably controlled much of the agriculture in the surrounding
region, about 1000 hectares (Warren, 1994: 46, 51).

<P> Under <B>Persian emperor Darius</B>, walled gardens or pairidaeze ( paradises
) were associated with hydraulic facilities, thereby exploiting water resources
more fully. In <B>Thebes, capital of the New Kingdom 1500 BC</B>, walled gardens
of prosperous Egyptians provided fresh fruit for the household (including
indigenous vine, pomegranate, imported apple and almond), sycamores, date and
down palms, fresh fish from lotus-covered pools; larger gardens with water tanks
had ducks (Jellicoe, 1989: 25). In the capital city of <B>Akhenatan, Egypt</B>,
gardens were everywhere, with additional spaces reserved to storage, underground
cellars, breweries and animal keeping (Courtlandt and Kocybala, 1990: 126).

<P> Water shortages may have curtailed urban horticulture in ancient
<B>Greece</B>, but ingenious use was made of it wherever some was available. On
<B>Crete</B>, the large inland city of <B>Eleutherna</B> was important until the
Late Roman period and had a vaulted aqueduct taking water from cisterns under the
acropolis and to extensive fields for crops, terraced down along the limestone
spur on which the city was erected; some of these terraces are still cultivated
(Rodenbeck, 1991: 91). Greek city-states were self-supplied with goat milk and
olive-oil fuel for house lighting.

<P> Vast agricultural drainage schemes were revealed on the Roman imperial sites
of <B>Timgad in Algeria</B> and of <B>Volubilis in Morocco</B>. Near the mouth of
the Tiber River, in the densely settled ancient Roman port of <B>Ostia</B>, a
planned complex of garden houses, surprisingly similar to contemporary
counterparts, was erected in approximately 128 AD. The complex was more likely
built for middle and lower classes, with 40-100 apartments which probably housed
400-700 people; all that remains of its original gardens are the six fountains
from which residents drew their water (Watts and Watts, 1994: 86, 88, 89).

<P> <B>The Roman coastal city of Cosa</B>, 140 km north of Rome, at its height in
100 BC, had its harbour linked by artificial and natural channels to a commercial
fishery in a lagoon. The catch was dried, pickled or salted and shipped in
amphoras. The fish farm had tanks more than 100 m long, covering about one
hectare at the west end of the adjacent lagoon. Some of the catch of eels, grey
mullet, sea bass, gilthead and sole would have been eaten by the local
population. A modern lagoon fishery is in operation at the nearby town of
<B>Orbetello</B> (McCann, 1994: 95-96). Elsewhere, <B>Andalusian cities</B> had
houses surrounded by gardens and orchards. Cities on the Indus River, such as
<B>Harappa</B> and <B>Mohenjo Daro</B>, discovered under the shifting mud of the
Indus, once were specialized agro-urban centres.

<P> Of <B>Medieval Europe</B>, Susan Reynolds (1984: 200) writes: "The provision
of food in sufficient quantity, sufficiently fresh, and at a reasonable price,
was a constant anxiety...". Crop-rotation systems were being tested in farms and
fields of monasteries, walled cities, and castles. Medieval tapestries suggest
ladies' castle gardens included herbs on raised beds and rabbitries (Jellicoe,
1989: 34). A fifteenth-century College of the Vicars Choral in the city of
<B>York, England</B>, had buildings surrounding a garden; behind them lay
orchards (Addyman, 1994: 117-118). Nearly perfectly preserved medieval
<B>Novgorod in Russia</B> is depicted in a seventeenth-century icon, showing
well-spaced housing, gardens and orchards, within its outer and inner
walls(Yanin, 1994: 123).

<P> In <B>North America's Mississippian culture</B> (peak 1050 1250 AD),
intensive riverine horticulture supported what Burland (cited in Coe et al. 1986:
57) qualifies as true pre-industrial cities in the rich alluvial valleys of the
Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Red rivers and tributaries. One of
them, the 10 000- people city of <B>Cahokia in Illinois</B>, was the largest
pre-Columbian urban centre north of Mexico. Also in the middle course of the
Mississippi, the <B>Moundville site</B> (population 3 000) in Alabama contains
borrow-pits apparently used to store live fish, part of the food needed to
support its people (Coe et al. 1986: 56). In <B>Central America</B>, authority
was exerted from major centres to terrace steep hills and drain swamps into
fields on the edge of <B>Nohmul</B>; this was a large late pre-classic city near
the <B>Belize-Mexico</B> border. At the city of<B> Edzna</B>, on the coastal
plain of <B>Campeche</B>, waterworks of staggering proportions (2.25 million m3
of water storage) supported a highly organised agricultural economy (Hammond,
1994: 132).

<P> Four thousand years ago in the <B>pre-Olmec Valley of Mexico</B>, small towns
on stone-faced terraces, such as <B>Tlatilco and Ticoman</B>, farmed vegetables
and raised dogs and turkeys, (Burland 1976: 15 18). The <B>Aztec</B> state was
partly dependent on food production within and on the periphery of the
metropolises of <B>Teotihuac n</B> and the capital city of <B>Tenochtitl n</B>,
south-west of the former and on a man-made island built on <B>Lake Mexico</B>
(Anton 1993: 116). In 1519, Diaz marveled at the agricultural nature of the city
he discovered, an island capital extending over 20 square miles, with five times
the population of Henry VII's London at the time (Redclift, 1987: 109).
<B>Teotihuacan</B> itself at the height of its power (500 BC) was larger (more
than 4000 buildings and 50-100,000 people) than imperial Rome (Millon, 1994:
138); Millon's maps of Teotihuac n (population 125,000 250,000) clearly indicate
<B>chinampas</B> in one section of the city: these were rectangular raised-beds
anchored with planted fences of willows, filled in and periodically fertilised
with piles of marshy vegetation removed through canal-cutting, topped with
canal-bottom mud.(Coe et al. 1986: 104).

<P> Chinampas carried fruits, vegetables, trees and houses, supplied most of the
produce consumed in the city at the time of discovery and still supplied some
vegetables as late as 1900. Three harvests were possible, with transplanting from
reedbeds. Animals were kept and their manure and that of humans applied to
organic gardens (Redclift, 1987: 109-110). Highly fertile and productive
chinampas were found in <B>Xochimilco</B> (surviving to the present), towns on
southern shores of Lake Xochimilco, and in most of the island of Tenochtitl n
Tlatelolco. A plan to recover the Xochimilco region has prompted new interest for
the chinampa economy which has survived to the present (Millon, 1994: 139; see
also Canaval, 1992). A 15 km-long dike, built across<B> Lake Texcoco</B>,
protects chinampas from rising saltwater in the rainy season (Coe et al. 1986:
144, 146, 149). An aqueduct raised water to irrigate a hilltop orchard in the
northeast of Tenochtitlan (Haas, 1993: 22). The well-spaced layout of outer house
mounds probably enabled each home to have its own garden (Burland, 1976: 40). In
Haas' Gardens of Mexico (1993: 22) a nineteenth-century painting depicts a woman
in her central <B>Mexico City</B> rooftop garden, attended by her mestizo and
native maids, a water seller approaching the group. Haas finds that secure
rooftop potted plants are an enduring phenomenon in provincial urban and rented
houses of Mexico.

<P> At Tairona's <B>Buritaca</B> 200 site in the <B>Colombian Sierra Nevada</B>,
an elaborate landscape of retention walls, canals, and drainage systems afforded
in-city cropping (Coe et al. 1986: 166 167; Burland 1976: 162). In the
<B>Peruvian Andes</B>, central plazas of U-shaped structures might have been
irrigated or flooded and crops possibly grown; large ceremonial complexes were
usually adjacent to cultivated fields (guinea pig remains found earlier than 1800
BC at <B>Culebras</B>, halfway between <B>Trujillo and Lima</B>) (Coe et al.,
1986: 197). At <B>Cuzco and Machu Picchu</B>, extensive retention walls, terrace
gravel beds and stone-lined drainage afforded intensive farming of steep slopes.
In our times, the <B>Yoruba of western Nigeria </B>maintained sizeable cities
that were largely self-sustaining because "most of the productive inhabitants
were full-time farmers" (Adams, 1994: 15).

<P> The above overview suggests that food production in the more advanced urban
settlements of ancient civilisations, was not a rare, temporary activity sited
haphazardly in the urban fabric. UA was not socially demeaning or technically
primitive when it was practised. Quite contrarily:

<P> Being more vulnerable to supply disruption or insufficiency, malnutrition or
famine, food provision throughout history has been a pervasive concern of city
populations. Under the <B>Islamic empire</B>, the<B> Abbasids</B> even turned a
postal service into an intelligence system, through which postmasters kept the
capital city informed on food prices in their postal districts, so that supplies
could be sent wherever shortages threatened. Cities have always had to ensure
that a reasonable share of their food needs be supplied from within a
controllable hinterland.

<P> Throughout most of mankind's history and in different civilisations, urban
populations have engaged to variable extents in producing at least some of the
food they require, close to or at their own residence, within or just outside the
city. Reliable, minimal amounts of food and nonfood items were needed to ensure
subsistence and trade by what were then unprecedentedly large human
agglomerations; this may explain the frequent coupling of elaborate earth- and
waterworks with food production in ancient cities.

<P> Archaeological remains and artistic depictions highlight the living
conditions of ancient urban elites more than any other human group. Clearly, food
production was not only carried out by better-off individuals; those in authority
also commissioned, built and managed massive food-producing systems, even making
room for food production when designing lower-class living quarters.

<P> Urban food production took a variety of forms, making ingenious use of space,
site conditions, closeness to equipment, facilities and markets, natural light,
water, soil and waste resources. The scarcer these resources, the more valuable
have been the products chosen to be grown or raised by city dwellers. Many cities
probably did offer the incentives, conditions, market and testing grounds for
more intensive and productive farming systems to be experimented, perfected, and
disseminated. Technological breakthroughs included sun reflectors; water
collection, storage, and distribution; frost protection; wetland drainage and
slope terracing, multi-cropped and layered chinampa-style raised beds. In his
review of recent archaeological findings on ancient cities, Adams concludes
(1994:15) that large-scale canal networks clearly seem to have followed the
advent of fully established cities.

<H2>2.2	Post-Industrial Revolution City Farming</H2>

<P>



It follows that the divorce of agriculture from cities, of food production from
urban economies, is very recent in the urban history of humanity. It also has not
been universal and is showing signs of weakening both in the North and the South.

<P>
The reasons for which UA would be disregarded by governments and planners of
western urban economies still need to be clarified. Lee-Smith and Memon (1994:70)
recognise that the exclusion of agriculture as a permanent urban function in
western contemporary urbanism can be explained by cultural connotations assigned
to country and city dating back to the Greco-Roman period, which was later
reinforced by recent urbanism associated with the Industrial Revolution. On the
other hand, Greco-Roman archaeological remains, current liberal practices in the
Mediterranean heartland, plus garden-city paradigms transferred from Europe to
colonies or ex-colonies (greenbelt towns of US and garden-city colonial cores of
Asian and African cities), point to a very complex arena of visions. Zoning
started to sanitize the core of medieval Dutch cities as early as in the 17th
century (Wagenaar, 1992: 165-176). However, the sanitation argument of West
European colonial powers against large-scale food production in many African
cities was wrongly aimed. In the industrializing metropolises of the North,
pathologies and epidemics had their origins in hazardous and polluting
manufacturing technologies and in workers' substandard living conditions rather
than in urban food production itself.

<P>
The prevailing eighteenth-century philosophical view in Western Europe opposed
natural to artificial, nature to civilization, natural man to urban man
(Marshall, 1992: 223). This view, along with the privatization of land ownership,
the privilege to grow food on private land by the elite who least needed to,
might better explain the divorce between urban and agriculture. This separation
was being formalized when cities and urban workers could have gained much from
urban agriculture. Wartime rationing induced exceptions to this rule in Europe
and North America, not dissimilarly to situations which post-colonial African
cities have been facing more enduringly.

<P>
In the North and South, particularly in the last twenty years, urbanization has
been putting the practicality of cities' exclusive reliance on often distant and
unreliable rural food production into question; urbanization has also been
challenging the morality of depriving the urban poor from accessing unbuilt urban
land for feeding themselves and others. The divorce is being revisited and
changes are being considered, albeit based on different arguments. In the urban
areas of several newly independent countries of the South, particularly those
where local governance is representative and progressive, bylaws inherited from
the colonial era are being changed and urban food production is tolerated if not
supported. In the North, urban governments are rediscovering UA as a means to
recover and utilize more fully resources such as space and energy. In both North
and South, cities may eventually reduce food brought in from other areas, while
extending the useful life of the resources they still require. For many decades
now, this utopia has become a reality in major Asian metropolises.

Tomorrow</H2>

<P>



In the late 20th century, the largest advances in production and marketing
systems for UA are found in and around major Asian cities. There, policy-makers
and planners have for many decades been overtly promoting food and some nonfood
production as a critical urban function. Chinese UA is expected to further
develop because it has become very intensive and highly integrated (vegetable
crops are highly structured spatially with use of intercropping, overplanting,
advanced purchasing, and combined contracting) (Honghai, 1992: 5). The <B>Shanghai</B>
Municipal Government has a fully integrated regional food-supply system (Yeung
1985: 12). UA is also being integrated with other sectors of the urban economy.
The City of <B>Dujiangyan, Sichuan</B>, is known to have diverted its surplus  labour
force to farming on wasteland, barren mountains, roadsides and field edges, as
well as food processing, handicrafts and small restaurants (Liu Hing as per 
Honghai, 1992: 7).

<P>
In China, ancient household urban gardening has provided the seed for the
development of urban farming in yards which later, with the support of planning,
grew into full-scale UA as an integral function of urban spatial economies. In
northern China the Siheyuan is a traditional residential compound with rooms
built  around a courtyard. Plants are grown in the latter which supply starch,
fruits, herbs, flowers and medicines; often with small livestock of which wastes
are applied to the gardens; garden wastes are fed to the livestock (Hou, 1991, as
per Honghai, 1992: 2). From the Opium War in 1940 through the 1960s, Soviet-style
urbanization and centralized industrialization considered urban farming as
backwardness and farming yards were eliminated (Honghai, 1992: 3). Since the  end
of the 1950s however, strategies promoting rural industrialization and 
decentralized urbanization have encouraged the incorporation of food production
into urban economies. Honghai (1992:5) estimates that <B>urban agriculture in China 
now feeds about of third of China's total population</B>. Chinese urban
municipalities are over-sized to allow room for a city foodshed; <B>most large
Chinese cities are nearly self-sufficient in perishable food crops.</B> City and town
farming has been using slightly more than one third of the State's budget for
agriculture (Honghai,  1992:7).


Extensive biological recycling, vertical planting and mixed farming make full use
of solar energy and organic wastes and are enabling UA to further develop in
Chinese cities, according to Honghai (1992). These systems include three-stage
recycling (organic waste for animal forage, livestock dung for methane generation
and methane tank residues for crop manure) and multiple-stage recycling
(crop-livestock-biogas tank-mushroom/earthworm), plus full ecological recycling
(fibrous organic waste to cultivate edible bacterium, conversion of coarse
cellulose into rich forage, animal dung into tanks to generate methane, tank
residues fed to earthworms, in turn fed to poultry, or are applied as crop
fertilizer). An effective ecological cycle of mulberry silk worm pond fish pig
system has been perfected  in South China (Yeung 1985: 14). In <B>Guangzhou</B> up to
nine crops are grown yearly on any single field; in nearby Hong Kong, six crops
of cabbage a year are not uncommon (Yeung 1985: 9).
<P>

An environmental monitoring network is being set up and perfected for UA in China
(Honghai, 1992: 11-14, 19). In Shanghai, more and more backyards, roofs,
balconies, walls and vacant space near houses are used by orange trees,
vegetables, leguminous plants, grapevine, gourds and melons (Deng, 1986, as per
Honghai, 1992: 8); a growing number of households are recycling organic wastes
using earthworms, edible mushrooms, flies, methane-generating bacteria;
underground air-raid shelters and cellars for long have been used to grow
mushrooms (Deng, 1986 and Shi and Cun, 1990, as per Honghai, 1992: 8). Pig 
farms, as one in <B>Beijing </B>(Honghai, 1992: 9), produce methane out of pig waste
to heat and cook, methane-based organic fertilizer and pig forage; earthworms grown
on methane forage are fed back to chickens, of which droppings are reprocessed
into pig forage. Major companies, such as Beijing's Capital and Steel Corporation
are actively involved in UA. Over the last 12 years, this company has  planted
3.4 million trees, 904,000 m2 of grass, 8.6 million flowers; over 46,500 m2 of
the factory's inner-walls are covered with climbing plants (Honghai, 1992: 
9-10).

<P>
Urban forestry is very much part of Chinese approach to UA in confined space. A
study of 439 Chinese cities in 1991 put their overall green space at 380,000 ha
or, on average, 20.1% of their urban area. Beijing has 9.2 million people on 750
km2, so there is little space to waste; yet the area of Beijing under tree cover
grew from 3.2% in 1949 to 28% in 1991. More than 90 different tree species were
identified in metro Beijing in 1990, including 40 varieties of fruit trees  that
represent 17% of all trees grown in sampled areas, as much as 23% in older
residential areas (Ming and Profous, 1993: 13 18).
<P>

Other Asian countries have intervened in different ways. Japanese census offices
closely monitor the performance of city farming. <B>Hong Kong's</B> policy for UA is
a high degree of self-sufficiency, no subsidies, development of large-scale,
modern, and fully commercial farming business. Competing urban land development
is pressing cropland to shrink, but animal husbandry thrives and crop yields
continue to rise, thanks to multi-cropping, hydroponics, and short-season
varieties (Yeung 1985: 9, 12, 23). In metro<B> Manila</B>, a presidential decree obliged
owners, or entitled others with owners permission, to cultivate unused private
lands and some public lands adjoining streets or highways (Bulatao-Jaime et al.
1981, cited by Yeung 1985: 25); community gardens were established, one of which
supplied 800 squatter families with 80% of their vegetables from an area of only
1500 m2 (Wayburn, 1985:6, as per Rogerson, 1993: 36). To increase food and fuel
production, the <B>Lae</B> City Council assigned thousands of allotment gardens  on city
lands to low-income residents, assisted by city horticultural staff and with
tenure guaranteed by council-granted leases and use permits (Yeung 1985:  14 15).

<P>


Since the late 1970s UA has been growing in many developing countries, in terms
of numbers of practitioners, space used, contribution to household welfare and
urban economies in general. A plethora of factors come into play to supplant this
growth: rapid urbanization, ineffective agricultural policies, crippled domestic
food-distribution systems, constrained public spending and subsidies, wage cuts,
soaring inflation and rising unemployment, plummeting purchasing power, and lax
urban land-use regulations or enforcement. External (civil strife and war) and
natural (droughts, earthquakes, floods, and tsunamis) disasters also disrupt
rural food production and supply lines to cities. One of the regions of the world
for which the most data on UA are available is sub-Saharan Africa.

<P>
Conditions sufficient to dampen, not to say reverse, the growth of UA appear
increasingly unlikely to arise in most of Africa and in sub-Saharan states in 
particular. Research and policy sectors are re-visiting UA because the 
aforementioned factors, formerly dismissed as exceptional or temporary until
recently, are now increasingly recognized as multiplying and becoming persistent.
Their compounding effect on urban populations is turning so pervasive that a
return to "normality" is becoming an increasingly unlikely, if not vanishing,
prospect in many parts of the world.

<P>
The growth of UA in <B>sub-Saharan Africa</B> will be discussed with evidence from
specific cities in the subsequent sections. In this section the cases of <B>Nairobi
in Kenya</B> and <B>Dar es Salaam in Tanzania</B> illustrate well that UA is expanding in
urban economies of the region, regardless of differences which countries may show
in the development of their respective urban economies.

<H2>3.2.1 Nairobi - Kenya</H2>

<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR>
International Development Research Centre </ADDRESS>

<P>

Recent studies indicate the growth of the urban informal sector
(UIS), but also the growing contribution of farming to both informal
and formal urban employment in <B>Africa</B>. ILO statistics for 17
African countries show that in 1989  the majority of the urban labour
force was being employed by the urban informal sector. During the
1980-5 period, the UIS grew much faster than the formal sector,
employing twice as many people and creating 12 times as many new jobs
as the formal sector. Formal market contractions during the 1985-7
period probably have further increased, since then, the lead of the
UIS (House et al.,  1993).

<P> In <B>Kenya</B> in particular, 1986 data from the Central Bureau
of Statistics reveal that 17.5% of self-employed workers and unpaid
family workers and 3.5% of paid  employees in urban areas worked in
agriculture and forestry (House et al., 1993: 1207). Both the numbers
of self-employed and unpaid workers and their  dependence on farming
are probably larger than recorded by the Bureau. A  breakdown of
whether agriculture and forestry was urban or rural was not provided,
but it can be assumed that most workers cannot afford to farm at
great distances from their city residence. In cities, agriculture and
forestry are the  second largest of eight occupational categories
(after sales workers), among urban  based self-employed and unpaid
family workers. Agriculture was also the second  largest of nine
economic activities listed, among self-employed and paid employees,
absorbing 24.4% of <B>Nairobi's</B> and 33.6% of urban Kenya's formal
sector jobs (based on Ritter and Robicheau's 1988 samples of 216
households and 1,100 cases respectively, cited by House et al., 1993:
1208). Furthermore,  agriculture provided the highest self-employment
earnings in small-scale enterprises in Nairobi and the third highest
earnings in all of urban Kenya (House et all, 1993:  1209).

<P> Binns (1994: 115, 122-123) notes that, while tropical Africa only
had three cities with more than half a million people, twenty years
later there were no fewer than 28 cities of that size, including 7
with over one million inhabitants. He notes that peri-urban areas are
often zones of intensive market-oriented food production and he
stresses that urban and rural development should not be treated in
isolation one from the other. Reports available from capital cities
of western and eastern Africa concur that UA is not a transitional or
temporary activity.

<H2>3.2.2 Dar es Salaam - Tanzania</H2>

<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR>
International Development Research Centre </ADDRESS>

<P>

Economist Francis Lungu in <B>Dar es Salaam</B> (personal communication, 27
August 1993) thinks that, should structural adjustment policies ever
succeed, UA would not necessarily subside; on the contrary, an
increase in UA is very possible because of persisting unemployment,
retrenched civil service, newcomers added yearly to the labour pool,
sheer population growth, women at home resorting to UA, and a growing
urban demand for abundant, regular and cheap supplies of good-quality
food. The large and fast-growing city of Dar es Salaam in one of the
continent s poorest countries illustrates Lungu's opinion. Similarly
to most African countries, the <B>Tanzanian</B> gross domestic product (GDP)
declined in real terms throughout the 1980s, from an average annual
growth rate of 5.1% to less than 2.0%. This fall is attributed to
falling export commodity prices, the collapse of the  East African
Community, war in Uganda, and successive droughts. Despite various
survival, adjustment, recovery, and social action programs in the
early 1980s, the per-capita income averaged 260 USD/year during the
1980s (DSM/ARDHI 1992: 4). The Arusha Declaration's emphasis on rural
development did not slow the growth of Dar es Salaam: its population
nearly doubled in 10 years to 1.4 million in 1988. Some 70% of its
people now live in unplanned settlements and 75% of the households
have to use pit latrines; less than 3% of  the city s solid wastes
are collected (DSM/ARDHI 1992: 5 6).

<P> Satellite imagery reveals that as much as 23% of the city region
is used for agricultural production, with nearly 34,000 ha under
crops in 1988 (more than 500 ha in vegetable crops) (DSM/ARDHI 1992:
8). Data on other Tanzanian cities show a similar, if not larger,
incidence of UA (Mosha 1991; Mvena et al. 1991).  According to the
1988 census, <B>UA ranked as Dar es Salaam's second largest 
employer</B>, after small traders and labourers; it occupied 11% of the population
aged 10 or more, and 20% of those employed, turning out about 100,
000 tons of food crops annually. People in Dar es Salaam are engaged
on a large scale in what many other large African cities are
increasingly documenting, if not trying to  manage more fully.

<P>

Changing attitudes is no doubt turning out to be a crucial factor in
bringing about more sustainable urban policies in the North and the
South. Worldwide, most UA still remains largely unrecognized,
unassisted, or discriminated against, if not outlawed or harassed,
even in years of food shortage. However, several  governments are
creating agencies to manage UA and some governmental and other
organizations are actively encouraging the activity. <B>Between 1975 and
1985, governments in at least 22 countries (10 in Asia, 6 in Africa,
and 6 in Latin  America) were supporting UA initiatives</B> related to
the provision of land and other  production inputs, technical
assistance, home food production and distribution, tree crops and
small-animal husbandry, food-import alternatives, nutrition, and food
distribution, storage, and preservation (Wade 1987: 38 41).

<H2>3.3.1	North America</H2>

<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR>
International Development Research Centre </ADDRESS>

<P>

Beyond typical backyard gardening, a growing number of North American
and European city governments are now encouraging community gardening
on city and institutional land. <B>The number of community gardens
for nine major North  American cities recently totalled 2,475</B>,
ranging from 1,000 in <B>New York City</B> down to 30 in
<B>Seattle</B> and metro <B>Toronto</B> (Archibald, 1993: 33). The
governments  of cities like <B>Montreal, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland and
Pittsburgh</B>, now provide some start-up funding and accept gardens in
parks. <P>

In <B>Canada</B>, the City of Toronto's Department of Parks and Recreation
currently provides a total of 358 allotment gardens at three
locations, including utility lands; metro Toronto has 14 community
allotment gardens with 2,000 available allotment plots (total metro
Toronto area in allotment gardens: 6.2 ha Eguillor, 1993, as per
Cosgrove, 1994a: 6). Two CityHome projects of the Housing Department
already have gardens with composters, raised beds and soil supplied
by CityHome to tenant growers. The Department of Public Health
nutritionists support urban food production and community gardening.
They also monitor city school-gardening and composting.

<P> In response to demands by community groups the Toronto Food
Policy Council and the Healthy City Project helped to establish an
Interdepartmental Working Group on Urban Food Production composed of
the Departments of Housing, Planning and Development, City Property,
Buildings and Inspection Public Health, Parks and Recreation and
Public Works and the Environment. This group  assessed capacities and
expertise of various city government units and issued recommendations
for these to support fully food production in the city. These
recommendations, contained in the Garden City report, were passed by
City Council in December 1993 (Cosgrove, 1994a: 4). Social housing
agencies had sponsored community-garden projects in the mid-1980s
(Cosgrove, 1994a: 3).  Now a community coalition called Grow T.O.
recently obtained permission to plan a new garden in City parkland
(Cosgrove, 1994a: 3).

<P> Cosgrove considers <B>Montreal's</B> community garden program "by far
the largest, best organized program in Canada" (1994b: 2). When
Italian and Portuguese immigrants initiated illegal gardening in
North Montreal in the early 1970s, the city attempted to regulate and
organize community gardening. The movement, sheltered and championed
by The Montreal Botanical Garden, blossomed. A review in 1985
clarified city policy and the Department of Recreation and Community
Development is now responsible for the program,  coordinating other
departments' involvement as well: Habitation & Urban Development,
Provisioning & Buildings, Public Works, and Planning and Policy. The
gardens are very productive and have long waiting lists; the city
provides insurance and horticultural animators; organic methods are
mandatory, gardeners must grow at least five different types of
vegetables; some of the food produced is donated to community
kitchens. The City of Montreal has 75 community garden  sites,
totalling 6 654 plots (plus 30 other sites elsewhere in metro
Montreal,  Archibald, 1993: 33).

<P>

In contrast with Toronto, urban food production in Montreal is an
official and permitted land use, with about one third of "community
garden" sites zoned as such and 13 of these 22 sites are located on
city parkland (Archibald, 1993:  11).

A 1994 IDRC survey of institutional capacities and ongoing UA
activities revealed growing official support in the region.
Fifty-five senior officials of 41 institutions (U.N. and regional
agencies, public and private research centres, national government
departments and local development NGOs and consulting firms) were
interviewed in the <B>Dominican Republic, Mexico, Costa Rica,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina</B> (Prudencio,
1994).

<P> In <B>Costa Rica</B>, the Food and Nutrition Division of the
Ministry of Education supports 1,500 gardens countrywide, which
supply food to school cafeterias feeding half a million students; it
is looking for ways to produce under growing space constraints.
Nutrition Department officials believe urban food production must be
encouraged above food donations given to child care centres. In
<B>Argentina</B>, the Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria,
with Ministry of Health funding until at least 1997, cooperates with
over 800 institutions to support nearly 56 000 gardens in 1,300
localities (61% urban and semi-urban); these reportedly benefit
directly 430,000 people.

<P> In <B>Lima</B>, a central hospital lends training and
crop-testing facilities to Peru Mujer, a women's NGO supporting some
252 produce gardens (household, communal and school-based) in three
low-income districts of Lima. The municipality of the <B>San Juan de
Miraflores</B> district, in agreement with the Pan- American Centre
of Sanitary Engineering and Environmental Sciences, operates a
waste-water treatment plant coupled to fish tanks yielding 4
tons/year of algae-fed Nile tilapia, which are in great demand on
Lima markets; the plant also irrigates 60  ha of field crops and 290
ha of forest land (Prudencio, 1994). In <B>Brazil</B>, more
backyards, vacant plots, road and streamsides are being converted to
food production in low-income districts, as observed by Yves Cabannes
(personal communication, August 1994) in <B>Fortaleza</B>, Agnäs Serre
(personal communication, September 1994) in <B>Belem</B>, and Martin Coy
(1994: 10) in <B>Cuiaba</B>. The Municipality of Cuiaba, which owns 143
green areas, is elaborating a municipal environmental plan to be
coupled to the city's master plan.

<H3>3.0 OFFICIAL SUPPORT FOR URBAN AGRICULTURE</H3>

<H3>3.3 Local Authorities' Changing Attitudes Toward City
Farming</H3>

<H2>3.3.3	Africa</H2>

<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR>

<P>


While gardening and some animal husbandry have been permitted on
private plots since colonial times, official initiatives have been
minimal for incorporating UA to low-income housing plans, the
management of institutional and open public space, as well as
citywide zoning. What Lee-Smith and Memon (1994: 71) say of
<B>Kenya</B> may well apply to other East and Southern African
countries: Kenyan urban centres were gazetted as townships under the
Townships Ordinance of 1903, to function as centres of colonial
authority and rule, over which strict sanitary control could be
maintained. Boundaries were carefully defined to reduce existing
areas of subsistence farming and settlement; upper-income residential
districts were laid out according to the garden-city model, often
protected from less salubrious land uses by buffer zones of public
open space. Permanent settlement of indigenous Africans was
proscribed and carefully policed.


<P> However, like post-Russian nationalist China, a growing number of
newly independent African countries are departing from colonial
approaches to urban planning. The new national capitals of<B> Cite d'
Ivoire, Malawi, and Tanzania</B> have been planned to accommodate UA
and their authorities are encouraging it (DGIP/UNDP 1992: 2, 25). As
for major existing urban centres, local governments have commissioned
special sectoral studies on urban agriculture as part of master
planning processes, in <B>Maseru, Lesotho</B> (Greenhow, 1994: 2),
<B>Kampala, Uganda</B> (NEIC, 1994) and <B>Dar es Salaam</B>
(DSM/ARDHI, 1992). In contrast with its 1967 version,
<B>Kinshasa's</B> 1975 master plan did set aside areas for
horticulture in the east, central, and southwest sections of this
multimillion-people city (Pain 1985:  34).

<P> Authorities in some intermediate size cities have also innovated.
<B>Tanzanian</B> municipalities have experimented with zones for UA
in recent years. While breaches to regulatory constraints on public
land have led to harassment in <B>Nairobi and Kisumu</B>, councils in
Kenyan other cities have been innovative and pro-active, supporting
crop irrigation in <B>Isiolo</B>, providing extension services in
<B>Kitui</B>, or experimenting with allotments for food crops in
Kitale (Lee-Smith and Memon,  1994: 83). In <B>Nigeria and Zaire</B>
as in China, Japan, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines urban
farmers have been protected and encouraged through land use
regulations and tax concessions (Diallo 1993; Lado 1990: 257).

<P> In <B>Daloa, Cite d' Ivoire</B> (population 123,000 in 1988),
peri- and intra-urban agriculture grew tremendously between 1954 and
1988, promoted successively by Chinese immigrants, native ethnic
minorities, and local authorities. One official project had 456 rice
growers in 1988 on government-improved and acquired  bottomland. A
1989 map shows 55 poultry farms located within and on the edge of the
built-up area, with 13 pig farms and 110 fish ponds in the city s
immediate vicinity. Della (1991) also surveyed Daloa s intra-urban
agriculture: some 121 part- and full-time producers tended 250 ha of
well- and tank-irrigated rice paddies  and native and introduced
vegetable crops on marshland within the built-up area; these plots
supply various governmental and public agencies. On the urban fringe,
agriculture has adjusted to rapid city growth, with labour-demanding
lowland cropping expanding from 52 to 624 ha between 1954 and 1983.

<P> In some major cities the changes in official attitudes have been
remarkable. In <B>Harare, Zimbabwe</B>, bylaw enforcement remains
among the most stringent observed in East and Southern Africa. Yet,
official attitudes towards UA have progressed considerably over the
last decade, as shown by Mbiba (1994: 194-200). Authorities were
originally opposed to any off-plot UA and this was reflected in
information campaigns prohibiting felling and cropping at all cost.
Tree-planting programs, the demarcation and pegging of cultivable
areas, and the  policing of UA by a municipal security unit in
high-density areas were implemented to discourage cultivation. A
Greater Harare Illegal Cultivation Committee was later set up by the
City Council, the aggressiveness of which began to worry ministerial
authorities. Pressed by the Ministry of Local Government and Town
Planning, the Harare City Council in the early 1980s finally issued a
more accommodating policy: UA could now take place on Council land
leased out by the Council to producers in cooperatives. However, the
slashing of crops on other public land proceeded, until major
confrontations prompted a review, resulting in the suspension, of
crop slashing in 1992 and ever since.

<P> A local stakeholders' workshop in Harare in early 1994 (ENDA-ZB,
1994b) further identified critical issues which need to be better
documented in order to guide a better management of UA in Harare. In
cooperation with the Ministry of Local Government and the Department
of Housing and Community Services, ENDA-Zimbabwe conducted a baseline
survey of open-space UA in Greater Harare; it now plans to research
more specific UA management issues. In 1989 in Harare, 246 out of 298
cooperatives managed by the City Council's Department of Housing and
Community Services (DHCS) in 1989 were agricultural cooperatives, 16
in food-catering, distributed in six major areas, among which was the
peri-downtown sector of Highfield Glenview Waterfalls. A number of
chicken cooperatives were active. The DHCS also managed some 97
women's clubs with about 2,700 members and four youth groups were
classified under agriculture.  With its activities in housing, home
industries, youth and women's clubs, child development, health and
nutrition, transportation, markets, and recreation, the DHCS of
Harare City Council could promote UA in a highly integrated fashion,
with multiple benefits to a wide range of population groups and
economic sectors.

<P> Thus, in several African countries, ministries of local
governmental affairs and agriculture, municipal health and nutrition
agencies, associations of urban municipalities, and elected
urban-district councillors have become more tolerant, if not
supportive, of city farming recently.

<P>

Not surprisingly, international congresses of city governments are
now paying much greater attention to the role of UA in urban
development than reported until recently. For instance, the
<B>International Union of Local Authorities</B> had panels addressing
city farming at their 31st World Congress in Toronto in June 1993. In
June 1994, the <B>Global Forum 94</B> in Manchester convened 50 city
delegations from the North and the South; it conducted an Advisory
Workshop on Urban Agriculture where delegates representing 25 of the
50 cities invited acknowledged UA and qualified its impact as
positive. Almost all questionnaire respondents at the workshop said
there is UA both within and at the edge of their home city; a little
more than two thirds said it is done by households, with a third
adding that entrepreneurs and institutions are also engaged in UA;
only a quarter said UA causes some problems but two thirds said their
city benefits from it. A third said UA was regulated in some way in
their city, with only about a quarter knowing of any support programs
or research underway in their city on UA. In  August 1994, in a
Declaration on Social Development and Sustainable Human  Settlements
issued at the <B>International Colloquium of Mayors on Social
Development at the U.N</B>. in New York, over 100 mayors from around
the world invited the various sectors of society to join them in six
categories of actions for the sustainable social development of their
cities. The category at the top of the  list reads:

<P> "Reducing urban poverty by providing productive employment for
the poor and the jobless in the private and public sectors, promoting
urban agriculture and supporting micro-enterprise development through
credit and training, particularly the informal sector;" (ICMSD, 1994:
10).

<P>

Food security is the most important consideration in assessing the
significance of UA. This seems to be the strongest argument which
politicians and planners in the South invoke to accommodate the rise
of farming in their cities. Food security is basically defined as
access by all people at all times to the food required for a healthy
life. It addresses the risks of not having access to needed
quantities and quality of food (von Braun et al. 1993: 3). One can
readily see why  local authorities have begun to seriously revisit
earlier, largely colonial attitudes, towards city farming.

<H2>4.1 Urban Vulnerability to Food Imports</H2>


<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR> International
Development Research Centre </ADDRESS>


<P>

Urban food supplies, particularly in the Least-Developed Countries
(LDCs), can no longer be taken for granted: by 1980, nearly 50% of
all food consumed by  people in the cities of the developing world
was imported from other countries (Austin 1980, quoted by Wade 1987:
37). In African cities, many imported food products now cost
relatively less than local food, at least during part of the year 
(Vennetier 1988: 221). The internationalization of urban food-supply
systems, in countries stricken or not by famine, and its effects on
diet changes, food prices, infant health, and local enterprises are
provoking renewed concern (Drakakis-Smith 1990). In <B>Harare</B>, a former
Secretary of Agriculture, now chairman of the Agricultural Marketing
Authority, sees UA as a national food-security issue (Charles Gore,
personal communication, Harare, 1 September 1993).

<H2>4.2 Food: Basic Luxury for the Urban Poor</H2>


<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR>
International Development Research Centre </ADDRESS>


<P>

For a large and growing segment of the population, food is turning
into a basic luxury. In 1990, households in nearly half (23) of the
LDCs largest metropolitan centres were spending 50 - 80% of their
average income on food (PCC 1990). Among the listed cities, most
hard-hit are <B>Calcutta, Ho Chi Minh City, Istanbul, Kinshasa,
Lagos, and Lima</B>. Global figures only tell part of the story;
survey estimates for low-income groups are much bleaker. In
metropolitan USA, for instance, households spend 9 - 15% of their
income on food, but the poorest 20% of Americans spend 34% of their
after-tax income on food (Ethelston, 1992: 16). Food-price surveys of
five developing countries showed that city dwellers paid between 10 -
30% more for their food than rural dwellers (Yeung, 1985: 2).

<P> In <B>India</B>, 80% of urban families typically spend 70% of
their income on food; master plans of Indian cities rarely, if ever,
provide land for food production (Newland 1980, cited by Yeung 1985:
2, 5). In <B>Bangkok</B>, the lowest-income families spend 60% of
their income on food (Sukharomana 1988: 7). In <B>Ecuador</B>, 74% of
urban households had insufficient incomes to afford basic food
purchases: percentages vary from 62% in <B>Babahoyo</B> to 84% in
<B>Tulcan</B>, with <B>Quito</B> and  <B>Guayaquil</B> scoring 67 and 71%
respectively (Fundacion Natura, 1993, II). A small sample of urban
households in <B>Bolivia</B> suggests that, on average, they were spending
32% but the poorer households, 70 - 89% of their income on food 
(Leon et al. 1992: 72, 73, 77). In the low-income urban district of
<B>La Florida, Chile</B>, 64% of interviewed households were spending more
than 50% of their  budget on food; even so, 42% could not fully cover
their basic food costs and  63% were not managing to satisfy their
basic nutritional needs (Cereceda and Cifuentes 1993: 273, 277).

<P> In <B>Africa</B>, poor urban Kenyan households have to spend 40 - 50% on
food and cooking fuel alone (Lee-Smith et al. 1987: 14). In 1983, 34%
of 189 surveyed households in Bamako spent 32 - 64% of their average
income on food and cooking (Diallo and Coulibaly 1988: 20). In <B>Egypt</B>,
food represents 60% of family budgets for more than 50% of all urban
households, despite state control of food supply and distribution
channels, and state subsidies on basic items (Chair-  Dagher 1987:
37). For low-income households in <B>Dar es Salaam</B>, the percentage of
income spent on food rocketed from 50% in 1940 to 85% in 1980 (Sawio
1993: 55). In <B>Kinshasa</B>, in 1982, food purchases were already
absorbing an average 60% of total household spending (Pain 1985: 44);
a 1988 study of food consumption showed that in major <B>Zairean</B> cities
67.4% of monthly household expenditure went to food purchases
(MacGaffey, 1991: 14). In the early 1980s, a minimum wage fed a
<B>Ghanean</B> family for a week with a staple starch. An official  in
Conakry could only feed his family for three days with his monthly
wage. Senior Ugandan civil servants could only buy 1.5 bunches of
banana with theirs. An  <B>Angolan</B> official would pay six days of his
salary for one chicken. And an average Tanzanian household of six
could be fed on formal wages for six days of the  month (MacGaffey,
1991: 15-16). Apolo Nsibambi, was writing in 1988 (151): "In <B>Uganda</B>,
where the salary of an ordinary wage-earner lasts for two weeks, food
alone wipes out the entire salary."

<P> Dar es Salaam illustrates how badly urban wages and their
purchasing power can trail behind food price increases. In this city,
a daily minimum wage could buy 10 kg of maize or 4.8 kg of rice in
1973, but only 1.3 kg of maize and 0.8 kg of rice in 1985 (Bagachwa
1990: 26, cited by Sawio 1993: 10). <P>

Food insecurity grows as the share of household budget which must be
spent on food rises. The fewer the household's alternatives to buying
food, the more it will be food-insecure. If one is a city poor, one's
coping strategies are fewer than in rural areas. In the Ecuadorian
city of <B>Cuenca</B>, 56.5% of street  scavengers interviewed precede the
collector-truck runs by 5 or 10 minutes and sort out of residential,
office, and public garbage, meal leftovers and overripe or  rotting
fruits and vegetables in order to feed their family (Fundacion Natura
1993,  II). <P>

In African cities, to eat only one meal a day is becoming
commonplace, and this undoubtedly affects people's nutritional health
(Vennetier 1988: 222). Even when doing so, if one is poor, one will
tend to pay relatively more than do higher income consumers for the
food one buys. More likely than not, one will be forced into
inefficient shopping practices: smaller, more frequent purchases from
various and distant sources, more cash spent on transportation, more
losses from bad storage, and so forth. Vennetier (1988: 222)
considers the micro-retailing of food as increasing food prices in
African cities, the higher prices being charged to those who are less
able to pay. <P>

The nutritional energy requirements of urban dwellers is generally
greater than that of rural dwellers, regardless of differences in
income or expenditures. Furthermore, poor urban manual workers may
have higher energy needs than the average urban resident. Calorie
costs are higher in metropolitan than in smaller centres, and, in
poor regions, intra-urban differences can be greater than rural urban
differences (von Braun et al. 1993, p. 14). Micronutrient
deficiencies can be much more prevalent among lower-income than among
higher-income families, as shown in <B>Manaus, Brazil</B> (Amorozo and
Shrimpton 1984, cited by von  Braun et al. 1993: 18).

<P> Available findings are collapsing the myth of urban privilege
over rural neglect. In some countries, malnutrition is as prevalent
in large cities as it is in rural areas; rates of malnutrition are
often likely to be higher in urban slums than in a typical rural
area. Although some doubted that there were marked rural urban
differences in malnutrition levels in Africa during the 1970s, the
experience of the  1980s now has clearly dispelled such doubts for
many countries. Schilter (1991: 11) and staff of the United Nations
Children s Fund (UNICEF) (Francis Kamondo, personal communication,
August 1993; Bjorn Ljungqvist, personal communication, August 1993)
believe that malnutrition in <B>Nairobi, Lome, and Kampala</B> is now more 
acute than in rural <B>Kenya, Togo, and Uganda</B>, respectively. In <B>Cairo
Giza</B>, the rate of malnutrition is nearly as high as in rural areas of
Egypt. An eight-country survey  revealed that between 25 and 30% of
the urban population was malnourished and more so than rural
populations in five of the eight countries studied (von Braun et  al.
1993: 13, 23).

<P>

As a result, urban food production has become a complex, thriving
industry. More and more people in cities in the South are trying to
grow some of the food they need. Globally, about 200 million urban
dwellers are now urban farmers, providing food and income to about
700 million people a minority of households farm in <B>North American</B>
cities, whereas most do so in <B>Siberian</B> and smaller Asian cities
(DGIP/UNDP, 1993: 3). Estimates are 25% in urban USA and 65% for 
<B>Moscow</B> in 1991 (Smit and Ratta, 1992).

<P>
In <B>Peru</B>, more than 50% of households are reported to raise guinea
pigs at home (Charbonneau, 1988: 7). In the El Alto area of<B> La Paz,
Bolivia</B> (based on a sample of 266 households representing a range of
incomes, from August 1984 to June 1985) between 31 and 55% raised
small livestock for self-consumption (hens, rabbits, pigs, lambs, and
ducks), with the number of self-consumers tending to increase. Animal
husbandry is the main source of animal protein for households, with
the low-income group representing as much as 68.1% of all animal
raisers during the period. Also, between 14 and 68.4% of households
grew food crops, mostly tubers, but also produce and vegetables, with
the majority again being low- income growers (Prudencio, 1993: 226
229).

Resources</H2>

<P>


In Africa, cities for which data are available show a growth in the
proportion of households practising some form of UA; a few such
cities also report a growth in the area under UA. In <B>Lusaka</B> in
mid-1980s, a survey of 250 low-income households in five compounds of
urban Lusaka found that 45% of them cultivated food within or on the
fringe of the city (Sanyal, 1984: 198). Rakodi's (1988) study  showed
percentages varying between 25 and 56%, reaching 73-80% in some areas
(Lee-Smith and Memon, 1994: 74). A 1991 dry-season survey on
vegetable supply in urban townships of Lusaka found that nearly 50%
of respondents practised vegetable gardening. An FAO-funded household
garden survey in 1992-3 found that 42.6% of 648 interviewees within
Lusaka Town practised gardening (Drescher, 1994:7). While rainy
season urban plots covered an average 300 m2  in the late 1970s
(Jaeger and Hickabay, 1980, as per Drescher, 1994: 8), the FAO 1992-3
survey showed that this average area had grown to 423 m2, ranging
from 231 to 666 m2 in six different sectors of Lusaka (Drescher,
1994: 8). In Harare, an interpretation aerial photographs of
open-space cultivation by ENDA-Zimbabwe (1994) reveals that this type
of cultivation has grown by 92.6% in almost four years, from 4,882 ha
in 1990 to 9,288 ha in 1994(ENDA-ZB, 1994: 12).

<P>
In <B>Maseru, Lesotho</B> (110,000 in 1986), a survey of 4,280 plots showed
that 55% had some form of UA ongoing; in low-income areas,
horticulture abounded where soils permitted, with small livestock
being preferred on more rocky soils; dairy and poultry husbandry were
fairly common in higher-income districts  (Greenhow, 1994: 2).
<P>

In <B>Addis Ababa</B>, a 1983 survey indicated that 17% of 1,352 households
surveyed produced their own vegetables (Hormann and Shawel, 1985, as
per  Egziabher, 1994: 88). Data for <B>Dar es Salaam</B> show that, in 1980,
44% of low- income earners had farms, but in 1987 some 70% of heads
of household engaged in some farming or husbandry (Malilyamkono and
Bagachwa 1990: 126, cited by Sawio, 1993: 63 64); another study found
that nearly 50% of workers and 59% of all residents of 287 households
in Dar es Salaam reported having farms in 1987/8 (Tripp, 1989).
<P>

A sample of 1 576 urban households (57% in low-income groups) in six
<B>Kenyan</B> cities found that 29% grew part of their food and 17% raised
livestock in the urban area where they lived in 1984/5 (Lee-Smith et
al., 1987). According to one senior UNICEF officer, clearly more of
the food sold by street-food vendors in <B>Nairobi</B> (spinach in
particular) comes from urban home gardens than was the case  years
ago (Francis Kamondo, personal communication, 24 August 1993).

<P>
In the early 1980s, UNICEF/KCC estimated that a quarter of low-income
households farmed, but, in the early 1990s, the Makerere Institute of
Social Research study found that 36% of the households surveyed
within a 5-km radius  from downtown, and 30% of all households
citywide, were engaged in some form of agriculture (Maxwell and
Zziwa, 1992; Maxwell, 1994: 49). In <B>Kisangani (Zaire)</B>,  33% of 426
households responded that they practise UA (Streiffeler 1991: 268,
cited by Sawio 1993: 103).
<P>

Also, in many studies used here, large percentages of the nonfarming
households said they would farm if they had access to land to do so.
In 1992-3 nearly 40% of the respondents of the survey in <B>Lusaka Town</B>
resorted to gathering of wild fruits and vegetables to supplement
their food intake or income; that  percentage rose to 80% in
peri-urban and rural areas outside Lusaka Town (Drescher, 1994: 4).

<H2>4.5 Urban Agriculture Shouldering Cities' Food
Self-Reliance</H2>


<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR>
International Development Research Centre </ADDRESS>

<P>


Clearly, UA is already contributing considerably to the food
self-reliance of many major cities. Food self-reliance is not
self-sufficiency but it can go a long way toward reducing the food
insecurity of vulnerable groups. No one expects UA to satisfy most of
the urban demand for cereals and tubers; these products can be 
easily stored and transported, with limited losses, from rural areas.
What is striking and must be recognized is that UA, with little
support, already supplies significant share of cities food needs. In
the USA, the Department of Agriculture statistics show that one third
of the country's agricultural output comes from  urban/metropolitan
areas (Ratta and Smit, 1993: 26; Smit and Nasr, 1992: 142).
<P>

In <B>Asia, Singapore</B> is relatively self-sufficient in pork, poultry,
and eggs, and grows 25% of all vegetables its population consumes
(Yeung, 1985: 22). In the early 1980s, on 10% of its total area, <B>Hong
Kong</B> was producing 15% of the pork, 45% of the fresh vegetables, and
68% of live chickens it consumed (Wade, 1981, cited by Yeung, 1985:
19). <B>Shanghai's</B> neichiao (inner zone) provides 76% of the  vegetables
consumed in the city, with only 16% of the cultivated land devoted to
this crop (Yeung, 1985: 12). <B>Within their municipal boundaries, six
large Chinese cities grew 85% of their vegetables requirements</B>
(Skinner, 1981: 215 280, cited by Yeung 1985: 8 9), with relatively
small waste and waste-water problems and budgets (Smit and Nasr
1992). Karachi produced 50% of its fresh vegetables  (Smit, 1980,
cited by Yeung, 1985: 9). Metro <B>Calcutta's</B> 4,500 ha of fish-stocked
wetlands produced 10% or more of its daily fish consumption (Panjwani
1985: 35). In <B>Kathmandu</B>, 30% of the fruit and vegetable needs are met
by household food production alone (Wade, 1987: 4). Some Latin
American metropolises grow 30% of the vegetables they consume
(Heimlich, 1989, cited by Sawio, 1993:  116).
<P>

In <B>Africa</B>, a single cooperative in <B>Addis Ababa</B> (in 1983) supplied 6%
of cabbage, 14% of beetroots, 17% of carrots, and 63% of the Swiss
chard  consumed in the city (Egziabher, 1994: 98). In <B>Kampala</B> about
20% of the staple foods consumed within the 5 km radius of the city
centre were produced within that same area, the percentage probably
being higher in the other less built-up municipal areas. Statistics
indicate that Kampala produces 70% of all poultry  products it
consumes (Maxwell, 1994: 49). Some cities even manage to export to
other centres <B>Singapore</B> exports eggs, chickens, and orchids, <B>Shanghai</B>
exports grains and vegetables (Yeung, 1985: 14, 22); chicken broilers
are exported from <B>Bangkok to Tokyo</B>, and fresh fruits from <B>Abidjan to
Paris</B> (DGIP/UNDP 1992: 4).

<P>
International development policies nurturing rural urban dichotomies
have been starving cities. Beyond industrialization programs which,
in the 1960s, disregarded the rural areas on one hand, and the 1970s
and 1980s saw agricultural programs which ignored urbanization, more
balanced development approaches are now needed. Urban agriculture
provides us good reasons for better  exploiting rural urban linkages;
fittingly, a recent book on the urban rural interface in Africa
dedicated a full section to UA (Baker and Pedersen, 1992). The 
comparative advantages which rural and urban areas must be exploited
to meet large cities growing needs for affordable and reliable
supplies of sufficient and nutritious food. In the process, a number
of related economic, social, gender,  environmental and political
issues can be addressed more comprehensively.

<P>

There are more signs that UA contributes to producers well-being. It
enables them to satisfy part of their needs in food. It provides them
with ready access to nutritious food which improves their health
status. It enables them to save cash and earn income which then can
be spent on other necessities.

<P>


In the poorer countries and among the lower-income groups,
self-produced food can cover a considerable share of a household's
total food intake and can save or release an even larger share of the
household's cash income to cover nonfood expenses. Self-produced food
accounted for as much as 18% of total household consumption in <B>East
Jakarta</B> (Yeung, 1985). However, percentages are  much higher in
African cities, as urban farmers produce mostly or largely for 
household consumption, 77% in urban <B>Kenya</B> for example (Lee-Smith and
Memon, 1994). In <B>Nairobi</B>, over 50% used the entire amount harvested
to feed their families or dependents. In <B>Pointe Noire</B>, 26% of
households or 33% of the population self-supplied all or part of its
needs for cassava (Vennetier, 1961:  71 72). In <B>Dar es Salaam</B>, nearly
50 % of 260 intra-urban producers reported that UA contributed 20 30%
or more of the household's food supply (Sawio. 1993: 309). In
Kampala, 55% of 150 producers obtained 40% or more, and 32%  obtained
60% or more, of their household food from their own urban garden
(Maxwell and Zziwa, 1992: 49 50). The poorest households in Lusaka
were estimated to self-produce about one third of all the food they
consumed (Sanyal, 1986, as per Rogerson, 1993: 38). In <B>Kenya</B> 40% of
the 1,576 urban farmers interviewed in the six Kenyan cities said
they would starve if stopped from farming (Lee-Smith and Memon, 1994:
80). In <B>Kampala</B>, almost without exception, those  engaged in UA said
that even if they were offered jobs whose cash remuneration  was
equivalent, they would not stop farming (Maxwell, 1994).

<H3>4.0	SIGNIFICANCE OF URBAN AGRICULTURE</H3>

<H2>4.6.2	Nutritional Impact</H2>


<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR>
International Development Research Centre </ADDRESS>

<P>


The impact of UA on households nutritional status is still
under-researched but the few data available are encouraging and more
are being collected. According to a 1981 UNICEF survey of households
with children aged 5 or under in 13 low-income districts of <B>Kampala</B>,
partial reliance on intra-urban food production largely explained why
supplementary feeding aid could be discontinued. This had taken place
despite dramatic economic decline during the Amin regime and a war
with Tanzania: 24% of households were engaged in farming within the
city. The Save the Children Fund (SCF) reports similar findings in
its 1987 study  of one division in Kampala. (Maxwell, 1993a).
<P>

The findings of SCF are also supported by the initial results of a
1993 survey by a team of the Makerere Institute of Social Research
(MISR). The MISR  findings impressed the Kampala City Council's
Public Health Office. The 1993 survey found a highly significant
difference between farming and nonfarming households in the low- and
very low-income groups, with respect to stunting among children under
5 years of age. Areas surveyed coincide with some covered by the
World Bank-funded First Urban Project in Kampala. Differences between
the nonfarming and farming groups on wasting a shorter-term effect of
malnutrition have been observed, although they were not statistically
significant (Maxwell,  1993a).

<P>
Such results suggest that the poorer a household is, the more the
women may be inclined to do some UA to prevent malnutrition. In
Nairobi, a 1992 baseline survey commissioned by UNICEF and the
Nairobi City Council's Nutrition Section in two low-income sectors
found that 21.6% (up to as much as 33.1%  in one area) of 250
children sampled were stunted. It found UA was not  adequately
addressed and recommended that the promotion of UA and marketing of
UA produce be seriously reviewed with municipal authorities, so as to
make food more accessible and affordable to low-income urban women
(Mutiso, 1993).

<P>
Conventional strategies for urban food security need to be reassessed
in view of UA's potential role: an extensive survey of subsidy
programs found that income transfers from food subsidies tend to
provide 15 - 25% of the real income of low-income households (von
Braun et al., 1993). As documented earlier, this is roughly what
(largely unassisted) urban farming seems to be achieving already.  UA
does this at a much lower cost, probably with more benefits to
consumers themselves and, by extension, to the general urban economy.

In <B>Dar es Salaam</B>, the lower-income group spent 77% of its income on
purchasing food; home-cultivation supplied the equivalent of 37% of
their income and saved them 50% of their expenditure in food (Sanyal,
1986: 32). In <B>Addis Ababa</B>, cooperative households consumption of
vegetables was 10% higher than the urban average and this enabled
them to save 10 - 20% of their income (Egziabher, 1994). In <B>Maseru,
Lesotho</B>, a detailed survey of 428 plots revealed  that, in the late
1980s, 69%, 51% and 32% of low, medium and high-income vegetable
producers (respectively) were trying to save money through growing
vegetables at home; about 66% of the high-cost, and 29% of the
low-cost, district households claimed to sell some of their produce
regularly (Greenhow, 1994: 2).

<P>

Urban agriculture can also increase a household's cash income. In
<B>Bolivia</B>, urban food projects supply women producers with 25%
of their total income (Prudencio, 1993: 15). In <B>Dar es Salaam</B>,
incomes obtained from UA are larger than regular salaries for 67% of
respondents (Sawio, 1993: 312). In <B>Addis Ababa</B>, all urban
cooperative farmers showed incomes well above those of half the
city's population: 50% earned more than 70% of the city's employed
population (Egziabher, 1994). In <B>Nairobi</B>, 47% of the urban
farmers had no visible means of support other than their urban shamba
plots (Freeman, 1991:135).

<H3>4.0	SIGNIFICANCE OF URBAN AGRICULTURE</H3>

<H2>4.7	The Booming Business of Urban Animal Husbandry</H2>


<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR>
International Development Research Centre </ADDRESS>

<P>

<B>Tanzania's</B> Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development keeps
statistics on UA. Annual reports of the Livestock Office of <B>Dar es
Salaam's</B> City Council show that livestock numbers grew steadily
between 1985 and 1989; chickens from 510,789 to 793,441, pigs from
8,601 to 15,658, goats from 2,617 to 6,218, and dairy cattle from
4,200 to 8,517 (Mosha 1991: 84). According to local observers,
official data give a conservative picture of reality. Similarly,
while  it was initially reported that there is little livestock
rearing in <B>Harare</B> (Mbiba, 1994: 191) the ENDA ground survey (1994:
15, 17, 22), which targetted major medium- and low-density sectors
under off-plot cultivation, revealed that 1,059 of 2,700 (39%)
interviewees in those areas (66.7% and 76.6% of whom practised on and
off-plot cultivation, respectively) raised 27,776 heads of livestock,
largely chickens (57% of growers and 84% of all animals). They also
kept rabbits, pigeons, ducks, turkeys and peacocks. Nearly 90% of
livestock producers live in high-density districts (most dairy
husbandry is carried out on large residential plots excluded from the
survey).

<P>
Ownership of urban cattle is mostly afforded by upper-income UA
practitioners. Individuals are known to raise dairy cattle on their
urban residential compounds in <B>Addis Ababa, Harare and Dar es Salaam</B>,
in addition to other livestock (Egziabher, 1994: 87; ENDA-ZB, 1994;
Sawio, 1993). In Addis Ababa, the Livestock and Fishery Corporation
in the Ministry of State Farms runs dairy, sheep, and poultry farms
in the city (Egziabher, 1994: 87). On Harare's outskirts,  the City
Council irrigates pastures with treated waste-waters for grazing
cattle which are then slaughtered and sold in urban outlets.


Milk vending can be a lucrative undertaking for urban dairy
producers. In Dar es Salaam in August 1993, one cow, yielding an
average of10 litres of milk daily, if this were all sold at 200
TZS/litres, would generate a gross income of 2,000 TZS (575 Tanzanian
shillings (TZS) = 1 United States dollar (USD)). This, minus  an
average maintenance cost of 500 TZS daily, would leave a net income
of 1 500 TZS daily or 10,500 TZS weekly, compared to the minimum
monthly salary which was set at 7,000 TZS. Anyone wishing to
cash-purchase a cow has to disburse an average of 150,000 TZS
(Camillus Sawio, personal communication, August  1993): cows can be
acquired through various means other than cash purchase.  In 1988/89,
there were 8,517 dairy cows in the Dar es Salaam City region. If, in
August 1993, there were at least as many dairy cows producing an
average 10 litres/day in Dar es Salaam, these were worth the
equivalent of 2.2 million USD. They generated a net overall annual
income equivalent to 6.75 million USD (during  the 10-month lactation
period). Assuming that only half of the milk was sold, the 
equivalent to 3.38 million USD per year would go into the pockets of
urban cow owners.
<P>

Furthermore, assuming that 75% of the estimated 23,000 heads of
cattle in Nairobi in 1985 were dairy cows, the annual retail value of
milk produced in the city of <B>Nairobi</B> was at least 13 million USD
(based on the above figures for Tanzania); this was probably only
part of the local milk-market picture as, according to Lee-Smith and
Lamba (1991:38), in 1985, the city of Nairobi was home to an
estimated 26,000 goats. Some of these goats may produce milk  which
is used for household consumption. It should be noted that the cost
of living in Nairobi was probably higher than in Dar es Salaam.


Because urban dairy production is lucrative, it attracts
reinvestments which make it competitive within cities. In 1993, the
District Veterinary Office of <B>Kampala</B> counted 1,751 heads of cattle
in the city ; while the numbers of indigenous breeds have declined in
recent years, the zero-grazing of exotic and cross-bred dairy cattle
has been rising and is actively promoted by NGOs (NEIC,  1994 draft).
<P>

The smaller the animal, the more affordable it is to a wide range of
people and the more easily it can make use of limited spaces in the
urban fabric. In Kampala, at least 105 private homes and three
institutions were raising over 1,100 pigs altogether (87 and 13% of
the total number of pigs respectively). The central-city division
boasted the second largest concentration (30%) of all animals 
reported, largely piglets sold for sale and slaughter. As in Dar es
Salaam, poultry is thriving, having grown by 60% up between 1991 and
mid-1993, when it  totalled 156,000 animals (NEIC, 1994 draft: 79-81)

<P>
As with food crops, urban livestock can sustain sizeable markets for
inputs and outputs, from feedstocks to slaughterhouses. In Kampala,
the growth of poultry is in turn boosting the sales of hatcheries and
chicken feed outlets (NEIC, 1994 draft: 81). In the mid-1980s, within
the city limits of <B>Maseru, Lesotho</B>, seven egg producers owned 75 000
birds; a marketing agency supplied the city with 90,000 dozens of
eggs per month. An expanding poultry industry had over thirty
large-scale poultry producers, a broiler unit and a slaughter unit
with a capacity of 2,500 birds/day; the national pig-breeding herd
was found within the  town, with a capacity to produce 2,500 weaners
per year (Greenhow, 1994: 3). Maseru's dairy plant in the mid-1980s
processed 3,000 litres of milk a day from 94 urban producers,
contributing to about 40% of the town's overall milk  production
(Greenhow, 1994: 3).

<P>

Small-scale urban farming's annual production in crops and livestock
may be worth tens of millions of dollars (US). In metropolitan <B>Rio de
Janeiro</B>, 172 ha are cultivated on lease in 1983, under electrical
transmission lines, resulting in the addition of garden produce worth
10 million USD to the local market (La Rovere 1986, p. 32). In Kenya,
the Mazingira Institute's six-town survey gave the  following
estimates for urban <B>Kenya</B> in 1985: 25.2 million kg of crops worth 4 
million USD and 1.4 million livestock worth 17 million USD. In
Nairobi, upper-  income farmers keep heads of cattle while
lower-income practitioners raise chickens, rabbits, sheep, goats. The
value of animals eaten by producing households in urban Kenya was
estimated at 1.5 million USD annually in 1985,  with another 2.4
million USD worth lost in livestock deaths (Lee-Smith and  Memon,
1994: 78). In <B>Maseru</B>, the annual value of UA was estimated
at 6.7  million maloti or South African rands (Physical Planning Division and
Institute of  Land Use Planning, 1987: 27, as per Mbiba, 1994: 192).
<P>

Although research on UA seems to have focused more on food crops than
on animal husbandry, the available data reveal that livestock keeping
is particularly amenable to farming in small urban spaces and where
soils are less fertile or water scarce (even space-scarce <B>Cairo</B> in
the early 1980s had at least 80,000  households home-raising animals
(Reed 1984, cited by Khouri-Dagher 1987: 41)). It can combine with
plant cultivation to give a highly productive farming system (Siau
and Yurjevic, 1993). It is less visible and less easily surveyed,
thus often more widespread and profitable than generally reported.
Some forms are less affordable to low-income farmers and most forms
are subject to more controls than plant cultivation in general.

<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR>

<P>


Well-tailored surveys consistently show that the area effectively
under UA is very much greater than conventional land use
classifications and maps may indicate.


<P>
Urban agriculture claimed the largest land use within the city
boundaries of <B>Waterloo, Canada</B>, in 1981 (Dorney, 1990, cited by
Sawio, 1993: 121). In <B>Sheffield, England</B>, nature gardens and
allotments together cover 22% of the inner city area and City Council
is encouraging the "green" redevelopment of a much larger central
area (Carr and Lane, 1993: 10). There are still 28,000 ha being 
cropped in three delegations of the Federal District of<B> Mexico</B>; the
Tlahuac delegation supplies one third of the eggs/milk produced in
the district, while Tlalpan is ranked first in terms of acreage under
oats, fodder and fresh maize (Brena, 1993: 149). Some 60% of Greater
<B>Bangkok</B> was officially under UA in the 1980s (DGIP/UNDP, 1993: 4). A
little more than half of the municipal area of  <B>Kampala</B> is used for
agriculture (Maxwell, 1994: 48). In <B>Bamako</B>, 1,550 ha available for UA
are fertilized solely with domestic wastes (Diallo and Coulibaly, 
1988: 30). Five cooperatives produced vegetables on 274 ha in <B>Addis
Ababa</B> (Egziabher, 1994).

<P>
Reported areas often exclude forms of UA in hidden household spaces
(individually small but collectively considerable). There is probably
more UA in any city than meets the eye of conventional aerial
photography; much UA, away from the easily observable crops on
open-land surfaces, actually thrives under tree cover, in shelters or
on roofed surfaces, on wall-shelves and fences, and in basements, or
grazes other unbuilt land areas. When surveys are carried out in  the
dry season, rainfed crops are probably omitted.

<H3>4.0	SIGNIFICANCE OF URBAN AGRICULTURE</H3>

<H3>4.8	The Spatial Distribution of Urban Agriculture</H3>

<H2>4.8.1	Urban Agriculture: An Adaptive and Mobile Land Use</H2>

<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR>
International Development Research Centre </ADDRESS>

<P>


Urban agriculture is a major urban land use because it is remarkably
adaptive and mobile. It is found on sites of various types
(constructible and undeveloped land, land which cannot be built upon
and voluntarily undeveloped, idle public lands and water bodies, and
household spaces); Freeman's (1991: 132) survey of 618 farmers in
<B>Nairobi's</B> open spaces (unenclosed, wholly or partly on public lands)
show that private residential land use is chosen most often (32%),
followed by roadside verges (29%), river banks (16%), and other
public lands (16%). Specific types of farming systems tend to occur
more in some zones than in others (city core, corridors, wedges, or
periphery).

<P>
It should come as no surprise that UA responds to competition for
land, as do many other urban land uses. As urbanization proceeds and
centrality becomes more valuable, space-demanding forms of UA migrate
to more peripheral or less valued locations, much in the same way as
single-storey residences, extensive institutional uses, warehousing
and industrial compounds, transportation terminals,  and ground-level
parking facilities. The kind of urban agriculture which remains in 
central locations tends to labour- or capital-intensive.

<P>
<B>Dar es Salaam</B> illustrates this trend. In a sector of 26 km2 in
central Dar es Salaam, UA initially used a vast amount of open public
space; in the 1970s, the urban fabric became denser in this sector
and by 1981-2, UA had lost ground in terms of total area; at the same
time that it had expanded in cultivated valley land, paddy plots, and
vacant land under power lines. Still, a substantial amount of open
land remained available within this urbanized sector. The pattern of
UA had become more dispersed in the sector by 1991-2, with ground
surveys revealing that 64% of gardens were less than 101 m2 and 25%
under 51 m2; more than 80% of the farmers worked other urban plots at
11 - 20 km from their houses.  Also, households now made more
intensive use of their homestead space, with 74% saying they raised
livestock; most of the cattle were stall-fed (Sawio, 1993: 137 156).
UA therefore does not obstruct more competitive land development; 
instead, it tends to exploit small, inaccessible, unserviced,
hazardous, or vacant  areas.
<P>

UA is typically opportunistic but that is not due to chance.
Practitioners have developed and adapted a remarkable range of
farming systems and crop-selection techniques. This enables them, in
principle, to make the best out of climate, site, and other
locational constraints and assets in the urban fabric. In <B>Kampala</B> for
instance, cocoyams are grown in bottomlands because they tolerate
flooding  during the rains and thrive on swampland during the drier
months (Maxwell, 1994:  54).
<P>

One survey by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
identified over 40 farming systems, each with its own technology,
investment  needs, yield rates, and returns to labour and risk (Smit
and Ratta, 1992: 8): as many as 17 different systems were in
operation in a single LDC city. General categories included
aquaculture (aquatic plants and pisciculture), horticulture 
(household, kitchen, community, and market gardening; roadside,
rights-of-way, and streamside horticulture; soilless and vertical
horticulture; special crops, animals (poultry, cattle, and
micro-livestock), agroforestry and production of multi-purpose wood,
and others (snail-raising, ornamental fish, silkworms, worm larvae,
horses, pets, and medicinal and culinary herbs).

<P>
Product and technical diversity enables UA to colonize an broad range
of niches in the urban ecosystem. This is best revealed by local
surveys. For instance, in three different socio-economic areas of
central Dar es Salaam, over the 1968 - 1982 period, some 260 urban
farmers in six farming categories grew 33 different types of crops
and 8 types of livestock, and some 11 major conventional  land uses
and 22 sub-land uses identified on 1:12 500 air photographs (Sawio, 
1993: 153, 277, 284).

<P>
Crop selection is not haphazard, it depends on local water supply,
soil conditions, distance from home, plot size, use of product, and
the gardener's control over future use of plot. Over 60 kinds of
vegetables were found to be grown by <B>Hong Kong</B> farmers (Yeung, 1985:
20). Tricaud (1988: 11, 33 34) identified some 74 species in Freetown
and Ibadan gardens between short-cycle, annual-cycle, and
semi-perennial crops; they include starchy crops, nuts, legumes, 
leaf vegetables, condiments for sauces, vegetables eaten raw, fruits,
stimulants and medicinal plants, herb teas, spices, extractable
products and raw materials, fencing and decorative plants.
<P>

UA can be a useful way of preserving, exchanging, and experimenting
with native plant biodiversity. A series of surveys commissioned by
the UN University's  Program on Natural Resources in Africa is
assessing the use of indigenous African food crops, introduced crops,
and imported foods in eating outlets in peri-urban  and urban areas.
One consultant found as many as 71 different species in a single
<B>Nigerian</B> home garden (Bede N. Okigbo, personal communication, 23
August 1993).

<H2>4.9 Urban Agriculture is Not Only the Poor's Business</H2>


<ADDRESS> by Luc J.A. Mougeot <BR> &copy Copyright 1994<BR>
International Development Research Centre </ADDRESS>

<P>


Because UA is complex, it is clearly far from being merely a poor
person's subsistence, an informal or illegal undertaking. Surveys in
middle- and upper-class districts actually unveil a very different
picture. The UNDP survey, for example, identified seven categories of
urban farmers, with types of production ranging from low-income
survival to agribusiness; food producers may be middle-income  home
gardeners, low-, middle-, and high-income entrepreneurs, and may
organize themselves into farmers associations and cooperatives. An
empirical classification for <B>Kampala</B> also ranges from
food-security to market-oriented households (Maxwell, 1993b). Another
typology based on the nature of production clearly indicates that
some types of food production require more inputs than others (Sawio,
1993). <P>

For instance, according to the Sokoine University's survey of 1,800
farmers in six <B>Tanzanian</B> cities, animal breeding is a
money-maker for top executives; 65% of all livestock kept in Dar es
Salaam in 1987/88 were found in a low-density area (Mvena et al.,
1991). A three-district survey in <B>Harare</B> showed that 80% of
Glen View (government and services) and Mabelreigh (middle-class
suburb) had gardens with some food crops (Drakakis-Smith, 1990). In
<B>Dar es Salaam</B>, urban farmers were evenly distributed across
educational levels; 86% of interviewees agreed that high-income
earners are doing the most urban farming (Sawio, 1993: 221, 228). <P>

UA can take on the form of a large enterprise: in <B>Bangkok</B>, a
single large firm contracts to about 10,000 producers of chickens and
runs hatcheries and dressing  plants; it controls major shares of the
national and export markets. International agribusiness produces
mushrooms in <B>Jakarta</B>. <B>Bogot</B> exports carnations to
<B>New York</B>; <B>Shanghai</B>, orchids to <B>Paris</B>. California-based
corporations own major shares and assist vineyards within <B>Santiago</B>,
<B>Chile</B> (DGIP/UNDP 1992: 23).

Because of the resources needed to engage in urban agriculture, even for small
scale producers, UA is not primarily the accidental or temporary business of
recent migrants from rural areas (Drakakis-Smith, 1992: 5). Back in 1958, in the
small town of <B>Pointe Noire</B>, Vennetier (1961: 72) had found that the largest
fields were in hands of people who had been living for 5 - 20 years in that city.
More than 60% of<B> Lusaka's</B> urban farmers had resided there for more than 5 years
before starting their plot gardens; nearly 45% had not farmed for the first 10
years of residence (Sanyal, 1986: 15). In <B>Nairobi</B>, urban farmers average
period of residence was 20.4 years and 85% had resided for at least 5 years, 57% for 15
years or more, and 15% for more than 40 years (Freeman, 1991:137). Tricaud's
(1988: 8) survey of 100 gardeners in <B>Freetown and Ibadan</B>, Sawio's study (1993) in
Dar es Salaam and others show similar findings. Most urban farmers have part or
full-time jobs. Even in small Pointe Noire, only 17 out of 266 interviewed
farming heads of household could be described as jobless; the rest were
nonskilled  manual workers, construction workers, and mechanics (Vennetier, 1961:
72). In <B>Addis Ababa</B>, most urban crop producers in Egziabher's sample initially
worked in the informal sector. They then became agricultural leaseholders and
workers prior to squatting on public land and setting up this cooperative
(Egziabher, 1994: 92).

<P>


Urban farming as a basic urban function is nothing new; in fact this activity
seems to be as ancient as cities themselves. At the dawn of the 21st century, 
Asia is leading the "South's way" in this sector, with highly organised and 
competitive systems for the production and marketing of urban agriculture. Since 
the late 1970s, the literature has been unveiling the growing incidence of UA in
many other developing regions. Factors encouraging this expansion were discussed
in this chapter. A noteworthy trend is that more governments are introducing
institutional and other policy changes which recognise, tolerate, manage and/or
promote the activity.
<P>

Paramount to justifying and encouraging this change of attitude is the mounting
evidence on UA's contribution to urban food security. That urban food supplies in
developing countries can no longer be taken for granted and there is ample
evidence from cities world-wide that food is turning into a basic luxury for the
urban poor. These findings are collapsing the myth of urban privilege over rural
neglect, at least as far as food security is concerned. Urban food production has
grown into a complex and thriving industry, in terms of practising households; it
supplies many nutritious food items to urban markets. There is a growing body of
data on the benefits accruing to practising households, in terms of food supply,
of child nutritional status and general health, and of cash savings and income.
The  unfolding evidence should gradually lead the development assistance
organizations and local authorities to incorporate UA into more sustainable and
cost-effective  food security strategies.

<P>
From an urban planning perspective, surveys systematically point to the fact that
the area or space effectively being used by UA activities is very much greater
than conventional classifications and land use maps indicate. UA is virtually
ubiquitous because it is remarkably adaptive and mobile. UA is typically
opportunistic because practitioners have evolved and adapted remarkable know-how
to select and locate, land, process and market plants, trees and livestock within
the urban context. What urban farmers have achieved and what they dare to pursue,
despite minimal support, in the very heart of our metropolises is a resounding
tribute to human ingenuity.

<P>
Perhaps some of the more startling revelations of studies are that UA is far from
being merely a poor person's subsistence, an informal activity, or an illegal
business. It is even less the accidental or temporary pursuit of recent migrants
from rural areas. Above all, UA in the South generally replicates on a massive
scale the efforts of increasingly urban people to meet their basic need for food
that is affordable and in adequate quantity. Without this food, there can be no
sustainable city, economy, or government.

<TT> by Shirley Buswell (C) Copyright <BR> <P> This article is
reprinted from a 1980 issue of City Farmer (Vol. 3, Number 2),  a
newspaper we printed in the early days before WWW publishing. We reprint
it now on the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.</TT>

<p> Up to the end of 1942, as we said in our last issue, the federal
government was not at all keen on the Victory Garden campaign. We
learned, from the Public Archives of Canada: <P>

"Gardening on such a small scale invited inefficiency in its (i.e. the
government's) opinion, due to a wastage of seed, fertilizer, tools, etc.
and lead to overproduction of some crops. They adhered to this opinion
despite scores of letters received urging the Federal Department of
Agriculture to support Victory Gardens, and despite the very active
Victory Garden movement in the United States of America.... By 1943,
however, problems of shortages of food supplies for the Allies (although
not domestically in Canada itself) inclined the federal government
towards Victory Gardens." These are the words of Terry Cook, Archivist,
National Resource Records, Public Records Division.

<P> Something decisive, apparently, happened to the bureaucratic mind in
January 1943, because in early February, James G. Gardiner, Federal
Minister of Agriculture, a man who had never encouraged a Victory Garden
campaign and who, furthermore, had actively discouraged private
involvement in the administration of it should such a campaign be
instituted wrote to a Mr. F.W. Warren of Hamilton, Ontario, in response
to Warren's offer of his services to the Government:

<P> "As a result of deliberations by the Agricultural Supplies Board and
the Foods Administration Board of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board"
(the Federal Department of Agriculture had decided) "... to advise the
Provincial Departments that it was desirable to sponsor community garden
and backyard garden campaigns during the 1943 growing season."

<P> Warren, said Gardiner, should contact his local Department of
Agriculture for more details, because "... ever since the beginning of
the war, provincial governments have been desirous of having the
responsibility of working out actual production programmes within their
respective provinces in view of their agricultural representative
services, and so on."

<P> By Gardiner's own admission, the discussion had been going on for
almost four years!

<P> Perhaps, really, there were some good reasons for the delay in
official approval of the Victory Garden campaign, reasons which it is
not given to us to understand from the historical perspective of almost
forty years. Perhaps bureaucratic federal/provincial wrangling was not
the principal one. Perhaps it was not even that (as the archivist has
pointed out) Canadians were not considered responsible enough by the
politicians to handle valuable supplies of seed and fertilizer - after
all Americans, Britons, Australians and New Zealanders had been growing
Victory Gardens for years, with official blessing. Perhaps it was not
the government mind that had changed. It might have been the government
heart.


<P> A very dark phase of the war in Europe was passing. Some people
could already imagine victory - and peace. The idea of it brought a new
fear. With Europe in chaos, with millions of its working-age population
killed, maimed, or malnourished to the point of chronic ill-health, how
could the first postwar crops be planted, cultivated and harvested?
Obviously the more food Canadians could produce for themselves, the more
could be released for shipment overseas.


<P> Now, with Government approval, the Victory Garden campaign was at
last underway. The National Film Board made a series of films on
nutrition. The Canadian Nutrition Program was launched nation-wide. The
government drew up "Canada's Official Food Rules" <B>Canadian
Horticulture and Home</B> ran a monthly series of articles on Victory
Gardening; seed company advertisements were geared to the concept.

<P> Then a pamphlet called <B>"The Wartime Garden"</B> was issued by
Gardiner's department. "There is a greater need for home food production
of vegetables now than at any time during the war. Every available bit
of land that is suitable should be put into a garden. Those with
experience should help their neighbours who wish to start..." it began.

<P> After all this, public involvement was instantaneous, and
enthusiastic. The Housewives' League of British Columbia (according to a
report in the <B>Vancouver News-Herald</B> of February 22, 1943)
requested City Hall to authorize the use of its heavy machinery to clear
vacant lots. "They'll want us to weed them next," snorted a holdout
alderman, C. Millar. By April of that year, Victory Garden contests had
been announced, and by the end of the month, the newspaper reported,
<B>"If all the Victory Gardens in British Columbia were lumped together,
they would occupy a space approximately three times the size of
Vancouver's great Stanley Park." At that time, the paper said, there
were 1425 gardens on city-owned lots. </B> <P> As fall came, Vancouver
residents looked for ways to supplement the produce they had taken from
their back yards. Many tried poultry raising. If less than twelve
chickens were involved, no permit needed to be applied for. But by
November, A.J. Harrison, the City Building and Zoning Secretary stated,
he had received 87 applications from citizens who wanted to keep more
than that number.

<P> 1944 approached, and someone added up some figures. <B>In 1943, the
Vancouver papers reported, there were 209,200 Victory Gardens in Canada,
and on the average they produced 550 lbs. of vegetables each. One
gardener in seven was a city dweller.</B> There were 15% more home
gardeners than in 1942; 24% more than 1940.

<P> <B>The number of gardens in Vancouver, including New Westminster,
Burnaby, North and West Vancouver by the end of the year was 52,000; the
value of the food they produced in the 1943 season was estimated (in the
dollar value of the time) as $4 million.</B>

<P> After such successes, everyone hoped that the Victory Garden
phenomenon wouldn't vanish. "The Horticultural Council has already
started its 1944 campaign," stated the Province in an editorial dated
December 4, 1943. "Allied statesmen have promised to feed the world in
the few months before harvest immediately following the war... There
will be more need for Victory Gardens... than at any other period in
human history, for these first months of peace, if millions are not to
starve..."

<P> And as the dreadful photographs of "liberated" Europe began
appearing in newspapers around the world, the truth of that statement
was revealed. The photo showed not only the survivors of Nazi death
camps, but the plight of hundreds of thousands of Europe's new
generation of dispossessed: homeless, parentless children who lived by
begging from Allied servicemen or by raiding whatever garbage cans they
were lucky enough to find. War, the photos said, is fought against
children. And its strongest weapon is starvation.

<P> What is to be learned from the Victory Garden experience of 1943?
First, we'd suggest, bearing in mind the tenacity of those who
campaigned so assiduously in the face of bureaucratic indifference for
official recognition of the movement, "Never give up!" But the second
(and we can only hope that it doesn't take some world catastrophe to
make us appreciate the truth of it), is that the closer to home we can
bring our sources of food, the greater control over them we have.

<P> Or, in the words of Vancouver's mayor in 1943, "the basic principle
of the Victory Garden is self-reliance."

<TT>By Monica Kuhn<BR>  (C) Copyright August 1995

<P>Monica Kuhn is a registered architect in Toronto.<BR>She
specializes in rooftop gardens and permaculture design.</TT><P>

<PRE>  </PRE>

Rooftops are a city's greatest untapped resource. Sloped or flat, large
or small, industrial or residential, the possibilities for urban
greening, air cleaning, community building, and food production are
limitless. <P>


Cover a roof with plants and you have immediately achieved several
things: <P>


Environmentally, by increasing the city's biomass, you have increased
Oxygen levels in the air - and decreased the amount of CO2, produced by
cars and other fuel burning "technologies"; you have cut down on dust
and air-borne particulates, since plants act as natural filters; you
have had a hand in altering the local climate, because plants absorb
rather than reflect heat; and because roots hold and absorb water, every
time it rains, your roof is retaining storm water runoff, thereby
decreasing the load on the city's already overflowing storm sewage
systems. <P>


Your building - and therefore your pocketbook - will also benefit.
Layers of soil and foliage have wonderful insulating qualities, keeping
your building warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer - and
thereby reducing your energy bills; because the extreme temperature
swings, and therefore the expansion and contraction experienced by the
roof will be moderated, the life span of your roofing membrane will
increase; and since the roofing will be covered, the membrane will be
protected from harmful UV rays, and everyday wear and tear.


<P> Would you like to hear more? Grow vegetables and you can feed your
family; grow flowers and you can attract butterflies! Create a safe,
private, outdoor space in the heart of the city - without having to buy
extra land; give the people next door a better view; increase the value
of your property; teach your children about the environment; increase
urban food production; plant a garden over your apartment; meet your
neighbors 10 storeys above the street; trade seeds and gardening ideas;
barter or sell your surplus; start a small canning business - and make
your city beautiful.


<P> Wow! And the best thing is that this is not a dream - it is reality.
In Europe and in Asia rooftops are viewed as much more than inaccessible
tar and gravel deserts dotted with drains, vents, and condenser units!
in some parts of Germany, new industrial buildings must have green roofs
by law; in Swiss cities, regulations now require new construction to
relocate the area of greenspace covered up by the building's footprint
to the rooftop - and even existing buildings, some hundreds of years
old, must convert 20% of their roofspace to pasture! This has spawned a
whole new industry which specializes in light-weight growing mediums,
filter cloths, roofing membranes, plant stock, and how-to books and
kits; nurseries, designers, consultants, and contractors have been
forced to relearn and re-adjust in order to compete in the new market,
with the result that they now have more and varied work. <P>


Many studies looking into the environmental, financial, and social
benefits of roofgardens have been completed, and statistics are readily
available - if you can read German! However, North Americans are also
slowly starting to realize the potential of this 'growing" movement;
last year the Danish company Grodania started importing their
lightweight rockwool growing medium to Canada, and in September 1994,
the National Roofing Contractors Association in the USA published an
article in their magazine "Professional Roofing" titled Designing green
roof systems: A growing interest. <P>


In reality, the technology and the know-how required to grow plants and
trees on elevated structures has existed in Canada and the USA for a
long time - just think of all the underground parking garages that
support landscaped courtyards; the difference here is that these gardens
are at ground level, mimicking a natural situation, and so we don't
notice a difference. As well, these gardens were given structural
consideration during the initial design phase - not after the fact -
whereas most of the roofgardens that people are interested in installing
now will have to be retrofits to existing buildings. <P>


If you are interested in growing a green roof, there are several issues
that you should be aware of: <P>



<H3>Loading</H3>

The first is loading. Soil, decking, people, planters - and where they
are placed on your roof deck - all have an impact on the existing
structural/carrying capacity of the roof, as well as that of the rest of
the building. It is important to have a structural engineer confirm the
additional weight that the roof can accommodate. One cubic foot of wet
"earth" weighs +100 pounds, so you can imagine the additional stresses
that a garden can create. However, remember that earth is not soil - you
will probably be adding compost, mulch, and other fillers which will
decrease the weight; nor do all of your planting beds have to be 12"
deep; nor will you be uniformly covering the whole roof surface. Heavy
planters can be placed strategically over bearing walls or columns;
grasses don't need more than 3 inches of growing medium; some plants
will grow in gravel... you have a lot of options available to you. <P>


<H3>Safety</H3>

The second consideration is safety. How do you access the roof; how do
you get materials and water up to the roof; who will be using the roof;
is there a railing; are you insured? Requirements, solutions, and costs
will vary depending on whether the garden is on a private residence, an
apartment tower, or a public library! The Ontario Building Code has
specific regulations regarding structural, health, and safety issues as
they relate to new and existing buildings - a call to your local
Building Department or your favorite architect will help to get you
started. <P>


<H3>Roofing</H3>

Your roofing is also an issue. What kind is it and what condition is it
in; can you walk on it or should it be protected; will plant roots
penetrate the membrane or should you be elevating your planters; how and
where does it drain? If you have to replace or repair it in 5 years, can
you do so without disrupting your established garden? Again, not to
worry, there are as many solutions as there are restrictions or
potential problems!

<H3>Micro-climate</H3>

<P> And then there is the specific micro-climate of the roof itself.
Gardening up on a roof is quite different from gardening at grade. It is
very sunny, sometimes windy, and the temperatures are often extreme.
This will have a direct effect on what will grow well, how often you
have to water, and whether your plants can survive through the winter.
You can temper the effects of heat, cold, and dryness by using
containers that retain moisture i.e. plastic vs. terra-cotta; by
insulating your planters; by using mulch; by mixing moisture retaining
additives into your soil; by layering or interplanting your plants; or
by sticking to plants that thrive in these conditions -it is likely to
be an ongoing experiment! You can build trellises and shade structures;
you can collect rainwater - I could go on and on! <P>


The main thing to remember is that each roof is as different as the
gardener who uses it. Toronto's <B>Field to Table</B> has started a low
cost market garden using 3" of soil, covered with straw mulch, on
plastic sheeting edged with produce crates, which double as pathways;
<B>Brock School</B> in the West end has installed an outdoor classroom
and working garden on a portion of its roof, with wooden planters,
decking, composters, and coldframes funded and built by the children,
parents, and teachers; <B>Homes First</B> has provided each of the 75
tenants at the Mary Lambert-Swale housing project with a 5 x 5 foot
roofgarden plot - and the tomatoes and the broccoli are thriving! The
next time you walk through your city, look up towards the rooftops - I
think you will be surprised at hints of green and growing things you can
see!

<H2>The Site and The Plan</H2>


<P><BR>To be sustainable, an agricultural endeavour must conform to the environment of which it is a part.  This environment is typically seen as being ecological in scope, but it also has social and economic dimensions.  The site of an agricultural intervention must dictate the nature of that intervention, and my rooftop garden is no exception in this regard.  This chapter describes the site where the rooftop garden was constructed, and outlines the cultivation plan I developed based on the opportunities it presented.</P>


<H2>The Site</H2>

	
<P>Field to Table is a non-profit organisation.  The Good Food Box programme is one of its key initiatives.  There are over 1,500 people in the programme who purchase a box of food at the beginning of the month, and receive fresh produce three weeks later when their funds are typically running low.   There is a number of different boxes to cater to the needs of city residents, including the Good Food Box, the Organic Box, the Mom-to-Be Box, and a Caribbean Box.
</P>	

<P>Field to Table also operates the Focus on Food programme.  Job skills, nutrition, and gardening are all part of the programme which is designed to provide women on social assistance with the skills they need to get back into the workforce.
</P>	

<P>Both of these programmes are related to food security, and there is considerable potential to integrate the rooftop garden with these initiatives.  The garden is compatible with the food-focus of the organisation, and the manager and staff are very supportive of my efforts there.
</P>	

<P>Field to Table operates out of a warehouse in downtown Toronto, at 200 Eastern Ave.  The building has a number of useful peculiarities that I was able to exploit for the garden project.  It also presented a few problems.  Both sets of issues are discussed below.  (I should note here that market gardening is a permitted land use in the industrial zones I1 to I3 and IC in Toronto (City of Toronto, 1995).  The warehouse is in zone I3.)</P>



<B>Figure 2.1: The warehouse roof -- shown from above (top) and from the west (bottom).</B>


<H2>Advantages</H2>


<H3>Snow load</H3>
	

<P>There are two types of roof loading: dead load and live load.  Dead load refers to the weight of the roof structure itself and any permanent fixtures situated on the roof.  To accommodate weights beyond the dead load (from snow, rain water, or people, for example) buildings are designed with a live loading capacity.  The minimum live load permitted by the Toronto Building Code is 30 pounds per square foot (p.s.f.) for flat roofs (RGRG 1993).  This is meant to bear the weight of snow in the winter, but can also be used by rooftop gardeners during the summer.
</P>	

<P>Snow will drift against walls, and building codes therefore require designers to accommodate extra loading on roofs that abut a wall.  The Field to Table building has two such areas.  Both the loading dock and the office sections of the warehouse are lower than the main warehouse, and hence have high live load capacities against the main warehouse wall (see Figure 2.1).  For the office rooftop (where the garden was built) the live load ranges from 120 pounds per square foot (p.s.f.) at the wall to 54 p.s.f. at mid-span, and down to 32 p.s.f. at the southern extremity.  The loading dock has a similar pattern of loading capacity.  The live loads were used to calculate the maximum depth of soil the roof can support, and were used to determine the appropriate size and distribution of the garden's planters (discussed under The Plan, below).</P>



<H3>Water supply</H3>
	

<P>I was fortunate to have access to the municipal water supply if it proved necessary.  I connected a hose to a faucet in the warehouse, and ran it up to the work area (Photo 2.2), where it could be taken out the window to the garden.  Two 50' lengths of hose proved adequate for this purpose.  A back-flow device was affixed to the faucet to avoid pressure-related plumbing problems when the elevated hose was turned off.</P>



<H3>Light and wind</H3>
	

<P>The garden was built at the base of a south-facing wall, and there are no overhanging trees or tall buildings in the area, so it enjoys maximum exposure to sunlight.  I decided not to use the loading dock roof because it faces east and therefore has the double disadvantage of being shaded all morning, and being exposed to the hot afternoon sun.
</P>	

<P>Wind is generally more of an issue on a rooftop than at ground level due to increased exposure.  There is a stand of trees to the west of the warehouse, an access ramp to the Don Valley Parkway to the north, and the garden itself sits at the base of a south-facing wall.  These features combine to limit the exposure of the garden to the drying and sometimes mechanically damaging effects of wind.</P>


<H2>Limitations</H2>

<H3>Water</H3>
	

<P>When I first undertook this project, it was my hope to design an irrigation system based on captured run-off from the roof of the main warehouse.  This proved impractical.  The drain for the main warehouse roof is connected directly to the building's plumbing, and the pipes are all internal.  Short of blasting a hole in the wall and redirecting the outlet pipes, there was no means of diverting this water from the storm drain.
</P>	

<P>Collecting the water would have posed another problem as there is no suitable place to store a large vessel.  To provide adequate pressure (approximately 10 pounds per square inch) in the drip irrigation system I envisioned, a gravity-fed hose would need a supply tank 23 feet higher than the hose outlets.  The maximum drop I could provide at the site is 10 feet (the distance from the garden rooftop to the main warehouse rooftop).  This would only provide 5 p.s.i., and would therefore be inadequate for drip irrigation.  The second problem would be getting water into this container if it were situated on same roof from which the water would be collected.  Finally, the upper roof is the weakest of the three roof surfaces.  A 55 gallon drum filled with water weighs approximately 460 lb.  The weight of this tank would have to be distributed evenly over a fourteen square-foot area to reach the 32 p.s.f. live-load limit of the rooftop, and a number of these tanks would be needed to adequately supply the garden.  These factors combined to make the irrigation system  and water collection impractical.</P>



<H3>Accessibility</H3>


<P>	The office roof is reached through a window in the main warehouse.  There is a section of floor about 15' above the main warehouse floor space.  This area is above the doorway that leads to the building's basement (Photo 2.2).  It was there that I carried out my work making soil blocks and seeding.  There is a bank of windows adjacent to this area, and it is there that I set up the capillary mats and tables for the seedlings (the windows face south).  One of these windows opens, and provides access to the garden area.
</P>	

<P>The main problem with this arrangement is that it is awkward getting materials (e.g. blocking mix components and garden bed lumber) from the warehouse floor to the work area.  I was fortunate to have access to a hand-operated lift for this purpose (also shown in Photo 2.2).  It would have been quite difficult to manage the project without this device.</P>



<H3>Indoor lighting</H3>
	

<P>To provide seedlings with sufficient light, two tables were set up in front of the south-facing windows of the work area.  These windows were a great advantage because seedlings could be kept in the work area, and hardened-off   easily because of their proximity to the garden area.  It was unfortunate however, that only a small portion of this window space is accessible, and the main watering table became very crowded in the early season.  A grow room was constructed in the warehouse basement for the Focus on Food programme.  Part of this space will be needed for the production of seedlings for the rooftop in future.  (Spring is the only time this space will be needed, as seedlings for the main crop, tomatoes, eggplants, flowers, and herbs are all competing for space at that time.)</P>


<H2>The Plan</H2>

	

<P>Most of my time in January and February of 1996 was consumed by planning.  It was necessary to choose crops, outline planting schedules, and design the garden's containers.  Basically, I needed to know what to grow, what to grow it in, and how to grow it.  The challenge was compounded by the discovery that the roof is much weaker than I had originally been told, and this necessitated a radical change in the site plan shortly after it had been completed.  I would thus recommend that all engineering consultations be completed (if possible) before any effort is expended on planning.</P>


<H2>Soil</H2>
	

<P>Field to Table moved to the Eastern Avenue site in late June, 1995.  One of the staff members was interested in rooftop gardening, and attempted to construct a garden on the site now occupied by my efforts.  The late start prevented much success, but the legacy he left behind (i.e. the soil), was fundamental to the success of this project.
</P>	

<P>The soil used for the garden beds is municipal compost donated by the city.  I expected it to have fairly high nutrient concentrations, but an early soil test revealed that it was deficient in both nitrogen and potassium.  These deficiencies were remedied with the addition of kelp meal (for potassium and micro-nutrients), and blood meal (for nitrogen).
</P>	

<P>It would have been difficult for me to complete this project in one growing season if the compost were not already on the roof.  The city's compost operation does not begin spring operations until May, and it would have taken a few weeks (if not longer, considering the heavy rain this spring) to move the compost and fill the growing beds.  This would have delayed the initial plantings considerably.</P>



<H2>Garden structures</H2>
	

<P>One needs some form of container to hold the soil for a rooftop garden.  Almost anything can serve -- plastic buckets are a common sight in many neighbourhoods, as are bushel baskets, but I've also seen old bathtubs, buckets, and garbage bags performing the duty.
</P>	

<P>The reasons for containing the soil go beyond the obvious need to prevent it from washing away.  It is vital that the roof's drainage system is not compromised, and efforts must be undertaken to ensure that the drains do not become clogged with garden soil, compost, mulch, &c.</P>


<H3>Beds and containers</H3>
	

<P>My search for appropriate containers provided me with a great opportunity to meet one of my project objectives: viz. the use of neglected urban resources.  All of the garden containers were constructed from, if you will excuse the indelicate term, garbage.
</P>	

<P>The main cropping area contains 15 beds, each 4' by 6' and 8" deep (Figure 2.2).   The lumber for these beds was salvaged from discarded packing skids (Figure 2.3) at the Field to Table warehouse.</P>


<B>Figure 2.2: The garden.

	</B>

<P>I encountered my first hurdle when trying to separate the packing skid lumber by removing the nails in the skid.  This is almost impossible because the nails often have barbs to prevent them from being pulled.  I decided instead to cut the sides off the skid, and then use the leverage provided by the loosened planks to pry the planks free from the central support.  This was slow work, even with the use of a power saw for the cutting, because the prying operation is manual, and fairly difficult.</P>




<B>Figure 2.4: An assembled side for a garden bed.</B>

	

<P>This procedure produced planks of varying widths (usually 3" and 5"), and approximately three feet in length.  To form the long sides of the garden beds, four planks were screwed together, producing a side 6' long and approximately 8-10" wide.  To form the ends, the remaining 3' planks were cut down to 2' lengths.  Four of these were attached, yielding a side 4' long and 8-10" wide.  In each case, the four planks were screwed to a 1' length of wood placed in the centre of each side (Figure 2.4).
</P>	

<P>Once the sides were assembled, they were moved to the work area above the warehouse floor.  The beds were assembled outdoors in the garden area by screwing the sides to blocks placed in the beds' corners (Photo 2.3).  These blocks were cut from the central supports of the packing skids from which the planks were separated.
</P>	

<P>This only provided sides for the garden beds.  To protect the roof membrane from root penetration, some form of bottom is required.  This was provided by placing a layer of waxed cardboard beneath the frame, and a layer of polyethylene plastic sheeting on top of the waxed cardboard (both materials were salvaged from warehouse waste).  According to ECHO (1993), a moisture barrier is not necessary, but Yang (1990) recommends that roots be prevented from reaching a roof's bitumen, as they can penetrate and damage it.
</P>	

<P>To prevent soil from draining out of the frame, straw was placed around its inside perimeter, in the corners, and over any gaps.  A layer of Styrofoam chips was then placed at the bottom of each bed to provide drainage.  These chips were made from broken grape boxes.  Finally, as recommended by Yang (1990), a layer of newspaper four sheets thick was placed on the chips and straw to keep soil from filling the drainage layer.
</P>	

<P>The beds were filled to a depth of three inches with compost donated by the Municipality of Toronto.  I chose this depth because of weight limitations.  Four inches of saturated compost weighed in at 31 p.s.f, slightly higher than the flat roof minimum live load in Toronto.  Although the Field to Table roof has much higher live loads in some areas, I decided to limit my investigation to soils of this depth so that the research would be applicable to any flat roof in the city.  Most gardeners will balk at this depth (I did), but according to ECHO's (1993) experiments in Haiti and St. Petersburg, this is sufficient for many plants, including corn (!), beans, and tomatoes.   This depth also left a few inches of lumber above the soil to contain a layer of mulch.  (The bed building procedure is shown in Photos 2.4-2.8.)
</P>	

<P>A few other containers were collected for some experimental plantings.  Bushel baskets were used to plant squash and cucumbers, and discarded plastic buckets housed a few tomatoes, tomatillos, and eggplants.  Drainage was provided by drilling holes in the bottoms of the buckets (the baskets are leaky enough) and adding a layer of Styrofoam chips, followed by a thin covering of straw.  The buckets and baskets were placed on used pieces of plywood to distribute the wet-container weight over enough area to reach the 30 p.s.f. limit.</P>


<H3>Shade and mulch</H3>
	

<P>I expected to have some trouble with heat during the project, and searched for means of keeping heat-sensitive crops cool (since I planned to grow primarily greens, just about everything is heat-sensitive).  I thought some form of shading would be necessary, as other rooftop gardeners I had spoken with mentioned problems of over-exposure to sunlight.  I considered purchasing sheets of lattice work, but luckily I came across a free alternative: corn crates.  Field to Table orders large quantities of sweet corn, and it is shipped in crates made of thin wooden slats bound with wire.  The sides of these crates can be separated and arranged to yield an easy to use plant shade.  Nine of these open crates will completely cover a 4'x6' garden bed, providing enough shade to keep plants cool and moist during the hotter parts of the day (Photo 2.9).
</P>	

<P>Mulch was provided from three bales of straw that had been left behind from the previous garden effort at the site.  It was to be used in all beds, both to conserve water, and keep the soil cool.</P>



<H2>Cropping plan</H2>
	

<P>One of my goals in this project was to maximise the yield from the garden in an effort to prove it an economical endeavour.  It was therefore necessary to devise a detailed plan to squeeze as much from the earth as possible.</P>
<B>Table 2.1: Garden crop data. </B>


<H3>Crops</H3>
	

<P>The first decision was what to grow.  To help with this, I sifted through a number of gardening books and compiled Table 2.1, which lists time to maturity, spacing, and basic planting instructions for a variety of crops.  It suggested that I concentrate my efforts on salad greens -- they are fast maturing, require little space, and are relatively high-value.  By planting a mesclun-type mix  I could take advantage of the recent popularity of the product and the spatial and temporal efficiencies of the greens.
</P>	

<P>I ordered seeds from The Cook's Garden, a company in Vermont that specialises in salad greens.  I chose non-hybrid varieties, both to allow me to save my own seeds, and to address my concerns about genetic diversity.  Some may question the decision to patronise an American company, but they offer the best service in the salad green market that I was able to find.</P>


<H3>Succession</H3>
	

<P>Once the crop was chosen, the mechanics of cultivation had to be worked out.  I decided to devote 10 beds to the lettuce and greens mix, and the remaining five beds to edible flowers, herbs, and areas for testing the practicality of the 3" soil depth for other vegetables.
</P>	

<P>Most of the greens (lettuce and mustard, primarily) have a maturation period of approximately 50 days, or seven weeks from seed.  I reasoned that I could start the plants in soil blocks (explained below), keep them in the blocks for three weeks, and transplant outside to spend the remaining four weeks in the garden.  A given crop would therefore only require outdoor space for four weeks.  This meant I could plant two beds to salad mix each week (Figure 2.5).  After four weeks, the first pair of beds would be emptied, and could rest fallow for one week before the space was needed by another crop.  In essence, each of the five pairs of beds would go through a five week rotation (four weeks in crop, and one week fallow) before being needed again.
</P>	

<P>I chose not to broadcast all seeds into the beds (this is the usual practice with mesclun) for two reasons.   The first was my effort to minimise the time each bed was occupied -- most of the crops grown from seed would require a full seven weeks outdoors, as opposed to the four weeks needed by transplants.  The second reason was that I was concerned about the growth medium.  The same compost had been used the year previously, but I was told that plants did not do very well in it.  I figured that transplants would have more resilience than sprouts, especially if damping-off fungus was present in the soil.  The transplant seeding schedule is shown in Table 2.2.
</P>



<B>Table 2.2: Transplant seeding schedule.
</B>	

<P>I used Bartholemew's (1981) square foot gardening method for spacing the transplants.  For the lettuces, I bent a wire coat hanger into an 8" square, and used this to mark the location of each transplant.  The other greens were transplanted at 6" spacing.  To mark this out, I took a 12" piece of board, tamped its edge into the soil four times to make a square, and then used the board to make a cross in the middle of the square.  This forms four smaller squares, each 6" apart.  (This sounds like an involved process, but one soon becomes quite proficient at it, and I believe that for small beds it is faster than using a line to mark the rows.)</P>



<H3>Soil blocks</H3>
	

<P>I chose soil blocks for starting seedlings because they have a number of advantages over the traditional use of pots and flats.  According to Coleman (1989), they are ideal because they avoid completely the transplant shock associated with most other methods of preparing transplants.  Normally, transplant shock slows plant growth for a period while the plant repairs root damage and adjusts to its new environment.  Soil blocks allow uninterrupted growth after transplanting because there is no root disturbance -- this is how I planned to grow a seven week crop in seven weeks with only four weeks spent outside.
</P>	

<P>Soil blocks are made with a block maker, or blocker -- a small form with a spring loaded, manual ejection mechanism (Photo 2.10).  The blocker is pressed into moistened blocking mix, and the blocks are ejected onto a surface for planting.  Each block is a cube of soil (2" per side with my blocker), and has a small indentation on the top for holding a seed.  Only one seed is planted per block, and the seed is not covered.  According to Coleman (1989) germination is excellent, as the seeds have access to all the moisture and oxygen they require.
</P>	

<P>My blocking mix recipe was based on the one given by Coleman.  It contains:</P>
		

<UL>
			<LI>10 l brown peat
			<LI>10 l black peat
			<LI>10 l sand or vermiculite
			<LI>10 l potting soil
			<LI>125 ml each of blood meal and bone meal
			<LI>250 ml kelp meal
			<LI>60 ml lime
</UL>


<P>To make the mix, the two peats are passed through a 1/4" screen and then mixed with the lime to balance their acidity.  Sand or vermiculite and the fertilisers are then added and mixed, followed by screened potting soil.  The peat provides the fibre necessary for the initial stability of each block (the blocks become very durable once penetrated by plant roots).  The sand or vermiculite encourages drainage in the block, and the fertilisers provide all of the nutrients required by the seedlings, and ensure healthy, sturdy transplants.  Coleman uses a soil and compost mix as the last component, but I had no source of compost or soil when the first blocking was required, and chose potting soil as a reasonable substitute.  Its purpose is to provide more nutrients and bulk to the blocking mix.  One part water is added to three parts blocking mix to produce the mortar-like consistency required by the blocker.
</P>




<B>Figure 2.5: Typical plantings.</B>	

<P>Watering the seeded blocks can be difficult, as they are prone to erosion before the plant's roots develop.  To avoid this problem, I purchased a pair of capillary mats (Photo 2.10).  These mats are designed to wick water from a reservoir, and spread it evenly over their surface.  Blocks resting on the mat will draw as much water as they can hold through similar capillary action.  The mats would take care of all transplant watering.</P>



<H2>Marketing</H2>
	

<P>I decided to concentrate my marketing efforts on local health food stores and restaurants.  To assist in this process, I produced a small pamphlet, outlining the idea behind the garden and the produce I expected to harvest (Figure 2.6), and I registered the garden as a business with the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations.  I ruled-out the possibility of selling at a farmers' market, as I did not expect to have enough produce to attract many customers.  According to Lee (1993), farmers' market sellers must offer a number of different produce items if they expect to be successful, and my small garden could clearly not meet this criterion.  I hoped instead to find a small, environmentally conscious restaurant or store proprietor interested in supporting urban agriculture.</P>



<H2>Processing</H2>
	

<P>The Ontario Farm Products Grades and Sales Act (1980) has no mention of mesclun, and hence it is not regulated with regard to product grades.  Packaging, however must conform to certain standards.  It must identify the grower, the product if the package is not clear, the weight, and the price.  I decided to follow the example of other growers and package the produce loose in boxes for restaurant sales, or in individual zip-closure bags for retail.
</P>	

<P>Health Canada regulations regarding standards for cleanliness and packaging are concerned primarily with the cleanliness of processed foods, dairy products, and meat products, and the use of food-grade plastics for packaging (Government of Canada, 1994).  My impression from reading the overview of the standards is that food would have to be fairly unclean to warrant a complaint.  In any event, I planned to sterilise all containers used for washing the salad mix with a weak bleach solution, and to package the mix in food-grade zip-closure bags.  The mix would be washed with water from the municipal supply.  These precautions would ensure that the packaged salad mix fell within the regulations.
</P>	

<P>Field to Table has a small institutional-type kitchen on the premises for catering and training.  I planned to use this for washing and packaging the greens.

<H2>Observations</H2>

<P><BR>Even the best laid plans can fail to produce their expected results.  This is particularly true of agriculture, which is so dependent on external factors.  One learns from ones mistakes however, and trial and error is the only way to integrate an agricultural enterprise into a local environment.  I am pleased with my successes on the rooftop, but there are a few things I would do differently in the future.  My observations and thoughts concerning the growing season are recorded in this chapter.</P>



<H2>Cropping Plan</H2>



<P>	The cropping plan needed some modification during the course of the project.  This was to be expected, given my own inexperience with both the site and some of the crops.  Unfortunately, change was not always easy, as I was more-or-less locked into a four week cycle, and altering the contents of the garden beds was impractical during the growing season.
</P>	

<P>My weekly planting schedule ran as follows.  On Monday, a new set of transplants was planted.  Soil blocks seeded the previous Wednesday were moved to the watering table against the windows,  and the blocks already on this table were moved to flats to begin their hardening-off procedure.  Tuesday was used for general maintenance and making blocking mix if necessary.  On Wednesday, a new set of blocks was made and sown on the seed starting table.  Thursday was another general maintenance day.  On Friday, greens were harvested and washed.  If rain was likely the following Monday, transplants were also planted.  If not, the seedlings were left outside for the weekend to finish hardening-off.  If it did not rain on Friday or during the weekend, Saturday and Sunday trips to the warehouse were necessary to ensure that the hardening seedlings did not dry-out.  (The soil blocks are fairly good at retaining moisture, and can go a day without water, but I took the precaution of checking on them regardless.)  The total amount of time required for this work was between ten and twelve hours per week.</P>



<H2>Soil</H2>


<P>	I was pleased to observe that most of the crops chosen did quite well in the 3" of soil they were provided (a more detailed discussion is found under Crops, below).  As crops were removed, nutrients were replenished by the addition of a few handfuls of blood meal and kelp meal.  There were no obvious nutrient deficiencies manifested in the appearance of the plants.
</P>	

<P>Crusting was a small problem, and was confined to those beds lacking mulch.  It was problematic because the hard surface prevented the quick absorption of water and encouraged run-off.  It was easy to remedy this with cultivation when the plants were widely spaced, but where seeds had been broadcast, this proved difficult.
</P>	

<P>Organic matter in the soil gradually increased when crops were harvested and roots were left behind.  It is unfortunate however that there were no worms to take advantage of this (although sow bugs, another decomposer, became quite plentiful).  I considered inoculating the beds with a few red worms (the type of worm used in composting) but decided against it.  I was worried that they would cause problems if the soil were moved indoors in the fall, or they would freeze to death in the 3" beds if left outside.  In any event, the soil texture did improve gradually over the course of the season (both from the organic matter, and the peat moss supplied by the soil blocks).</P>



<H2>Beds and containers</H2>
	

<P>The garden beds held up quite well, and displayed no obvious signs of decay or damage.  I had considered using Jeavons's (1991) five foot width for the beds, but was glad I went with four feet, as I was just barely able to access the centre of each bed for planting and cultivating.
</P>	

<P>One factor I neglected to consider when planning to fill the garden beds was spring rain.  The compost on the roof was quite difficult to move and fairly uncooperative in general when wet.  I had to work very rapidly during the few dry, sunny periods in order to get the beds filled in time for planting.  This was not a great problem, but could have considerably delayed operations if I had planned an extensive spring planting.
</P>	

<P>The soil barrier in each bed was compromised after the first heavy rain.  I thought at first that the compost had simply settled, but some digging revealed that the newspaper had disintegrated.  I would therefore advise that another medium be used for this purpose.  I experienced no drainage problems, in spite of this occurrence, so perhaps the soil barrier is unnecessary for this type of container.</P>



<H2>Shade and mulch</H2>
	

<P>June, 1996 was an abnormally wet and cool month, so I had little need of either shade or mulch.  The shading crates did prove useful for protecting recent transplants (especially claytonia -- see below).  I found that they were surprisingly good at retaining moisture in the beds, and used them on occasion to protect broadcast seeds from desiccation on sunny days.
</P>	

<P>I had no idea if, or when, the weather would warm, so I applied straw mulch to the beds as a precaution.  The mulch was very effective at retaining moisture.  Mulched beds would take three or four days to dry out, whereas unmulched sections would be dry in one or two days.  The mulch also had a beneficial effect on soil texture: it prevented the crusting common to unmulched areas.  Finally, the mulch kept the soil beneath it noticeably cooler than exposed soil.
</P>	


<P>There was one problem with the mulch, and that was weeds.  It may have been that weeds simply grew better in the cool, moist environment it provided, but I think a significant number of weed seeds came in with it.  Lamb's quarters and grasses were the main invaders.  The lamb's quarters were fairly easy to keep ahead of, but the grass was always difficult to completely remove.</P>


<H2>Crops</H2>
	

<P>Most of the crops grew well in the 3" beds.  The cool, wet weather during the project summer was beneficial to the growth of many of the salad greens.  Outlined below are some observations on the suitability of cultivars, and cultural considerations for a few special crops.</P>



<H3>Lettuce</H3>
	

<P>There was a marked difference in the yields from different types of lettuce.  The red lettuce varieties were often twice the size of the green varieties found in the same bed.  I found the varieties Lollo Biondo, and Curly Oakleaf particularly disappointing, and Red Sails, Red Salad Bowl, Valeria, and Rossa d'Amerique to be very fast growers.  I speculate that the red pigments helped these greens cope better with the low light levels during the cloudy season.
</P>	

<P>Some of the lettuce varieties are very attractive.  Rossa d'Amerique, Rossa di Trento, and Valeria are beautiful varieties, and look very good in the salad mix.  Their quick growth, appearance, and utility as cut-and-come-again greens  makes them ideal candidates for mesclun cultivation.</P>



<H3>Mustards</H3>
	

<P>All varieties of mustard (tatsoi, Osaka Purple, and mizuna) bolted  the week of June 17th, regardless of age.  The last early season crop of these was planted May 17th, and was harvested before it bolted.  Fortunately, mustard flowers and seed pods are edible and add an interesting effect to the salad mix, so some of the bolted mustards were left in the beds to provide these.
</P>	

<P>Mizuna and tatsoi were the most interesting components of the salad mix, judging by the comments I received.  Mizuna has large, thin, and deeply toothed leaves which look very attractive in the mix.  Tatsoi has a thick, spoon shaped leaf with prominent white stem.  Both of these varieties have a mild flavour, and can therefore be significant contributions to the mix.  Osaka Purple mustard, by contrast, is quite pungent and must be used sparingly.  Its leaves also tend to get quite large if it is not harvested at an early stage.
</P>	

<P>All of the mustards grew very well in the cool spring.  Much better than the lettuce, in fact.  They appear to be good greens for early spring and late fall mesclun mixes.</P>



<H3>Other greens</H3>



<B>Figure 3.1: New Zealand spinach seeds.</B>
	

<P>New Zealand spinach and malabar spinach were very disappointing.  I was depending on these crops for hot-season greens (they are alternatives to the mustards which will not grow well at that time).  They are both difficult to germinate and slow growing.  It took a number of months before I finally discovered how to germinate the seeds of New Zealand spinach.  The seeds are large, and I read that they require scarification  and soaking before planting.  This I did, and I put them in plastic bags to pre-germinate.  After a month no sprouts had emerged, so I started another batch.  Another month passed with still no results.  After dissecting some seeds, I found that they are actually berries, with the seeds confined to the flat end (Figure 3.1).  I cut the tops off of a number of these berries, and they germinated fairly quickly after planting in soil blocks.  Unfortunately, I had lost two months by this time, and the crop did not develop in time to meet its intended need.
</P>	

<P>Claytonia, also called miner's lettuce, is a very attractive addition to the salad mix.  It requires more coddling than the other greens, however, and my ignorance of this caused some early losses.  It seemed very sensitive to increased exposure to light, and suffered very bad leaf-burn if hardened-off for only one week with the lettuces and mustards.  I found that the plants did much better if partially shaded for a week or two after transplanting.  They suffered less burn, and established themselves and matured more quickly than those exposed to full sun from the start.
</P>	

<P>Mache and dandelion both suffered from slow germination.  They came up about a week behind lettuce and mustard planted at the same time, and were too small to transplant when the other greens were ready.  This could be remedied by seeding mache and dandelion a week earlier than the other greens, or by adopting the broadcast-sowing discussed below.  I will not bother with mache in the future, except perhaps in the early spring.  Dandelions, however deserve more attention because they are able to grow in the hot season, unlike most of the other salad-mix greens.  I think there may have been a problem with my seed stock, as germination rates for the dandelion were often below 50%.
</P>	

<P>Arugula and cress grew very well in the early season but suffered as the temperature rose.  Cress was particularly disappointing, and the later crops failed entirely.  Arugula was somewhat more dependable, and seemed to benefit from partial shading during the hotter days.
</P>	

<P>Purslane is a very successful hot-season green.  It tolerated both the heat and the shallow soil.  I found it reached maturity faster than the seven weeks cited in Forsyth & Mohr (1992), and recommend its cultivation for mesclun.  I also found that it stored quite well, again in contrast to Forsyth & Mohr.  Its succulent leaves are quite delicate, however, and must be washed and dried separately from the other greens.
</P>	

<P>Finally, we come to the star failure of this experiment, radicchio.  Most of the crop bolted by the end of June, and the rest followed by mid-July.  This is not likely due to heat or water stress, as June was fairly cool this year, and the crop was well mulched.  I think, rather, that the crop had trouble with the 3" soil depth, and the plants sent up seed stalks when their roots became restricted.  More experimentation would certainly be required, but I do not recommend this crop for shallow bed cultivation.</P>



<H3>Other crops</H3>
	


<P>Flowers proved to be a very inefficient use of space, being slow to mature and requiring wide spacing.  They should have been started indoors, rather than direct seeded, but space limitations prevented this.  I would recommend that others with similar space restrictions confine their efforts to one or two varieties that do not require much space and that serve other purposes.  Arugula and mustard greens, for example, produce prolific edible flowers if left to run to seed.  They also produce useful greens prior to bolting.  Shungiku, borage, and nasturtiums also produce useful young greens and edible flowers.  This combination of greens and flowers will produce a better use of space than the cultivation of crops like calendula and agastache that do not yield edible greens.
</P>	


<P>No problems were observed with the cultivation of green beans in the 3" beds.  I chose a variety of filet beans, which are meant to be harvested when quite small.  Unfortunately, the small space allotted to them was far below that needed to produce a worthwhile yield, and I do not recommend their cultivation in gardens where space is precious.
</P>	


<P>Kohlrabi was another successful crop, although it, like the green beans, requires too much space to produce a decent return in a rooftop garden.  It is usually planted at a 4" spacing, but since this would have been very difficult to manage with transplants, I took Coleman's (1989) advice and tried starting it in a multi-plant block.  A multi-plant block is a normal soil block which has been planted with more than one seed.  In the case of onions, Coleman puts four seeds in each block, and sets-out the blocks at 1' spacing.  This gives a final spacing of four onions per square foot, the same as would result from planting individual onions 4" apart in rows 1' apart.   As the onions grow, they push their neighbours away and produce normal bulbs.  I reasoned that kohlrabi should do the same thing, and indeed it grew quite well using this method.
 </P>	

<P>Okra, cucumbers, and tomatoes did not do very well in the shallow beds (the tomatoes in buckets were fine).  The plants seemed healthy, but they were stunted and slow growing.  I do not recommend the cultivation of okra where space is at a premium, and would confine plantings of cucumbers and tomatoes to deep containers.</P>



<H2>Succession</H2>
	

<P>The late spring delayed outdoor planting until May 3rd (I had expected to put my first transplants in the ground on April 15th).  Cold weather was only part of the problem, as the soil was often too wet for transplanting.  (Indeed, the problem of transplanting in wet soil plagued me throughout June as it rained for 20 of the first 24 days of the month.)  I also lost the fallow week that had been a part of the cropping plan as I waited for the greens in the first pair of beds to reach a size large enough for harvesting.
</P>	


<P>The first harvest of greens was on June 3.  Approximately 1/3 of a bed-pair was harvested, yielding 316g of salad mix.  On June 6, a pair of beds was harvested, and this yielded 620g of mix.  These yields were far below what I had expected.  According to Jeavons (1991), leaf lettuces should yield between 0.4 and 1.7 lb. per plant.  With 54 heads per lettuce bed, I expected at least 20 lb. (approximately 10 kg) of mix per week.  The plants were clearly not reaching expected size in the seven weeks they had been allotted for growth.  This may be attributed primarily to the cold, cloudy spring, which undoubtedly had an effect on plant maturity (later greens were somewhat larger).  Also, the salad mix contains only leaves, and will consequently weigh less than lettuces, which include stems and part of the root.  In any event, these early harvests suggested that a radical change was need to the cropping plan, if any acceptable yields were to be obtained.</P>

<P>	The first change involved planting distances (Photos 3.1 and 3.2).  The lettuce plants were initially set-out at 8" spacing, and there was a lot of empty space in the bed come harvest time.  I decided that I could double my yields by doubling the planting density.  I tried a number of routes to this end.  The first option was to produce twice as many transplants each week, and plant them at 4" spacing.  This was unworkable given the limited space I had for starting transplants, and because transplanting blocks closer than 6" is difficult.  A second option was to harvest a lettuce crop as cut-and-come-again rather than digging up the whole bed and re-planting.  To increase yields, I simply planted new seedlings between the harvested rows with the old stumps in place (Photo 3.4).  I could then get a second and perhaps third cutting from the first set of lettuce plants and also get cuttings from the new set.  This proved to be a very satisfactory arrangement, and increased yields once it was adopted (results appeared on June 17th: q.v. Table 3.1).  The resulting spacing was 6" between each plant.  This eliminated unused space in the beds while still providing each plant with enough room to grow.
</P>	


<P>Yields could also have been increased by broadcast sowing the beds, and I seriously entertained this prospect for some time.  It was unworkable with the cropping cycle I had planned, however.  Broadcasting would save the labour and materials associated with starting transplants and hardening-off, and would eliminate wasted space by producing denser stands of greens.  Yields could be higher because the lettuces and greens formerly grown in two beds could be grown in one.  A pair of beds could still be harvested and planted each week, effectively doubling the yield possible with my initial plan.  This, at least, was what I thought until I tried it.  Perhaps I lacked the necessary skill at broadcasting mixed seeds, but I found the stand of plants produced to be very uneven and full of gaps.  Clearly, this method requires both practice, and much more seed than I anticipated to result in a full stand.
</P>	


<P>There are a few other disadvantages of broadcasting mixed seed into the shallow beds.  The first is that care must be taken to ensure that the seed-bed remains moist throughout the period required for germination and seedling establishment -- this may require two waterings a day on dry, windy days.  The second problem is that each pair of beds would require seven weeks to reach maturity rather than four.  (Using fourteen beds for the rotation would solve this, and could be done given the current number of planters if fewer planters were devoted to flowers and vegetables.)  A third problem is that applying mulch and weeding would be difficult.  Mulch would be unnecessary once the soil surface was covered -- indeed, the leaves will form their own "living mulch." Potential weed problems was one of the reasons I chose to avoid this method at the start.  The cultivator must be familiar with the greens and local weeds, otherwise weeding could become a slow and difficult task.  My brief experience tells me that broadcasting is not the best method of sowing mesclun.  The difficulties outlined above, and the fact that one cannot easily harvest a single crop if necessary (arugula or lettuce, for example) make separate plantings the most appropriate technique to my mind.</P>



<P>	There are a few other changes that were made to the initial cropping plan.  Excellent germination rates meant I needed fewer soil blocks than I originally called for: four blocks less were seeded for each plant each week in Table 2.2 (e.g. Block 8 contained 32 Lolla Rossa lettuces, 32 Salad Bowl lettuces, 20 claytonia, and 20 dandelions).  I also omitted kohlrabi, mache, and dandelion from later blockings, for the reasons outlined under Crops.</P>



<H2>Soil blocks</H2>
	

<P>Soil block making (blocking) is a fairly straight forward task.  I used a 500g yoghurt container to scoop the dry blocking mix into a recycling box.  For every three scoops of mix, I added one scoop of water, and stirred thoroughly.  The block maker was then pressed into the moist mix, any excess was scraped from the bottom, and the blocks were ejected directly onto the capillary watering mats.
</P>	


<P>I used tweezers to plant the seeds, one per block.  It took about 40 minutes to make and seed 120 blocks, working at a leisurely pace.  This required about 30 scoops of mix, so each 500 ml scoop yields approximately 4 blocks.
</P>	

<P>The blocking  mix ingredients changed early in the project.  I initially used sand for drainage, but soon discovered that carrying a 66 lb. bag of sand on my bicycle was not at all enjoyable.  I switched to vermiculite, which is far lighter, and found it to be an acceptable substitute.  Coleman (1989) however, warns that vermiculite can be subject to compacting when blocks are being pressed-out.  Perhaps this is more of a problem with the large floor model blockers, because I did not notice any problems with my hand-operated unit.
</P>	

<P>Although I was quite impressed with soil blocks in general, there were a few problems associated with their use.  At 2" per side, the blocks require considerably more space per seedling than traditional flats or cell packs.  This proved to be a problem at this site because the limited amount of window space for the seedlings.  Another difficulty, and this is true for all methods of starting transplants, was the time and attention required for hardening-off the seedlings.  They require daily attention during the early phase of this process, and I occasionally found it difficult to keep myself busy while waiting for two or three hours of hardening to pass.  It was also somewhat awkward transplanting claytonia, mache, and mustards at the 6" spacing they require.  The two inch blocks are simply too large to make this a smooth operation.  Finally, I have concerns about the use of peat and vermiculite in the blocking mix.  Peat is a non-renewable resource and vermiculite requires a considerable energy investment in its production.  It is necessary to find alternatives to these products -- leaf mould and sand are two options -- if blocking is to become a sustainable means of producing transplants.
</P>	

<P>On the plus side, the blocks did provide a great deal of flexibility with scheduling transplanting.  Because there is no root disturbance, the blocks can be planted in the blazing heat of mid-afternoon, with no ill effects.   They also conserve garden space outdoors while the plants are starting in the blocks.
</P>	

<P>I am still of two minds regarding the use of soil blocks for the main greens crop.  (I will definitely continue to use them for herbs, flowers, tomatoes, and other transplanted vegetables.)  The convenience of broadcasting is attractive (i.e. there is no block making or hardening-off required), but given the problems weeding and mulching broadcast beds and the space restrictions at this site, the use of blocks is, I think, the better method.</P>



<H2>Marketing</H2>
	

<P>Taking Lee's (1993) suggestion, I delayed any intensive marketing efforts until I had an example of my produce to display.   After the first harvest, I realised that there was no way I would be able to meet the demands of even a modest restaurant or store.  Fortunately, when the director of Field to Table saw the salad mix, she said she would take whatever I could produce, hoping to incorporate it into the Organic Food Box, or use it for catering contracts.
</P>	


<P>I did have an initial concern about this arrangement.  I felt at first that by selling to Field to Table, I was avoiding marketing the product in "the real world."  But upon consideration, I realised that Field to Table is as real world as any customer, and has the same demands for quality and price as any other.  I was fortunate, however, that their needs are very flexible, and they would not be left short if I was unable to provide a harvest on a given week.
</P>	

<P>The more I considered the arrangement with Field to Table, the more sense it began to make.  Integrating rooftop production and the business beneath the roof seems the only way to take advantage of the benefits rooftop agriculture provides.  I often found that I only need to do 10 or 20 minutes of work at the warehouse on some days, but still had to make a 40 minute trip to do it.  This wasted time could be avoided easily if the roof space were cultivated by someone already at the site.
</P>	

<P>A second buyer for the rooftop produce was found in early July.  Juice for Life, a local food bar, became a regular customer purchasing lettuce and edible flowers to extend their own salad mix.  I received calls from a few other restaurants interested in my produce but I did not have the volume to meet their needs as well.  If Field to Table continues to use and expand the site and engages local restaurants in the crop planning, the garden could prove fairly lucrative.</P>



<H2>Processing</H2>
	


<P>The first two harvests (June 3 and June 6) were used to test different types of packaging and the shelf-life of the product.  I chose zip-closure plastic bags, following the lead of other mesclun sellers.  I tried two types of bag, one of standard plastic, and a second, designed specifically for vegetables, with small perforations in the plastic to allow for moisture exchange.  Plain plastic proved far superior.  The greens lasted in fresh form for over a week, whereas those in the perforated bags began deteriorating after three days -- broadleaf cress was the first to go, and turned yellow quite rapidly (it may therefore be a good plant for testing other packaging methods).
</P>	


<P>Washing and drying the leaves was a time-consuming process, requiring about an hour and a half for a 1.5 kg batch of greens.   The greens were washed in three water baths.  The entire mix was washed in the first two baths, and large handfuls were washed in the final bath so that any remaining weeds, damaged leaves, straw, insects, and dirt could be easily spotted and removed (most of these contaminants were gone at this stage, but a few blades of grass and straw usually appeared here).
</P>	


<P>I looked into purchasing a hand-operated industrial-size salad spinner, but the $219 price-tag was prohibitive.  Instead I used a mesh bag, salvaged from a shipment of onions (the 50 lb. bags are quite large, and perfect for spin-drying greens).  I found that lettuce and arugula leaves were easily damaged by vigorous spinning, so I adopted a procedure of gently spinning a small quantity of greens, and frequently re-distributing them in the bag to speed the drying process.</P>



<H2>Environment</H2>



<H3>Flora and Fauna</H3>
	


<P>Weeds were a minor problem, and I believe the mulch I used was the most significant vector of contamination.  I was unable to apply the mulch thickly enough to achieve any weed-suppressing action, so it was perhaps more of a problem in this regard than anything.  Weeding was by no means onerous, and only took about 10 or 20 minutes every few days if I stayed ahead of it.
</P>	


<P>I had no idea what to expect in the way of garden fauna.  Would I be invaded by pests?  Would there be any bees for pollination?  Would pigeons eat all my seedlings?  These questions weighed heavily on me as the season began.
</P>	


<P>I am happy to report that there were almost no pest problems at the site.  The growing medium was almost free of pests (I found only three cut worms).  Most importantly, there was no damage from flea beetles.  Brassicas (a family which includes my crops of mustards, arugula, Chinese cabbage, and kohlrabi) are usually plagued by these pests.  The mizuna (a mustard) I grew at home was punctured with thousands of holes from these beetles, and my rooftop mizuna would have been unusable if subjected to the same invasion.   There are either few flea beetles in the area (unlikely, given the wild overgrown properties nearby), or they were simply unable to find my rooftop greens.  In any event, their absence was a blessing.
</P>	


<P>A number of beneficial insects were found in the garden, including numerous species of spiders, wasps, bees, and flies as well as ladybird beetles and their larvae.  These no doubt played an important role in keeping aphids and the larvae of butterflies and moths in check.  A few of these pests were spotted, but they did not reach problematic levels of population.</P>



<H3>Temperature</H3>



<P>	When planning this project, I expected to get a jump on the growing season because of the heat-effect in town, and the heat collecting potential of the large wall to the north of the garden.  It was a very cool spring, however, and it is hard to assess the benefits of these factors.  The main difficulty lay in the fact that the air was quite cool, and there was significant cloud cover, so there was little opportunity for the walls to absorb much heat and produce any noticeable effects.  In fact, it often felt cooler on the roof than it did at ground level because of the increased exposure to wind.  Later in the season, I did notice a warming effect from the north wall.  Plants and soil against this wall began to wilt and dry out much sooner than those only a few feet away.  The heat-gain thus proved to be more of a problem than an advantage in this situation.
</P>	


<P>I expected to have problems with excessive heat, but these did not materialise.  Temperatures in June were consistently below normal however, so in another season this may be more of an issue.  At the soil level, mulch was very effective at maintaining cooler temperatures than those found in exposed areas of soil.</P>



<H3>Wind</H3>
	


<P>Wind was a small problem at the edges of the garden.  A few early tomato transplants suffered from this exposure, but after being moved to the centre of the garden area their appearance improved dramatically.  Most of the heavy breezes came from the north-east, and I affixed small shelters to the tomato, eggplant, and tomatillo planters to avoid damage to the plants (Photo 3.3).  The garden beds were not subject to much wind because of their low profile and the protection of the south-facing wall.</P>




<H3>Water</H3>
	


<P>Water proved to be less of a problem than I had anticipated.  In fact, the trouble came at the other end of the spectrum, i.e. there was almost too much water.  It rained for 20 of the first 24 days of June, and it was often difficult to get transplants into the sodden soil on schedule.  As the season began to dry out, mulch took on great importance.  Mulched soil, as mentioned above, dried out much more slowly than exposed areas and did not form a surface crust.  Mulching would be vital to any similar enterprise if only for the reason that the gardener can take the occasional day off without worrying about desiccation of the crops.
<P></P>	</P>



<P>I must state here my concern about the use of municipally supplied water for gardens.  As I mentioned earlier, I hoped to harvest rain water for this garden but could not find any practical means of doing so.  I estimate that over the course of a 20 week growing season, about 3,200 gallons of water would be required for a project of this size.   The cost of this water amounts to less than $13.00 (the Toronto rate is $3.95520 per 1000 gallons), but I feel it is an inappropriate use of potable water.  Finding a means of harvesting and storing rain water should be a priority for anyone interested in developing an urban garden.</P>




<H3>Pollution</H3>
	



<P>Early in the project, concerns surfaced about urban air pollution and its potential effect on the safety of the salad mix as a food product.  According to David McLaughlin (1996, personal communication), the Phytotoxicology Investigator Coordinator at the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy, Standards Development Branch, air pollution is unlikely to have any influence on the safety of the crops at this site.
</P>	

<P>McLaughlin's branch has been researching the effects of air quality on plants since 1968.  The data indicate that most of the toxins collected by plants comes from the soil rather than the air.  In the last five or six years, the amount of airborne lead (the primary contaminant of concern) has dropped significantly with the phase-out of lead in gasoline.  McLaughlin states that, unless there is a nearby industry or other point-source of emissions (a hospital incinerator, for example) there is no reason to be concerned about contamination of urban garden produce from the air.
</P>	

<P>Soil is another matter however.  As noted earlier, most of the contaminants found in plants are absorbed from the soil.  Lead based paint from old playground equipment, houses, and fences, and emissions from the burning of leaded gasoline can all accumulate and remain in the ground.  Soil should be tested for contamination before any cultivation is planned.  If lead is found, it does not mean that the site cannot be used, but it does suggest that only certain crops should be grown, or that other steps should be taken to avoid the contamination of produce (e.g. replacing the soil, or planting the garden in containers of imported soil or compost as was done on the project rooftop).   </P>



<H3>Roof loads</H3>
	


<P>Using snow load to support the garden planters poses one big problem: viz. what do you do in the winter?  One option is to remove the planters entirely.  The second possibility is to displace snow from the garden area using a tarp or some other structure designed to prevent snow accumulations in utilised spaces.  Both of these options are being considered.  The former is the least attractive, not only because of the work involved but also because a) it will delay the commencement of cultivation next spring, b) it prevents the development of any sort of stable soil ecosystem in the planters, and c) it prevents the use of perennial herbs and flowers in the garden.  The same quantity of soil did stay on the roof throughout the previous winter, but I am reluctant to leave it there this year in light of what I have learned about the strength of the roof.  The tarping idea may prove difficult to realise, but I hope that the problems can be resolved before November, when a final decision will have to be made.</P>


<H3>
Social aspects</H3>
	


<P>As mentioned earlier, the management and staff at Field to Table were very supportive of my efforts on the rooftop.  Urban food production marries to the organisation's interest in food security.  The potential synergy between the rooftop garden and the other initiatives at the warehouse are particularly interesting.  All of these features made for a comfortable social environment.
</P>	

<P>The volunteers involved with the Good Food Box packing and the many visitors to the warehouse often displayed a keen interest in my activities on the rooftop.  Unfortunately, however, much of the potential educational benefit of the project was lost because many of the visitors were discouraged from viewing the site because of the ladder climb and the crawl through a window.  I did get some media exposure however, with a brief article in the July/August issue of the architectural magazine Azure, a glimpse of the garden in a Field to Table feature on City T.V. on June 17th,, and a feature in the Canadian Gardening episode on rooftop gardening to be aired on The Life Channel in 1997.
</P>	


<P>Improving access to the site is one of the objectives of the management at the warehouse, and would be an excellent way of realising more of the garden's potential benefits.</P>




<H2>Waste Reuse</H2>




<P>	All materials used in the garden were salvaged from the urban waste stream, and I was therefore quite successful in meeting my goal of making a productive use of neglected resources.  The garden beds were salvaged from broken packing skids.  The soil is municipal compost.  The boxes and plastic lining the beds were taken from the refuse produced by Field to Table.  Discarded electrical conduit served as supports for runner beans and tomatoes (Photo 3.5).  Old pickle buckets provided planters for tomatoes, tomatillos, and eggplants.  Bushel baskets grew cucumbers and summer squash.  And shade was provided by corn crates.  The only hardware purchase I made was for screws to hold the garden beds together.</P>



<H2>Costs & Revenues</H2>



<H3>Costs</H3>
	

<P>There are two types of monetary cost associated with the garden.  The first is for one-time expenses (Table 3.2), and includes the tools and materials needed to build the garden infrastructure, and provide for its maintenance (the cost of the items marked with an asterisk is an estimate as they were already at the warehouse).  The second set of costs is ongoing, and includes materials for making soil blocks, and the fertilisers required to maintain nutrient levels in the garden beds (Table 3.3).</P>


<P>	The first of these costs is spread over the life of the garden, and in this case, represents a very small expense for a business start-up.  The second set of costs could almost be eliminated by using broadcast sowing for the main crop (rather than using soil blocks), and by using compost to maintain fertility. </P>

<P></P><BR>
<P>	Labour should be considered when accounting costs, and indeed I believe that it this cost that will determine the economic viability of any rooftop gardening enterprise.  Labour, like monetary cost, can be divided into one-time and ongoing investments.  I estimate that I spent about 85 hours getting the site and work area prepared.  This would have been doubled or tripled if I had had to move the compost to the roof.  As for weekly labour, I estimate that about 10 to 12 hours are required per week.  This includes the time required for watering, weeding, harvesting & washing the salad mix, blocking, transplanting, and general cultivation and maintenance.</P>




<H3>Revenues</H3>




<P>	Revenues from the project were not nearly what I had expected.  As mentioned earlier, lettuce yields were far lower than I anticipated.  There is also a difference between selling wholesale (as I did to Field to Table and Juice for Life), and selling retail.
</P>	
	
<P>	My revenues amounted to approximately $24 per week.  This is from the sale of salad mix at a wholesale price of $4 per pound (occasionally I sold lettuce only, at $3 per pound).  This is a fairly low price, but it is the same as the cost of similar salad mix from California.  Over the course of the 15 weeks I expect the garden to be in production, this will amount to a total revenue of approximately $360.  This is enough to cover the ongoing expenses and most of the start-up cost, but leaves nothing for the labour invested in the project.  This is still a respectable yield, however.  According to Lee (1993), a market garden that yields $1 per square foot is doing well.  Only 12 of my beds (288 square feet) are devoted to salad production, so I am producing $1.25 per square foot.
</P>	

<P>If the salad mix were sold at retail, revenues would be much higher.  Mesclun from a local organic grower retails at $5 per 100 g (about $22.50 per pound).  If I had a retail venue, revenues from the garden could have exceeded $2,000 at this price (the mix is of comparable quality).  This is enough to cover all of the production costs, and provide a fair return on the 10 to 12 hours of labour required each week. 
</P>	


<P>I believe that with a few improvements to the cropping plan I initially devised, these revenues could be increased further.  This could be done by increasing the initial planting density, harvesting lettuces as cut-and-come-again greens, and devoting more space to the salad mix by eliminating some of the more inefficient crops.  There is also the potential to extend the season by a few weeks in both the spring and fall with the use of glass frames on the garden beds.  Outlined below in Tables 3.4 and 3.5 are the crops which I would recommend for future cultivation at this site and those which I would neglect.  The tables are arranged in the following order:  salad greens, edible flowers, herbs, and finally vegetables.  (It is important to note that my recommendations are for this site, elsewhere, and indeed in another season, it may be found that the problems I experienced do not materialise, or that problems I did not encounter are significant.  Advice should always be taken with a grain of salt.)</P>

	<TD>A fast growing and popular salad green.  Requires some shading during hot weather to germinate and grow well.
<TR>
	<TD>Cress
	<TD>I'm still of two minds regarding this green.  It did quite well during cool weather, but was a complete disaster when the temperature rose.  Yields are also fairly small, and it was the first green to decay in the refrigerated salad mix.  It does have a nice flavour however, and perhaps more attention to its cultivation would produce better, more dependable yields.
<TR>
	<TD>Mizuna (Mustard)
	<TD>A strong grower in cool weather.  Produces heavy yields.  Mild flavour allows it to make a significant contribution to the salad mix.  Very beautiful leaves.  Requires protection from flea beetles.  Cool season only.
<TR>
	<TD>Osaka Purple Mustard
	<TD>Stronger flavour than mizuna, but just as vigorous.  Attractive addition to the mix, but must be used sparingly.  Cool season only.
<TR>
	<TD>Tatsoi (Mustard)
	<TD>Thick, spoon-shaped leaves generated much interest at Field to Table.  It is mild and can therefore form a large part of the mix.  Cool season only.
<TR>
	<TD>Lettuce
	<TD>Cool season varieties: Black Seeded Simpson, Red Sails, Rossa d'Amerique, Rossa di Trento, Valeria
<TR>
<TD>Lettuce
	<TD>Hot season varieties: Buttercrunch, Lollo Rossa, Red Riding Hood, Red and Green Salad Bowl, Sierra
<TR>
	<TD>Malabar Spinach
	<TD>Could prove useful, but must be started indoors very early (around 10 weeks before the last frost).  Hot season.
<TR>
	<TD>New Zealand Spinach
	<TD>Same as Malabar spinach.  See figure 3.1 for proper seed treatment.  Hot season.
<TR>
	<TD>Purslane
	<TD>Very dependable hot season green.  Succulent leaves are delicate, and require separate washing and drying.
<TR>
	<TD>Borage
	<TD>Beautiful blue flowers make a nice addition to the salad mix.  Plants produced acceptably in 3" beds, but not as healthy as those grown in deeper soil.  Blooms in June.
<TR>
	<TD>Calendula
	<TD>Greens are not edible, but flower petals are a spectacular addition to the salad mix.  Touch of Red is an attractive variety.  Blooms in July if planted outdoors at last frost (could be started indoors for earlier yield).
<TR>
	<TD>Fennel
	<TD>Flowers a useful addition to the mix if harvested young.  Too slow growing to be of much use as a rooftop garden vegetable.
<TR>
	<TD>Johnny-Jump-Up
	<TD>Viola tricolour. Small plants require very little space and produce many colourful, edible flowers.  Seeds require cold treatment to germinate well.  Flowers in June from direct seeding.

<TR>
	<TD>Shungiku
	<TD>Also known as garland chrysanthemum.  Young greens are edible (they have a strong celery flavour, and should be used sparingly).  Flowers produced in late July from direct seeding.
<TR>
	<TD>Epazote
	<TD>Mexican herb considered indispensable for flavouring beans.  Apparently unavailable in Toronto, this herb deserves some market research.
<TR>
	<TD>Purple Perilla (Shiso)
	<TD>A few plants are all that is needed (four served me well).  The large cumin flavoured leaves make a nice garnish if sliced thinly.  (They must be sliced thinly, as their flavour is quite strong).
<TR>
	<TD>Tomatillo
	<TD>Like epazote, another crop that deserves some market research.  These were the most outstanding plant in the garden.  They grew in 18 l pails, and were extremely vigorous.
<TR>
	<TD>Tomatoes, Eggplant, Cucumbers
	<TD>All of these can be grown in pails, and could make an interesting addition to one's produce.  They would be difficult to incorporate into a salad mix, however, and would most likely be better sold separately.  Cucumbers are an interesting option for niche exploitation, as they can be grown along walls or over the exposed areas of the rooftop (the early season was too cold for my cucumbers to do well this year).

	<TD><B>Comments</B>
<TR>
	<TD>Chard
	<TD>Although the leaves of red-veined Swiss chard are beautiful, the plant did not grow well in 3" beds.  It survived, but was stunted.
<TR>
	<TD>Claytonia
	<TD>Another attractive salad green, claytonia produces very small yields for the amount of space it requires.
<TR>
	<TD>Dandelion
	<TD>Too slow germinating and growing to be useful in the rotation I planned.
<TR>
	<TD>Mache
	<TD>Same problems as dandelion.
<TR>
	<TD>Lettuce
	<TD>The following varieties did not prove acceptably vigorous:  Biondo Lisce, Curly Oakleaf, Lollo Biondo.
<TR>
	<TD>Radicchio
	<TD>The entire crop of radicchio bolted before mid-July.  I speculate that the problem was soil depth, as moisture and temperature until that time were both acceptable.
<TR>
	<TD>Agastache
	<TD>Also called anise-hyssop, this herb produces attractive edible flowers.  It was too slow growing however to be of any use this season.
<TR>
	<TD>Nasturtium
	<TD>Both the flowers and leaves of this plant are edible, but the plants did not grow well in the shallow beds.  They displayed a marked loss of vigour when compared to normal plants.
<TR>
	<TD>Chervil
	<TD>This anise flavoured herb would make a nice addition to a salad mix, but it too failed to grow well in shallow beds.
<TR>
	<TD>Filet Bean
	<TD>These beans grew surprisingly well, but the amount of space required to produce a respectable yield is prohibitive.
<TR>
	<TD>Kohlrabi
	<TD>A vigorous cool season vegetable, kohlrabi grew very well in the shallow beds.  The problem with the crop is spatial; it produces only four stems per square foot, and a large space would be required to grow any useful quantity.
<TR>
	<TD>Okra
	<TD>The rooftop plants did not have the vigour normally associated with okra, but this may have been partially due to the cool spring.  Like the filet bean, it requires too much space to be a useful rooftop garden plant.

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P><BR>When I began this project, I had visions of covering the city's vacant roofs with productive verdure -- standing on the Field to Table rooftop and surveying the surrounding empty roofscape, I felt like the first pioneer to reach the prairie.  I now realise that this is an impractical idea.  There are too many technical barriers to make gardening a convenient and inexpensive undertaking on most roofs.  Rooftop gardening is not without its benefits however, and I believe that it has the potential to serve local needs in many circumstances.  Summarised below are some of the positive and negative aspects (pros and cons) of rooftop cultivation illuminated by this project.</P>



<H2>Pros</H2>



<H3>Location</H3>


<P>	Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of rooftop gardens is their nearness.  An individual or business cultivating their roof space does not have to make the trip to and from an allotment or community garden.  As Hough (1995) observes, community gardens are not often found where they are most needed.  Gardens on community centre roofs, for example, could help address this dislocation to some degree.</P>



<H3>Tenure</H3>



<P>	One of the great insecurities of urban agriculture centres around tenure.  Community gardens, allotments, and temporary garden plots are often displaced by what are viewed as more productive uses of the land.  Lack of tenure has a profound affect on the activities undertaken in an agricultural enterprise.  Many of the improvements sites require are labour intensive, and gardeners will be reluctant to invest the time and energy required if they cannot be assured continued use of the land.  Rooftop gardens are not likely to face competition with other uses of the space, and can therefore offer greater security of tenure than other spaces.</P>



<H3>Security</H3>
	

<P>A rooftop, by mere virtue of its nature, has limited accessibility.  The Field to Table warehouse is in one of the more neglected areas of Toronto, and theft and vandalism would very likely have been a problem at ground level.   Security from animal pests is also an issue.  There is a pair of groundhogs resident in the overgrown area adjacent to the warehouse, and keeping them from devouring my crops would have posed a serious challenge.  Racoons are other common garden marauders found in the city.  I enjoyed freedom from all of these problems because of the garden's elevation.</P>



<H3>Water and light</H3>
	


<P>Gardens built in undeveloped parts of the city may have trouble accessing water.  Roofs, in contrast, are almost always in close proximity to a municipal water supply outlet.  They have the added bonus of providing an opportunity to collect rain water from the roof -- an option which should be explored, as I believe that harvesting rain water is more appropriate than the use of potable water for crop production.
</P>	


<P>Roofs do not fall in the shadow of the buildings they cover, and so often enjoy the best exposure to sunlight on a given lot.  On the Field to Table property there are only a few small spaces not cast in the shadow of either trees or the warehouse for significant portions of the day.  In this respect, the rooftop is the best location for a garden on the property.</P>


<H2>Cons</H2>



<H3>Loading</H3>


<P>	Unfortunately, most roofs in Toronto are not designed to support gardens year-round.  The considerable labour involved with moving soil would have to be repeated in spring and fall each year.  This process would also make it impossible to develop a stable soil ecosystem and difficult to cultivate perennials.  Clearly, for a rooftop garden to be an appropriate use of space, the roof must be able to support the weight of the garden throughout the year.</P>



<H3>Accessibility</H3>
	

<P>Accessibility is another important issue.  As mentioned earlier, I believe that much of the educational and social potential of my garden was lost because it is difficult to get to the site.
</P>	

<P>Safety is another factor: both for the gardeners and for those on the ground.  If a rooftop is to be used as a public space, it must have a 3'6" railing, according to the Toronto Building Code.  This could be an expensive undertaking on a large roof, and might necessarily limit the amount of space available for cultivation.</P>


<H2>The Ideal?</H2>



<P>	Although there are difficulties associated with using rooftops for urban agriculture, they do have some potential.  Ideally, restaurants, or catering companies could use their own roof spaces to provide rare or expensive ingredients for their kitchens.  The labour required would not be great, and could easily be performed by those already employed at the site.
</P>	


<P>There is an opportunity to cultivate markets in the city for products that are delicate, or perish too quickly to be shipped in from elsewhere (edible flowers for example).  But I no longer believe that the economic returns possible from the use of rooftop gardens would make growing these products economically sustainable on most city roofs.  There is simply too much labour required to generate an adequate return from the sale of produce.  The main problem is that an extensive planting, although capable of generating a decent income, would require a colossal amount of labour in spring and fall to move soil to and from the roof.  Strong rooftops would of course not require this effort, and therefore have the most potential for generating an economic return.
</P>	


<P>My experience during the project summer has led me to believe that rooftop gardening is unlikely to thrive unless it meets many needs in its environment.  Economically, the activity could cover costs and perhaps make a small profit, but the returns on labour would probably be too small to make it worthwhile from this standpoint alone.  If, however, the garden can serve other goals while generating income on the side, then it could indeed be a worthwhile endeavour.  The activities of an organisation like Field to Table, for example, can be augmented through the use of a rooftop garden.  It is an ideal spot to carry-out the gardening component of the Focus on Food programme.  By using it as a classroom, the costs of labour for growing produce would be eliminated.  The income produced by this and related value-added activities (e.g. making preserves, herb condiments, or salad mix) could provide revenues to improve the programme while meeting the programme's needs for produce and garden training facilities.</P>



<P>	I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to do this project at the Field to Table warehouse.  The vibrant community there and the organisation's interest in food security were instrumental in illuminating the potential of rooftop gardening.  Although the activity is not without its problems and limitations, it could effectively meet some community needs in an appropriate environment.  It is not likely to have a substantial impact on urban food production however, and I would suggest that efforts in this regard focus on promoting the use of other unused spaces in the city.</P>

<P>

"Ooh, this is delightful."

<P> Many a visitor to Vancouver's Van Dusen Gardens has uttered such a
phrase, but on a recent May afternoon the visitor was special: a young
woman in a wheelchair facing the challenges of a physical disability.
She is part of a unique pilot project exploring the benefits of
horticulture as therapy. <P> Veronica Sorban is a resident of the B.C.
Rehabilitation Society's George Pearson Centre for physically disabled
adults and was enjoying a visit to the famous botanical gardens as a
part of the latest addition to the Centre's leisure services program.
Working in concert with City Farmer, the Centre has begun offering its
residents a series of activities based on horticulture, ranging from
tending and harvesting plants to making scented sachets.

<P> But wait a minute: Isn't all that digging and weeding too demanding
for institutionalized people? <P>

Not at all, said Pearson's leisure services manager Kathleen Mason, who
helped bring the program in to five wards in the 180-resident Centre,
following a trial year of bussing to City Farmer's Ability Garden in
Kitsilano. "One of the things that surprised me was how active the
residents participating in the garden were... You see people stretching,
people are using their eyes, their arms, their hands," Mason said, of
the first time she saw the residents at work.

<P> The concept of the horticultural therapy program is simple: Let the
Centre's residents practice gardening in their own home. At the Pearson
Centre, this means the residents go out onto the patios to grow flowers
and vegetables in hanging baskets and raised planter boxes, which allows
them to work from their wheelchairs. Often hand-tools are modified to
fit special-needs hands, and, at least initially, the scope of the
gardening has been kept modest. To round out the program, outings such
as the trip to the Van Dusen Gardens are arranged to show people just
what can be done with horticulture. A major secondary program is indoors
crafts, where the residents learn to convert the garden products into
items for gift giving or to brighten personal rooms.

<P> Mason calls the program "building recreational skills," meaning it
gives the residents one more activity in which to be involved. In an
institution, activity patterns threaten to become tedious, so Mason took
the risk of trying an innovative new program. "The range of garden and
craft activities seemed fresh, a little different than what we see (in
the health-care profession)" she said. <P>

Michael Levenston, the City Farmer director who developed the program,
has long been an advocate of horticulture in any form for its many
virtues - fresh produce, healthy outdoor physical activity, the peace of
mind which comes from nurturing growing plants, among others. He saw no
reason why the disabled shouldn't garden, too.

<P> "Everybody can garden, regardless of politics, age, wealth or
background. We want to demonstrate that a disability need not be a
barrier to enjoying the benefits of gardening," he asserted. <P>

For the residents of the Pearson Centre, the benefits of horticultural
therapy range from intangibles like Sorban's delight to possible
improvement in functional abilities. <P>

Assessing the program's benefit to her clients early in the project,
Mason noted, "In the initial phases, we're seeing that gardening makes
the institution feel more home-like. The presence of plants and flowers
is improving the environment." She also pointed to "unmeasureable
qualities" which work to the resident's benefit, such as fresh air,
sunshine and physical activity. She suggested the residents feel a sense
of accomplishment as they see the fruits of their labours mature, a
sense of self-worth which is helping even staff realize just how much
the residents can do for themselves.

<P> This new feeling of self-worth, coupled with the physical therapy of
performing the gardening, may even yield tangible improvements in
patients' conditions. "I think by the end of the program we're going to
see improvements in fine and gross motor skills," predicted Mason.

<P> Working directly with the residents are a crew of three hired by
City Farmer under an Employment & Immigration Job Development grant.
With the help of Centre staff, Laurette Douziech, Dianne Petrant and
Linda Lock are learning to blend the skills of a gardener with those of
a therapist. They work hands-on with the residents, sometimes literally,
as in the case of those with limited hand control, when the therapeutic
horticultural assistant's hand will guide the resident's.

<P> Gardening days have become something of a social event, with country
music on the ghetto-blaster setting a friendly and informal mood. "It
really brings the residents out of their shells," said Douziech. "One
day we were playing music and everybody was singing along...whatever
came out." While the sing-along may not have soothed the seedling
plants, it set the tone for a remarkably harmonious day of activity. <P>

Though smiles abound, there's still work to be done. The assistants
handle the heavy jobs, but it is the residents themselves who decide
what and where to plant. They also do the planting, weeding and
watering, which can often involve new challenges in reaching, digging,
pushing and grasping. "It's a different set of movements than they're
used to, and they really have to work at it," said Lock, who couldn't
resist comparing the similar growth struggles of the seeds and the
residents.

<P> "Most of us would take it for granted to do a simple task like drop
a single seed into a hole in the soil. But for them, that's a major
challenge," said Petrant. "Everything in the hospital is done for them.
With the garden, they're out there doing it for themselves." <P>

All of those working with the project expressed surprise at how
successful it has become, beyond even their own expectations. This
suggested to Levenston that the idea could be considered in other
institutions, and led to the production of this handbook.

<P> Two typical residents' views on the program are representative of
those of most residents. The first is an older adult to whom gardening
is an old companion, the second is the awe-struck young woman mentioned
above, who has no gardening experience. <P>

"I used to look after a garden at home before I developed my illness, so
to continue here at Pearson is just exactly what I wanted to do,"
resident Andrew Barnes, a former fireman, said, "It gets me right back
into the realm of gardening, gets me involved, it's a very interesting
program." <P>

And for Sorban. "This is more interesting than what I've been doing."
She said she loves the chance to get outdoors, adding, "I go and take
care of the garden every Saturday," when the horticultural assistants
are off-duty. <P>

Strolling along a path at Van Dusen Gardens in her electric wheelchair,
she paused, and a gleam came to her eye. Glancing mischieviously over
her shoulder, she leaned closer to confide, "I like getting dirty the
best."

<P>

Using horticulture for healing has a long history. As early as 1699
Leonard Maeger, writing in the <I>English Gardener</I> advised his
countrymen "to spend their spare time in the garden, either digging,
setting out, or weeding; there is no better way to preserve your
health."

<P> Dr. Benjamin Rush, pioneer psychiatrist, and a signer of the
American Declaration of Independence, declared in his time that "digging
in the soil has a curative effect on the mentally ill."

<P> Following both World War I and II, veterans' hospitals made
increased use of gardening as therapy in the treatment and reeducation
of disabled soldiers. Volunteers from garden clubs brought the delights
and benefits of their hobby to thousands of men recovering from battle.

<P> Today in the US and Canada hundreds of hospitals work with plants to
provide a powerful form of therapy for patients with emotional and
physical disabilities. There are more than 250 registered Horticultural
Therapists in North America working in a wide range of settings, from
nursing homes to prisons, schools to hospitals, they are trying to ease
mental and physical distress and provide creative, recreational and
vocational activities for people who often have very few such outlets.

<P> Gardening with individuals with disabilities can show surprising
results both in improving motor skills and in reducing stress. Twenty
minutes of watering and tending plants produces visible calm.

<P> By blending gardening and nutritional education, participants begin
engaging in healthier behavior, becoming more active and improving their
diets. <P>

As a therapy, gardening is unique in that a living medium - plants - is
used. Disabled people get a hands-on connection with the natural
environment and life cycle. By caring for plants individuals work with a
product firmly anchored in reality. Participants realize that they have
an effect on something else that is living. Changes in behavior,
emotional expression and reliability have occurred. <P>

Some disabled gardeners feel a reversal of dependency when they see that
they can function independently, and actually garden for themselves.
This can bring about a tremendous improvement in feelings of self
esteem.

<P> By introducing horticulture to disabled individuals a new
interesting hobby takes root in their lives. Group gardening activities
promote social interaction. Changes in outlook take place as
participants wonder what will come up next week, or what will they plant
next year. Looking ahead to the future is extremely important in
fostering a healthy, positive, mental state especially in seniors. <P>

For some, a new career is a possibility. The American Horticultural
Therapy Association directs a national employment project aimed at
assisting horticulture employers find qualified disabled job candidates.
To date 1000 people have been placed in a variety of salaried
horticulture jobs. <P>

City Farmer believes that gardening as therapy has a place in all health
care facilities in British Columbia. Given the opportunity, disabled
people find the activity of working with plants a joyful experience.

<P> Gene Rothert of the Chicago Botanic Gardens concisely sums up the
job of providing a horticultural therapy service in three parts, "Adapt
the garden, adapt the gardener, and adapt the plant materials."

<P></P><BR>


<B>By Kathleen Mason <BR>Manager, Leisure Services <BR>George
Pearson Centre<BR> (C) Copyright: 1988</B>

<P>

The mission of leisure service delivery in care facilities is to
assist residents in developing a satisfying leisure lifestyle. Our
delivery of services is based on a continuum approach which stretches
from developing specific treatment goals through leisure education
services with the ultimate goal of independent participation in
chosen leisure activities. A gardening program fits nicely with this
model of service delivery and offers many opportunities for
recreation therapists to creatively adapt a program to meet
individual needs. A gardening program can offer an individual
opportunities for developing skills, creativity, self-awareness, and
choices, all of which are key elements in a quality leisure services
program. Our philosophical approach is based on enabling individuals
to do as much as they can themselves and providing the appropriate
amount of support and assistance.
<P>

At George Pearson Centre we have been both inspired and challenged by
our association with the City Farmer group and their fresh approach
to gardening. Residents, occupational therapists, recreation
therapists and staff of the job development program of City Farmer
have demonstrated to us the importance of sharing our knowledge,
skills, and resources and this has been a rewarding experience for
all involved. Although gardening with residents is not new to George
Pearson Centre, the ward based approach, where the gardening takes
place beside the resident's bedrooms, is proving to be a bonus in
many ways. Nursing and housekeeping staff see residents gardening
instead of the activity taking place in the "activity" centre.

<P>
Residents are taking responsibility for watering and ongoing
maintenance of projects. Residents are asking to have a vegetable
garden!

<P>
I would like to encourage other leisure service professionals to
develop therapeutic gardening programs in their facilities and would
be willing to share our knowledge and experience with others in the
field.

Healing</FONT></H1></DIV>

<P></P><BR>

<H3>Personal Perspective </H3>

<P> If I leave you with nothing else today I would like to leave you
with what a healing environment is for me. For me a healing environment
is ultimately a sanctuary that allows for active involvement or
passivity. The sanctuary is made up of an amalgamation of elements in
which plants are just one part of a larger whole. The basis for a
nurturing and restoring environment can be discussed in terms of; the
framework or the overall structure of an environment; the elements
within the framework; and finally, what I am going to call the
"essence", or the tactile qualities of the environment.

<P>

The framework was the geographical place itself. Stinson Beach, when you
spend some time there other than a day trip from the city, is a very
special place. It is nestled into the backside of Mt. Tamalpias. The
slopes, long and broad, reach down and almost touch the ocean. The
landscape itself provides a safe haven. The element of safe haven and of
feeling protected is crucial to any nurturing space. In visualization
before you focus on your goal, yourself without cancer, the perfect
athletic performance, one focuses on a safe and comfortable place. This
is a technique to relax your mind so that you can begin to concentrate
on your ultimate goal. My safe haven has always been the beach. At
Stinson the notion of safe haven was enforced by the hills reaching down
and around me. The fingers of the ridges extended out to the ocean on
either side. They protected my backside while the open expanse of beach
lay before me. For me, the beach was a strong protective metaphor. Even
though I was exposed to the elements, I was able to see all around and
to see oncoming dangers. At the beach I could choose solace or
gregariousness. I could walk the deserted portions of the beach or throw
myself into the fray of beach balls, dogs, children, and swimming. I
could choose active involvement or to be passive.

<P>

Another aspect of the framework was the garden. I believe all gardens
are nurturing, restorative and healing in themselves but this garden
embodied the notion of sanctuary through courtyards which led from the
public street, through a semi-private courtyard, to an inner private
courtyard, and eventually to the house. The outer courtyard was rambling
with flowers and vegetable patches. The inner courtyard was well
protected from the sun and the wind. The garden, like the beach, invited
involvement but allowed for passivity as well. There was privacy in the
garden and a sense of separation. When I was ill, I needed privacy and
separation. The frameworks of the garden and the beach, though different
in scale, both suggested safety and protection.

<P>

In the garden I found elements which were complementary to the overall
framework. These elements were the nature of the plant materials and the
complexity of the setting itself. For me there was relief in returning
to a more natural world. Tending to the garden and the plants within it
was analogous to tending to my body. The time I took caring for the
plants, picking off dead heads, weeding, watering and restaking would
reap a bounty in the garden. So it was with my body. I felt that if I
took care of my body, eating better food, rebuilding my physical
strength, and taking the time to meditate, my body would reap the
benefits more so than if I neglected it.

<P>


<IMG  ALIGN=left BORDER=2 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="268"
SRC="Flowerpot.GIF" ALT="Flowers/pots">

<P>

Within the garden and its setting was an element of complexity.
Complexity is an element which, I believe, invokes involvement. What I
saw walking in was not necessarily what I saw when I turned around and
walked out. There was something else to focus on. In this case it was a
series of artifacts that were scattered throughout the garden. The house
I stayed in was owned by two antiquarians. They have travelled
extensively and have brought back artifacts, masks, pots, and statuary,
from all over the world. I needed to feel that despite the
circumstances, there was respite. That respite I found in the garden. In
the garden, I could experience a physical notion, similar to meditation,
of going far away and then coming back refreshed.

<P>

The last category of "essence" is critical to a healing setting. It is
the category that embraces the senses; sight, sound, smell, touch, and
taste. As I mentioned earlier, my sense of taste and smell were
suppressed by the chemotherapy. My other senses, sight, sound and touch
became more acute. Colour was a significant aspect in that curative
space. Colour should be not a riot of colour from all spectrums but a
soft range that lies within the blues, purples, pinks and greens with
potentially a little red, yellow or orange as accent. In the garden, the
brighter colours were in the outer courtyard, the more subtle tones of
blues and purples in the inner courtyard. There was a warm subtlety to
the colours that invoked tranquility, - tranquility and peace in every
corner, in every direction I turned. I can remember the fading light on
the hills. The sun bleached hills which intensified as the sun set
turning from ochre and orange to pink, violet and finally fading to
blue. Even in the interior of the house the colours were soothing; pale
yellow in the kitchen, rich, deep reds in the living room. The warm and
rich colours of the wood furniture seemed to absorb light. At sunset the
deep, rich, introverted colours washed the rooms a glow with the warmest
hues.

<P>

Sound was another prominent aspect in my healing environment. For me the
ocean with its eternal pounding of waves is soothing and calming to the
spirit. Even the slightest trickle of water is calming but the endless
beat of waves is meditative. I feel I made progress by the water. There
was a continual relation to the earth through my senses. After being in
the desensitized and institutional environment of a hospital to be able
to focus on a bloom of flowers or the ripeness of a tomato, then to pick
and eat that tomato was to invite that whole environment in. To shake
off the cobwebs of the hospital was refreshing. I appreciated all the
sensual aspects of my environment - from the colours, forms and textures
in the garden to the sound of the wind and the waves. It was a time to
delight in the senses. That house and garden provided a milieu where
that could be accomplished. <P>


Again a healing environment is ultimately a sanctuary. For me, the
framework of the surrounding hills and garden provided a safe haven. The
elements of plants and artifacts mixed with some complexity within the
framework allowed for active and passive involvement and the distinct
qualities of the setting which stimulated my senses, were the basis, I
believe, to the environment I found so nurturing, calming and
restorative.



<P> In closing, I would like to return to the notion of breaking the
code of silence. I feel that in speaking out I am taking a step towards
breaking the code of silence. The more people who hear stories like this
the better. There are not enough advocates for people with cancer.
Hospitals and the treatment of cancer is physically and emotionally very
unpleasant. However, it does not have to be that way. As designers if
you can listen to the voices of those with illnesses, I think you can
create a sanctuary and ultimately participate in the healing process
itself.


<P> In closing, I would just like to mention that after I left Stinson
Beach I returned to San Francisco. My doctors were amazed to find no
trace of cancer on my body. We suddenly had a window of opportunity and
within the week I was back in the hospital for a transplant. That was
July of 1992. It has been almost four years since my remission and more
than anything else in my life I am very happy and I feel very fortunate
to be alive. I am also glad to have had the opportunity to share with
you some of my insights.

(translucent plastic preferred).
<P>

<LI>A room or closet with dependable temperature (18-24 C, 65-75 F).

<P>
<LI>Dark coloured nylon wedding veil material (tulle) or other fine netting to
generously cover pails.

<P>
<LI>Bungee cords with hooks to hold netting firmly over pails.

<H3>The Sprouts Need</H3>

<P>

<UL>

<LI>humid, not wet, conditions
<P>

<LI>air circulation
<P>

<LI>steady temperature

<P>
<LI>light for greening (never direct sunlight)
<P>
<BR>

<H3>Method</H3>

<DL>

<DT>Wash 

<DD>Wash seeds thoroughly in at least 2 changes of lukewarm water. Agitate
well with hands or stick and drain water through netting.
<P>

<DT>Soak 

<DD>Soak the seeds for 5-8 hours, (or overnight) in cool water and drain.
Rinse and drain thoroughly. Let pail stay on side for 5 to 20 minutes to drain,
then rotate 1/4 turn and let drain again.
<P>

<DT>Divide 

<DD>Divide the seed into more pails as necessary during sprouting. The
larger the quantity of seed in one container, the more frequent the rinsing must
be. This prevents heat build-up. Cover the pails with the lids between rinsing
leaving a small crack for ventilation.

<P>
<DT>Rinse 

<DD>Rinse the sprouts at least 3 times a day with cold water (first thing in
the morning and last at night are important). Break up sprout clumps by hand
while rinsing. Large amounts of sprouts have a tendency to heat in the middle if
not rinsed often enough (especially in summer). Cover pails with netting held in
place by bungee cords. Let pail stay on side for 5 to 20 minutes to drain, then
rotate 1/4 turn and let drain again. Stand the pails up and cover them with the
lids between rinsing. Leave a small crack for ventilation.
<P>

<DT>Clean & Green 

<DD> About the third day, before rinsing, remove the hulls and hard
seed from the bottom of the sprout mass. Skim the hulls from the top of the water
when rinsing. Replace the screen and bungee, then cover pails with a transparent
lid to allow greening. Polyethylene sheeting, plastic or glass will work for
this.

<P>
<DT>Store 

<DD> Use room temperature water for the last rinsing. Drain extremely well and
let sprouts sit until internal heat has dried them well (7-10 hours depending on
batch size and room temperature). Transfer to clean pails and cover with slight
ventilation at fridge temperature. Do not use poly bags or similar for extended
storage.

</DL>

<P>

<BR>
<H3>Hints and Options</H3>

<P>

<UL>

<LI>Use Hydrogen Peroxide 3% at 50ml to 4 liters or 1/8 cup to a gallon of water to
soak seed, for final rinse, or stronger for cleaning equipment, especially if you
have mold or rot problems. You may wish to clean all equipment with bleach on a
regular basis.

<P>
<LI>Add faster sprouting seeds such as radish (washed and soaked) on the 3rd day for
mixes.
<P>

<LI>A hose attachment for your tap is useful for rinsing and agitating.
<P>

<LI>Coarser nylon wedding veil material may be useful after 2 or 3 days to help rinse
out debris.
<P>

<LI>Alfalfa and red clover should take 5-7 days, depending on temperature.
<P>

<LI>Soak-water from alfalfa stains everything yellow. Dispose of carefully and wipe
up spills immediately.
<P>

<LI>Sprouts can't stand to sit in water, either during sprouting or storage.
<P>

<LI>You can also use a laundry tub, with a homemade screen outlet, for sprouting.
<P>

</UL>

Experiment and develop your own variations.

<DIV ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="Navy"> <H3>Urban Agriculture Group Forms a Global
Facility:<BR>

to Reduce Food Insecurity,

Create Jobs<BR>

and Improve the Environment in Cities</H3></FONT></DIV>

<P><BR>

A new Global Facility for Urban Agriculture was created in March 1996 at an
international consultation held by the Urban Agriculture Support Group [SGUA].
The SGUA was formed by the UNDP in 1992 to examine issues related to food
security and urban agriculture, especially for developing countries. The new
Facility will be guided by an interim steering committee, and initial funding
will come from the UNDP, IDRC of Canada and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.

<P> The new Facility responds to an escalating demand worldwide for information
and technical assistance from the growing constituency of urban farmers'
associations; civic organizations; mayors of large and small cities; and urban,
agricultural and environmental research institutions. A recent study by the UNDP
estimates that 800 million urban farmers produce over one-seventh of all the food
consumed on the planet, and more than half of the vegetables, poultry and pork
eaten in towns and cities.

<P> The meeting, held at IDRC in Ottawa, Canada was attended by senior
representatives of the World Bank, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization,
German Technical Assistance [GTZ], British agricultural assistance [NRI], Dutch
development cooperation [DGIS], Canadian development research [IDRC], CARE
International, the World Sustainable Agriculture Association, the Developing
Countries Farm Radio Network, the ETC Foundation, the Urban Agriculture Network,
City Farmer of Canada, and members of the academic community.

<P> The interim steering committee will recommend that the facility establish a
homepage on the world wide web, an Internet listserv on urban agriculture, an
e-mail conference, and a quarterly newsletter. It may also recommend support for
policy and technical workshops in Asia, Africa and Latin America over the next 3
years.

<P> The Global Facility for Urban Agriculture will be hosted initially by IDRC in
Ottawa, Canada within the <B>Cities Feeding People</B> Programme Initiative.


<P> To learn more about urban agriculture you can read the latest book on the
subject, <B>Urban Agriculture: Food, Jobs and Sustainable Cities</B> published in
1996 by the UNDP, now available from the Urban Agriculture Network in Washington
DC, or visit 2 sites on the Internet: <A HREF="http://www.cityfarmer.org"><FONT

<P><LI> On Sept 29th Jac was the keynote speaker at the <B>American
Community Gardeners Assoc.</B> 17th annual conference in Montreal,
Canada, and received a standing ovation.  What is particularly
remarkable is that this four-day conference, focused on community
gardens [CG], had the following workshops:
<UL>
     	<LI>The role of CGs in building the new agriculture;
   	<LI>CGs as an urban planning issue --;
   	<LI>Community food security --;
     	<LI>Employment, Education, Empowerment and Economic Development;
    	<LI>The politics of CGs in Germany;
    	<LI>Long term solutions for vacant [urban] land;
   	<LI>FGU: a model for urban revitalization;
  	<LI>CSAs and the urban-rural connection;</P>
</UL>



<P>    <LI>We received word this week that we will be assigned to do
the UA 'Agricultural Technical Notes' for <B>IBRD</B>.  We will be riding
on your shoulders.</P>


<P>   <LI> <B>FAO's W. Baudoin</B> has decided to join TUAN in a small study
of popular hydroponics or low-cost greenhouses, possibly in Peru.</P>


<P>    <LI> <B>UNCHS</B> has decided to fund the French edition of the book: 
"Urban Agriculture: f, j, & sc".</P>


<P>     <LI> The final text of TUAN article on UA is approved for the
WFSummit edition of <B>"Our Planet".</B></P>


<P>    <LI>TUAN will be presenting on Oct 18th at the <B>American
Agricultural Consultants Association</B> annual conference in Atlanta.</P>


<P>    <LI>IDB has requested TUAN to participate in the '<B>Urban
Greening' conference</B> on Dec 2-5 in Mexico City.  Fliers are
available with us.</P>


<P>    <LI> <B>The National Agriculture Library</B> Beltsville MD will be
visiting TUAN on Oct 15 to assess our library.</P>


<P>    <LI> The recent 'urban waste for agriculture' <B>2-day workshop at
the WB</B> [we assisted in design] was truly seminal.  This could be a
turnaround.  Please check with T. Schillhorn.  UA was included in
the vice president's keynote speech.</P>


<P>    <LI> We are informed that FAO has a UA initiative in Peru
regarding access to peri-urban land.</P>


<P>   <LI> The <B>WFSummit </B>will distribute a two-page brief on urban
agriculture.  It quotes from "the Book" [page -26-].</P>

<P>

<LI> This week TUAN made a presentation for the <B>World Future Society
Conference</B>.  We were joined by the eminent Futurist Rashi Mayur who has four
projects going on in three countries including urban agriculture.  The panel,
from 10 am to 12 noon on the 15th was moderated by Tamara Belt of the <B>World
Bank</B>.  We did a 'meet the authors' session at 3:30 pm the same day.  The next
evening, 16th, Jac presented a future vision of urban agriculture in the American
Capital Region, with eminent experts. <P>

<LI> We are in the second stage of preparing the next regional UA conference.  It
will be <B>November 26-29 in Jakarta, Indonesia</B>.  We are the guests of the
Ministry of Environment with the Universities in Bandung and Bogor co-hosting. 
There will also be three professional organizations co-hosting.  More in a few
weeks.

<P> <LI> Two weeks ago [June 25] we assisted the <B>World Bank's educational unit
EDI/ENV</B> to design a UA policy training project.  For one day specialists in
UA from Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe and North America convened to direct
the purpose, clientele, and method of training policy makers in UA.  Several UA
list members were there and a report will be coming out soon. <P>

<LI> Jac Smit was the resource person on a panel at<B> Habitat II</B> with Anders
Wijkman of the UNDP.  There was a wonderful group of interested persons 
participating for three hours.  Several interesting press articles resulted. <P>

<LI> Also at Habitat II, TUAN became more directly interrelated with the
'<B>Healthy Cities</B>' and '<B>Best Practice</B>' global programs.  Both of
which have well-funded web sites. <P>

<LI> Here in America's Capital City we are carrying out negotiations with the
School Board to start-up a UA youth program.  We welcome any tips on resources
for this venture. <P>

<LI>  Today we have an offer from a <B>Nigerian Agriculture Research Centre</B>
to serve as the secretariat for a <B>Nigerian Urban Agriculture Network</B>.  Is
there and support out there?  This possibility was opened up by Rudy Schippers at
NRI. <P>

<LI>  TUAN is collaborating with '<B>City Farmer</B>' and '<B>ETC Foundation</B>'
in preparing proposals in response to the Communications Group of SGUA meeting on
March 19th, for a newsletter and a web site.

<P>

<LI>  A news item we should all be aware of is that the 15 agriculture research
centers in the <B>Republic of South Africa</B> have been authorized to conduct
research in urban agriculture under the oversight of a vice president. Thus UA
has moved beyond policy to administrative directive.

<P>

<LI>  Urban Agriculture, and TUAN in particular, are showing up more frequently
in the press.  Look for items in: <P> <UL> <LI><B>Scientific American</B>, June
[page 18] <LI><B>Metropolis</B>, September <LI><B>NextCity</B>, August <LI><B>New
Scientist</B>, June 15th <LI><B>Observer</B> [London], 26th of May <LI><B>African
Urban Quarterly</B>, September <LI><B>WSAA Newsletter</B>, Spring <LI><B>New
Garden</B>, Summer [last page] </UL> <P>

We have contracts for articles in '<B>Scientific American</B>' and
'<B>Planet</B>', the new UNEP popular magazine.  The latter will be distributed
free at the 'food summit'.  <B>GEO</B>, the European 'National Geographic' is
doing an article on urban agriculture with our advice, featuring Greater Cairo.
<P>

<LI>  For July 28th, 8:00 am to 10:45 am,  Joe Nasr has organized a panel, "Urban
Planning and the Future of Urban Food Systems" at the <B>ACSP/AESOP 1996
Conference</B> in Toronto.  This includes some truly interesting papers. <P>

<LI> On September 29th Jac Smit will be a featured speaker at the <B>American
Community Gardening Association</B> conference in Montreal.

<P> <LI>  <B>The Interamerican Bank 'Urban Greening' conference in Mexico City,
October 21-23</B>, will include urban agriculture both inside the main agenda and
in a workshop which we are organizing. <P>

<P></P><BR>

<H3>Development Context</H3>


<P>Millions of people in the cities of the South have become farmers in recent decades, growing vegetables, raising livestock, and practising many other types of agriculture in urban areas.  These urban farmers, most of whom are women, enjoy benefits that include better diets and a higher income, and they make a significant contribution to the urban environment.  Urban agriculture (UA) improves local food supplies, puts marginal lands to good use, and speeds the recycling of organic wastes into productive compost and fertilizers.</P>


<P>Urban agriculture is recognized as ranging from low-income subsistence farming to middle-income home gardening to agribusinesses.  Among lower income groups, self-produced food can provide a considerable share of a household’s total food, and can save cash income that otherwise would be spent on food.</P>


<P>Cities have been needlessly starved by development policies nurturing rural-urban dichotomies.  Most urban agriculture remains largely unrecognized and unassisted, if not outlawed and harassed, even in years of food shortages.  Nonetheless, some governments are creating agencies to manage urban agriculture and actively encourage it.  </P>


<P>Urban agriculture does, however, require higher technological and organizational precision than rural agriculture, because it needs to be more intensive, more tolerant of environmental stress and very carefully monitored to protect public health.</P>
<BR>

<H3>Goal</H3>


<P>Cities Feeding People will encourage policy and technology for sustainable agricultural use of urban resources, with appropriate gender focus, to strengthen:</P>


<UL>
		<LI>Household food security 
		<LI>Employment and income generation 
		<LI>Waste and open space management 
		<LI>Community self-management, particularly for the urban poor  
</UL>


<P>IDRC has concluded that to improve the well-being and health of urban dwellers who are low-income food producers and consumers, and to make urban ecosystems sustainable, both political and technical solutions are needed. The current focus is on research in these fields: confined-space technologies for low-income food producers; safe urban agriculture practices (organic recycling) to reduce human and environmental health risks; and receptive policy and regulatory frameworks for land tenure, zoning and use planning. </P>


<P>At the same time,  Cities Feeding People will upgrade regional capacities to share experiences and identify common obstacles.  It will look for solutions by building partnerships through networking and training.  As awareness towards urban agriculture increases and attitudes change, development agencies are certain to make more effective investments in key research and development areas.
</P> 

<BR>
<H3>The IDRC Experience</H3>


<P>IDRC has been supporting multidisciplinary research on urban food systems and water resources in the South for nearly 20 years.  It has staff expertise covering a broad range of disciplines, regions and cultures. Projects on the following topics in have been funded in almost 40 cities (9 in Asia, 15 in Africa, and 15 in Latin America and the Caribbean):</P>

<UL >

		<LI>The reuse of urban waste by urban agriculture
		<LI>The workings of urban food distribution and consumption
		<LI>The extent of urban malnutrition
		<LI>Urban food insecurity
		<LI>The urban production and processing of food
	
</UL>

<P></P><BR>

<H3>Our Partners
</H3>

<P>The issues around urban food production and food security are so complex that a wide range of people and institutions are working on them.   We have been working at the regional level, for example, in Latin America to create a network of researchers called AGUILA.  Cities Feeding People recognises and leads growing interest among the development community in managing urban environments in a sustainable way. </P>


<P>At the international level, we have been participating in the Support Group for Urban Agriculture (SGUA) since its creation in 1992.  This group is composed of representatives from:  bilateral and multilateral development agencies; municipal planners; public and private research centres; and NGOs. In 1996, the SGUA met at IDRC to look at how better coordination on information, policy, research, technical assistance and investment can achieve urban food security, environmental improvement, poverty reduction, and improved urban management. The SGUA agreed to create a Facility to fund and promote this work.</P>

the environment and sustainable development, Fall 1996</TT>
                                                                                  

<P>

</P><BR>

<H3>A day in the life of an urban farmer:</H3> 


<P>    Its Tuesday morning, and like every other morning of the week Ms Luna is feeding her chickens and guinea pigs leftovers from her family's and the neighbors' Monday meals.  Before returning to the kitchen to prepare breakfast, she checks the fence around her one-tenth of an acre [4 % of a hectare] home-plot for damage by the community's free ranging goats.  At the end of the day we find her again tending her crops: raised beds of vegetables, cucumbers and zucchini vines on the fences and trellised walls, and seedlings and herbs in hydroponic flats on the roof.
</P> 

<P>	     Ms Luna in Valparizo raises one-third of her family's nutritional needs during the year.  This one-third includes two-thirds of their protein and micronutrient requirements.  In addition to creating a healthy diet for her family, she raises culinary and medicinal herbs which are sold at retail by a grocer near her husband's job, on a consignment basis.  A third activity we note is that Ms Luna produces her own fertilizer by composting her family and the neighbors' organic waste and using grey water from the kitchen and bath for irrigation.  </P>


<P>	     Before leaving we note that Ms Luna's small plot is green from boundary to boundary and that it is far cleaner and a bit cooler than others in the neighborhood.  If we could stay we would learn that her children are far healthier than the average for her low-income community.</P>

<P>	     On a recent study tour to 20 countries for the UNDP the author 'discovered' that there are hundreds of millions of urban Ms Luna's in Asia, Africa, Europe and North America as well as in Latin America.  Nine out of ten families in Nairobi, who have access to land, are food producers.  In a somewhat richer country, two of three families in Greater Moscow raise food.  How about wealthy countries?  In the USA 16 million families in urban and suburban census tracts raise vegetables, that's almost one-in-three of all American urban families.</P>


	<H3>21st century urban food security prospect:  </H3>   

<P>Readers of "Our Planet" are well versed in the dire world 'future-view' of food and the agriculture related environment. UNICEF tells us that 800 million, one sixth of the world population, suffers from inadequate diets.  UNCHS projects that urban population will increase from 45 percent to 65 percent between 1990 and 2020, and it will double in many developing countries, where most of these new city dwellers will appear. Urbanization is doing the best in Africa where economic growth is the slowest.   Land is being converted from rural to urban land use at three to five times the rate of urban population growth, as city expansion is largely unplanned and dispersed.  In sum, our future seems likely to include more urban hunger in lower density cities.</P>


<P>	     The UNEP [GLASOD study] finds that three-fifths of all agricultural cropland world-wide is degraded with percentages of 65 in Africa, 50 in Latin America and 40 in Asia.  Land degradation could decrease crop yields by one seventh by 2020, and much more than that in certain countries and sub-regions. The World Bank warns us of looming water shortages for agriculture, particularly in the Middle East, China, and large parts of Africa.</P>


<P>	     Common intelligence now-a-days suggests that these problems can effectively be resolved through 'technology', and we do not disagree.   We accept that technology, well applied, can solve the problems of hunger and malnutrition, and the problems of land degradation and water shortages as well.  However, from the point of view of an urban farmer like Ms Luna, the technological solution appears risky, slow, expensive and perhaps incomplete for her family and neighbors in the urban South.</P>


<P>	     What if? in addition to pursuing the technological fix, the world puts its intelligence, research, and investment into empowering Ms Luna and hundreds of millions of other urban farmers [increasing in numbers every day] to produce more within their home-lots, communities, cities and megalapoli?  What would the world environment look like if towns and cities produced half of their nutritional needs.  And that is not a difficult target to achieve by 2020 in many countries.  </P>


<P>	     What if? urban waste, which is 70 percent organic, was transformed, within the city and peri-urban areas, into biodiversity, greenery and food?  Perhaps the possibilities of urban agriculture have been noticed many times and set aside, as being so obvious that: "it must have been studied and found wanting by someone else".</P>

<H3>
	Should cities produce food? </H3>   
	
	
<P>	 Many of us have come to believe that it is "cast in stone" that food is produced in [remote] rural areas and that farming is inappropriate in towns and cities.  During the 1970s a few specialists in development began to notice and report that there was an increase in farming in cities.  The author first became aware of this phenomenon, as a Ford Foundation urban advisor, in 1968 in Calcutta.  This large, dense city produces  over one-third of the fish and vegetables consumed, largely using urban waste as a resource for production.</P>


<P>	     In the middle 1980s, at long last, a global urban agriculture study was undertaken by the UN University, by Drs. Ignacy Sachs and Dana Silk, "The Food-Energy Nexus".   This study produced 32 papers, 24 published, from 25 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe.  Studies in the next few years, many funded by IDRC of Canada, found that the phenomenon 'discovered' by the UNU was spreading and increasing.  It seemed that as city populations grew in hot and cold climates, and in command and open economies, urban agriculture grew even more rapidly.  </P>


<P>	     Urban food security is increasingly dependent on increasingly longer supply lines, operating on fossil fuels, feeding growing cities from shrinking land and water resources. Macro-economists assure us it will all work out IF the urban residents have enough money to pay for the food.  In African cities, and many other in other regions, half of the total economy is informal or non-money.   </P>



<P>	     In Mrs. Luna's community three quarters of the economy is not in "the coin of the realm".  Her neighbors can buy from her through barter but they can not buy from global agri-business. And cities are growing faster than the formal economy in many countries.  Perhaps urban food security in the 21st century will depend in part on locally grown and raised food, and that production may be based more on local resources than fossil fuel. One could conclude that it would be prudent for a city with low-income residents facing food insecurity, to convert its waste and idle land into food and green.  And the technology to do that is well known and tested.</P>


<P>	     Urban agriculture produces products for the daily urban market.  It does not specialize in cattle or cereal crops, with exceptions, but perishable products.  The crops vary according to the availability of infrastructure [transport and storage] and the establishment of a formal [money] economy.   Urban agriculture is typically intensive, producing three to 15 times as much per hectare as common rural methods.  It is more organic and sustainable than rural agriculture, two reasons being that urban waste is more abundant than rural waste and the urban farmer's labor intensive methods use less land and water per unit of production than industrial agriculture.</P>



<P>	     There may be no either/or in the future of agriculture, rural:urban or technology:sustainable.  We may optimize the reduction of hunger, spread of economic development and environmental conservation by advancing even-handedly technological research, rural development [including off-farm activities] and urban agriculture [emphasizing food security and environmental enhancement].</P>


<P>	     In China 40 percent of the jobs in cities are categorized as agriculture.  In Mozambique's capital Maputo it is about 30 percent.  Fifty thousand Berliners rent land to produce crops and there are 14,000  on the waiting list.  Sixty-eight percent of all families in Dar es Salaam were food producers in 1988, up from 18 percent in 1968.  Many cities are self-sufficient in vegetables including Shanghai and Bamako, Mali.</P>


<P>	     The reverse of a hundred-year trend, to separate where we live from where we produce our food, has slowly begun to gain the support of government.  On the side of that, urban agriculture has not yet gained support from the agricultural research and education institutions or agribusiness, with but few exceptions. </P>


<P>	     Cuba did a 180 degree turn on its strong stand against urban food production in 1990.  Today there are programs to assist would-be city farmers [Cuba is 80 percent urban in population] to access public land, seeds and inputs, extension services, and markets.  There are even two TV programs a week for the urban farmer.  Argentina began the pro Huerta 'community farming' program in 1990 with 50,000 participants and 100 partner institutions.  Within five years it grew to 550,000 participants and 1,100 partner institutions.  </P>


<P>	     The United States congress passed the Community Food Security Act in 1996 which specifically encourages, and funds, nutritional self-reliance in urban communities.  Harare Zimbabwe dropped its anti-urban agriculture policy and program, on an interim basis, in 1992.  Within two years the area in green cultivation had doubled, with no reported negative impacts and many benefits.  </P>


<P>	     In Ahmedabad India the city decided to cut costs by allowing urban families to farm in the 'green belt'.  The program has been very successful in the areas of food security, employment, reducing municipal budget, and greening the city.  The African National Congress, a political party in South Africa, had urban agriculture in its platform when it won the election in 1991. That platform plank is now the policy of the Government and urban farmers are being supported by hundreds of NGOs, dozens of towns and cities, several provinces and the national Ministry of Agriculture.  </P>


<H3>Is farming in the city a risky business? </H3>



<P>	     The risks to society of producing food where we live are not great.  The recent episodes of radish sprout school-lunch contamination in Japan and vegetable contamination in Peru are rare and avoidable.  With the introduction and expansion of a new industry new methods of monitoring and regulation are required. Indicators and measures need to be established for different climates, economies and cuisines.  Regulatory staff need to be retrained and reassigned.  Rural methodologies will have some inadequacies.  Urban intensity of production and proximity to habitation require more careful monitoring.</P>


	<H3>The benefits of Urban Agriculture:    
</H3>


<P> What are the benefits of agriculture as a resource for food security, an urban industry, a land use, and an environmental intervention?   Are those benefits likely to be more or less significant in the 21st century?  Who benefits?  Who loses? What's the risk?</P>


<P>	     Agriculture in the human settlement benefits the soil.  The regeneration of the biodiversity of the soil provides the base for many other health and quality of life benefits.  The soil of the city is enriched by the agricultural transformation of solid waste and waste water into food and fuel.  </P>


<P>	     A city with agriculture is greener and cooler.  The biological transformation of waste and conversion of barren land to a green, productive landscape contributes to a clean healthy city, especially in the first meter above the soil where our children spend their days.   Raising livestock and growing crops in cities closes open nutrient [polluting] loops.  A sustainable city may not be feasible without agriculture in the city.   Agriculture in the city reduces the city's 'ecological footprint' and conserves the environment of rural areas.</P>


<P>	     Agriculture is a basic industry that broadens the economic base of a city, and enables it to buy more from rural areas.  The jobs in urban agriculture are disproportionately in favor of women, youth and the elderly.  Agriculture in the city feeds the processing and marketing sectors with a minimal demand on transport and infrastructure.  In cities like Hanoi and Kinshasa food is half the total economy and local production has tremendous importance to families and administrators.  In cities like Zurich, where food is only ten to 15 percent of the economy, it has three or more times that importance in consumption of natural resources.</P>


<P>	     Food production in low-income urban communities has substantial benefits in food security, nutrition and health.  In situations where families go hungry three to ten days a month [from Los Angeles to Nairobi] having physical rather than money access to food in one's own or a friend's farm has been found to be an effective food security intervention.  Sarajevo being the premier example of the 1990s.</P>


<P>	     Farming in the open spaces of a community brings a community together.  Farming is not enclosed by walls.  Farming requires cooperation/partnership and creates community.  Perhaps the greatest benefit in the 21st century of urban farming will turn out to be its capacity to reconnect urban man with nature.</P>


<P>	     The first benefit of urban agriculture is to the small-scale producer.  The last benefit is to the planet as urban footprints are shrunken and open-loop systems are converted to closed-loop systems.  Returning agriculture to the city, as it was in other civilizations, hurts no one.  It is part of a reasonable shift in functions between the rural and urban spheres. </P>


 	<H3>Conclusions: </H3>    


<P>The information age and computer managed manufacturing is moving former urban functions to rural areas.  Furniture is now-a-days made in the forest against daily e-mail orders.  The finished product is shipped to the city, not the raw material. And food can be produced, without shipping and handling costs, where the demand is, in town. </P>


<P>	     Our modern civilization has available hundreds of years of positive experience in urban agriculture.  This is best carried forward in Chinese and Japanese literature.  It is being rediscovered in Inca, Aztec and Mayan texts and sites.  And it is available in excellent texts  from the 19th century.  Combining these resources with the leading-edge research going on today, augurs well for further green, healthy cities in balance with nature.</P>


<P>	     Ms Luna, and her hundreds of millions of peers farming in cities, are looking forward to the benefits of genetically improved crops, [designed for urban situations], improved access to land and markets, support in accessing and processing urban solid and liquid wastes [privatized waste management], and the availability of appropriate extension advice and credit, like other businesses.   And last but not least, the urban farmers are ready to make a contribution to a better urban world.  </P>

<P>
ETC, in collaboration with TUAN, is working on a programme "Urban farming and productive re-use of organic wastes as a strategy for sustainable cities; an inventory and analysis of European experiences on Urban Agriculture". 
</P>



<P>
In Europe urban agriculture is increasingly recognized as a realistic and desirable land use option in urban areas and an integral part of the urban productive system. In Western Europe the main interest in urban agriculture may be from the point of view of environmental management (last year the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Fisheries published a discussion paper on the role of urban agriculture in enhancing the urban environment); in Central and Eastern Europe the potential of urban agriculture for enhanced food security, employment creation and small enterprise development is increasingly acknowledged as well.
</P>

<P>
Until today no major inventory of European experiences with Urban Agriculture has been done. To fill this gap, a research proposal has been developed that aims at: 
</P>


<P>
<UL>
 	<LI>bringing together available information and expertise on urban farming systems, actors and trends in Europe; 
	</P>


<P>
	<LI>facilitating regional and European networking among stakeholders in urban agriculture; and 
	</P>


	<P>
	<LI>providing assistance to a number of local organizations in the development of urban farming systems and integration of urban agriculture in urban policies and planning. 
</UL>
</P>


<P>
In addition ETC took the initiative to establish a <B>European Support Group on Urban Agriculture</B> with the participation of organizations like the European coordination of Gardeners Associations, International Coalition for Local Environmental Action, European League of Local Authorities and other organizations interested in the promotion of urban agriculture.
</P>


The European Support Group aims at: 


<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<P>
	<LI>Stimulating the 'dialogue' on urban agriculture between city councils, citizens, farmers and other stakeholders on both local, regional and European level.
</P>


<P>
	<LI>Discussing present and future research and policy development with regard to sustainable urban agriculture and development.
</P>


<P>
	<LI>Facilitating regional and European networking among stakeholders in urban agriculture and providing information and support to individual persons or organizations in the development of urban farming systems and integration of urban agriculture in urban policies and planning.
</P>
</UL>


<P>
However, as ETC has been mainly working in the "Third World" we are not very familiar with Central and Eastern European countries. We would like to know of any European contacts or organizations interested in urban agriculture or case studies of potential relevance to the above described research programme.
</P>

<P>
We would be very pleased to receive any information you have on urban agriculture in European context.
</P>

NMIMR is carrying out a study of urban food security and malnutrition in
the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, which will include a component of
urban agriculture.  A proposal for this component is under preparation,
for submission to donors.  A  pre-research roundtable workshop
highlighted the importance of urban agriculture, both in terms of
supplying the city with certain types of perishable foods, and in terms
of income generation and access to food by the urban poor.

<DD>

<P> The Farm Radio Network is an information exchange network for rural
communicators in developing countries including broadcasters, extension
workers, health workers, teachers, and librarians. We supply simple,
practical information aimed at increasing food supplies and improving
health and nutrition at the grassroots level.

<P> In 1992, the United Nations Development Program commissioned the
Network to produce a series of scripts on urban agriculture. We produced
four scripts in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese which focus on
using roadside space for farming, raising rabbits in the city, and
growing in small containers and walls. These scripts were presented
along with accompanying cassettes at a world conference of mayors in
Brazil just before the Earth Summit.

<P> In 1995-96, we produced a series of six scripts on urban agriculture
funded by the International Development Research Centre in Ottawa,
Canada. The first three scripts, published in our April 1996 package,
deal with growing vegetable vines in small spaces, rooftop gardening,
and raising guinea pigs. The next three, in the July 1996 package,
provide information on lead reduction in urban farming, growing fruit in
the city, and gardening in tires.

<P> In the future, the Farm Radio Network is committed to providing
fresh material on sustainable urban farming practices and techniques for
people in developing countries. For further information on our urban
agriculture series, contact:<BR> Jennifer Pittet (Managing Editor)

<P> <DD>

<B>1. On ETC</B>

<P> ETC Foundation was established in 1974 as a non-profit but
commercial organization based in the Netherlands. Currently, ETC
Foundation is an international organization with local offices in
Leusden (the Netherlands), Tynemouth (UK), New Delhi (India), Nairobi
(Kenya), Colombo (Sri Lanka), Lima (Peru) and a representative in Harare
(Zimbabwe).

<P> All ETC offices share a common vision concerning development
cooperation and a joint responsibility regarding the formulation of
general policies, quality of work and human resource development. Local
offices are autonomous in implementing projects and programs. ETC
International is functioning as the service and coordinating unit for
all offices. <P>

ETC employs about 50 experts of different nationalities on a permanent
basis. Another 100 staff members are contracted for the execution of
projects and programs. <P>

ETC is involved in policy analysis and development, (applied) research
projects and development studies, program identification and
formulation, project management, technical assistance and backstopping,
impact assessments.

<P> ETC's main objective is to encourage and support local initiatives
which aim to build sustainable development. ETC attaches great
importance to its involvement in national and international dialogue on
development approaches and therefore participates in various networks
and organizes seminars and workshops on key development issues. <P>

ETC's main fields of expertise are the following: Environmental
management and planning, Sustainable Agriculture, Agroforestry,
Sustainable Energy, low cost Housing, Water Supply and Sanitation,
Agricultural research and extension.

<P> In all fields due attention is given to local capacity development,
gender issues, and the application of participatory approaches. Our
approach emphasizes self management, location specificity, use of local
knowledge, and sustainability of the programs. <P>

<B>2. Urban Agriculture (UA)</B>

<P> Some 4 years ago ETC started to develop interest in this field,
acknowledging the vast potential of the use of urban waste for urban
agricultural production, urban animal production and fish culture, urban
forestry, and its significance for the urban poor (employment, income,
food and energy) and for urban environmental management.

<P> ETC initiated its activities by undertaking some exploratory studies
on local experiences in four major cities (Lima, New Delhi, Nairobi,
Harare, Colombo). <P>

ETC is contributing to the promotion of Urban Agriculture by collecting
and disseminating local experiences on UA through its Information Centre
on Low External Input Agriculture (ILEIA), and by assisting in the
preparation and implementation of regional conferences on urban
agriculture (in Bolivia, Germany, UK, India and Zimbabwe). <P>

ETC is a member of the (interim-) Steering Committee of the Global
Facility on Urban Agriculture (GFUA). <P>

ETC-NL, in coordination with TUAN, IDRC and other GFUA partners, is
preparing the publication of an (electronic) international newsletter on
Urban Agriculture and the establishment of a resource-base on Urban
Agriculture.

<P> One staff member of ETC NL is involved in a project on "community
supported agriculture" in the Netherlands. <P>

ETC ANDES (Lima/La Paz) is hosting and co-financing (with IDRC) the
Latin American Network on Urban Agriculture (AGUILA).

<P> ETC-Sri Lanka is preparing an action research project in Colombo
with both governmental and municipal organizations in town planning,
agriculture and livestock, as well as local NGOs and CBOs active in this
field. <P>

ETC India is involved in the set up of an Indian network on Urban
Agriculture and in the formulation of an UA project with the All India
Kitchen Garden Association, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research
and the Planning Commission of India. <P>

ETC consultants do assist local organizations in the development and
implementation of UA projects. <P>

<B>3. Resource Persons</B> <P>

ETC activities in the field of Urban Agriculture are coordinated by Henk
de Zeeuw (agricultural sociologist), part-time assisted by Marielle
Dubbeling (agronomist). Other ETC staff involved in Urban Agriculture
and their field of expertise: <P> <UL>

<LI> Henk Kieft (ETC-NL), LEISA farming <LI> Ann Waters-Bayer (ETC-NL,

Subject: search the world's largest chemical database!<BR>
X-Listserver-Version: 6.0 -- UNIX ListServer by Anastasios Kotsikonas<BR>
X-Comment:  Chemistry Webmasters Discussion list<BR>
<P>
Tripos, Inc. and Silicon Graphics recently announced a record-making event--
SpaceCrunch.  The joint project demonstrates how the union of high-performance
scaleable supercomputing and leading edge chemical database technology can
fundamentally change the drug discovery process.  The SpaceCrunch project
involves creating a structural database containing over 100 billion
compounds, and provides capabilities to search and manipulate the database at
rates above 100 million compounds per hour per CPU.
<P>
The technology for building and searching the database comes from Tripos'
ChemSpace(TM), a patented methodology for the creation and management 
of chemical
databases. The power to build and search the database is provided by the
scalable computing power of Silicon Graphics computer systems. The SpaceCrunch
project is running on a POWER CHALLENGE at the Silicon Graphics Supercomputing
Technology Center in Cortaillod, Switzerland.
<P>
What does this mean to you?  Anyone with an internet browser can participate
in SpaceCrunch, although Java is needed for full interactive capability.
During the next two months, you can access SpaceCrunch through
URL <BR><A HREF="http://spacecrunch.sgi.ch">http://spacecrunch.sgi.ch</A> or 
URL <A HREF="http://www.tripos.com/spacecrunch">http://www.tripos.com/spacecrunch</A>.
<P>
The event will consist of two phases, during the initial period (October
28 to November 11) visitors may
find out more about the project and may propose molecular structure queries to
be applied to the full database. The second phase,  in early December,
will be a live event in which
visitors will interactively examine and explore the results of queries that
were selected for running against the database.
<P>
You can participate in the world's first public applications of this
groundbreaking new technology.
<P>
Combinatorial Chemistry and High Throughput Screening are new disciplines
in which large chemical compound libraries are designed, created and tested for
desired biological activity.  The one-by-one screening method used currently is
being replaced by these new technologies.  The design and evaluation process
of
library building has been performed up until now on a small scale. Now,
ChemSpace and Silicon Graphics Technology brings innovation to this process by
enabling the creation and searching of vast libraries containing billions of
chemical compounds stemming from specific reactions and reagents.
<P>
ChemSpace is unique in enabling both the construction of massive medicinal
databases and the ability to search them for specified similarity or chemical
substructures.  The ChemSpace technology is scalable across the entire Silicon
Graphics line of products, from the entry-level Indy desktop workstation to the
top-of-the-line POWER CHALLENGEarray as well as on the recently announced
product line extending from the O2 desktop solution, through ORIGIN200 and up
to the ORIGIN2000 scalable solutions.
<P>
Visit the web sites to learn more about ChemSpace and Silicon Graphics
technology and to submit a query to be one of those possibly selected to run
against the SpaceCrunch database.
<P>
Contact Mark Schwartz of Tripos (314-647-1099, schwartz@tripos.com) or
Heidi Taylor of Silicon Graphics (+44 1734 257500, heidi@reading.sgi.com)
for additional information.

<H1>Inorganic  and  Organometallic  Chemistry</H1>
</CENTER
<P>
From its inception the School of Chemistry
has been an international centre of excellence in organometallic
chemistry.  The first professor and dean was C Eaborn who continues
to receive research support from SERC and to edit the <I>Journal
of Organometallic Chemistry</I> from his office within the School.
 Professors Lappert, Nixon, and Cloke have made notable contributions
in this area; their research also covers a wide range of related
topics in inorganic chemistry and all elements of the periodic
table.  A common theme is the use of bulky organic groups in alkyls,
alkoxides, amides, or phosphorus compounds to facilitate isolation
of compounds with unusual structures and properties.  Work on
solid state chemistry has been developed by Dr K Prassides.

Research on complex organic molecules isolated from plants and organisms was initiated 
in the 1960s. The reputation of the School in this area has been built on the research of Professor McCapra on chemi- and bio- luminescence,<A /faculty/dwy/"> Professor D. W. Young</A>
 on the interaction of drugs with target enzymes and<A HREF="/faculty/jrh/">
 Dr. J. R. Hanson</A> on phytochemistry. The stimulating intellectual environment led 
 Professor Sir J. W. Cornforth winner of the Nobel Prize in 1975, to choose to hold his Royal 
Society Professorship within the School. There have also been notable contributions by 
members of the School to physical organic chemistry and the study of reaction mechanisms.

<P>
It is recognised that metalloenzymes are a ubiquitous group of materials involved in a wide range
of biological reactions. A principal interest is the conversions of small molecules and ions in the
nitrogen cycle, including N<SUB>2</SUB>, N0, N<SUB>2</SUB>0, N0<SUB>3</SUB>-,
 and N0<SUB>2</SUB>-. Many of these conversions are
mediated by metalloenzymes, but the detailed chemistry of reactions such as the conversion of N<SUB>2</SUB>
in to NH<SUB>3</SUB> (nitrogen fixation) aild the conversion of N0<SUB>2</SUB>- in to
 N<SUB>2</SUB>0 is not understood. We
therefore study model reactions of complexes containing the metal elements at the heart of the
relevant metalloenzymes, particularly Fe, V, and Cu. Thus we have shown how iron complexes
can mediate the conversion of N<SUB>2</SUB> in to NH<SUB>3</SUB>, and how 
N<SUB>2</SUB> bridging between vanadium atoms can
also produce ammonia. We wish to learn more about the function of N0 in biological systems, and
have investigated new methods for the oxidation of N<SUB>2</SUB> and the reduction of N0. Consequently we
are learning more about how these simple materials react, but we have also uncovered novel
aspects of coordination chemistry, such as a high-spin square-planar complex of iron(II) and
polymeric materials based upon vanadium-oxygen chains.

Our interests lie in the synthesis, reactivity, and electronic
structure of organometallic and coordination compounds of the
d-, f-, and p-block elements in novel oxidation states/ligand
environments.  One of our main synthetic strategies is the use
of metal vapour synthesis, e.g. in the preparation of (i) the
first zero oxidation state complexes of scandium, yttrium, and
the lanthanide elements (e.g. <B>1</B> and photograph), compounds
which are of fundamental interest in terms of their structure,
magnetic properties, and bonding, as well as being very active
homogeneous and heterogeneous olefin polymerisation catalysts;
(ii) new classes of organometallic sandwich compounds, such as
the bis(-butadiene)metal complexes <B>2</B>; and (iii) p-block
complexes, such as the first monomeric Al(II) complex <B>3</B>,
which also have potential application in chemical vapour deposition.
 In more &quot;conventional&quot; areas, we are exploring the
potential of the new ligand.
<P>
1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-cyclooctatetraene for the synthesis of
cationic early transition metal alkyl derivatives, e.g. <B>4</B>,
which are key intermediates in Ziegler-Natta catalysis.  Novel
early transition metal and f-element alkyls and hydrides, e.g.
<B>5</B> and <B>6</B>, are also being examined as homogeneous
catalysts for copolymerisation of polar olefins.  Most recently,
in collaboration with Dr G A Lawless, we have embarked on a programme
to study the interactions of highly Lewis acidic organometallic
complexes with small molecules (e.g<I>.</I> CH4, H2, N2) in supercritical
xenon solution by high-pressure NMR spectroscopy.

The first is the synthesis and characterisation of novel organometallicspecies, particularly those involving low oxidation states or exhibitingcatalytic activity. Our programme concentrates on derivatives of GroupsI, II, IV, XIV, the lanthanides and the actinides. In addition to carbon-basedligands we employ Si-, Sn-, O-, N-, and P-centred groups. Among the catalyticreactions under investigation are olefin polymerisation, hydrosilylation,and methane activation. </P><P>Our second main area of investigation is solid and solution state multinuclearNMR studies of some of the above systems. We are particularly interestedin the observation of hitherto undetected nuclei, e.g. 169Tm, and the useof supercritical fluids as solvents for NMR experiments. Our supercriticalexperiments are carried out in sapphire NMR tubes which permit gases tobe compressed beyond their critical pressure (typically 100 - 200 atm).We have employed supercritical Xe in C-H activation studies, supercriticalCO2 as an alternative &quot;green&quot; solvent for polymerisation reactionsemployed by industry. Many of these projects have associated industrial sponsors. <P>

Current activity centres around synthetic, structural, and spectroscopic studies of novel phosphorus
compounds and their ligating behaviour towards transition metals.

In recent years it has become apparent that phosphorus has an exceptional ability to mimic the
chemistry of carbon. It is now possible to synthesise stable phosphorus analogues of the better
known unsaturated hydrocarbon 7r-complexes which have been responsible for the rapid
development of organotransition metal chemistry and its importance in homogeneous catalysis.
The ligating properties of compounds containing phosphorus-carbon multiple bonds were examined
for the first time at Sussex and now a wide variety of complexes have been synthesised and
structurally characterised. A recent extension has led to the first examples of 11 l-ligated XP=NR
and [P-NR]+ systems and the syntheses of novel 'cage' compounds such as As4C4But4 and
P6C6But6. These compounds may have importance both in catalysis and as precursors for a
variety of new materials.

develop and understand them from the perspective of both the inorganic and organic chemist.
We are thus keen to hear from any potential graduate students who might otherwise find 
themselves bored in either single field and who would like to work in our multi - disciplinary group.
There is considerable potential for industrial support of our studentships.

lead to the peaceful uses of uranium metal. So far out work has encompassed polymer catalysis,
small-molecule activation and mixed-valence systems. In the process of our work we occasionally
stumble across some pretty awesome activity. This programme is hard but offers excellent
training for those interested in modern organometallic and coordination chemistry.

<P>
Many fungi produce biologically-active metabolites, some of which are useful as, for example,
antibiotics, tumour-inhibitory substances, or plant-growth regulators. The biosynthetic
pathways
leading to these metabolites have been shown to have some substrate flexibility, allowing the
organism to bio-transform substances similar to their natural biosynthetic intermediates.
Information accrues from these biosynthetically directed transformations on the
stereo-electronic
requirements of specific enzymatic steps. However the rules that govern the extent of this substrate
flexibility are unknown. It is the object of our research to establish these in the context of the
biosynthesis of the tumour-inhibitor aphidicolin, the gibberellin plant growth regulators, and some
antibiotics from <I>Gliocladium</I> and <I>Penicillium</I> species. Current studies concern the overlap
between the regiospecificity of steroid hydroxylations and biosynthetic hydroxylations, the factors
that govern methyl group hydroxylations, and the use of biosynthetically-directed sesquiterpenoid
cyclisations.

There is currently interest in the chemical modification of the steroid hormones to produce
compounds that inhibit specific enzymes involved in prostate disease and breast cancer. In this
context research is in progress to introduce on to the steroid framework functionality associated
with the tumour inhibitory properties of aphidicolin and related diterpenoids. These synthetic
studies, particularly with conformationally rigid structures, also allow us to examine the stereo-
electronic features that govern various chemical reactions.

A wide range of mechanistic and synthetic problems in free radical chemistry is being studied.
<P>
Organosilicon radicals show completely different reactivity from carbon-centred radicals:
addition takes place to the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group, and halogen atoms are extracted 
from organic halides. The differences can be utilized for example in a method of making specific
alkyl radicals from halides and in synthetic procedures for dehydroxylation  and decarboxylation.
<P>
Radical reactions on zeolites are being explored: the narrow channels constrain
organic molecules causing different positional selectivity that we intend to exploit
synthetically.
<P>
Substituents can stabilize or destabilize ions; most substituents stabilize radicals.
A new scale of substituent constants is needed, and we have suggested a Hammett-type scale
based on the decomposition of substituted dibenzylmercurials. EPR studies of substituted benzylic radicals also provide information about radical stabilization.
<P>
We have developed computer methods for the
objective analysis of complex EPR spectra, even for weak spectra where
individual lines are difficult to identify.  Stabilization effects in phenoxyl radicals have been 
studied and related to biological antioxidants such as Vitamin E. <I>Para</I>-substituted 2,6-di-<I>tert</I>-butylphenoxyl radicals are
also models for the active site in ribonucleotide reductase enzymes; we are investigating the
chemistry of such radicals with a view to discovering reductase inhibitors.
<P>
The (radical) reactions involved in the production and destruction of 
benzene in combustion of automobile fuels are being studied using deuterium-labelled hydrocarbons; mechanistic insight may 
lead to lower levels of emissions.
<P>
In collaboration with Dr Steve Armes we have just initiated a project on novel capping agents for living radical polymerisations.

There is a need to deposit films of germanium and silicon from volatile precursors at low temperatures
to avoid degradation of the substrate surface. Germanium and Silicon hydrides ( currently used) present 
corrosion and handling problems. Alkyl  derivatives overcome these but thermally are too stable.
We find that towards excimer (UV) photolysis the alkyl derivatives are <ITALIC>less</ITALIC>
stable than the hydrides owing to their grater molecular cross-section. The potential for depositing
films at ambient temperature that this presents is being investigated and developed.
<P>
The closed  - cage  carbon molecules (fullerenes) are at the centre of chemists' attention worldwide
At Sussex the first pure samples of C<SUB>60</SUB> and C<SUB>70</SUB> were isolated, 
and the colours of these materials discovered, and their structures were determined by 
<SUP>13</SUP>C NMR spectroscopy. Current research (in 
collaboration with<A HREF="/faculty/hwk/"> H. W. Kroto</A> 
and<A HREF="/faculty/drmw/"> D. R. M. Walton</A>)
 includes isolation and characterisation  of higher fullerenes, and investigation of the reactions of
 C<SUB>60</SUB> and  C<SUB>70</SUB>, e.g. hydrogenation and
halogenation, photocatalysed oxidation, cycloaddition (2 + 2 and 2+ 4), arylation,  hydroboration and
hydroxylation. The aim is both to determine the reactivity behaviour of the cages and the addition 
patterns associated with them, and to derivatise them, thereby providing pathways for the 
formation of novel compounds. The exceptional acidity of the fullerenes (partially hydrogenated
fullerenes) is being investigated through base-catalysed hydrogen exchange. Studies of hydrogen 
exchange in related aromatic hydrocarbons are also in progress.

Current research activity centres on understanding the mode of action of drugs and 
the design and synthesis of compounds which should be active as drugs. 
This involves stereospecific synthesis including the design of new synthetic 
methodology and the investigation of the mechanism of action of key target
enzymes
<P>
The group was the first to discover the stereochemistry of the ring closure
step which gives the &beta;-lactam ring in the antibiotic penicillin (<B> 1</B>)
and is currently involved in the synthesis of antibacterial compounds 
acting on the penicillin target enzymes. Crucial discoveries have been made
of differences in the docking of the cancer drug methotrexate ( <B>2</B>) and the 
natural substrate at the active site of a cancer target enzyme dihydrofolate 
reductase. Work on thymidylate synthase has led to a chemical model for this 
important enzyme and current work centres on understanding how the 'suicide 
substrate' 5-flourouracil ( <B>3</B>) inhibits the enzyme in a process important 
to cancer chemotherapy. Stereochemical aspects of enzymes involved in the 
synthesis of antibiotics and in the catabolism of DNA, RNA and the anti-cancer
drug 5-flourouracil ( <B>3</B>) have been discovered. Current work in this area 
centres on the metabolism of D-amino acids that are common in bacteria but 
not in man. Investigation of inhibition of these processes may lead to development of antibacterial drugs.
<P>
Synthetic studies involve asymmetric synthesis of new amino acids and new
methods of synthesis of glutamate agonists and antagonists which are important
as potential central nervous system drugs. Studies on conformational aspects of 
peptide interaction centre on medicinally important peptides and work on 
peptide mimetics should furnish information on drug - receptor interactions.

<H4>Carbon Networks</H4><P>
The coupling of silyl-protected alkynes e.g. R3SiC=CH to sp,sp<SUP>2</SUP> and sp<SUP>3</SUP> 
carbon systems provides a versatile route to substrates such as (1) -
(4), which in turn can be used to generate planar or three-dimensional
carbon networks. These networks act as valuable precursors to a wide
range of useful materials including novel hetrocycles, polymers
(including dendrimers) and metal (PI)-complexes. Reactions, especially
those involving cycloadditions to the alkyne moieties, provide a
valuable insight into the electron distribution and polarisability of
extended conjugated systems.

I am interested in a broad range of problems in theoretical chemistry, 
including the theory of atomic and molecular collisions, valence theory
and inter atomic forces acting in molecules and solids.

The main emphasis in current research is on the structure of solids and
solid surfaces and the relationship between these and the structures of
microclusters.

We have recently derived a new method for determining the potentials in
atomic solids from vibrational (phonon) data and have shown that this
can be applied equally well to metals and non-metals. These potentials
give very satisfactory predictions for the geometries of clusters. For 
example, a carbon potential determined from diamond and graphite gives
a good picture of linear, planar and fullerene carbon clusters. Typical
of our metal results is that for Ca. We reproduce the phonon spectrum of
both known solid phases (fcc and bcc) and get a good picture of the
reaction path between these two.

Lasers of all forms have had a revolutionary impact on the borderlines
between chemistry and physics.  They bring a new experimental
dimension that allows us to probe the fundamental principles of
science.  Our group uses laser methods, particularly laser spectroscopy
of small molecules, to investigate the physical principles that
govern chemical processes.
<P>
 
<P>
(i)  New spectroscopic methods have been developed for obtaining
the state-to-state differential scattering cross-section in non-reactive
and reactive collisions from high resolution double resonance
spectroscopy.  This method is used to investigate elementary chemical
processes in the gas phase.
<P>
 
<P>
(ii)  Collision-induced processes in molecules may be governed
by the probability of <I>angular momentum</I> transfer, the probability
of energy change being less important.  This fundamentally new
principle is investigated experimentally and theoretically through
quantum state resolved experiments on small molecules.
<P>
 
<P>
(iii)  Dynamical processes at the surface of atomic and molecular
liquids are investigated using molecular beam/laser studies with
small molecules as probes.  Both kinetics and dynamics of molecular
adsorption and desorption at liquid surfaces are revealed by this
novel study.
<P>
 
<P>
(iv)  Guided wave optics in solids has great potential for novel
devices in the rapidly developing field of optoelectronics.  Lasing
action has already been achieved and frequency doubling has been
demonstrated in ion-implanted optical waveguides in this project
with Professor P Townsend from Physics.

The study of clusters provides an opportunity to investigate the
ways in which chemical and physical properties of substances develop
as a function of size.  Current programmes involve some of the
fundamental questions concerning materials: for example, how many
metal atoms are required to construct an electrical conductor,
and can a finite collection of atoms or molecules adopt the same
crystalline structure as that observed for the bulk material?
<P>
 
<P>
We have designed and developed a broad range of procedure for
generating and probing the properties of finite collections of
atoms and molecules (clusters) in the gas phase. By use of a variety
of techniques centred on supersonic expansion, clusters of the
form Arn, (H2O)n, (C6H6)n, Aln, Hgn, etc. can be generated for
n in the range 2 - 1000 and detected by advanced mass spectrometric
methods.  Infrared and visible lasers are used to investigate
the physical properties of the clusters, and visible and UV lasers
are used to promote chemical reactions in pure and mixed clusters,
such as (C4H6)n+ and Arn.C4H6+.  Of particular interest in the
latter case are the steric constraints imposed on the fragmentation
pattern of the molecular ion by a &quot;matrix-like&quot; environment.
<P>
 
<P>
New apparatus has been developed for studying the structure and
decay dynamics of cluster and molecular ions.  In these experiments,
neutral photofragments act as &quot;messengers&quot; giving information
about the time scale and energetics of particular decay processes;
a detailed study of the structures of small inert gas cluster
ions, i.e. Ar3+, Kr3+ etc., is in progress.

Research is focused on conducting polymer colloids. We are studying <I>namocomposites</I> of 
air-stable conducting polymers such as polyaniline and polypyrrole with inorganic particles, typically silica.
Polymerisation in the presence of a dispersion of 20 nm inorganic particles gives a colloid with a 
"raspberry" morphology (See Figure below). These composites have a unique combination of chemical
and physical properties and are expected to find applications in antistatic paints, immunodiagnostic
assays and camouflage. One of the main aims of the research is to establish structure-property 
relations as well as to develop new applications.
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="spa1.gif"><P>
<H3>Collaborative Research</H3><P>
The aim is to develop novel methods for producing polymers with controlled architecture.
<P>
Group - transfer polymerisation is utilised to make narrow distribution homo - and co - polymers and
block copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic  monomers, particularly statistical and block copolymers
containing acid groups. With low concentrations of acid groups the polymers are dispersants for
inorganic particles and are proving very effective in ceramics processing. Higher acid content
gives membranes which combine good mechanical properties with high permeability to ions.
<P>
We are also producing water -  and organic - soluble monodisperse, amphiphilic block copolymers
containing acidic and base groups in the same molecule. Their phase-separation is being studied
in both solid and solution in order to develop applications as dispersants, viscosity modifiers, drug
delivery systems and membranes. Living cationic polymerisation of vinyl ethers is also being used
to prepare water - soluble homo - and block polymers with interesting properties.<P>
We are also (in collaboration with<A HREF="/faculty/fgnc/"> Professor F. G. N. Cloke</A>)
developing new lanthanide catalysts for synthesis of previously inaccessible copolymers of ethane
and acrylic monomers.<P>

There has been a long standing interest in the physical chemistry of degradation and stabilisation
of polymers, in solubility and diffusion of small molecules in polymers and thermosetting resins.
<P>
Most organic polymers emit very low levels of light as a result of their oxidation. We have developed
the application of this<I> chemiluminescence</I> as a method for detecting oxidative degradation
before failure and trying to predict lifetimes of service use. We are currently investigating high - 
sensitivity camera for imaging of oxidative degradation.<P>
We have also developed applications of U. V. and flourescence microscopy to study localised
degradation and the distribution and migration of stabilising additives. Current interests are in
effects of polymer structure on the solubility and diffusion of stabilising additives and in equilibration 
of additives between phases in polymer blends and it's effect on stability. The last problem has many 
implications for the recycling of mixed plastic wastes.

<STRONG>Hello and a warm welcome to my home page.</STRONG>
<H1>Phil Chitty</H1>At work, I am responsible for the running of the Computer Workshop. I report directly to the Laboratory Resources
 Manager. I also look after the range of Apple Macintosh Computer's that we have in the school.
<P> Environmental monitoring is also another of my interests.
As a member of the Remote Imaging Group, I have set up a Weather
Satellite Receiving station in the Environmental Science room (MOLS
stage 2).<P> I have helped to set up a  3rd year U.G. project using a
special kite to lift atmospheric pollution monitoring equipment. The
observation of Ultra  Violet Radiation resulting from changes in the
Ozone layer is also being carried out.<P>

<hr>
<A NAME="Train"><H2>By Train</H2>
</A>
Book through to Falmer Railway Station which is immediately opposite
the University entrance. Some trains on the Coastway line east of
Brighton run direct to Falmer, but travellers from London and on most
other lines will need to change at Brighton or Lewes. Falmer Station
is well served by frequent local trains from Brighton and Lewes (about
eight minutes from either direction) which run until about midnight.
 <P>
<HR>
<A NAME="Coach"><H2>By Coach</H2>
</A>
Coaches to Brighton leave Victoria every 90 minutes from 0900 hours.
The coach arrives in Brighton Pool Valley Bus Station and you should
then take a <A HREF="#Bus">bus</A> to the campus.
 <P>
<hr>
<A NAME="Bus"><H2>By Bus</H2>
</A>
Bus numbers 28, 128 and 729 travel between Brighton (Old Steine) and
Lewes and stop outside the University; bus number 25 runs between
Brighton (Old Steine) and the University and comes to the North end of
Campus.
 <P>
<HR>
<A NAME="Car"><H2>By Car</H2>
</A>
The University is on the main A27 road between Brighton and Lewes,
about four miles (six kilometers) from the centre of Brighton and the
same distance from Lewes. Visitors driving from London should take the
M23/A23, coming off at Patcham to join the A27 eastbound towards
Lewes. Drivers from the West should take the A27 direct to the
University; from the East they should go to Lewes and follow the signs
for Brighton. Visitors may use any of the designated car parks (see <A HREF=  
"/images/Campus.jpg">map</A>) but
should note that the car parks are open and unattended. Cars should be
locked and objects of value should not be left in them.
 <P><HR>
<A NAME="Taxi"><H2>By Taxi</H2>
</A>
Taxis are available at Brighton and Lewes Railway Stations and in
central Brighton, but please note that there is no taxi service at
Falmer Station.
 <P>
<HR>
<A NAME="Air"><H2>By Air</H2>
</A>
If there is a choice of airport, it is advisable to fly to London
(Gatwick) since it is closer to the University than London (Heathrow).
<P>
From Gatwick take the train to Brighton or Lewes and change for
Falmer.
 <P>
From Heathrow take the Underground (London Transport) to Victoria
Railway Station and then take the train to Brighton or Lewes and on to
Falmer; or take the airport bus to Gatwick and go on by train from
there. <P>
<HR>
<A NAME="Sea"><H2>By Sea</H2></A>
From Newhaven, take the train direct to Falmer. From Portsmouth or
Southampton, take the train to Brighton and change there for Falmer.
From all other ports, take the train to London and travel from
Victoria via Brighton or Lewes

coming to Sussex to take a Masters degree in Medicinal Chemistry. I now
work for Dr. Steve Caddick and I am in the second year of my D.Phil. which
is essentially exploring methods of stereoselectively manipulating racemic
substrates to give products of enriched stereoisomeric composistion. This
is typically achieved by either transforming the racemate into a prochiral
reactive intermediate which then undergoes a stereoselective reaction or
by a dynamic resolution of the racemate, which requires the stereogenic
centre in the starting material.to be optically labile. A resolution process
(e.g. kinetic or preferential crystallisation) differentiates between the
two stereoisomers and the epimerisation equilibration allows the overall
transformation to proceed to give chirally enriched material in greater
than 50% yield.</font></font></p>

<p><b><font COLOR="#FFFFFFFF"><font SIZE=+1>It has been known for many
years that an insulating material can be heated by the application of a
high frequency electromagnetic wave. Organic chemistry is an area to which
microwaves have been found to be beneficial, in that they have been found
to increase the rate of reaction times and in many cases also increase
the yield of the reactions. The purpose of this project is to investigate
the effect of microwave radiation on a range of free radical based transformations,
with regards to the effect on the efficiency of a range of stereoselective
free radical reactions and also on the effect of tin mediated inter and
intra radical reactions. The first objection of the project, however, was
to examine the Baylis-Hillman reaction to see what effect microwave irradiation
would have on itís reaction rate and yield. The control of relative stereochemistry
in organic reactions is very important. The second objective of the project
was to use the microwave oven to attempt to control the stereochemistry
in the radical mediated allylation reaction of phenyl-2-bromo-3-methoxybutyrate
formed from the methoxybromination of methyl-trans-cinnamate. </font></font></b></p>

<p><i><font SIZE=+2>Hi I'm Val, I'm a final year D.Phil. student and I
work for Dr. Steve Caddick at the University of Sussex. My undergraduate
degree was in Chemistry with Business at Kingston, but I decided business
was just too boring to contemplate for life and so here I am working on
the total synthesis of a novel anti-cancer agent, namely the Neocarzinostatin
chromophore.....exciting stuff, huh?.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font SIZE=+2>For those of you thinking she's working on what?, here's
a little background info:</font></i></p>

<p><i><font SIZE=+2>Neocarzinostatin is a member of the class of naturally
ocurring enediyne anti-tumour anti-bacterial agents, which also includes
Calicheamicin and Dynemicin. It occurs naturally as a biologically active
chromophore bound to its apo-protien which provides it with transport and
stability. </font></i></p>

<p><i><font SIZE=+2>Neocarzinostatin's potent anti tumour activity along
with its interesting mode of action has led to much academic interest recently,
but there has yet to be a complete synthesis of the chromophore.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font SIZE=+2>My approach to the synthesis of the A &amp; B rings
of Neocarzinostatin (as outlined below in green, click on the diagram if
you want more detail) is based on a novel Pd mediated cyclisation.</font></i></p>

<center><p><b><i><font SIZE=+3>Model Studies Directed Towards the Asymmetric
Synthesis of the Neocarzinostatin Chromophore. </font></i></b></p></center>

<p><font SIZE=+1><b><i>Introduction</i></b> Neocarzinostatin Chromophore
A (<b><i><a href="ncsbig1.gif">NCS Chrom A, 59k .gif image</a></i></b>)is
part of a family of naturally occurring enediyne anti-cancer antibiotics.
They have received much attention due to their potent biological activities
and novel modes of action. We were intrigued by the structural complexity
of NCS Chrom A, which to date has eluded total synthesis. Our work has
been focused on developing an asymmetric route to the A ring of NCS chrom
A, utilising a novel silyl cuprate based methodology. We will show how
a successful model study led us to tackle the real system. Discussion The
retrosynthetic analysis that we envisaged for NCS chrom A (below) shows
that the A ring portion 1 was a key intermediate. </font></p>

<center><p><img src="web1.gif" border=0 height=267 width=900></p></center>

<p><font SIZE=+1><b><i>Model Study</i>.</b> We decided to make a model
A ring precursor containing one hydroxy functionality. The known compound
2 was readily converted to the acetylenic aldehyde. </font></p>

<center><p><img src="web2.gif" border=0 height=142 width=871></p></center>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The aldehyde was subsequently treated with TMS cuprate
to yield the cyclised product 3 in 35%. The real system. Encouraged by
this result we proceeded with the real system. The strategy employed was
the use of the Sharpless Asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction (A.D.) as
the means of introduction of the two hydroxy groups, with the correct relative
and absolute stereochemistry. To this end, the enynol 4 and its TMS deprotected
counterpart were protected with various groups and treated both forms of
the A.D. Mix. Our results indicated that the PMP protecting group gave
the best result with diol 5 being prepared in 90% yield. </font></p>

<center><p><img src="web3.gif" border=0 height=146 width=928></p></center>

<p><font SIZE=+1>After suitable protection, deprotection and oxidation,
the diol aldehyde was treated with our cuprate reagent and initial results
indicate the presence of cyclised product 6. In conclusion, we have developed
an asymmetric route to the A ring of our target molecule, which is suitably
substituted to allow further elaboration. </font></p>

<CENTER><H2>What is SPIS Webview?</H2></CENTER>
<P>SPIS Webview is an <I>offline</I> web page browser. That means you can use it any time you like, on any computer you like <I><B>without having a connection to the Internet!</B></I>

<P>Here are four excellent reasons to use Webview:
<OL>
<LI>It's small -- under 800K -- so if you need to visit someone to show them some web pages, you could fit Webview <I>and</I> the pages on a single floppy disk!
<LI>No fiddly connection problems. While it <I>is</I> possible to use most regular web browsers without an Internet connection, it can sometimes be a tricky and time-consuming job persuading them to do so.
<LI>It's capable. Currently, Webview supports most of the HTML 2.0 specifications and many of the more popular HTML 3.0 features, as well as having <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">some useful extensions for Windows,</FONT> such as being able to play Windows sound files directly, or run external programs.
<LI>It's adaptable. In addition to using Webview's standard and optional features, you can have <A HREF="../pin.htm#SPIS">SPIS Ltd</A> make you personalised, custom versions of Webview for purposes such as:
      <UL>
      <LI>Sample disks for web sites or for other software
      <LI>Scripted (automated) demonstrations
      <LI>Offline publishing using HTML
      <LI>Surveying or remote data entry (with the web forms used to collect and save the information)
     </UL>
</OL>
<P>We encourage you to try SPIS Webview out by <A HREF="#Downloads">downloading a copy</A>, looking at the sample pages that come with it and, of course, at your own favourite web pages.

<ul>
<li>Webview can now recognise .avi and .mid files and call the Windows Media Player to play them automatically
<li>Webview can now save the HTML page as Text, automatically stripping the HTML Tags 
<li>Now handles Client Side image maps 
<li>Webview can now display html documents larger than 32K
<li>Image sizing (using width and height)
<li>Horizontal rule width Size and Width attributes supported
<li>Table widths can now be specified in Pixel dimensions
<li>The &lt;TABLE&gt; tags now recognise bgcolor, bordercolor attributes
<li>PLAIN attribute added to the &lt;UL&gt; tag to remove bullet points
<li><a href="WVOption.htm#Scripts">Scripts</a> now support setting a background .wav file that will play while the rest of your demonstration isbeing displayed. 
<li>Better control over your script via "SingleStepOn" "SingleStepOff" and "Stop" commands
</ul> 

<H3>Additions in earlier versions:</H3>
<ul>
<li>We've increased the size of the history list to 15
<li>Faster handling of files on floppy disks
<li>Optional Print, Home, and Contents buttons. These can be set via entries in the Setups section of the Webview.ini file:<br>[Setups]
<br>HomeButton=1<br>PrintButton=1<br>ContentsButton=0
<LI>IMG and Header (Hn) tags now support the Align attribute 
<LI>Added support for a few additional tags such as <SMALL>SMALL</SMALL> and <BIG>BIG,</BIG> <SUP>SUP</SUP> and <SUB>SUB</SUB>
<LI>Table cells can now have background colours (e.g. &lt;TD BGColor="Red"&gt;)
<LI>New "Page Load Delay" setting for scripts (see <A HREF="WVOption.htm#Scripts">Scripted demonstrations</A>)
<LI>Extra menu options, e.g. File Reload and Close, image cache control on the Options menu
<LI>You can define "Helper Applications" for files with particular extensions, e.g. append these lines to your Webview.ini file:<BR>
[Helper Applications]<BR>
DOC=winword.exe  ; a URL with a .DOC  extension will run WinWord to show the document.
</UL>



<P>We've added several optional features which are great for those using Webview for training, demonstrations and offline applications. You won't find them all in any other browser!
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="WVOption.htm#Editor">Built-in text editor.</A> How better to learn (or teach) HTML and tweak and improve your pages than with a simple text editor built right into your browser?
<LI><A HREF="WVOption.htm#Scripts">Scripted demonstrations.</A> You can now tell Webview to automatically display a set of pages (even sections within pages) in sequence. You can control the rates at which pages scroll and load, whether or not the user can pause the demonstration -- there's even a single step mode!
<LI><A HREF="WVoption.htm#Compress">Page compression.</A> Another great bonus for distributing demonstration sites. Use this to benefit from the 3 "S's" -- Speed, Security and Size.  Our optional page compression utility will let you compress your entire web site into a single archive, reducing the disk space required by 20-50%. Not only that, but page display from the archive will be significantly faster than from ordinary pages on CDROM or floppy disk, and the user will <I>not</i> be able to directly edit or view them.
<LI><A HREF="WVOption.htm#CGI">Local CGI</A>. Who needs a server to run web applications? When your users push a form button, Webview can now call any external program, pass it the information from the form <I>and</I> optionally wait for a response page to be generated. Ideal for search engines, data logging or Web site simulation!
</UL>
<P>All the above options are <B>enabled</B> in the <A HREF="#Downloads">evaluation version</A> so you can try them out. In addition, we've made the following universal improvements (some were introduced in earlier versions):
<P><UL>
<LI>(New in v2.5) Add CDROM=Yes to the [Setups] section of Webview.ini, and Webview will happily run from a CDROM or write-protected disk.
<LI>(New in v2.5) Webview can now be set up as the default browser by great HTML editors such as <A HREF="http://www.csdcorp.com/webber.htm">Webber.</A> This is because only one copy of Webview will be loaded into memory at any one time, which means you can easily flip back and forth between the HTML editor and Webview.
<LI>Images are now cached, so they load faster second time around</LI>
<LI>All Options menu information is preserved between sessions (unless the CDROM setting is in effect, see above)</LI>
<LI>PNG images are now supported</LI>
<LI>Transparent GIFs are now supported</LI>
<LI>BMP files can be displayed transparently by adding the non-standard <B>TRANSP</B> attribute to your &lt;IMG SRC&gt; statements. The colour of the bottom-left pixel of the image determines the transparent colour.</LI>
<LI>Links which directly load images are now supported</LI>
<LI>Several other aspects of image display have been improved</LI>
<LI>Copy and Select All options have been added to the Edit menu</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Coming in future versions:</B>a sample search engine application, new HTML features (e.g. imagemaps) and more besides!

<LI><A HREF="wv2all.zip">Webview 2.8 and sample pages (786K)</A> -- a full run-through with many examples
<LI><A HREF="wv2.zip">Webview 2.8 only (464K)</A> -- enough to run it with your own pages (most links from the sample Webview home page to the "Special Features" pages won't work)
<LI><A HREF="wv2demos.zip">Webview 2.8 demo pages (321K)</A> -- the compressed pages omitted from the "Webview only" download, in case you want to come back for them later...
</UL>
<P>Once you've downloaded the file you chose, unzip it into a directory of your choice, and use either <B>Program Manager's File|Run</B> (Windows 3.x) or <B>Start|Run</B> (Win95) to launch the Webview.exe program -- it will display a page similar to this one with many example links on it.
<P><B>Note:</B> if you currently have Webview 2.0, delete IMLIB221.DLL before unzipping V2.8 -- the old DLL has been supplanted by one with a different name.
<P>Enjoy!

<CENTER><H2>What is SPIS WebWatch?</H2></CENTER>
<P>WebWatch is a site monitor program which will
regularly and automatically request pages from any sites you like,
and take corrective or notification action if any are "down", invalid or can't be contacted.

<P>Web sites are now a critical information tool for many businesses -- critical to the businesses <I>owning</I> the sites, and to those who provide Web site services.

<P>Unfortunately, the Internet is a complex organism, and prone to failure. Connections get lost, domain names get "mislaid", servers go down and with automated Web sites there are yet more layers which <I>might</I> go wrong.

<P>WebWatch keeps an eye not just on connections (which any <B>ping</B> program can do), but also on the servers and any Web site applications behind them... Above all, it does so in an automated fashion, running the checks every minute, every hour -- as often as you need.

<P>We encourage you to try SPIS WebWatch out by <A HREF="#Downloads">downloading a copy,</A> looking at the help file and sample control file that comes with it and, of course, using it to monitor your own Web site!
<P><A HREF="#Downloads">Download</A> a copy.<BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Features"><IMG SRC="images/rainbowb.gif" 
HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>What can WebWatch do?</H2></CENTER>

Here are <B>seven</B> good reasons to use WebWatch:
<OL>
<LI>It can monitor up to 4 (Standard version) or an unlimited number (Extended version) of independent Web sites or URLs, checking them as often as you like.
<LI>It can identify problems including lost connections or server down, bad or lost pages, misbehaving CGI applications, and can even tell you if keywords are missing from the requested page. It also incorporates special checking features for the <A HREF="http://www.href.com">Webhub</A> site automation framework.
<LI>When WebWatch finds something wrong, it can:
  <UL><LI>Log the problem
   <LI>Display it
   <LI>Sound an audible alarm via speaker and sound card
   <LI>Send a warning email (or fax via a faxmail service) to one or more addresses
   <LI>Run an external program on the WebWatch computer (e.g. a phone pager utility)
   <LI>Request another URL from the web server (such as a CGI-DOS URL which runs an on-site program to fix the problem or restart the server)<BR><I>All of these actions can be independently customised for <B>each</B> URL!</I>
</UL>
<LI>It's small (the executable is under 600K) and will run on any WinNT (3.51) or Win95 computer with an active Internet connection.
<LI>Although it is a Windows program, you can use it to effectively monitor Web sites running on <I>any</I> server, <I>anywhere</I> in the world (including on the same machine of course!)
<LI>Regular and flexible reporting options include emailing of  accumulated error logs (if any) access counts and timing information
<LI>And, as a special bonus feature, WebWatch has an option to check all the external links in <I>any</I> file or site document you want -- no more worries about off-site links going astray when they move!
 </OL>
<P>Using WebWatch, you can of course monitor your own sites, but you can also offer a "Site Watch" service monitoring any mission-critical sites out there. So rather than costing you money, WebWatch actually offers you a new revenue-earning opportunity.
<P>ISPs using WebWatch or a Site Watch service will be able to reassure their clients that "our sites are independently monitored every hour of the day -- if something goes wrong, we'll <I>know</I> about it and take action." That's a notable competitive edge...

; Below we define the URLs we want to check, AND their sequence.
; Note that this sequence of URLS *could* be used to automate some
; kind of on-site operation which was set up to be URL-controlled.
; If so, you'd use WebWatch's command-line script override option
; to run a script composed for that purpose,
; e.g. WebWatch UPDATE_SITE.INI
; (it would have a Frequency of 0 for a one-off operation then exit)

UnknownErrorAction=Email2,Alarm  ; As above

IgnorePeriodDuration1=5 ; minutes   (max nine such periods)
Program1=NOTEPAD.EXE    ; this <I>could</I> be a pager program, for example
SendURL1=http://www.NetTravel.co.nz/cgi-dos/rebootme.bat  ; if it can connect, that is!
Fax1=03 384-5138
Match1=/SmartSearch   ; If the word SmartSearch is NOT found on the page, then...
MatchAction1=Program1,SendURL1,Fax1,Alarm  ;  do all this!

TimeoutAction=Email2,Alarm
NoConnectAction=Program1,Email2,Alarm
UnknownErrorAction=Program1,Email2,Alarm

; Here are several actions which are predefined for the <A HREF="http://www.href.com">Webhub</A>
; site automation software
; For other automated sites ,you would use appropriate Match strings and actions
BadURLAction=Email1,Alarm,SendURL1      ; e.g can't find hubws runner... warn/reboot!!!
NoHubAction=Fax1,Email1,Alarm,SendURL1  ; Webhub not loaded
NoAppAction=Fax1,Email1,Alarm,SendURL1  ; Webapp not loaded

<CENTER><H2>Downloading SPIS WebWatch</H2></CENTER>
<P>Before running SPIS WebWatch, you must install the Microsoft Internet Control Pack. You may already have this installed on your computer, especially if you have a version of Internet Explorer 3.0, NT Server 4.0 or Borland Delphi 2.01. Look for <B>httpct.ocx</B> and <B>smtpct.ocx</B> in your Windows System directory. If you don't have those files, you can download the Internet Control Pack now from <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/icp/us/icpmain/icpmaint.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/icp/us/icpmain/icpmaint.htm.</A>

<P><I>(August 2nd, '96: It appears that Microsoft are now omitting the <A HREF="OC30.ZIP">OC30.DLL</A> file from their control pack. If you don't already have that file in your system directory, you'll need it too...)</I>

<P>Once you have the control pack, go ahead and download WebWatch V1.01, unzip it into any directory, and see the help file for information on getting started.  Here are the links:

<P><UL>
<LI><A HREF="webwatch.zip">WebWatch 1.01,</A> including help file and examples (340K)
<LI><A HREF="wwhelp.zip">Just the help file,</A> if you want a quick look first (55K)
<LI><A HREF="OC30.ZIP">OC30.DLL</A> which is no longer in the Internet Control Pack
<LI><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/icp/us/icpmain/icpmaint.htm">Internet Control Pack page, </A> if you don't have it
</UL>
<P><B>Note:</B> Webwatch was updated from 1.0 to 1.01 on July 16th. Apart from minor reporting and user interface improvements (e.g. Alt+A to toggle Auto), the main change is the new DEFAULTACTION setting in the Control file (see help for more information).

<P>WebCentre is <A HREF="../index.htm">our</A> soapbox, from which we earnestly seek to promote the development of responsive, readable and visitor-friendly Web sites in New Zealand. We do this with exhortations, cogent arguments, examples, a touch of humour and the odd bit of rabble rousing (which will naturally pass over the gentle reader).</P>
 
<P>Pet hates and jealousies are not excluded, but we've tried to mute our most trenchant criticisms in the full knowledge that the Web is a frontier, with sheriffs who never leave their office.</P>

<P>WebCentre is also where we (that is, <A HREF="../pin.htm#spis">SPIS Ltd)</A> get to talk about the sites we've done, are doing, and some of our plans for the future. But that's purely incidental.</P>

<P>So, without further ado...</P>

<A NAME="Sites We Made"></A><H2>A Selection of Sites We Have Made (or Remade)</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Takenaka Corporation's English language web site. As we have a long history of dealings in the Japanese market, it was natural that this huge Osaka-based architectural conglomerate would turn to us to make a quality English language site which nevertheless matched (and improved upon) the design standards of their Japanese site.<BR>

<P>The slow ones, the badly spelt, the terrible HTML, the browser-specific, the unresponsive, the lousy navigation, the useless-with-images-off, the no feedback possible, the "must have frames"...</P>

<A Name="Overview"></A><H2>Overview</H2>
<P><B>TCompress</B> provides native Delphi components for the creation of multi-file
compressed archives, as well as database, file and in-memory compression using
Delphi streams.

<P>Two compression methods (RLE and LZH) are built in, with "hooks" for the easy
addition of custom compression formats. Compressed file protection using keys is supported.

<P><B>TCompress</B> also includes drop 'n play components for automatic database blob, 
image and memo compression, based on Delphi's TDBMemo and TDBImage components.

<P>Images compress by up to 98% when using LZH, hence there is a massive saving
in disk space and disk or network access when using these components.

<P><B>TCompress</B> comes with an extensive demonstration, many source examples (including how to make a self-extracting EXE) and Delphi-compatible help and keyword files. Supports Delphi 1.0 and 2.0.

<P><B>Included in the TCompress v2.5 set are:</B>

<P><B>TCompress</B> and its companions provide very comprehensive data
compression capabilities. Most developers might only need to drop a
TCompress component on a form and call its ExpandFile/CompressFile methods in
order to create and work with their own multi-file archives...

<P>Others might drop <B>TCDBMemo/TCDBImage </B>components on as well and simply
interact with them to have text and picture data automatically compressed
when they are stored in a database.

<P>...and some developers might use the <B>TCBlobfield</B> class to store all kinds
of data (sound, numbers, video etc) directly into compressed database
blobs (see the BLOB.DPR demonstration for an example of this).</P>

<A NAME="New in V2.5"></A><H2>New in TCompress V2.5</H2>
<P>Here's what we've added:
<UL>
<LI><B>TargetPath, MakeDirectories</B> and <B>ExceptionOnFileError</B> properties to make expanding files from multi-file archives a one-liner
<LI><B>Key</B> property for protecting compressed data
<LI><B>LoadCompressedResource</B> and <B>LoadExpandedResource</B> functions for extracting compressed resources from your EXE or DLL -- ideal for making self-extracting EXEs
<LI>Fewer dependencies in the Compress unit means much smaller  "no-forms" applications are now possible
<LI>Example applets for self-extracting EXEs and loading compressed bitmaps from your EXE
<LI>Several other minor changes and additions to make your data compression jobs easier
</UL>
<P>As always, we've kept a very high level of backwards compatibility with previous versions. Best of all, <I>for registered TCompress V2.0 users, the upgrade is free of charge.</I>

<P><A HREF="mailto:kmcclain@mindspring.com">Ken McClain</A> has released a new version of his <A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~kmcclain/index.htm">
TSegCompress</A> "wrapper" component for TCompress v2.5. This component lets you split archives into multiple chunks. For example, use <A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~kmcclain/index.htm">
TSegCompress</A> to break an archive into 1.44MB chunks for backing up to floppy disk, and then to splice them all back together.

<P>The new version has some improvements and includes support for Delphi 1.0 and 2.0. Credit card registrations for TSegCompress are now possible by registering through us, or you can register via check with Ken if you prefer.

"I found that best compression rates on large tables are achieved by using first coRLE to squeeze the table quickly into 25% of it's original size and then coLZH to finish it up. It gives the best compression/time ratio and the best compression rate ever: 1,076,152 bytes squeezed down to 39,300bytes." <BR>
<I>Bob Heida (bobtsf@login.cz)</I></P>

<P>"I tweaked the Compress method source so it <I>always</I> puts a header in compressed blobs. Having done that, I can now compress multiple items into a single database field -- very useful if you have a range of information to store in a single record."<BR>
<I>Lee Slater (lees@motelnet.co.nz)</I></P>

<P><A NAME="Reviews"></A><H2>News and Reviews: What TCompress users have said, and what they're doing with it</H2></P>
<P>
"First let me thank you for one of the most well crafted shareware Delphi components I have seen. I greatly appreciate those who have gone the extra step to turn a "program" into a "product....."<BR>
<I>Integral Scientific Software, Fort Collins, CO 80525-1799, USA.</I></P>

<P>"I was, and am still, impressed with the level of service you provided. You went out of your way, even before we bought the product, to work with me (by sending code, examples, etc)... and I really appreciate
it!  Your level of service is extraordinary. I wish that all of the people we dealt with were as accomodating as you."<BR>
<I>Tom Bowden (tom@Rheyn.COM)</I></P>

<P>"It took me less than a day to implement your tcompress in a dll that's backwards API compatible with our old library. It is a god-given control ! (my P120-NT-box made an overnight compression burn-in test. I stopped it this morning with 15731 successfull compression iterations).... (far better than my good old compress.dll and PK libraries)."<BR>
<I>Bob Heida (bobtsf@login.cz)</I></P>

<P>"Thanks for sending TCompress to me. I'm very impressed with it. It is the first component I've found that does what I want it to... and more.I didn't realize you could compress image and memo fields -- that's also a huge advantage for the program I'm working on."<BR>
<I> Mike Yui, Queens University (3mry@qlink.queensu.ca)</I></P>

<P>"We just got a shareware version of TCompress from The Delphi Station - and we love it very much."<BR>
<I>(matej.jaksa@ijs.si  and kres@eunet.si)</I></P>

<P>"Classy stuff!  Well-designed, intuitive.  I was able to use it without a glance at any help or instructions."
<BR> <I>Lou Garner (lou.garner@lunatic.com)</I></P>

<P>"Thank you for an exceptional component."
<BR><I>Graham Colwell (teracomc@mlmpro.com)</I></P>

<P>"I'm using your TCompress in an application I'm developing that communicates with international language translation services.  And BTW, thanks for a GREAT component!  It
seems to find its way into almost everything I do, (hence the need to purchase another license for my day job)."
<BR> <I>David M Trump (dtrump@hach.com)</I></P>

<P>"I was silly enough to try and rescue my schedule by picking up your
compression component last week, and guess what... IT
WORKED WONDERFULLY!<BR>
<P>"Thank you, I absolutely love your component, it saved me a ton of time and
helped me get that app out on time."<BR>
<I>Phillip D. Clark" (phildc@beetu.com)</I>

<P>"Well, I just tested using TCompress with images in Interbase and it works just fine. The trick seems to be to set the TCblobfield size to 1. It's the same you'd write for any other SQL database I think." <BR>
<I>Ricky Engberg (ricky.engberg@microlan.se)</I>

<P>"I appreciate your support... the product [I had to get ready for Comdex] is <A HREF="http://www.mediaminds.com"><I>PictureAlbum for Windows</I></A> (made for Mediaminds Inc)...
<P>"...Tcompress continues to perform well for me. I have included it in <A HREF="http://web2.airmail.net/nunnally">Projector for Windows v4.1,</A> -- a windows screen saver that uses a powerful image engine for the front end and a database for the backend.  Each database is actually 3 files, the database file, a memo file which contains the image blobs, and an index.
<P>"I use Tcompress to archive these files together, so that the user need not be bothered with tracking several files. The database file, which is basically an index, is highly compressible with LZH. One of the things I point out to customers is that my archive files can actually GROW if you try to 'zip' them."

<P>Every issue is stuffed to the gills with the latest in ground-breaking research and technology done right here in New Zealand. We frequently carry information about new research and discoveries <I>two or three years</I> ahead of the mainstream media.

<H3>Great stories!</H3>

<P>We don't pull punches. <A HREF="../people.htm#Vicki">Vicki Hyde's</A> editorials are so pithy, popular and universally relevant that she virtually has a space reserved for her on National Radio's <CITE>Sunday Supplement.</CITE>

<P>Vicki's not alone, either. Our <STRONG>Retorts</STRONG> and <STRONG>Viewpoint</STRONG> pages are alive with debates about everything from possum poisoning to the purpose of science, written by people who <STRONG>care.</STRONG><BR>

<P>Then there's the:</P>
<UL>
<LI>news briefs (<STRONG>Quick Dips</STRONG> and <STRONG>Over the Horizon</STRONG>) that keep you up-to-date with what's happening around the country and overseas</LI>

<LI>features which cover a vast range of topics, from the technology of helping the blind see to the fiery debate on fluoridation, from how extraterrestrial material may have kick-started life on this planet to finding out about pioneering science
in New Zealand's pioneering days</LI>

<LI><STRONG>Spotlight</STRONG> profiles, which show that there's usually a heart and humour to be found under the white coat of the stereotypical scientist</LI>

<LI>science education issues covered in <STRONG>Discovery</STRONG>, from science fair ideas to teacher resource material, student science tours and curriculum extensions</LI>

<LI>puzzles in <STRONG>Neurobics</STRONG> designed to exercise the brain, and the occasional dark humour of the <STRONG>Black Hole</STRONG>

<LI>last (but not least) where else can you get a regular fix of <A HREF="../people.htm#Nick">Nick Kim's</A> weird and wonderful cartoons?</LI>

<P>There was a time when honour was all, a time of courtly love, tournaments fought for a lady's honour, a time when people were respected for the nobility of their characters and the skills of their hands, voices and minds. Once there was a dream of the power of individuals to live by a code of truth and honour.

<P>The dream still lives.

<P>The Society for Creative Anachronism strives to brings the dreams and ideals of the Middle Ages into the present day by actively recreating those aspects of medi&aelig;val life most favourable to the continuation of the dream (but with the benefits of indoor plumbing...).

<P>Now reaching its 30th year, and with 50,000 or so members <A HREF="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~rodmur/sca/
">worldwide</A>, the SCA provides a a welcoming environment where you can make these Current Middle Ages yours to enjoy, whether you're into feasting or fighting in tournaments, costuming or calligraphy, dancing or dalliance. A vast compendium of information about the SCA's Knowne Worlde can be found in the <A HREF="http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/rialto/rialto.html
">Rialto Archive.</A>

<P>While authenticity is encouraged, the SCA is also about fun and fellowship. We may sing 16th-century madrigals, but you might also find us singing the following:

<P align=center>Those men aren't wearing dresses, sir<BR>
Those are not pantyhose<BR>
No, those are tights and tunics, sir<BR>
They're medi&aelig;val clothes<BR>
And men were really macho then<BR>
As everybody knows<BR>
So kindly do not look at us that way, that way<BR>
For we are your local SCA.

<P align=center>(to the tune of <CITE>God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen</CITE>)

<P>New Zealand's first SCA branch, the <A href="http://www.spis.co.nz/spis/phil/southron.htm">Barony of Southron Gaard</A>, is some dozen years old, and there are now groups springing up around the country, ensuring that there will be a feast or fighters' practice, archery shoot or armoury workshop, embroidery meeting or entertaining revel someplace near just about anywhere.

</UL>

<P>In the mid-80s, I spent six inscrutable years in Japan working for a great little computer company which later got swallowed by a giant (Toshiba). Some of my time was spent refereeing a development team consisting of stroppy Kiwis, Irish, Nihonjin, Koreans and one token American. When I wasn't doing that, I was jet-setting all over the world, learning interesting things about the insides of hotels, airports and restaurants.

<P>In '89 <A HREF="/spis/people.htm#Vicki">Vicki</A> and I spent a few fantastic months re-visiting these places, and discovered that they had museums, architecture, scenery and <EM>people!</EM> Then we came home and settled in Christchurch, New Zealand, which is <A HREF="http://WWW.Regy.Canterbury.ac.nz/CH_Promo/HasItAll.html">The Place To Be</A>.

<P>And started <A HREF="/spis/pin.htm#SPIS">this business...</A>

<A NAME="SAT"><H3>What I do with my time:</H3></A>
<P>When working, I <A HREF="/spis/softserv.htm#SoftwareEngineering">design and develop software</A>, generally Windows-based applications these days. Most of this is done using <A HREF="/spis/softserv.htm#Programming">Borland's Delphi and Paradox</A>. At the moment, I'm up to my neck in <A HREF="/spis/softserv.htm">electronic publishing</A> applications, such as presenting databases <A HREF="/spis/softserv.htm#WebPage">on the Web</A>.  I really <I>enjoy</I> this stuff!

<P>Otherwise, I fly whenever the bank balance is almost in the black, travel whenever I can't get away with flying, dress up in funny clothes and pose as a <A HREF="/spis/sca.htm">12th-Century</A> scoundrel, and read endless books to David and Perry. That is, when we're not up on the roof playing petanque.

<P>I write stories too, at least one of which was described as "amusing". It even got published: in <A HREF="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/~thetroll/phlogiston.html"><CITE>Phlogiston.</CITE></A><BR><A HREF="/spis/autotran.htm">I've got proof!</A>

<P>I've also been known to act, but I won't bore you with the reviews...

<H3>Qualifications & Experience:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>BSc (Psychology) BA (Sociology)  </LI>
<LI>Mother of two horribly cute little boys (must be genetics)</LI>
<LI>I've got a big bronze Science and Technology Medal of New Zealand which makes a great paperweight</LI>
</UL>

<P>After abandoning Auckland to start a Canterbury science degree in astrophysics, I wandered through a startlingly diverse range of departments in search of a major, and ended up with the perfect academic background for a science journalist -- I know a little about everything, but not a great deal about anything in particular.

<P>I spent my sojourn in Japan working for a <A HREF="http://www.twics.com/~COMLINE/links.html">
science and technology</A> database and, later, as a science and front-page editor for one of the four main English daily newspapers, <A HREF="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/index-e.htm"><CITE>The Daily Yomiuri.</CITE></A> I also ended up as local correspondent for about a dozen technical magazines, covering broadcasting, telecommunications, energy, ceramics, even shipping and the duty-free industry.

<P>Frustration at the lack of science coverage in the New Zealand media led me to establish the <A HREF="/spis/nzsm/nzsm.htm"><I>New Zealand Science Monthly</I></A> in 1990. While it hasn't exactly led to fame and fortune, we must be doing something right -- we're still going strong!


<H3>What I do with my time:</H3>

<P>Well, there's the <A HREF="/spis/nzsm/nzsm.htm"><I>New Zealand Science Monthly</I></A> and the other regular (and irregular) <A HREF="/spis/editserv.htm">publishing</A> work that I either do or manage as SPIS's managing editor. (If you want to be seen to support New Zealand science and technology, and have dollars to burn in your advertising budget, I want to <A HREF="mailto:nzsm@spis.co.nz">hear from you!)</A>

<P>Then there's being Chair-entity for the <A HREF="/spis/skeptics.htm">New Zealand Skeptics</A>, which involves (among other things) early morning calls from radio stations every Friday 13th. *sigh*

<P>If I'm lucky, I get to put on my 16-gauge steel helm and camail, my breastplate, my padded gambeson, my knee and elbow pads, my groin protection, my puncture-proof trousers and my boots, and go out and shoot arrows at <A HREF="/spis/people.htm#Peter">Peter</A> (see <A HREF="/spis/sca.htm">SCA</A>).

<P>If I'm <I>really</I> lucky, I hit him.

<P>
After a decade or so as a university student and part-time tutor, I sort of drifted bit by bit into a job with this place. Not as much fun, but the money's a bit better and I still don't have to have a haircut or wear shoes.

<H3>What I do with my time:</H3>

<P>Aside from slaving at work, I sleep, read, argue, listen to music, procrastinate, play games... you know, sort of like everyone else really. Some day I may get around to updating this page and doing a comprehensive sloth page.

<P>Some say I only lecture at Waikato's Chemistry department in order to support  my cartooning habit.  However, chocolate and coffee can also be expensive.

<H3>What I do with my time:</H3>

<P>Draw <STRONG>NICK</STRONG> cartoons, inspired mainly by caffeine and theobromine. They are created in a secret home laboratory in the dead of night.

<P>Once born, they discard the host and assume lives of their own, migrating inexorably outward from the point of their birth to seek out potential publishing grounds (such as the <A HREF="/spis/nzsm/nzsm.htm"><CITE>New Zealand Science Monthly.</CITE></A>) I haven't yet observed it, but I suspect that once these things are in your brain, they will begin to replicate, consuming your cognitive juices in their relentless progression to the next horrible stage of their parasitic life-cycle.

<P>The New Zealand Skeptics (NZCSICOP Inc.) form a network of New Zealanders -- including magicians, teachers, scientists, health professionals and many others from all walks of life -- dedicated to increasing public awareness of the dangers and inanities of pseudoscience and bogus paranormal claims.

<P>Through meetings and its regular periodical, the <CITE>New Zealand Skeptic</CITE>, the group encourages informed, critical examination of claims of fringe and quack medicine, astrology, creation "science", alleged extraterrestrial visitations and abductions, psychic phenomena, and associated "New Age" gullibility.

<P>The society also provides speakers, media comment and educational material with the aim of reducing ignorance and encouraging critical thinking. Contacts with Skeptics groups <A HREF="http://www.csicop.org/">around the world</A> means that we are always up-to-date with the <A HREF="http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/~btcarrol/skeptic/dictcont.html">latest in everything</A> from alien abductions to ghost-busting, from shonky statistics to the mis-use and abuse of real science.

      <P>If you want to know what's going on in New Zealand science, have <I>we</I> got a magazine for <I>you!</I>

<P>Every issue is stuffed to the gills with the latest in ground-breaking research and technology done right here in New Zealand. We frequently carry information about new research and discoveries <I>two or three years</I> ahead of the mainstream media.

<H3>Great stories!</H3>

<P>We don't pull punches. <A HREF="../people.htm#Vicki">Vicki Hyde's</A> editorials are so pithy, popular and universally relevant that she virtually has a space reserved for her on National Radio's <CITE>Sunday Supplement.</CITE>

<P>Vicki's not alone, either. Our <STRONG>Retorts</STRONG> and <STRONG>Viewpoint</STRONG> pages are alive with debates about everything from possum poisoning to the purpose of science, written by people who <STRONG>care.</STRONG><BR>

<P>Then there's the:</P>
<UL>
<LI>news briefs (<STRONG>Quick Dips</STRONG> and <STRONG>Over the Horizon</STRONG>) that keep you up-to-date with what's happening around the country and overseas</LI>

<LI>features which cover a vast range of topics, from the technology of helping the blind see to the fiery debate on fluoridation, from how extraterrestrial material may have kick-started life on this planet to finding out about pioneering science
in New Zealand's pioneering days</LI>

<LI><STRONG>Spotlight</STRONG> profiles, which show that there's usually a heart and humour to be found under the white coat of the stereotypical scientist</LI>

<LI>science education issues covered in <STRONG>Discovery</STRONG>, from science fair ideas to teacher resource material, student science tours and curriculum extensions</LI>

<LI>puzzles in <STRONG>Neurobics</STRONG> designed to exercise the brain, and the occasional dark humour of the <STRONG>Black Hole</STRONG>

<LI>last (but not least) where else can you get a regular fix of <A HREF="../people.htm#Nick">Nick Kim's</A> weird and wonderful cartoons?</LI>

<A NAME="About"></A><H2>About WebCentre</H2>

<P>WebCentre is <A HREF="../index.htm">our</A> soapbox, from which we earnestly seek to promote the development of responsive, readable and visitor-friendly Web sites in New Zealand. We do this with exhortations, cogent arguments, examples, a touch of humour and the odd bit of rabble rousing (which will naturally pass over the gentle reader).</P>
 
<P>Pet hates and jealousies are not excluded, but we've tried to mute our most trenchant criticisms in the full knowledge that the Web is a frontier, with sheriffs who never leave their office.</P>

<P>WebCentre is also where we (that is, <A HREF="../pin.htm#spis">SPIS Ltd)</A> get to talk about the sites we've done, are doing, and some of our plans for the future. But that's purely incidental.</P>

<P>So, without further ado...</P>

<A NAME="Sites We Made"></A><H2>A Selection of Sites We Have Made (or Remade)</H2>

<UL>
<LI><A href="www.wpm.co.nz/">Windpower Monthly Magazine</A> -- the world's premiere magazine for those in the business of windpower.

<LI><A HREF= "http://www.nettravel.co.nz/">NetTravel</A> -- a large, database-driven, searchable list of New Zealand accommodation providers, complete with a booking service, and substantial site automation and remote maintenance. Written for <A HREF="whynt.htm">Windows NT</A> using Borland Delphi and <A HREF="Webhub">Webhub.</A>

<LI><A HREF= "http://www.northland.ac.nz/nrc">Northland Regional Council</A>'s multi-level corporate site, with an explanation of what they do, a photo gallery, an educational section and general information about the Northland Region.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.chchpoly.ac.nz/">Christchurch Polytechnic's site</A>. The course and paper pages on this site are regularly generated from a database using <A HREF="webhub.htm">Webhub.</A>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.spis.co.nz/ssb/ssb.htm">South Sea Books,</A> a catalogue and ordering system for used and rare books. The catalogue is automatically updated every two months from the South Sea Books database.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.securicor.co.nz/">SecuriCor 3Net's</A> new corporate web site (formerly known as Network Dynamics)

<LI>The <A href="http://www.spis.co.nz/skeptics.htm">NZ Skeptics</A> -- the group to join if you're tired of New Age claptrap.</LI>

<LI>Takenaka Corporation's English language web site. As we have a long history of dealings in the Japanese market, it was natural that this huge Osaka-based architectural conglomerate would turn to us to make a quality English language site which nevertheless matched (and improved upon) the design standards of their Japanese site.<BR>
<I>(Still under development, in concert with our <A HREF="../pin.htm#MIR">partners</A> in Japan).</I>

</UL>

<A Name= "Sites We Like"></A><H2>Sites We Like</H2>

<P>Most of all, we like sites  that <strong>work</strong> rather than those which just have pretty pictures. But you'll get our attention if the pretty pictures are really <I>interesting,</I> -- like NASA's site for example.

<P>
<A href="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">Alta Vista</A> -- search the world's sites easily. The site we visit most often.<BR>
<A href="http://www.nasa.gov">NASA</A> -- lotsa cool stuff! And it works just fine with images off.<BR>
<A href="http://www.searchnz.co.nz/">SearchNZ</A> -- search all NZ sites easily, a "fuzzy" search
 engine, restricted to New Zealand cyberspace<BR>
</P>

<H2><a Name= "Sites We Hate">Sites We Loathe</A></H2>

<P>The slow ones, the badly spelt, the terrible HTML, the browser-specific, the unresponsive, the lousy navigation, the useless-with-images-off, the no feedback possible, the "must have frames"...</P>

<P><A href="http://wolf.co.net/index.html">Background tiles should not obscure the text</A>. And silly things to do with frames.<BR>
<A href="http://members.tripod.com/~baydolph/index.html">Shouting doesn't help get your message across</A>. Neither does blinking text.</P>

<P>We don't check these every week, so some may have improved since we added the link -- do <A HREF="mailto:peter@spis.co.nz">let us know...</A> If you'd care to nominate a site, we'd be happy to <A HREF="mailto:peter@spis.co.nz">hear about it.</A>
<P>And If you have a sick fascination with bad sites, check out <A href="http://www.mirsky.com/wow/">Mirsky's Worst of the Web</A>.

<CENTER><H2>What is SPIS Webview?</H2></CENTER>
<P>SPIS Webview is an <I>offline</I> web page browser. That means you can use it any time you like, on any computer you like <I><B>without having a connection to the Internet!</B></I>

<P>Here are four excellent reasons to use Webview:
<OL>
<LI>It's small -- under 800K -- so if you need to visit someone to show them some web pages, you could fit Webview <I>and</I> the pages on a single floppy disk!
<LI>No fiddly connection problems. While it <I>is</I> possible to use most regular web browsers without an Internet connection, it can sometimes be a tricky and time-consuming job persuading them to do so.
<LI>It's capable. Currently, Webview supports most of the HTML 2.0 specifications and many of the more popular HTML 3.0 features, as well as having <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">some useful extensions for Windows,</FONT> such as being able to play Windows sound files directly, or run external programs.
<LI>It's adaptable. In addition to using Webview's standard and optional features, you can have <A HREF="../pin.htm#SPIS">SPIS Ltd</A> make you personalised, custom versions of Webview for purposes such as:
      <UL>
      <LI>Sample disks for web sites or for other software
      <LI>Scripted (automated) demonstrations
      <LI>Offline publishing using HTML
      <LI>Surveying or remote data entry (with the web forms used to collect and save the information)
     </UL>
</OL>
<P>We encourage you to try SPIS Webview out by <A HREF="#Downloads">downloading a copy</A>, looking at the sample pages that come with it and, of course, at your own favourite web pages.

<P>We've added several optional features which are great for those using Webview for training, demonstrations and offline applications. You won't find them all in any other browser!
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="WVOption.htm#Editor">Built-in text editor.</A> How better to learn (or teach) HTML and tweak and improve your pages than with a simple text editor built right into your browser?
<LI><A HREF="WVOption.htm#Scripts">Scripted demonstrations.</A> You can now tell Webview to automatically display a set of pages (even sections within pages) in sequence. You can control the rates at which pages scroll and load, whether or not the user can pause the demonstration -- there's even a single step mode!
<LI><A HREF="WVoption.htm#Compress">Page compression.</A> Another great bonus for distributing demonstration sites. Use this to benefit from the 3 "S's" -- Speed, Security and Size.  Our optional page compression utility will let you compress your entire web site into a single archive, reducing the disk space required by 20-50%. Not only that, but page display from the archive will be significantly faster than from ordinary pages on CDROM or floppy disk, and the user will <I>not</i> be able to directly edit or view them.
<LI><A HREF="WVOption.htm#CGI">Local CGI</A>. Who needs a server to run web applications? When your users push a form button, Webview can now call any external program, pass it the information from the form <I>and</I> optionally wait for a response page to be generated. Ideal for search engines, data logging or Web site simulation!
</UL>
<P>All the above options are <B>enabled</B> in the <A HREF="#Downloads">evaluation version</A> so you can try them out. In addition, we've made the following universal improvements (some were introduced in earlier versions):
<P><UL>
<LI>(New in v2.5) Add CDROM=Yes to the [Setups] section of Webview.ini, and Webview will happily run from a CDROM or write-protected disk.
<LI>(New in v2.5) Webview can now be set up as the default browser by great HTML editors such as <A HREF="http://www.csdcorp.com/webber.htm">Webber.</A> This is because only one copy of Webview will be loaded into memory at any one time, which means you can easily flip back and forth between the HTML editor and Webview.
<LI>Images are now cached, so they load faster second time around</LI>
<LI>All Options menu information is preserved between sessions (unless the CDROM setting is in effect, see above)</LI>
<LI>PNG images are now supported</LI>
<LI>Transparent GIFs are now supported</LI>
<LI>BMP files can be displayed transparently by adding the non-standard <B>TRANSP</B> attribute to your &lt;IMG SRC&gt; statements. The colour of the bottom-left pixel of the image determines the transparent colour.</LI>
<LI>Links which directly load images are now supported</LI>
<LI>Several other aspects of image display have been improved</LI>
<LI>Copy and Select All options have been added to the Edit menu</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Coming in future versions:</B>a sample search engine application, new HTML features (e.g. imagemaps) and more besides!

<CENTER><H2>Downloading SPIS Webview</H2></CENTER>
<P>You have three zip file download options from which to choose. To start your download,  just click the one which appeals to you:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="wv2all.zip">Webview 2.8 and sample pages (786K)</A> -- a full run-through with many examples
<LI><A HREF="wv2.zip">Webview 2.8 only (464K)</A> -- enough to run it with your own pages (most links from the sample Webview home page to the "Special Features" pages won't work)
<LI><A HREF="wv2demos.zip">Webview 2.8 demo pages (321K)</A> -- the compressed pages omitted from the "Webview only" download, in case you want to come back for them later...
</UL>
<P>Once you've downloaded the file you chose, unzip it into a directory of your choice, and use either <B>Program Manager's File|Run</B> (Windows 3.x) or <B>Start|Run</B> (Win95) to launch the Webview.exe program -- it will display a page similar to this one with many example links on it.
<P><B>Note:</B> if you currently have Webview 2.0, delete IMLIB221.DLL before unzipping V2.8 -- the old DLL has been supplanted by one with a different name.

<CENTER><H2>What is SPIS WebWatch?</H2></CENTER>
<P>WebWatch is a site monitor program which will
regularly and automatically request pages from any sites you like,
and take corrective or notification action if any are "down", invalid or can't be contacted.

<P>Web sites are now a critical information tool for many businesses -- critical to the businesses <I>owning</I> the sites, and to those who provide Web site services.

<P>Unfortunately, the Internet is a complex organism, and prone to failure. Connections get lost, domain names get "mislaid", servers go down and with automated Web sites there are yet more layers which <I>might</I> go wrong.

<P>WebWatch keeps an eye not just on connections (which any <B>ping</B> program can do), but also on the servers and any Web site applications behind them... Above all, it does so in an automated fashion, running the checks every minute, every hour -- as often as you need.

<P>We encourage you to try SPIS WebWatch out by <A HREF="#Downloads">downloading a copy,</A> looking at the help file and sample control file that comes with it and, of course, using it to monitor your own Web site!
<P><A HREF="#Downloads">Download</A> a copy.<BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#Contents">Table of Contents...</A>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Features"><IMG SRC="images/rainbowb.gif" 
HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>What can WebWatch do?</H2></CENTER>

Here are <B>seven</B> good reasons to use WebWatch:
<OL>
<LI>It can monitor up to 4 (Standard version) or an unlimited number (Extended version) of independent Web sites or URLs, checking them as often as you like.
<LI>It can identify problems including lost connections or server down, bad or lost pages, misbehaving CGI applications, and can even tell you if keywords are missing from the requested page. It also incorporates special checking features for the <A HREF="http://www.href.com">Webhub</A> site automation framework.
<LI>When WebWatch finds something wrong, it can:
  <UL><LI>Log the problem
   <LI>Display it
   <LI>Sound an audible alarm via speaker and sound card
   <LI>Send a warning email (or fax via a faxmail service) to one or more addresses
   <LI>Run an external program on the WebWatch computer (e.g. a phone pager utility)
   <LI>Request another URL from the web server (such as a CGI-DOS URL which runs an on-site program to fix the problem or restart the server)<BR><I>All of these actions can be independently customised for <B>each</B> URL!</I>
</UL>
<LI>It's small (the executable is under 600K) and will run on any WinNT (3.51) or Win95 computer with an active Internet connection.
<LI>Although it is a Windows program, you can use it to effectively monitor Web sites running on <I>any</I> server, <I>anywhere</I> in the world (including on the same machine of course!)
<LI>Regular and flexible reporting options include emailing of  accumulated error logs (if any) access counts and timing information
<LI>And, as a special bonus feature, WebWatch has an option to check all the external links in <I>any</I> file or site document you want -- no more worries about off-site links going astray when they move!
 </OL>
<P>Using WebWatch, you can of course monitor your own sites, but you can also offer a "Site Watch" service monitoring any mission-critical sites out there. So rather than costing you money, WebWatch actually offers you a new revenue-earning opportunity.
<P>ISPs using WebWatch or a Site Watch service will be able to reassure their clients that "our sites are independently monitored every hour of the day -- if something goes wrong, we'll <I>know</I> about it and take action." That's a notable competitive edge...

<CENTER><H2>Downloading SPIS WebWatch</H2></CENTER>
<P>Before running SPIS WebWatch, you must install the Microsoft Internet Control Pack. You may already have this installed on your computer, especially if you have a version of Internet Explorer 3.0, NT Server 4.0 or Borland Delphi 2.01. Look for <B>httpct.ocx</B> and <B>smtpct.ocx</B> in your Windows System directory. If you don't have those files, you can download the Internet Control Pack now from <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/icp/us/icpmain/icpmaint.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/icp/us/icpmain/icpmaint.htm.</A>

<P><I>(August 2nd, '96: It appears that Microsoft are now omitting the <A HREF="OC30.ZIP">OC30.DLL</A> file from their control pack. If you don't already have that file in your system directory, you'll need it too...)</I>

<P>Once you have the control pack, go ahead and download WebWatch V1.01, unzip it into any directory, and see the help file for information on getting started.  Here are the links:

<P><UL>
<LI><A HREF="webwatch.zip">WebWatch 1.01,</A> including help file and examples (340K)
<LI><A HREF="wwhelp.zip">Just the help file,</A> if you want a quick look first (55K)
<LI><A HREF="OC30.ZIP">OC30.DLL</A> which is no longer in the Internet Control Pack
<LI><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/icp/us/icpmain/icpmaint.htm">Internet Control Pack page, </A> if you don't have it
</UL>
<P><B>Note:</B> Webwatch was updated from 1.0 to 1.01 on July 16th. Apart from minor reporting and user interface improvements (e.g. Alt+A to toggle Auto), the main change is the new DEFAULTACTION setting in the Control file (see help for more information).

<A Name="Overview"></A><H2>Overview</H2>
<P><B>TCompress</B> provides native Delphi components for the creation of multi-file
compressed archives, as well as database, file and in-memory compression using
Delphi streams.

<P>Two compression methods (RLE and LZH) are built in, with "hooks" for the easy
addition of custom compression formats. Compressed file protection using keys is supported.

<P><B>TCompress</B> also includes drop 'n play components for automatic database blob, 
image and memo compression, based on Delphi's TDBMemo and TDBImage components.

<P>Images compress by up to 98% when using LZH, hence there is a massive saving
in disk space and disk or network access when using these components.

<P><B>TCompress</B> comes with an extensive demonstration, many source examples (including how to make a self-extracting EXE) and Delphi-compatible help and keyword files. Supports Delphi 1.0 and 2.0.

<P><B>Included in the TCompress v2.5 set are:</B>

</TABLE>
<HR>
<A NAME="Features"></A><H2>Key Features</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Support for Delphi 1.0 (16-bit) and Delphi 2.0 (32-bit)
</LI>
<LI>NATIVE Delphi compression -- no mucking about with DLLs, VBXes et al</LI>
<LI>Multi-file compressed archives using the TCompress component</LI>
<LI>Database BLOB (memo, image) compression with TCDBMemo and TCDBimage</LI>
<LI>In-memory compression using streams (file/memory/blob/resource<-->file/memory/blob)</LI>
<LI>Key-based protection of compressed data</LI>
<LI>Self-extracting EXEs and compressed resources in EXEs</LI>
<LI>Event hooks for customizable user interaction</LI>
<LI>Built-in RLE (Run-Length Encoding) and LZH (Lempel-Ziv-Huffman) compression</LI>
<LI>Easy to add your own custom compression routines at any time</LI>
<LI>Loads of example source included</LI>
<LI>Full component source code available</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>TCompress</B> and its companions provide very comprehensive data
compression capabilities. Most developers might only need to drop a
TCompress component on a form and call its ExpandFile/CompressFile methods in
order to create and work with their own multi-file archives...

<P>Others might drop <B>TCDBMemo/TCDBImage </B>components on as well and simply

<P><A HREF="mailto:kmcclain@mindspring.com">Ken McClain</A> has released a new version of his <A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~kmcclain/index.htm">
TSegCompress</A> "wrapper" component for TCompress v2.5. This component lets you split archives into multiple chunks. For example, use <A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~kmcclain/index.htm">
TSegCompress</A> to break an archive into 1.44MB chunks for backing up to floppy disk, and then to splice them all back together.

<P>The new version has some improvements and includes support for Delphi 1.0 and 2.0. Credit card registrations for TSegCompress are now possible by registering through us, or you can register via check with Ken if you prefer.

"I found that best compression rates on large tables are achieved by using first coRLE to squeeze the table quickly into 25% of it's original size and then coLZH to finish it up. It gives the best compression/time ratio and the best compression rate ever: 1,076,152 bytes squeezed down to 39,300bytes." <BR>
<I>Bob Heida (bobtsf@login.cz)</I></P>

<P>"I tweaked the Compress method source so it <I>always</I> puts a header in compressed blobs. Having done that, I can now compress multiple items into a single database field -- very useful if you have a range of information to store in a single record."<BR>

<P><A NAME="Reviews"></A><H2>News and Reviews: What TCompress users have said, and what they're doing with it</H2></P>
<P>
"First let me thank you for one of the most well crafted shareware Delphi components I have seen. I greatly appreciate those who have gone the extra step to turn a "program" into a "product....."<BR>
<I>Integral Scientific Software, Fort Collins, CO 80525-1799, USA.</I></P>

<P>"I was, and am still, impressed with the level of service you provided. You went out of your way, even before we bought the product, to work with me (by sending code, examples, etc)... and I really appreciate
it!  Your level of service is extraordinary. I wish that all of the people we dealt with were as accomodating as you."<BR>
<I>Tom Bowden (tom@Rheyn.COM)</I></P>

<P>"It took me less than a day to implement your tcompress in a dll that's backwards API compatible with our old library. It is a god-given control ! (my P120-NT-box made an overnight compression burn-in test. I stopped it this morning with 15731 successfull compression iterations).... (far better than my good old compress.dll and PK libraries)."<BR>
<I>Bob Heida (bobtsf@login.cz)</I></P>

<P>"Thanks for sending TCompress to me. I'm very impressed with it. It is the first component I've found that does what I want it to... and more.I didn't realize you could compress image and memo fields -- that's also a huge advantage for the program I'm working on."<BR>
<I> Mike Yui, Queens University (3mry@qlink.queensu.ca)</I></P>

<P>"We just got a shareware version of TCompress from The Delphi Station - and we love it very much."<BR>
<I>(matej.jaksa@ijs.si  and kres@eunet.si)</I></P>

<P>"Classy stuff!  Well-designed, intuitive.  I was able to use it without a glance at any help or instructions."
<BR> <I>Lou Garner (lou.garner@lunatic.com)</I></P>

<P>"Thank you for an exceptional component."
<BR><I>Graham Colwell (teracomc@mlmpro.com)</I></P>

<P>"I'm using your TCompress in an application I'm developing that communicates with international language translation services.  And BTW, thanks for a GREAT component!  It
seems to find its way into almost everything I do, (hence the need to purchase another license for my day job)."
<BR> <I>David M Trump (dtrump@hach.com)</I></P>

<P>"I was silly enough to try and rescue my schedule by picking up your
compression component last week, and guess what... IT
WORKED WONDERFULLY!<BR>
<P>"Thank you, I absolutely love your component, it saved me a ton of time and
helped me get that app out on time."<BR>
<I>Phillip D. Clark" (phildc@beetu.com)</I>

<P>"Well, I just tested using TCompress with images in Interbase and it works just fine. The trick seems to be to set the TCblobfield size to 1. It's the same you'd write for any other SQL database I think." <BR>
<I>Ricky Engberg (ricky.engberg@microlan.se)</I>

<P>"I appreciate your support... the product [I had to get ready for Comdex] is <A HREF="http://www.mediaminds.com"><I>PictureAlbum for Windows</I></A> (made for Mediaminds Inc)...
<P>"...Tcompress continues to perform well for me. I have included it in <A HREF="http://web2.airmail.net/nunnally">Projector for Windows v4.1,</A> -- a windows screen saver that uses a powerful image engine for the front end and a database for the backend.  Each database is actually 3 files, the database file, a memo file which contains the image blobs, and an index.
<P>"I use Tcompress to archive these files together, so that the user need not be bothered with tracking several files. The database file, which is basically an index, is highly compressible with LZH. One of the things I point out to customers is that my archive files can actually GROW if you try to 'zip' them."

</TABLE>
<P>From v2.5 onwards, Webview includes several optional features of particular interest to those using it for offline demonstrations, training, web site simulation and data gathering. The evaluation version of Webview has all the optional features <B>active</B> so you can try them out. However, you must specifically order each option if you want it to be usable in the <A HREF="webview.htm#Registration">registered</A> version.
<A NAME="Options"></A>
<P>The optional features are:
<P><UL>
 <LI><A HREF="#Editor">Built-in Editor</A>
 <LI><A HREF="#Scripts">Scripted Demonstrations</A>
 <LI><A HREF="#Compress">Page Compression</A>
 <LI><A HREF="#CGI">Local CGI</A>
 </UL>
<P>Return to the <A HREF="webview.htm#Contents">Table of Contents...</A>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Editor"><IMG SRC="../images/rainbowb.gif" 
HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>Built-In Text Editor</H2></CENTER>

<P>Webview will let you examine <I>and</I> edit the HTML text of the current page. Just press <B>F9</B> or click the View button near the top right of the form. In text editing mode, you can:
<UL>
<LI>Save, Edit, Find and Print the current text (see the File and Edit menus)
<LI>Create or open another HTML or text document
<LI>View the text as a Web page again (F9 or View button)
<LI>Right-click with the mouse for a quick edit menu
</UL>
<P>Any unsaved changes you make in the text editor will be preserved until you exit Webview, or until you try to edit a different page using F9 or View. You will always be given a chance to save changes before they are discarded.
<P><B>Note:</B> the maximum page size that the Webview text editor can handle is 32 kilobytes.

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#Options">Webview Options...</A>


<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Scripts"><IMG SRC="../images/rainbowb.gif" 
HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>Scripted Demonstrations</H2></CENTER>
<P>This option allows you to set up a demonstration of your web pages which will run automatically as soon as Webview starts. It's very useful for shows or other occasions where you want the whole site to be viewed without user involvement. You can choose to let the user intervene by hiding or showing the Pause button, or even running the demonstration in Single Step mode if you like.
<P>Aspects of the display such as the page scrolling and loading rates can be independently controlled. Best of all, you don't need to alter your HTML to make the scripts work!
<P>The best way to learn about scripts is to try one out. Copy the following lines and add them to the end of your Webview.ini file (it's in the same directory as Webview.exe).  Then exit Webview, run it again and watch the results.  Note the pause/play button at the top right of the form -- use this to stop and restart the script any time you like.

<pre>
; Here is a simple script example -- to stop it running automatically whenever
; you load Webview, just put a semicolon in front of the next line:
Script=Sample    ; Which script to run (can define several in the INI file, and use any one)
Page Rate=1      ; milliseconds, i.e. no gap *between* pages
Page Load Delay=2000 ; i.e. wait 2 seconds after load before starting scroll
Scroll Rate=3000 ; millisecs, i.e. 3 seconds between scrolls -- 0 means NO scrolling
Scroll Amount=90 ; % of vertical height of the display area to scroll each step
Pause Button=Yes ; If no, user can't pause the script
Single Step=No   ; If yes, awaits F10 or "play" after each page loads

; Here is the "Sample" script referred to above.
[Sample]
1=alarmrng.wav               ;start a background .wav file
2=webview.htm#Registration  	; Show from the Registration section of Webview.htm onwards
3=SingleStepOn               ; from now on, it is as if SingleStep above had been set to yes
4=webwatch.htm               ; load the page, and then stop (because of SingleStepOn)
5=SingleStepOff              ; back to continuous play
6=wvoptions.htm              ; then show the options page, 
7=Stop                       ; don't start the script again unless F10 or Play is pressed.
</pre>
<p>
The SingleStepOn setting in the [Setups] section can be overridden in the script as above.
<P>Once you've tried that, change to the following display settings. They should give you smooth, continuous scrolling, with a pause at the end of each page:
<pre>
Page Rate=3000   ; 3 second pause at the end of a page
Scroll Rate=100  ; 1/10 second pause between scrolls
Scroll Amount=1  ; scroll by 1% of the display area each time
</pre>

<P>You may also want to experiment by setting <B>Single Step=Yes</B>.
<P>Finally, a few notes on developing scripts using Webview:
<P><UL>
<LI>If you click Play (or push F10) after the script has been paused, it will resume from precisely where it left off, regardless of what other pages you may have manually loaded in the meanwhile.
<LI>If you save changes to a script (e.g. from Notepad) while it is being played, the change will be noticed when the next page is
loaded and the new settings will be adopted. Changes will also be noticed when you Play after pausing the script. In both cases, the script will restart from scratch
<LI>Using the menus while a script is playing will not stop the script, but can conceivably temporarily alter what it is playing
(e.g. the file which is being automatically scrolled will be altered by File|Opening another one).
<LI>If a bad file is referenced in your script, it will automatically pause after showing the error message. Play will continue with the
next line of the script unless you change the script first.
<LI>You can only reference HTML files in a script. If you want to display an image by itself, make a small page with the appropriate IMG SRC tag in it.
</UL>
<P>Return to the <A HREF="#Options">Webview Options...</A>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Compress"><IMG SRC="../images/rainbowb.gif" 
HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>Page Compression -- Speed, Size, Security</H2></CENTER>

<P><I>All</I> copies of Webview 2.5 or later are able to decode and display pages and other files stored in compressed archives.  The process works as follows:

<UL>
<LI>You compress your web pages into an archive using our optional MAKEWV utility, and add a line to the Webview.INI file which tells it the name of your archive
<LI>When Webview is run, it rapidly decompresses the files into a work directory on the user's hard disk. Subsequently, all page display is from hard disk -- much faster than from floppy or CDROM
<LI>Any kind of files -- HTML, images, sound files, CGI applications etc. can be in the archive, but it will still be possible to open or link to other files which are <I>not</I> in the archive
<LI>Pages which came from the archive are protected -- Webview will not let the user view or edit their HTML
<LI>Before Webview exits, the contents of the archive are removed from the user's hard disk
</UL>
<P>Depending on the content of your pages, the amount of space saved will range from 20-50%. GIF and JPG images will hardly compress at all, but HTML, EXE, BMP or WAV files will be significantly compressed. This makes distribution of floppy-based material even easier!
<P>To see a working example of a compressed page archive, make sure you <A HREF="webview.htm#Downloads">download</A> the <I>full</I> evaluation version, then run any of the pages in the Special Features section.
<P>Return to the <A HREF="#Options">Webview Options...</A>


<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="CGI"><IMG SRC="../images/rainbowb.gif" 
HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>Local CGI</H2></CENTER>
<P>With online web sites, you can write Web applications which process form input and produce result pages which are then sent back to the browser. This is usually done using "Common Gateway Interface" (CGI) calls. <B>Local CGI</B> gives Webview the same capability, except that the crafting of Local CGI applications is usually much easier than the online variety!

<P>You can write your applications in Visual Basic, Borland Delphi, C++ or any programming language which creates executable files.

<P>Just as with regular CGI, a Local CGI call is defined using the &lt;FORM&gt; tag's <B>Method</B> and <B>Action</B> attributes, e.g.<BR>
<pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVRUN" Action="search.exe srchvals.txt results.htm"&gt;</pre>
<P>The above statement tells Webview that when a button on the form is pressed, it should:
<UL>
<LI>Store the form data in <B>srchvals.txt</B>
<LI>Run the <B>search.exe</B> program with "srchvals.txt" and "results.htm" as parameters
<LI>Wait for search.exe to create a response page in <B>results.htm,</B> then display it 
</UL>

<P>In order to maintain "neutral" behaviour for existing forms you may display, Webview has defined three new <B>Method</B> values:
<UL><LI><B>WVSAVE</B> -- this simply saves the form data in the file specified by the <B>Action</B> attribute, e.g.<BR>
          <pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVSAVE" Action="order.txt"&gt;</pre>
A message is displayed telling the user where the data has been stored, but no external program is run. Use this for simple no-programming data collection into files in your web page's directory.
<LI><B>WVAPPEND</B> -- this is exactly the same as <B>WVSAVE</B> except that the form information will be <I>appended</I> to the <B>Action</B> file if it already exists
<LI><B>WVRUN</B> -- this will run an external program, with three <B>Action</B> options available, as shown in the examples below:
   <OL><LI>Program name only, e.g.<BR>
<pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVRUN" Action="notepad.exe"&gt;</pre>
          <BR>This is the same as a direct link to a program -- Webview will run it, but cannot provide it with any form information. The user can return to continue with Webview operations at any time.
           <LI>Program name plus form data filename, e.g. 
          <pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVRUN" Action="notepad.exe order.txt"&gt;</pre>
           <BR>Webview will first save the form data in <B>order.txt,</B> then call the program with "order.txt" as its only parameter. The program can process that information as it requires. The user can return to continue with Webview operations at any time.
           <LI>Program name, form data filename and result filename, e.g.<BR>
          <pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVRUN" Action="calcthis.exe rawdata.txt results.htm"&gt;</pre><BR>
           <BR>Webview will:<BR>
           <UL>
              <LI>save the form data to <B>rawdata.txt</B>
              <LI>delete any existing copy of <B>results.htm</B>
              <LI>execute the program with "rawdata.txt" and "results.htm" as parameters
              <LI><I>wait</I> until the result file has been created <B>and</B> closed by the program
              <LI>load <B>result.htm</B> and display it as an HTML file (regardless of its extension)
          </UL>
          <P>Note that if the result file hasn't been created by the program within 10 seconds, Webview will display an error message and stop waiting. The 10 second default can be altered to, say, 30 seconds by adding a "Wait For CGI=30" line to the [Setups] section of Webview.ini.
   </OL>
</UL>

<H3>Where files are located when using Local CGI</H3>

<P>EXE files referenced in <B>Action</B> statements (and also in direct HREF links) are assumed to be: 
<OL><LI>in the specified path if an absolute path is given
<LI>in or relative to the current web page's directory, if present
<LI>otherwise assumed to be on the system path
</OL>
<P>Form data and result page files referenced in <B>Action</B> statements are located as follows
<OL><LI>in the specified path if an absolute path is given
<LI>if "CDROM=Yes" is  in the [Setups] section of Webview.ini, in the system's TEMP (if defined) or Windows directory
<LI>otherwise in or relative to the current web page's directory
</OL>
<P>Regardless of where the files end up, the <I>correct</I> path is always passed to the program, so it simply needs to use the path(s) which Webview will specify in the parameter list, e.g.<BR> <B>myapp.exe c:\temp\formdata.txt c:\temp\output.htm</B>

<P>Now you know how to call your Local CGI program, you simply need to write the code to process the form data file (test-drive our <B>Order form</B> in the <A HREF="webview.htm#Downloads">evaluation version</A> to see an example of one such file). Then, if necessary, have the program  generate an HTML response page. Have fun!

<A NAME="What"></A>
<H1>What is the Web?</H1>
<I>If you're already familiar with the Web, <A href="#Who">skip the introduction.</A></I>

<P>The World Wide Web is a popular and fairly recent extension of the Internet, the global electronic communications network. Information is presented on "pages" made accessible through programs called Web browsers.
</P>
<P><I>Common browsers include <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com">Netscape</A>, <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html">Mosaic</A> and <A HREF="http://www.jackson.freenet.org/about_lynx/www_start.html">Lynx</A>.
</I></P>
<P>The information provided reflects the activities, interests and, frequently, <A HREF="people.htm#Peter">personality</A> of those who host the pages -- from <A HREF="sca.htm">recreation</A> and research areas through to <A HREF="http://www.etext.org/Zines/Quanta/">full-blown publications</A>, <A HREF=" http://www.cezanne.com/eng/accueil.html">art galleries</A> and <A HREF="http://cc.lut.fi/~mega/jukebox.html ">sound studios</A>.
</P>
<P>Web pages are usually designed so that the reader can effortlessly follow "links" to related subjects, information or files. The links could be pointing to somewhere else on the <A HREF="climwhat.htm#Design">same page</A> or <A HREF="http://www.joes.com/home/spis_ltd">half a world</A> away.
</P>
<A NAME="Who"><H2>Who is using the Web?</H2></A>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><P>Exact usage numbers are impossible to determine, but an indication can be gained from the following:
</P>
<P>Over the past two years, the number of Web pages on-line has grown from just a few thousand to an estimated 20 million or more. In New Zealand alone, a recent listing contained more than 45,000 pages;  an estimate published just one month earlier suggested 20,000.
</P>
<P>The number and range of people who read Web pages is also increasing dramatically -- from an estimated 250,000 in June 1994 to 30 million today.

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><P>In the beginning, the main users and authors were academic (reflecting the origins of the Internet), but now the trend is towards wider involvement from companies, societies and private individuals.
</P>
<P>There is still a reasonably high cost involved in using the Web, so readers are likely to be:
</P>
<UL><LI> professionals whose employers are footing the bill</LI>
<LI> businesses seeking out critical information or trading opportunities
</LI>
<LI>individuals in the middle- to upper-income bands who can afford
not only the necessary hardware, but also the connection and on-line fees
</LI></UL>
<P>This picture too is changing, as costs continue to decrease. In New Zealand over the past few months, international data transfer charges have halved (from $10/MB to $5/MB), opening up the Web to more users.

<H2>What are the limitations?
</H2>
<P>A broad range of information and services can be provided on the Web, but there are both limitations and drawbacks, and these should be weighed when considering your own Web site:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>access</STRONG><BR>
There is not much point establishing a site if the people you want to reach do not have or do not plan to get Web access.<BR>
<I>On the other hand, you may be able to expand your reach to include new contacts, clients or members who find your offerings interesting.</I>
</LI>
<LI><A href="#Promotion"><STRONG>getting attention</STRONG></A><BR>
With over 20 million pages out there already, you have to do something really different if you want to <A href="#Promotion">make an impact</A> in the Web community itself.<BR>
<I>Nonetheless, in recent months, two New Zealand sites have been listed among the <A HREF="http://icair.iac.org.nz">top 5%</A> of sites visited worldwide.</I>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>bandwidth constraints</STRONG><BR>
<I>Bandwidth relates to the amount of data which can be sent over communication links</I><BR>
The tremendous growth in Web usage has resulted in slowdowns (or "brownouts") in certain parts of the world, especially the US. Links to and from some overseas sites can be very slow at peak times. If this trend continues, people will be dissuaded from using the Web.
<BR>
<I>At present within New Zealand, there appears to be little problem with this.
</I>

<LI><STRONG>costs</STRONG><BR>
Although a Web site can be set up fairly economically by renting space from a <A HREF="#Service">service provider</A>, you still have to bear the costs of all accesses to your pages by readers. If your readers are within New Zealand, this can be quite cheap, or even free. Visitors from outside New Zealand will cost you, however.<BR>
<I>If you have a popular site, these charges can rapidly become a major issue!</I>

<LI><A HREF="#Security"><STRONG>security</STRONG></A><BR>
If you are merely providing information which is free to all, this will not be a problem. But if you are collecting or providing information which you want to protect or restrict in some way (including personal information, finance and copyrighted material), security can become an issue.

<A NAME="Design"><H1>Web Site Design</H1></A>
<H2>The Basics</H2>
<P>Web pages are created using a simple language called "HTML"  which describes the structure and contents of your offering. HTML provides some control over page layout, as well as the ability to add images, tables, forms and even animations and sound (though not all browsers will be able to make use of this).
</P>
<I>While HTML (HyperText Markup Language) allows authors to structure information for presentation, it does not define how pages will actually appear -- that is up to each browser and its user settings.</I>
<P>Having your own Web page can be as simple as finding a <A HREF="#Service">service provider</A> to rent you the storage space and Web connection, then creating your page.
</P>
<P>More complex sites, such as those with <A HREF="#Applications">database and indexing</A> capabilities or extensive sound and graphics, require careful programming and testing to deliver the desired results.
</P>
<P>Most sites need ongoing maintenance. A page rapidly <A HREF="sam.htm">goes stale</A> if it is not updated. Links on the page may no longer be valid, or the information itself may become out of date.
</P>
<P>Web sites tend to grow over time as pages are added to cover new subjects or activities. If you're not careful, the whole structure can become unwieldy. Good site planning and design allows you to forestall this, so be sure to put the time in early on to decide how the growth will be managed.
</P>
<H2>Doing it Right
</H2>
<P>Putting up Web pages is just a new form of publishing, subject to most of the old conventions, plus a few new wrinkles. Good offerings have useful content, clear presentation and consistent style  and can be read with most or all of the different browsers in use. Bad ones are browser-specific, have little or no content or simply represent somebody going on-line to say "me too"
</P>
<P>The Web itself contains a large number of <A HREF="#Resources">guides</A> on how to create Web pages. Some will tell you the latest tricks to make your favourite browser display pages to the best effect. Others will give you clear indications of what is and isn't good style and design, and will usually reinforce the following message:
</P>
<P>If you want your page to be read by others, bear in mind that they won't all be using the same browser, or even the same kind of computer.
</P>
<P>Tricks and illusions created to impress users of one popular browser may look sad -- or even ridiculous -- if read by another. If the purpose of your pages is to convey information, then learn and use standard HTML. If the purpose is to dazzle, then be aware that not every visitor will be dazzled -- and some will be annoyed.
</P>
<H2>Validate, Validate, Validate!
</H2>
<P>Once a Web page has been created, it is important that it be checked out as correct HTML. It is all too easy to make a mistake in page creation which works on your test browser, but results in gibberish on the one used by your next visitor.
</P>
<P>Fortunately, both <A HREF="#Resources">software and Web sites</A> exist which will perform this vital validation function for you. Use them!
</P>
<H2>Using Graphics
</H2>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><P>Many Web pages can be enhanced by judicious use of <A HREF="http://www.fn.net/gifs/">graphics</A>
-- the key word is <STRONG>judicious</STRONG>. When people are paying to look at your page (and most are, even if you are picking up some of the cost), they don't want to receive a 100KB  graphic to embellish 100 words of text (there are <A HREF="images/12goats.gif">exceptions</A>, of course).
</P>
<P>Many readers set their browsers up to ignore all images, so it is important that you design your pages so that they are attractive and usable even if the graphics are not present or, worse, replaced by little "image here" boxes as some browsers do.
</P>
</TD>
<TD Align=Center>
<SMALL><I>Original image:</I></SMALL><BR><A HREF="wop.htm">

<IMG SRC="images/imaghere.gif" alt="Netscape image placeholder (.3K)" WIDTH=36  HEIGHT=37><BR>
<SMALL><I>"Image here"</I></SMALL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>Good Web page designers use a number of techniques to reduce the size and increase the viewing speed of the graphics they use, and to blend them into the overall design and layout of the page. These include:
<UL>
<LI>Store an image with no more colours than it requires (this can cut file sizes by a factor of five!)</LI>
<LI>Always specify the image dimensions (with some browsers, this makes a page load faster)</LI>
<LI>Usually, save an image with a <A href="http://dragon.jpl.nasa.gov/~adam/transparent.html">transparent</A> background so it blends in with the page background</LI>
<LI>Images <I>without</I> transparent backgrounds can be saved in "interlaced" format to make apparent loading time faster</LI>
</UL>
<P><I>An "interlaced" image is loaded and displayed in <A HREF="images/12goats.gif">multiple passes</A> -- the first pass gives a rough idea of what it looks like, and the remaining ones fill in the detail.</I>

<HR>
<A NAME="Applications"></A>
<H1>Web Applications</H1>
<P>Web pages are often used to present or collect information for databases. Sometimes this kind of application is solely for in-house use, with Web tools used but without the data being available on the World Wide Web itself.
</P>
<P>Typical database publishing applications include:

</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>For both data publishing and data collection, some programming support is usually required to support the application. Although there are ways to collect data from Web page forms without programming, this rapidly becomes unwieldy as the amount of data increases.
</P>
<P>Using a protocol known as CGI, Web applications are able to transfer data to and from Web pages and forms. This information is usually stored in databases on the server machine -- a well-designed Web application will not require a change in the format or the layout of existing databases you may already be using.
</P>
<P><I>A server is the computer on which the Web site or application is stored.
</I>

<P>The programming language used to develop a Web application will generally vary depending on the nature of the server machine (e.g. Unix-based, Windows-based), but will most commonly be Perl, C, <A HREF="softserv.htm#Programming">Delphi</A>, Visual Basic or a dedicated add-on to a database management system.
</P>
<P>Because of the programming requirements, developing Web applications generally requires a distinct set of skills from those which go into Web page design. It is important to remember this when deciding who will create your site.
</P>
<P>The best Web site developers are those who are able to marry the <A HREF="#Here">divergent disciplines</A> of professional publishing, graphic design and software engineering.

<A NAME="Promotion">
<H1>Web Site Promotion
</H1></A>
<P>Creating a Web site is only half the story. If your site is to to serve any purpose, people must know that it is there. Two audiences are usually targeted:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>your natural audience (e.g. members, clients or subscribers) who may have Web access, or be getting it soon</LI>
<LI>the wider Web community, who use the <A HREF="#Lycos">search and indexing</A> services on the Web to find pages with information of interest to them</LI>
</UL>
<P>The first group is usually easy enough to reach through your existing lines of communication.
</P>
<P>You will usually have to go to some trouble to explain the purpose and benefits of the Web-based service to those who are not yet "Web aware", in the hope that they will find your site one of many reasons to get a connection themselves.
</P>
<H2>Making a splash on the Web

</LI>
<LI><STRONG>develop your site on an on-going basis</STRONG><BR>
Many pages are worth visiting once. Few are worth a second look unless the host makes an effort to keep them up-to-date and interesting. New links, ideas and points of interest are essential.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>add your web address to all stationery, printed and electronic</STRONG><BR>
Any place you list your contact information, make sure to add your Web address too. This means on your letterheads, business cards, publication mastheads, email sigs -- anywhere people would expect to see it.<BR>
<I>A sig (signature)  is a tailpiece on email messages which usually contains your email address.</I>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>add in links to compatible sites</STRONG><BR>
Mutual links between your site and others in a related area will help bring visitors interested in what you do, and your link will do the same for them.</LI>

You <I>must</I> do this appropriately, following the often tricky conventions of netiquette if you are to succeed. Inappropriate promotion can hinder rather than boost your sites popularity.<BR>

<P>This is an area which is still developing rapidly, and there are no guaranteed solutions. Security concerns are threefold:
</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>system security</STRONG><BR>
This is mainly a concern for service providers and organisations with their own servers. Because there are ways for Web applications to modify the data on the machines on which they are run, there is always the possibility that unauthorised access and modification can occur through program design flaws or deliberate intent.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>confidentiality</STRONG><BR>
Any Web usage that involves sensitive data (e.g. personal information, credit card details, technical data) needs to be protected against unauthorised access and eavesdropping. This is difficult when the information passed between the reader and the Web server can be routed through intermediate hosts on the Internet. Access restrictions using passwords and data encryption are two of the most common approaches to providing protection in this area.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>authentication</STRONG><BR>
In the Web world, there is no straightforward way of knowing who is reading a page or filling out a form. This can be a severe limitation, especially in the commercial arena.

<A NAME="Electronic">
<H2>Electronic commerce
</H2></A>
<P>Because of the security concerns noted above, and the critical fact that money is involved, electronic commerce on the Web is more complex than almost any other activity.
</P>
<P>At present, most commercial transactions that arise from the Web are carried on outside it, but this is slowly changing. Corporations like Mastercard and Visa are devising strategies for adding the security and confidence necessary to make transactions over the Web an everyday occurrence.
</P>
<P>There is no need to wait for them, however. Even as the paragraph above was being written, we received confirmation of a <A HREF="http://super.sonic.net/ann/delphi/more/tcompres/">software</A> sale which relied on the <A HREF="#FV">First Virtual</A> Internet Payment System (FV). Their system is a good example of what is possible at present:
</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>
<UL>
<LI>suppliers and potential buyers pay a small fee to be registered with FV</LI>
<LI>potential buyers also provide their credit card details via a secure route to FV, who gives them an FV identification number (ID)
</LI>
<LI>when a buyer sees something they want, they transmit their ID (but <I>not</I> any credit card information) to the supplier, who passes that on to FV
</LI>
<LI>FV then emails the buyer requesting authorisation --  the transaction is carried out only if this is received. Thus, anyone who obtains the buyers ID must also be able to intercept and respond to email directed at the buyer if they want to use it fraudulently.
</LI>
<LI>when authorisation is received, FV processes a credit card transaction
billing the buyer (and paying FV)
</LI>
<LI>at regular intervals, FV credits all payments (less a small transaction fee) to the suppliers nominated account
</LI>
<LI>Note that there is always a risk that the buyer will refuse to authorise the transaction, even though they have received the goods (or information). Naturally, anyone doing this too often is expelled from the system.

<H2>What can we do for you?

<H2>Why use our services?
</H2>
<P>Establishing your own site on the World Wide Web represents both an 
opportunity and a challenge. By now, the <A HREF="climwhat.htm#You">opportunities</A> should be pretty 
clear. The challenge is to design your presence and your presentations 
so that you appeal to your target audiences rather than offend them 
(or, worse, bore them!).
</P>
<P>For most organisations, the Web offers the chance to launch a new 
and powerful complement to existing information, promotion and communication 
efforts. But, if you aren't careful, your new Web presence can 
drain important resources you need elsewhere, and a poorly conceived 
site can even alienate those whom you most want to reach.
</P>
<P>Most importantly of all, the Web may offer you opportunities for productive 
interaction with your target community in ways that aren't obvious 
to those who are not experienced in the nuances of the Net. Thats 
where we come in...

<P>A single page of text is suitable for an <A HREF="skeptics.htm">individual or organisation</A> who simply needs to have an on-line presence. This is often sufficient for small-scale or short-term promotion and enrolment activities, especially if the site is listed in the appropriate Web catalogues (optional).</P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><P>This consists of a primary page and three or four subsidiary pages (covering such things as personnel, projects, topics), including a small number of graphics such as company logos or scanned photographs.</P>

<P>This is particularly suitable for professional societies and small, specialist businesses who would find a broader audience and greater market in the global electronic sphere. This greater reach can be developed by promoting the site on the Web itself -- we will submit listings to 10-15 of the most suitable catalogues and search engines.</P>

<P>A <A href="ssb/ssb.htm">rare book dealer</A>, for example, could be listed using keywords such as <I>books, rare, antiquarian, collectibles,</I> and any specific subject topics, such as <I>history, fine arts,</I> or <I>Antarctic exploration.</I></P>

<P>Forms and mail links are provided for reader feedback, subscription or surveying. Files containing further information or other resources can be placed on-line for readers to download.</P>

<P>This package provides an excellent source of information and communication for national organisations, magazines, <A href=" http://www.northland.ac.nz/nrc/">local bodies</A> and special interest groups.</P>

<A NAME="Commerce"></A><H2>Commerce Package</H2>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>
<P>This is a site designed to sell products or services, usually by providing a catalogue or directory. A typical site will have information which is extracted from a regularly-updated database. It will also have some kind of ordering system, such as a "print and fax this form" feature or full electronic commerce.</P>

<P>Larger sites will have strong indexing and search capabilities, meaning that the database itself must be kept on-line.</P>

<P>This presents good opportunities for a broad range of businesses, such as real estable companies, <A HREF="http://www.NetTravel.co.nz">travel and tourism services,</A> publishers and anyone already involved in direct mail or long distance sales activities.</P>

<P>Strong promotional work will be undertaken, including catalogue and search engine submissions, appropriate promotion on Usenet newsgroups and a search for other sites on the Web with which links can be usefully exchanged. We can also optionally promote the site in the mainstream media.

</TABLE>
<P>From v2.5 onwards, Webview includes several optional features of particular interest to those using it for offline demonstrations, training, web site simulation and data gathering. The evaluation version of Webview has all the optional features <B>active</B> so you can try them out. However, you must specifically order each option if you want it to be usable in the <A HREF="webview.htm#Registration">registered</A> version.
<A NAME="Options"></A>
<P>The optional features are:
<P><UL>
 <LI><A HREF="#Editor">Built-in Editor</A>
 <LI><A HREF="#Scripts">Scripted Demonstrations</A>
 <LI><A HREF="#Compress">Page Compression</A>
 <LI><A HREF="#CGI">Local CGI</A>
 </UL>
<P>Return to the <A HREF="webview.htm#Contents">Table of Contents...</A>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Editor"><IMG SRC="../images/rainbowb.gif" 
HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>Built-In Text Editor</H2></CENTER>

<P>Webview will let you examine <I>and</I> edit the HTML text of the current page. Just press <B>F9</B> or click the View button near the top right of the form. In text editing mode, you can:
<UL>
<LI>Save, Edit, Find and Print the current text (see the File and Edit menus)
<LI>Create or open another HTML or text document
<LI>View the text as a Web page again (F9 or View button)
<LI>Right-click with the mouse for a quick edit menu
</UL>
<P>Any unsaved changes you make in the text editor will be preserved until you exit Webview, or until you try to edit a different page using F9 or View. You will always be given a chance to save changes before they are discarded.
<P><B>Note:</B> the maximum page size that the Webview text editor can handle is 32 kilobytes.

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#Options">Webview Options...</A>


<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Scripts"><IMG SRC="../images/rainbowb.gif" 
HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>Scripted Demonstrations</H2></CENTER>
<P>This option allows you to set up a demonstration of your web pages which will run automatically as soon as Webview starts. It's very useful for shows or other occasions where you want the whole site to be viewed without user involvement. You can choose to let the user intervene by hiding or showing the Pause button, or even running the demonstration in Single Step mode if you like.
<P>Aspects of the display such as the page scrolling and loading rates can be independently controlled. Best of all, you don't need to alter your HTML to make the scripts work!
<P>The best way to learn about scripts is to try one out. Copy the following lines and add them to the end of your Webview.ini file (it's in the same directory as Webview.exe).  Then exit Webview, run it again and watch the results.  Note the pause/play button at the top right of the form -- use this to stop and restart the script any time you like.

<pre>
; Here is a simple script example -- to stop it running automatically whenever
; you load Webview, just put a semicolon in front of the next line:
Script=Sample    ; Which script to run (can define several in the INI file, and use any one)
Page Rate=1      ; milliseconds, i.e. no gap *between* pages
Page Load Delay=2000 ; i.e. wait 2 seconds after load before starting scroll
Scroll Rate=3000 ; millisecs, i.e. 3 seconds between scrolls -- 0 means NO scrolling
Scroll Amount=90 ; % of vertical height of the display area to scroll each step
Pause Button=Yes ; If no, user can't pause the script
Single Step=No   ; If yes, awaits F10 or "play" after each page loads

; Here is the "Sample" script referred to above.
[Sample]
1=alarmrng.wav               ;start a background .wav file
2=webview.htm#Registration  	; Show from the Registration section of Webview.htm onwards
3=SingleStepOn               ; from now on, it is as if SingleStep above had been set to yes
4=webwatch.htm               ; load the page, and then stop (because of SingleStepOn)
5=SingleStepOff              ; back to continuous play
6=wvoptions.htm              ; then show the options page, 
7=Stop                       ; don't start the script again unless F10 or Play is pressed.
</pre>
<p>
The SingleStepOn setting in the [Setups] section can be overridden in the script as above.
<P>Once you've tried that, change to the following display settings. They should give you smooth, continuous scrolling, with a pause at the end of each page:
<pre>
Page Rate=3000   ; 3 second pause at the end of a page
Scroll Rate=100  ; 1/10 second pause between scrolls
Scroll Amount=1  ; scroll by 1% of the display area each time
</pre>

<P>You may also want to experiment by setting <B>Single Step=Yes</B>.
<P>Finally, a few notes on developing scripts using Webview:
<P><UL>
<LI>If you click Play (or push F10) after the script has been paused, it will resume from precisely where it left off, regardless of what other pages you may have manually loaded in the meanwhile.
<LI>If you save changes to a script (e.g. from Notepad) while it is being played, the change will be noticed when the next page is
loaded and the new settings will be adopted. Changes will also be noticed when you Play after pausing the script. In both cases, the script will restart from scratch
<LI>Using the menus while a script is playing will not stop the script, but can conceivably temporarily alter what it is playing
(e.g. the file which is being automatically scrolled will be altered by File|Opening another one).
<LI>If a bad file is referenced in your script, it will automatically pause after showing the error message. Play will continue with the
next line of the script unless you change the script first.
<LI>You can only reference HTML files in a script. If you want to display an image by itself, make a small page with the appropriate IMG SRC tag in it.
</UL>
<P>Return to the <A HREF="#Options">Webview Options...</A>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Compress"><IMG SRC="../images/rainbowb.gif" 
HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>Page Compression -- Speed, Size, Security</H2></CENTER>

<P><I>All</I> copies of Webview 2.5 or later are able to decode and display pages and other files stored in compressed archives.  The process works as follows:

<UL>
<LI>You compress your web pages into an archive using our optional MAKEWV utility, and add a line to the Webview.INI file which tells it the name of your archive
<LI>When Webview is run, it rapidly decompresses the files into a work directory on the user's hard disk. Subsequently, all page display is from hard disk -- much faster than from floppy or CDROM
<LI>Any kind of files -- HTML, images, sound files, CGI applications etc. can be in the archive, but it will still be possible to open or link to other files which are <I>not</I> in the archive
<LI>Pages which came from the archive are protected -- Webview will not let the user view or edit their HTML
<LI>Before Webview exits, the contents of the archive are removed from the user's hard disk
</UL>
<P>Depending on the content of your pages, the amount of space saved will range from 20-50%. GIF and JPG images will hardly compress at all, but HTML, EXE, BMP or WAV files will be significantly compressed. This makes distribution of floppy-based material even easier!
<P>To see a working example of a compressed page archive, make sure you <A HREF="webview.htm#Downloads">download</A> the <I>full</I> evaluation version, then run any of the pages in the Special Features section.
<P>Return to the <A HREF="#Options">Webview Options...</A>


<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="CGI"><IMG SRC="../images/rainbowb.gif" 
HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>Local CGI</H2></CENTER>
<P>With online web sites, you can write Web applications which process form input and produce result pages which are then sent back to the browser. This is usually done using "Common Gateway Interface" (CGI) calls. <B>Local CGI</B> gives Webview the same capability, except that the crafting of Local CGI applications is usually much easier than the online variety!

<P>You can write your applications in Visual Basic, Borland Delphi, C++ or any programming language which creates executable files.

<P>Just as with regular CGI, a Local CGI call is defined using the &lt;FORM&gt; tag's <B>Method</B> and <B>Action</B> attributes, e.g.<BR>
<pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVRUN" Action="search.exe srchvals.txt results.htm"&gt;</pre>
<P>The above statement tells Webview that when a button on the form is pressed, it should:
<UL>
<LI>Store the form data in <B>srchvals.txt</B>
<LI>Run the <B>search.exe</B> program with "srchvals.txt" and "results.htm" as parameters
<LI>Wait for search.exe to create a response page in <B>results.htm,</B> then display it 
</UL>

<P>In order to maintain "neutral" behaviour for existing forms you may display, Webview has defined three new <B>Method</B> values:
<UL><LI><B>WVSAVE</B> -- this simply saves the form data in the file specified by the <B>Action</B> attribute, e.g.<BR>
          <pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVSAVE" Action="order.txt"&gt;</pre>
A message is displayed telling the user where the data has been stored, but no external program is run. Use this for simple no-programming data collection into files in your web page's directory.
<LI><B>WVAPPEND</B> -- this is exactly the same as <B>WVSAVE</B> except that the form information will be <I>appended</I> to the <B>Action</B> file if it already exists
<LI><B>WVRUN</B> -- this will run an external program, with three <B>Action</B> options available, as shown in the examples below:
   <OL><LI>Program name only, e.g.<BR>
<pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVRUN" Action="notepad.exe"&gt;</pre>
          <BR>This is the same as a direct link to a program -- Webview will run it, but cannot provide it with any form information. The user can return to continue with Webview operations at any time.
           <LI>Program name plus form data filename, e.g. 
          <pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVRUN" Action="notepad.exe order.txt"&gt;</pre>
           <BR>Webview will first save the form data in <B>order.txt,</B> then call the program with "order.txt" as its only parameter. The program can process that information as it requires. The user can return to continue with Webview operations at any time.
           <LI>Program name, form data filename and result filename, e.g.<BR>
          <pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVRUN" Action="calcthis.exe rawdata.txt results.htm"&gt;</pre><BR>
           <BR>Webview will:<BR>
           <UL>
              <LI>save the form data to <B>rawdata.txt</B>
              <LI>delete any existing copy of <B>results.htm</B>
              <LI>execute the program with "rawdata.txt" and "results.htm" as parameters
              <LI><I>wait</I> until the result file has been created <B>and</B> closed by the program
              <LI>load <B>result.htm</B> and display it as an HTML file (regardless of its extension)
          </UL>
          <P>Note that if the result file hasn't been created by the program within 10 seconds, Webview will display an error message and stop waiting. The 10 second default can be altered to, say, 30 seconds by adding a "Wait For CGI=30" line to the [Setups] section of Webview.ini.
   </OL>
</UL>

<H3>Where files are located when using Local CGI</H3>

<P>EXE files referenced in <B>Action</B> statements (and also in direct HREF links) are assumed to be: 
<OL><LI>in the specified path if an absolute path is given
<LI>in or relative to the current web page's directory, if present
<LI>otherwise assumed to be on the system path
</OL>
<P>Form data and result page files referenced in <B>Action</B> statements are located as follows
<OL><LI>in the specified path if an absolute path is given
<LI>if "CDROM=Yes" is  in the [Setups] section of Webview.ini, in the system's TEMP (if defined) or Windows directory
<LI>otherwise in or relative to the current web page's directory
</OL>
<P>Regardless of where the files end up, the <I>correct</I> path is always passed to the program, so it simply needs to use the path(s) which Webview will specify in the parameter list, e.g.<BR> <B>myapp.exe c:\temp\formdata.txt c:\temp\output.htm</B>

<P>Now you know how to call your Local CGI program, you simply need to write the code to process the form data file (test-drive our <B>Order form</B> in the <A HREF="webview.htm#Downloads">evaluation version</A> to see an example of one such file). Then, if necessary, have the program  generate an HTML response page. Have fun!

<A NAME="Stop"></A><H2>Stop Press Stop Press Stop Press -- February Seminar</H2>
<P>Ann Lynnworth and Michael Ax, the principals of HREF Tools Corp, USA, will be giving a <B>two day Webhub training seminar in Auckland on February 17th and 18th, 1997.</B>
<P>This will be an intensive two-day course on building WebHub applications, presented by Ann. Day One will provide a solid review of the WebHub framework: CGI architecture, HTML, Web Action Components and Database Components. Day Two will get into building custom web action components with an emphasis on electronic commerce.
<P>The course is lecture-style using a data projector. Do bring a laptop if you have one; printed lecture notes/workbook will be provided. On the evening of day one we will have an informal "code clinic" when you can work on your own projects or the examples from class. Michael Ax will be available to answer questions during the code clinic.
<P>Course cost will be $NZ870+GST for the two days, with 10% discount for registrations received by Feb 1st, and a further 10% for registered Webhub users. Discounts are also available for multiple attendees from the same organisation.
<P>For further information and a secure registration form, see <A HREF="http://www.tradesrv.com.au/href/">Seminar Details.</A>

<P>NB: Ann and Michael will also be speaking at:
<UL>
<LI>Delphi User Group meeting on Wednesday February 12th in Auckland (tentatively from 4pm) at the Westhaven Marina Rowing Club
<LI>Delphi User Group meeting on Thursday February 13th in Christchurch from 6:30pm at ADDLink College, 271 Madras St
</UL>
<P>They are knowledgeable and entertaining speakers, so you shouldn't miss a chance to see them in action...
<P>Email <A HREF="mailto:peter@spis.co.nz">Peter Hyde</A> for further information.


<A NAME="What"></A><H2>What is Webhub?</H2>

<P>Webhub is a state-of-the-art <A HREF="#Why">Web site automation</A> product from <A HREF="http://www.href.com">HREF Tools Corporation.</A> Compared to other <A HREF="automate.htm">automation</A> products for Windows 95 and NT, Webhub has some very significant advantages:

<UL>
<LI><B>Server independence.</B> As the Web server market grows and evolves, Webhub permits migration from one server to another with zero code changes.
<LI><B>Session management.</B> Webhub automatically "saves state", ensuring that each surfer has their own, independent "session" when visiting your site. Many competing automation approaches completely fail to take account of this, resulting in situations where Surfer B can end up staring at Surfer A's data!
<LI><B>Separation of HTML from programming.</B> Webhub's structure means page layout can remain the province of Web designers, while programmers can concentrate on functionality, security, business rules and database connections.
<LI><B>Surfer tracking.</B> Webhub's HUBLOG feature allows each surfer's visit to be fully recorded for later analysis.
<LI><B>Easy site maintenance.</B> Strong support for reusable macros and HTML "chunks" means that URLs, headers, footers etc. which are used all over the site can be changed in just one location.
<LI><B>Performance.</B> Apart from its <A HREF="http://www.href.com:8010/scripts/runisa.dll?HTSM:whyfast">in-built performance features,</A> Webhub allows you to develop fast, scalable Web applications using <A HREF="http://www.borland.com">Borland Delphi,</A> a robust, object-oriented and full-featured compiler language.
<LI><B>Scalability.</B> As site traffic grows, Webhub can scale performance by running additional copies of your Web applications, additional Web servers and even cross-server application execution using it's "Maitre-D'Hub".
<LI><B>Database connectivity.</B> Using the Borland Database Engine, ODBC or Borland's Client/Server links, Webhub applications can bring any of today's most popular database formats to the Web.
<LI><B>High-level functionality.</B> Out of the box, Webhub has support,  customisable components or working demonstration code for:
<UL>
<LI>Form-mail processing (sending form data as email)
<LI>Database table display
<LI>File uploads
<LI>Remote administration
<LI>Scrollable/pageable table grids
<LI>User authentication
<LI>And quite a lot more! (see <A HREF="http://www.href.com:8010/scripts/runisa.dll?HREFSITE:sample">Webhub Demos)</A>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>Webhub is most suitable for applications which go <I>beyond</I> displaying some static pages and a few fields from a database. Tools which come with most of today's servers will usually go that far. Webhub excels where features like electronic commerce, custom searching, security, browser independence, sessions, dynamic pages, data entry and two-way communication (e.g. faxmail) are required. And it is ideal for getting the most value and performance from an Intranet.

<P>A wide range of <A HREF="http://www.href.com:8010/scripts/runisa.dll?HTSM:homepage">public Web sites</A> worldwide have been built with Webhub, including our own <A HREF="http://www.NetTravel.co.nz">NetTravel New Zealand</A> accommodation search engine.

<P>Why not <A HREF="http://www.href.com:8010/scripts/runisa.dll?HREFSITE:trywhub">download a trial version</A> now?

<A NAME="Why"></A><H2>Why Automated Sites?</H2>

<P>High-impact Web sites fall into two categories:
<UL><LI>Those which look beautiful (though often at the expense of download time or browser independence)
<LI>Those that <B>WORK,</B> providing a service or function which brings surfers back to them time and again. Covering everything from book catalogues and weather predictions to shopping malls, interactive puzzles and search engines, working Web sites are now making the running on the Web.
</UL>
<P>As time goes on, more and more effort is going into preparing material for web pages. Excellent new tools such as Microsoft Frontpage or Borland Intrabuilder have been developed to help this process along.

<P>However, when your business information is already present in existing databases or documents, the ideal solution is to present this information with appropriate security and filtering while eliminating manual intervention or conversion steps. This process is another form of site automation.

<A NAME="Our"></A><H2>Our Webhub-related Services</H2>
<P>There are several ways we can help you get up to speed with Webhub:
<UL>
<LI>Webhub introduction and training -- helping you or your
development staff to get up to speed with Webhub, it's key features
and benefits for an automated Internet or Intranet Web site

<LI>Webhub technical consultancy -- leveraging your development
efforts with on-site, telephone and email support

<LI>Site co-development -- you concentrate on the look-and-feel of
your site and we'll produce the Webhub applications to make it hum

<LI>Full site design and development, from needs analysis, initial
specification, structural outline, graphical and user interface
design through to software implementation, hosting, site status and
reliability monitoring

<LI>Advice on site design and hosting issues, especially for
automated Web sites

<LI>Complementary products such as our <A HREF="webview.htm">SPIS Webview</A> offline browser,
and <A HREF="webwatch.htm">Webwatch site monitor</A> and <A HREF="../compress.htm">TCompress File and Database Compression</A> components.
</UL>
<P>Some successful Webhub sites we've developed or consulted on
include:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.NetTravel.co.nz">NetTravel New Zealand</A> -- a set of six
highly automated sites including custom search engine, faxmail,
database-driven pages, remote administration, security and accounting
functions. Contact: <A HREF="mailto:admin@NetTravel.co.nz">Graham Crocombe</A> (admin@Nettravel.co.nz)

<LI><A HREF="http://www.chchpoly.ac.nz">Christchurch Polytechnic</A> -- a largely static site whose 1200 pages of
course and paper related information are quickly generated from a database
using Webhub. Contact: <A HREF="mailto:fieldg@lib.chchp.ac.nz">Guy Field</A> (fieldg@lib.chchp.ac.nz)

<LI>Southpower Ltd's Intranet site, which went from "what is possible?"
to a fully operational prototype of several key functions in under a
month. Contact: <A HREF="mailto:harrism@southpower.co.nz">Mark Harris</A> (harrism@southpower.co.nz)

<A NAME="About"></A><H2>About WebCentre</H2>

<P>WebCentre is <A HREF="../index.htm">our</A> soapbox, from which we earnestly seek to promote the development of responsive, readable and visitor-friendly Web sites in New Zealand. We do this with exhortations, cogent arguments, examples, a touch of humour and the odd bit of rabble rousing (which will naturally pass over the gentle reader).</P>
 
<P>Pet hates and jealousies are not excluded, but we've tried to mute our most trenchant criticisms in the full knowledge that the Web is a frontier, with sheriffs who never leave their office.</P>

<P>WebCentre is also where we (that is, <A HREF="../pin.htm#spis">SPIS Ltd)</A> get to talk about the sites we've done, are doing, and some of our plans for the future. But that's purely incidental.</P>

<P>So, without further ado...</P>

<A NAME="Sites We Made"></A><H2>A Selection of Sites We Have Made (or Remade)</H2>

<UL>
<LI><A href="www.wpm.co.nz/">Windpower Monthly Magazine</A> -- the world's premiere magazine for those in the business of windpower.

<LI><A HREF= "http://www.nettravel.co.nz/">NetTravel</A> -- a large, database-driven, searchable list of New Zealand accommodation providers, complete with a booking service, and substantial site automation and remote maintenance. Written for <A HREF="whynt.htm">Windows NT</A> using Borland Delphi and <A HREF="Webhub">Webhub.</A>

<LI><A HREF= "http://www.northland.ac.nz/nrc">Northland Regional Council</A>'s multi-level corporate site, with an explanation of what they do, a photo gallery, an educational section and general information about the Northland Region.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.chchpoly.ac.nz/">Christchurch Polytechnic's site</A>. The course and paper pages on this site are regularly generated from a database using <A HREF="webhub.htm">Webhub.</A>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.spis.co.nz/ssb/ssb.htm">South Sea Books,</A> a catalogue and ordering system for used and rare books. The catalogue is automatically updated every two months from the South Sea Books database.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.securicor.co.nz/">SecuriCor 3Net's</A> new corporate web site (formerly known as Network Dynamics)

<LI>The <A href="http://www.spis.co.nz/skeptics.htm">NZ Skeptics</A> -- the group to join if you're tired of New Age claptrap.</LI>

<LI>Takenaka Corporation's English language web site. As we have a long history of dealings in the Japanese market, it was natural that this huge Osaka-based architectural conglomerate would turn to us to make a quality English language site which nevertheless matched (and improved upon) the design standards of their Japanese site.<BR>
<I>(Still under development, in concert with our <A HREF="../pin.htm#MIR">partners</A> in Japan).</I>

</UL>

<A Name= "Sites We Like"></A><H2>Sites We Like</H2>

<P>Most of all, we like sites  that <strong>work</strong> rather than those which just have pretty pictures. But you'll get our attention if the pretty pictures are really <I>interesting,</I> -- like NASA's site for example.

<P>
<A href="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">Alta Vista</A> -- search the world's sites easily. The site we visit most often.<BR>
<A href="http://www.nasa.gov">NASA</A> -- lotsa cool stuff! And it works just fine with images off.<BR>
<A href="http://www.searchnz.co.nz/">SearchNZ</A> -- search all NZ sites easily, a "fuzzy" search
 engine, restricted to New Zealand cyberspace<BR>
</P>

<H2><a Name= "Sites We Hate">Sites We Loathe</A></H2>

<P>The slow ones, the badly spelt, the terrible HTML, the browser-specific, the unresponsive, the lousy navigation, the useless-with-images-off, the no feedback possible, the "must have frames"...</P>

<P><A href="http://wolf.co.net/index.html">Background tiles should not obscure the text</A>. And silly things to do with frames.<BR>
<A href="http://members.tripod.com/~baydolph/index.html">Shouting doesn't help get your message across</A>. Neither does blinking text.</P>

<P>We don't check these every week, so some may have improved since we added the link -- do <A HREF="mailto:peter@spis.co.nz">let us know...</A> If you'd care to nominate a site, we'd be happy to <A HREF="mailto:peter@spis.co.nz">hear about it.</A>
<P>And If you have a sick fascination with bad sites, check out <A href="http://www.mirsky.com/wow/">Mirsky's Worst of the Web</A>.

</TABLE>

<P>We're a media-based organisation and we've learnt the best ways of presenting material to the rest of the Fourth Estate. The tricks of the trade are many and varied, and you have to know the difference between a press release and a feature story, what is news and what isn't, how to present your material -- and yourself -- appropriately to get your message across. We can help you do that through the range of media services we offer.

<A NAME="MediaLiaison"></A><H3>Media liaison</H3>

<P>SPIS has close links with other media organisations and considerable experience in producing feature articles and press releases which get attention in both print and broadcast media. We know how to write material that the media will want to use.

<P>That's because we do a lot of writing and broadcasting ourselves. Since our inception, we've provided news and feature articles on a regular basis to more than a dozen publications and numerous broadcast outlets, in New Zealand and around the world. There's news items on the New Zealand wind energy scene, produced for the Danish magazine <CITE>Windpower Monthly</CITE>,
<!-- Pending: WPM link here --> a monthly astronomy column for the <CITE>New Zealand Herald</CITE>, the eighth year of the Momentum science column in Japan's <A HREF="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/index-e.htm"><CITE>Daily Yomiuri</CITE></A>, and the monthly science slot on Alison Parr's Sunday show on National Radio.

<P>We can help you get better press coverage and establish more effective media relationships by helping you to:
<UL>
<LI>Research, write and distribute media releases on a regular basis</LI>
<LI>Prepare feature articles about specific initiatives or products</LI>
<LI>Field and answer media enquiries</LI>
<LI>Plan and organise media days and events</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="MediaTraining"><H3>Media training</H3></A>

<P>We can provide seminars and training materials to better equip you and your staff to deal with the media. We can give you the skills to look at your own media relations and see how they can be improved. We can help you develop better media management over a range of areas, including:
<UL>
<LI>Identifying your target media and building press relations</LI>
<LI>Analysing your press releases to identify weak points and make them effective</LI>
<LI>Interview preparation for print and broadcast media</LI>

<P>Everyone's excited about electronic publishing, whether on the Web or off-line, but not a lot of people have the information or the ability to use this new media to its fullest potential. We've got the skills and knowledge to help you make the most of your electronic publishing opportunities.

<P>If you want to use electronic access as part of your national and international marketing strategy, electronic marketing offers a whole new field of opportunity. We provide services that range from basic information or promotional packages in electronic form through to the production of electronic catalogues that will keep your staff and your customers up to date with what you have to offer.
 
<A NAME="WebPage"></A><H3>Web site design and maintenance</H3>

<P>Top Web sites get thousands of visits each day and they achieve that popularity for very good reasons -- they're well designed, interesting, interactive. We can help you design your Web site so people will want to visit it, learning about your organisation and its activities -- just as they do with our popular Web site primer <A HREF="/spis/climb.htm"><CITE>Climbing Out on the Web.</CITE></A>

<P>Web pages are often dynamic -- generated from product or information databases as required. We have the design skills and tools to automatically deliver information on demand.

<P>Design is an important starting point but if a Web page goes "stale", people notice. On-going maintenance is important, particularly when you Web page is acting as your electronic front door.

<P>We can take the drudgery of Web page maintenance out of your hands by providing regular re-designs and updates at designated intervals, or through daily monitoring and analysis of how your page is received in the competitive electronic scene.

<P>In addition to <A HREF="/spis/climb.htm"><CITE>Climbing Out on the Web,</CITE></A> we have a selection of sample <A HREF="webpacks.htm#All">Web site designs</A> with indicative pricing, including:</P>

<P>How often have you had to hunt for a manual, only to find that it's well out of date as far as your system is concerned? On-line documentation offers an effective way of ensuring that your documentation is up-to-date and accessible to everyone.

<P>We can organise disk, network or CD-based documentation using standard tools such as Adobe Acrobat&reg; or HTML, with access systems designed to make it easy to read and use on screen. You can update and distribute your documentation at will, allowing everyone to benefit.

<A NAME="OnlineHelp"></A><H3>On-line help and support systems</H3>

<P>Software is only as good as the information used to run it and support it. We can design effective Windows-based help systems that can solve many of the bottlenecks experienced as people struggle to use new packages.

<P>Not only that, but we can provide on-line support sites with dial-in or Net access to new files, support information and product releases.

<P>Got a mountain of press clippings going yellow and mouldering in some filing cabinet for lack of use? Burn them! Instead, use <CITE>MediaMonitor</CITE>, an advanced Windows-based package to effectively automate the gathering, storage, retrieval and analysis of your press material.

<P><CITE>MediaMonitor</CITE> clients such as Visa International and Barclays Plc use it as an effective way of storing and analysing vast quantities of press clippings (including scanned images) collected by their PR agencies. Instead of the paper wars they had previously, they now have instant online access and sophisticated analysis and trend-tracking.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Discussion Document<BR>
<SMALL>&quot;Why More and More Internet Service Providers are offering Windows- and Mac-based platforms.&quot;</SMALL>
</H1>
<P><I>This document was originally written in December 1995, predicting rapid growth the the number of Windows hosted Web sites. As of October 1996, its predictions seem to have been borne out...</I>
<P><OL>
<LI>The Web market is exploding (stats available, but we all know them anyway)</LI>
<LI>Consequently every Joan and her dog are starting to consider putting their product/organisation/membership/recipe/catalogue/you-name-it information on-line, for better or worse.</LI>
<LI>Larger companies who use Unix/VMS/etc based machines generally get their own Net connection rather than using independent service providers (ISPs) for site hosting. The small to medium and personal computer world is therefore where the ISPs will reap their market.
<LI>In that market segment, 80-90% of the &quot;sharp end&quot; (i.e. sales oriented) information is held on PCs, maybe more. [This is picked entirely out of the air, but I bet it would stand up if tested]</LI>
</OL>
<P>Thus, the <EM>source</EM> of existing information which is likely to be placed on-line is any number of PC or Mac based databases, word processor documents and occasionally spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>A Web site developer is thus left with a few alternative ways of getting it on-line:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>Create static HTML pages <EM>once</EM>, and update by hand as required (we've done this)
<LI>Create static HTML pages on a regular basis, updating in toto using a conversion utility (we've done this too)
<LI>Create a form of searchable/interactive flat-file database on Unix by converting the PC data (no fun at <I>all</I> the first time)
<LI>Implement a Web front-end to an existing PC database via Win-CGI or ISAPI on a Windows-based server (our experiences of doing this using <A HREF="webhub.htm">Webhub</A> have been relatively pain-free)
</OL>
<P>Note that, in contrast to (a) to (c), option (d) requires no conversion step. It also means that the developer gets to use their programming language and operating system of choice -- which is bound to lead to higher productivity. It also means they can fully install, debug and test-bed the system in-house, not over a Unix $$/hour shell link to their service provider. These are very significant benefits which no developer will ignore.
</P>
<P>Of course, if it were only a matter of cozening a couple of diehard Unix-phobe developers, it would be of no concern. But quite apart from those developers who are more comfortable in the Windows world, there is the massive market of PC users (all obtaining HTML and CGI add-ons and export functions for their current apps) who represent the main growth area in Web users. At this moment, they don't know they want a service provider who has a Windows host option. But in a matter of months, they'll be demanding it -- warts and all.
</P>
<P>And there are warts, naturally enough -- performance on an NT server is arguably lower than an equivalent Unix or Linux machine, and security may take more effort to get a workable solution. But performance isn't everything -- otherwise we'd all be closing Netscape whenever the transfer rate drops below our modem speed.
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the ISP who gets an NT box and sticks it alongside their Sun whizz-bangs will probably fare better in the marketplace than those who don't.
</P>
<H2>IMHO. &lt;g&gt;

<P>Amongst our other <A HREF="/spis/services.htm">services,</A> we  create customised autostereograms. A sample (which we've nick-named <A HREF="/spis/sam.htm">Sam Bracanov</A>)  is provided below.

<P>To view an autostereogram, relax and try to stare <EM>through</EM> the screen. After a time, the hidden image should float out of the background.

<P><A HREF="/spis/images/stereosa.gif"><IMG SRC="/spis/images/s_stereo.gif" ALT=[Sample] ALIGN=center></A> (41K)

<P>Autostereograms are often produced to decorate postcards or greetings cards.  You can have your corporate or personal logo appear out of a background of your choice. We can create just the image (either on disk, or as a colour laser-printed masterpiece), or we can design and print the cards for you.

<P>Your cards, posters and tee-shirts can also showcase specially-commissioned <A HREF="/spis/people.htm#nick">Nick</A> cartoons, targeted at your activities or audience.

<P>If you're interested in knowing more about this service, please email our <A HREF="mailto:stereo@spis.co.nz">stereogram designer</A>

</HEAD>

<BODY TEXT="#000099" BGCOLOR="#ffffcc">
<A name="top"></A>
<H1><CITE><IMG SRC="../images/nzsmlogo.gif" height=66 width=240 ALIGN=top alt="New Zealand Science Monthly"></CITE> In the April issue:</H1>

<H2> Quick Dips</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Ever wanted to see a sheep - without the blood and guts? Dissection has been made easier with Aries, the Digital Sheep, put together by AgResearch and a team of Taieri High School students. 
</LI>

<LI>Frogs are disappearing all over the world and New Zealand scientists are part of an international effort to find out what's happening to the amphibians in a new monitoring programme.
</LI>

<LI>IRL researchers have found a way to calibrate highly accurate temperature-measuring equipment  for one-hundredth the cost of conventional approaches.

</UL>

<H2>When will the Mosquitoes Strike?</H2>

<P>Diseases carried by mosquitoes are on the increase all over the world -- can they be kept out of New Zealand? <STRONG>Philip Weinstein</STRONG> of the Ministry of Health thinks it's just a matter of time.

<P>Dengue fever, yellow fever, Ross River virus and others are spreading along with the mosquitoes that carry the diseases. Already potentially dangerous mosquitoes have been found in New Zealand and tourists arriving home from infected areas have brought new viruses into the country.

<P>&quot;Although the differing vector capabilities of local mosquitoes and the different climates in the Pacific and in New Zealand may partly account for the lack of transmission in New Zealand, a small virus pool and a lot of good luck are probably more significant factors. We were lucky that time, but what of the future?&quot;

<H2>Stormy Weather for Rainmakers</H2>

<P><STRONG>Steve Matthewman</STRONG> of Auckland University's Sociology Department shows that the contested case of weather modification is an interesting mix of science, pseudo-science and bad science.

<P>&quot;Praised as a project with significant potential to benefit mankind, and publicly reviled as the crime of the century in Pennsylvania, weather modification has elicited exaggerated praise and blame.&quot;

<P>Should we look to cloud seeding to boost depleted aquifers and help drought-stricken areas? Knowing the history and the science behind such efforts suggests the answer. 

<H2>Glowworm Man</H2>

<P>A 22-year-old post-grad from Massey University spends much of his time lurking in dark caves, wading through freezing water to film hundreds of hours of glowworm activity. <STRONG>Adam Broadley</STRONG> writes of his study of this curious creepy-crawly.

<H2>Under the Microscope</H2>

<P><CITE>Test your Psychic Powers</CITE> by Susan Blackmore and Adam Hart-Davis (Harper Collins 1995) gets the thumbs up from Professor Bernard Howard, the Secretary of the NZ Skeptics, as an interesting and informative book with useful tests and critical interpretations.

<P><CITE>The World Unfolds</CITE> series (Viking/Penguin 1995) of concertina-folded books provides a 1.5-metre look at skyscrapers, dinosaurs, the human body and aircraft. Something to keep the children - and may adults - quiet on a wet afternoon, says <CITE>NZSM</CITE> editor and reviewer Vicki Hyde.

<A name="top"></A>
<H1><CITE><IMG SRC="../images/nzsmlogo.gif" height=66 width=240 ALIGN=top alt="New Zealand Science Monthly"></CITE> In the December/January issue:</H1>



<H2>Quick Dips and Over the Horizon</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Ball lightning caused by atmospheric vortices may explain UFO sightings.</LI>

<LI>The winning entry in this year's New Zealand Annual Micromouse Contest looked like a cross between Terminator 2 and something out of Doctor Who, and it blew away the local and international competitors.</LI>

<LI>How do you get a pair of identical twin birds? By the very rare event of having two yolks in a single egg. Identical twin emus in New Zealand are thought to be a world first for birdkind.</LI>

<LI>There's more to read -- finding a lost comet, solving the mystery of the New Zealand eel's sex life, and checking out the dangers of toxic algal blooms.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Talking in Real Time</H2>

<P>There's good reason for the fast drone of the racing commentator -- it provides a linguistic means of making efficient use of memory resources, according to Canterbury University's <STRONG>Koenraad Kuiper</STRONG>.</P>

<P>Although talking is something we take for granted, it's actually a very complex business -- how <CITE>does</CITE> the brain keep up with someone who needs to say a lot very quickly? Race callers have to remember the names of the horses, how long the race is, the names of the jockeys and a whole host of other information which has to be recalled and spoken within a short space of time. In addition, the situation in a race can change dramatically within a very short period. Race commentators have to cope with this somehow (compare their situation to that of cricket commentators who sometimes have hours to describe play...)</P>

<P>Sports announcers have characteristic techniques that enable them to talk rapidly without stumbling, using formulae or set phrases ("and they're off!") to fill up the commentary without filling up the short-term memory; the monotone reduces the amount of processing needed in normal speech.</P>

<P>The speech used in slow sports does not have these properties. Formulae are used, but by no means exclusively. Intonation is frequently animated -- after all there isn't much else happening in a cricket game a lot of the time. Looking at the way the different sports announcers use speech tells us something about how the brain works.</P>

<H2>A Close-Up Look at Food</H2>

<P>Food researchers really like to see what they're eating, and Dairy Research Institute scientist <STRONG>Tony McKenna</STRONG> provides a look at how to look at food.

<P>A variety of sophisticated techniques allows researchers to gain a better idea of how foods are formed, behave and even taste by looking at how their basic components fit together.</P>

<P>McKenna freezes food, shatters it, embeds it in resin, coats it with gold or platinum and even zaps it with lasers to get the best idea of what is happening down in the depths of important dairy products, from cheese to ice cream.</P>

<H2>Spotlight</H2>

This month's Spotlight shines on the Southland Explorers Club and what these intrepid young explorers find combing the 26 kilometres of Oreti Beach, near Invercargill.

<H2>Under the Microscope</H2>

<P><CITE>Wrinkles in Time</CITE>, by George Smoot and Kay Davidson (Abacus/Penguin, $24.95) is a lively, well-written and non-technical account, warmly recommended by astronomer <STRONG>John Hearnshaw.</STRONG>

<P><CITE>Developing Ecotourism in New Zealand</CITE> by Julie Warren and C. Nicholas Taylor (SR&amp;D/Statistics New Zealand, $19.95) gets a mixed review from ecotourism operator <STRONG>Rodney Russ.</STRONG>

<P><CITE>Mineral Wealth of New Zealand</CITE> by Bruce Thompson, Bob Brathwaite and Tony Christie (IGNS, $49.95) is a colourful and well-presented technical resource book for the general audience, writes the <CITE>NZ Science Monthly's</CITE> <STRONG>Ros Davis.</STRONG>


<H3>And that's not all! See what you can come up with for the Picotaphs competition in our <STRONG>Neurobics</STRONG> puzzle column.</H3>

<P>The <CITE>New Zealand Science Monthly</CITE> provides an informative, readable 
look at New Zealand science and technology. Its readership is very 
diverse: Cabinet Ministers, secondary school pupils, university staff 
and students, top business management, researchers, engineers, farmers - anyone 
with an interest in science and technology in this country. 
</P>

<P>As such, we aim to explain clearly scientific research, technological 
developments and applications. In order to cover a broad range of 
topics, many of the items are brief. Space restrictions mean conciseness 
is valued. Footnotes and references are not required.
</P>

<P>At this stage, we are unable to offer payment for material, but welcome submissions. We're happy to receive copies of abstracts or conference presentations too.
</P>

Text can be:
<ul>
<li><A href="mailto:nzsm@spis.co.nz">e-mailed</A> to us</li>
<li>mailed in printed/typed form to P.O. Box 19-760, Christchurch</li>
<li>sent as ASCII text on an IBM-compatible disk (any size, will 
be returned if labelled)</li>
<li>faxed to us at: (03) 384-5138</li>
</ul>


<H3>The requirements for the different sections are:
</H3>

<P><STRONG>Quick Dips</STRONG>: short news items and information on research, technological 
developments and so on. One paragraph to ten (50-500 words). Accompanying 
photos or graphics most appreciated.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Over the Horizon</STRONG>: the same as Quick Dips only with an international 
connection - collaborative research, visiting researchers and 
suchlike.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Features</STRONG>: longer articles on scientific and technological items 
and issues. 500-3,000 words. Graphics appreciated.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Viewpoint</STRONG>: opinion pieces on issues that concern, interest or 
exasperate people involved in science and technology. 500-800 words.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Spotlight</STRONG>: profiles of or by individual researchers or teams, 
giving an idea of what it's like working as a researcher and why people 
get into it. This is aimed at giving readers a perception of scientists/technologists 
as people. 500-800 words, plus photo.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Under the Microscope</STRONG>: reviews of science or technology-related 
books, not necessarily New Zealand material. Information needed includes 
the name of the book, author/s or editor/s, publishers and date of 
publication, number of pages and NZ$ price. It should provide an opinion 
of the book, rather than just a pr&eacute;cis. 50-300 words.
</P>

<P><Strong>Discovery</strong>: pieces directly related to education at any level from primary to tertiary. 100-800 words.

<P><STRONG>Black Hole</STRONG>: a light-hearted look at any aspect of science and 
technology. 500-800 words, including a humorous bio sentence about 
the writer.

<LI>Once I got given a bunch of trophies at school, but I had to give them back.</LI>
</UL>

<P>In the mid-80s, I spent six inscrutable years in Japan working for a great little computer company which later got swallowed by a giant (Toshiba). Some of my time was spent refereeing a development team consisting of stroppy Kiwis, Irish, Nihonjin, Koreans and one token American. When I wasn't doing that, I was jet-setting all over the world, learning interesting things about the insides of hotels, airports and restaurants.

<P>In '89 <A HREF="/spis/people.htm#Vicki">Vicki</A> and I spent a few fantastic months re-visiting these places, and discovered that they had museums, architecture, scenery and <EM>people!</EM> Then we came home and settled in Christchurch, New Zealand, which is <A HREF="http://WWW.Regy.Canterbury.ac.nz/CH_Promo/HasItAll.html">The Place To Be</A>.

<P>And started <A HREF="/spis/pin.htm#SPIS">this business...</A>

<A NAME="SAT"><H3>What I do with my time:</H3></A>
<P>When working, I <A HREF="/spis/softserv.htm#SoftwareEngineering">design and develop software</A>, generally Windows-based applications these days. Most of this is done using <A HREF="/spis/softserv.htm#Programming">Borland's Delphi and Paradox</A>. At the moment, I'm up to my neck in <A HREF="/spis/softserv.htm">electronic publishing</A> applications, such as presenting databases <A HREF="/spis/softserv.htm#WebPage">on the Web</A>.  I really <I>enjoy</I> this stuff!

<P>Otherwise, I fly whenever the bank balance is almost in the black, travel whenever I can't get away with flying, dress up in funny clothes and pose as a <A HREF="/spis/sca.htm">12th-Century</A> scoundrel, and read endless books to David and Perry. That is, when we're not up on the roof playing petanque.

<P>I write stories too, at least one of which was described as "amusing". It even got published: in <A HREF="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/~thetroll/phlogiston.html"><CITE>Phlogiston.</CITE></A><BR><A HREF="/spis/autotran.htm">I've got proof!</A>

<P>I've also been known to act, but I won't bore you with the reviews...

<H3>Qualifications & Experience:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>BSc (Psychology) BA (Sociology)  </LI>
<LI>Mother of two horribly cute little boys (must be genetics)</LI>
<LI>I've got a big bronze Science and Technology Medal of New Zealand which makes a great paperweight</LI>
</UL>

<P>After abandoning Auckland to start a Canterbury science degree in astrophysics, I wandered through a startlingly diverse range of departments in search of a major, and ended up with the perfect academic background for a science journalist -- I know a little about everything, but not a great deal about anything in particular.

<P>I spent my sojourn in Japan working for a <A HREF="http://www.twics.com/~COMLINE/links.html">
science and technology</A> database and, later, as a science and front-page editor for one of the four main English daily newspapers, <A HREF="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/index-e.htm"><CITE>The Daily Yomiuri.</CITE></A> I also ended up as local correspondent for about a dozen technical magazines, covering broadcasting, telecommunications, energy, ceramics, even shipping and the duty-free industry.

<P>Frustration at the lack of science coverage in the New Zealand media led me to establish the <A HREF="/spis/nzsm/nzsm.htm"><I>New Zealand Science Monthly</I></A> in 1990. While it hasn't exactly led to fame and fortune, we must be doing something right -- we're still going strong!


<H3>What I do with my time:</H3>

<P>Well, there's the <A HREF="/spis/nzsm/nzsm.htm"><I>New Zealand Science Monthly</I></A> and the other regular (and irregular) <A HREF="/spis/editserv.htm">publishing</A> work that I either do or manage as SPIS's managing editor. (If you want to be seen to support New Zealand science and technology, and have dollars to burn in your advertising budget, I want to <A HREF="mailto:nzsm@spis.co.nz">hear from you!)</A>

<P>Then there's being Chair-entity for the <A HREF="/spis/skeptics.htm">New Zealand Skeptics</A>, which involves (among other things) early morning calls from radio stations every Friday 13th. *sigh*

<P>If I'm lucky, I get to put on my 16-gauge steel helm and camail, my breastplate, my padded gambeson, my knee and elbow pads, my groin protection, my puncture-proof trousers and my boots, and go out and shoot arrows at <A HREF="/spis/people.htm#Peter">Peter</A> (see <A HREF="/spis/sca.htm">SCA</A>).

<P>If I'm <I>really</I> lucky, I hit him.

<H1><CITE><IMG SRC="../images/nzsmlogo.gif" height=66 width=240 ALIGN=top alt="New Zealand Science Monthly"></CITE> In the April issue:</H1>

<H2> Quick Dips</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Ever wanted to see a sheep - without the blood and guts? Dissection has been made easier with Aries, the Digital Sheep, put together by AgResearch and a team of Taieri High School students. 
</LI>

<LI>Frogs are disappearing all over the world and New Zealand scientists are part of an international effort to find out what's happening to the amphibians in a new monitoring programme.
</LI>

<LI>IRL researchers have found a way to calibrate highly accurate temperature-measuring equipment  for one-hundredth the cost of conventional approaches.

</UL>

<H2>When will the Mosquitoes Strike?</H2>

<P>Diseases carried by mosquitoes are on the increase all over the world -- can they be kept out of New Zealand? <STRONG>Philip Weinstein</STRONG> of the Ministry of Health thinks it's just a matter of time.

<P>Dengue fever, yellow fever, Ross River virus and others are spreading along with the mosquitoes that carry the diseases. Already potentially dangerous mosquitoes have been found in New Zealand and tourists arriving home from infected areas have brought new viruses into the country.

<P>&quot;Although the differing vector capabilities of local mosquitoes and the different climates in the Pacific and in New Zealand may partly account for the lack of transmission in New Zealand, a small virus pool and a lot of good luck are probably more significant factors. We were lucky that time, but what of the future?&quot;

<H2>Stormy Weather for Rainmakers</H2>

<P><STRONG>Steve Matthewman</STRONG> of Auckland University's Sociology Department shows that the contested case of weather modification is an interesting mix of science, pseudo-science and bad science.

<P>&quot;Praised as a project with significant potential to benefit mankind, and publicly reviled as the crime of the century in Pennsylvania, weather modification has elicited exaggerated praise and blame.&quot;

<P>Should we look to cloud seeding to boost depleted aquifers and help drought-stricken areas? Knowing the history and the science behind such efforts suggests the answer. 

<H2>Glowworm Man</H2>

<P>A 22-year-old post-grad from Massey University spends much of his time lurking in dark caves, wading through freezing water to film hundreds of hours of glowworm activity. <STRONG>Adam Broadley</STRONG> writes of his study of this curious creepy-crawly.

<H2>Under the Microscope</H2>

<P><CITE>Test your Psychic Powers</CITE> by Susan Blackmore and Adam Hart-Davis (Harper Collins 1995) gets the thumbs up from Professor Bernard Howard, the Secretary of the NZ Skeptics, as an interesting and informative book with useful tests and critical interpretations.

<P><CITE>The World Unfolds</CITE> series (Viking/Penguin 1995) of concertina-folded books provides a 1.5-metre look at skyscrapers, dinosaurs, the human body and aircraft. Something to keep the children - and may adults - quiet on a wet afternoon, says <CITE>NZSM</CITE> editor and reviewer Vicki Hyde.

<H1><CITE><IMG SRC="../images/nzsmlogo.gif" height=66 width=240 ALIGN=top alt="New Zealand Science Monthly"></CITE> In the December/January issue:</H1>



<H2>Quick Dips and Over the Horizon</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Ball lightning caused by atmospheric vortices may explain UFO sightings.</LI>

<LI>The winning entry in this year's New Zealand Annual Micromouse Contest looked like a cross between Terminator 2 and something out of Doctor Who, and it blew away the local and international competitors.</LI>

<LI>How do you get a pair of identical twin birds? By the very rare event of having two yolks in a single egg. Identical twin emus in New Zealand are thought to be a world first for birdkind.</LI>

<LI>There's more to read -- finding a lost comet, solving the mystery of the New Zealand eel's sex life, and checking out the dangers of toxic algal blooms.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Talking in Real Time</H2>

<P>There's good reason for the fast drone of the racing commentator -- it provides a linguistic means of making efficient use of memory resources, according to Canterbury University's <STRONG>Koenraad Kuiper</STRONG>.</P>

<P>Although talking is something we take for granted, it's actually a very complex business -- how <CITE>does</CITE> the brain keep up with someone who needs to say a lot very quickly? Race callers have to remember the names of the horses, how long the race is, the names of the jockeys and a whole host of other information which has to be recalled and spoken within a short space of time. In addition, the situation in a race can change dramatically within a very short period. Race commentators have to cope with this somehow (compare their situation to that of cricket commentators who sometimes have hours to describe play...)</P>

<P>Sports announcers have characteristic techniques that enable them to talk rapidly without stumbling, using formulae or set phrases ("and they're off!") to fill up the commentary without filling up the short-term memory; the monotone reduces the amount of processing needed in normal speech.</P>

<P>The speech used in slow sports does not have these properties. Formulae are used, but by no means exclusively. Intonation is frequently animated -- after all there isn't much else happening in a cricket game a lot of the time. Looking at the way the different sports announcers use speech tells us something about how the brain works.</P>

<H2>A Close-Up Look at Food</H2>

<P>Food researchers really like to see what they're eating, and Dairy Research Institute scientist <STRONG>Tony McKenna</STRONG> provides a look at how to look at food.

<P>A variety of sophisticated techniques allows researchers to gain a better idea of how foods are formed, behave and even taste by looking at how their basic components fit together.</P>

<P>McKenna freezes food, shatters it, embeds it in resin, coats it with gold or platinum and even zaps it with lasers to get the best idea of what is happening down in the depths of important dairy products, from cheese to ice cream.</P>

<H2>Spotlight</H2>

This month's Spotlight shines on the Southland Explorers Club and what these intrepid young explorers find combing the 26 kilometres of Oreti Beach, near Invercargill.

<H2>Under the Microscope</H2>

<P><CITE>Wrinkles in Time</CITE>, by George Smoot and Kay Davidson (Abacus/Penguin, $24.95) is a lively, well-written and non-technical account, warmly recommended by astronomer <STRONG>John Hearnshaw.</STRONG>

<P><CITE>Developing Ecotourism in New Zealand</CITE> by Julie Warren and C. Nicholas Taylor (SR&amp;D/Statistics New Zealand, $19.95) gets a mixed review from ecotourism operator <STRONG>Rodney Russ.</STRONG>

<P><CITE>Mineral Wealth of New Zealand</CITE> by Bruce Thompson, Bob Brathwaite and Tony Christie (IGNS, $49.95) is a colourful and well-presented technical resource book for the general audience, writes the <CITE>NZ Science Monthly's</CITE> <STRONG>Ros Davis.</STRONG>


<H3>And that's not all! See what you can come up with for the Picotaphs competition in our <STRONG>Neurobics</STRONG> puzzle column.</H3>

<P>The <CITE>New Zealand Science Monthly</CITE> provides an informative, readable 
look at New Zealand science and technology. Its readership is very 
diverse: Cabinet Ministers, secondary school pupils, university staff 
and students, top business management, researchers, engineers, farmers - anyone 
with an interest in science and technology in this country. 
</P>

<P>As such, we aim to explain clearly scientific research, technological 
developments and applications. In order to cover a broad range of 
topics, many of the items are brief. Space restrictions mean conciseness 
is valued. Footnotes and references are not required.
</P>

<P>At this stage, we are unable to offer payment for material, but welcome submissions. We're happy to receive copies of abstracts or conference presentations too.
</P>

Text can be:
<ul>
<li><A href="mailto:nzsm@spis.co.nz">e-mailed</A> to us</li>
<li>mailed in printed/typed form to P.O. Box 19-760, Christchurch</li>
<li>sent as ASCII text on an IBM-compatible disk (any size, will 
be returned if labelled)</li>
<li>faxed to us at: (03) 384-5138</li>
</ul>


<H3>The requirements for the different sections are:
</H3>

<P><STRONG>Quick Dips</STRONG>: short news items and information on research, technological 
developments and so on. One paragraph to ten (50-500 words). Accompanying 
photos or graphics most appreciated.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Over the Horizon</STRONG>: the same as Quick Dips only with an international 
connection - collaborative research, visiting researchers and 
suchlike.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Features</STRONG>: longer articles on scientific and technological items 
and issues. 500-3,000 words. Graphics appreciated.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Viewpoint</STRONG>: opinion pieces on issues that concern, interest or 
exasperate people involved in science and technology. 500-800 words.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Spotlight</STRONG>: profiles of or by individual researchers or teams, 
giving an idea of what it's like working as a researcher and why people 
get into it. This is aimed at giving readers a perception of scientists/technologists 
as people. 500-800 words, plus photo.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Under the Microscope</STRONG>: reviews of science or technology-related 
books, not necessarily New Zealand material. Information needed includes 
the name of the book, author/s or editor/s, publishers and date of 
publication, number of pages and NZ$ price. It should provide an opinion 
of the book, rather than just a pr&eacute;cis. 50-300 words.
</P>

<P><Strong>Discovery</strong>: pieces directly related to education at any level from primary to tertiary. 100-800 words.

<P><STRONG>Black Hole</STRONG>: a light-hearted look at any aspect of science and 
technology. 500-800 words, including a humorous bio sentence about 
the writer.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Graphics</STRONG>: photos, slides, graphs, charts, maps, cartoons, pictures 
and any other form of artwork. Graphics for all items are desired, 
and will be returned if requested and fully labelled.
</P>

<H1>Science and Politics Don't Mix Easily</H1>

<P>Politics and science can make uneasy bedfellows, particularly when a political agenda attempts to drive science. Much in all as politicians may want the world to work in the fashion that they decree, reality has a habit of catching up with them, sometimes with disastrous results. Millions and millions of people starved to death in the Soviet Union when the political machine attempted to drive the country's agricultural science. 

<P>In some cases, one might argue that there has been a certain ironic twist when political motives have suborned science: German chemist Fritz Haber, best known in New Zealand for his development of manufactured fertiliser, was also the head of Germany's 1920's poison gas programme. He lost his job when Hitler came to power, and was forced into exile for being Jewish, but the programme continued.

<P>Others have withstood the blandishments of politicians and recognised the need for a morality that rises above that of petty nationalism: last century Michael Faraday was asked by the British government to direct a poison gas project for use against the Russians in the Crimean War. He told them yes, the work was feasible, and no, he would have absolutely nothing to do with it.

<P>And then there was the attempt by the Arizona State legislature to simplify mathematics by redefining the constant <I>pi</i> as 3...

<H1>Video Reviews</H1>

<H3><CITE>The Day After</CITE>*</H3>

<P>It just goes to show what can happen when you let nuclear-related information run riot, and the explosive results cross national boundaries. However, the Americans just can't do grime, terror and hardship convincingly and this movie comes across like the cross between <CITE>The Waltons</CITE> and <CITE>The Longest Day</CITE>. If you get a chance, check out the much older, and much more believeably horrific <CITE>War Game</CITE> (commissioned by the BBC but never officially broadcast, as far as I am aware -- don't watch it if you're feeling depressed). Most environment groups and quality video stores should be able to point you toward a copy.
</P>
<H3><CITE>On The Beach</CITE>****</H3>

<P>Life's a beach, man. Well, it would be, wouldn't it, if you were left with nowhere to go but Australia? Just be thankful that you can admire a quality film and know that its particular plot line is far less likely than it once was.</P>

<H3><CITE>Cromwell</CITE> ****</H3>

<P>Some might say that Oliver Cromwell had the right idea when it came to royalty -- you might think that, but I couldn't possibly comment. This film paints a fairly sympathetic view of the Roundhead cause with Richard Harris playing the husky-voiced lead role. Alec Guiness is suitably spaniel-eyed as Charles I. It's no great loss when he goes to the block. History tells us what happened after that, and it doesn't say much for the radical republican approach to politics.

<H3><CITE>The Fugitive</CITE> *** (worth a run)</H3>

<P>Harrison Ford does well playing the typical sort of nice guy we've come to expect, in his role as The Fugitive, Dr Richard Kimble. He wouldn't kill his wife, nah. It was the guy with one arm who did it. And that's what Kimble spends the next 125 minutes trying to prove while on the dodge from Deputy US Marshall Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). It's a good solid movie with obligatory chase scenes (the forest, the sewer, the building, the parade), good acting and  not too silly a plot line.

<HR>

<H1>Op-Ed Page</H1>
<H3>By: Professor Geoff Stedman</H3>

<P><BIG>The Minister of Health has vetoed a proposed &quot;radiation discussion&quot; between
the French Ambassador, Jacques Le Blanc, and the Director of the
National Radiation Laboratory in Christchurch, Dr Andrew McEwan.</BIG>
</P>

<P>Now the public are right to be ultra-cautious of the supposed scientific
expert. There are a small proportion of physicists whose opinions I
certainly would not trust even within the appropriate specialty. (Is it
any different within any other profession or occupation?) Some experts
whom I know speak with arrogant complacency against the risks in nuclear
propulsion. That needs to be kept in balance. More importantly, the
far greater risks in petrol propulsion tend to be as firmly buried by
most of us.
</P>
<P>At the other end of the scale are still others who form a fixation and
drum up a pressure group ex nihilo: &quot;Would you allow <EM>your</EM> schoolgirl
daughter to be exposed to...&quot; whatever the speaker's latest hobby-horse
may be. It is great material for local community or parents' meetings.
It is guaranteed to fuel Luddite reaction against any change and (worst
of all) to blinker people into ignoring the major hazards of life.
</P>
<P>You can create an obsession, and most people have no sales resistance to
pseudoscientific lies. The media understandably love it and lionise the
provocative speaker. The simple and liberal insertion of subjunctives
can easily placate the responsibility for accurate journalism. The rest
of the profession sighs a deep sigh when a measured and informed reply
from a consensus view goes unreported.
</P>
<P>Dr McEwan certainly has had his share of such criticism. But I
would trust the Director of the National Radiation Laboratory, along
with the staff of the institutions this laboratory services, with
my life. Indeed, I have. And all New Zealanders have done so several
times over, as beneficiaries of many medically related services and
treatments during our life in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>The &quot;average person&quot; might well ask of any apparently controversial
scientific pronouncement: &quot;who can we believe?&quot; A satisfying answer is
not easy. But it has one guaranteed component: full discussion by all
parties. I will suggest a few more:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>avoid emotive arguments -- what are the facts?</LI>
<LI>what are <EM>all</EM> the facts?</LI>
<LI>what evidence is there on other counts that each contributor is trustworthy?</LI>
<LI>what is a clear consensus between such trustworthy speakers in this open debate?</LI></UL>

<P>The Minister's action is open to the interpretation that the first
of these at least is precisely what is to be forbidden in this case.
Maybe the Minister did not intend this; but I suggest the effect will
be the same for many New Zealanders. This, sadly, fuels a public
climate of suspicion for any informed comment on any technical issue,
such as any possible hazards with cell-phones. And this
interpretation, even if a misinterpretation, will be more probable
for European observers and for their reportage of the debate.
</P>
<P>I am sure that Dr McEwan is not even remotely pushing his own political
view (whatever it is, or is not) as a private citizen when he makes
public statements on Mururoa. He is not intruding some personal amoral
perspective on nuclear warfare. He does not intrude his own convictions as a private citizen at
all. He is acting in public as the cautious civil servant, the
well-informed spokesperson for his laboratory, for the national medical
administration, for New Zealand health care, for an international
consensus view among the cream of the world's specialists in
health-related nuclear issues. He is not straying outside the confines
of purely scientific comment.
</P>
<P>It bothers me that it is this one utterly independent aspect of the
matter which the Minister appears to want to suppress. Jack White
may not discuss matters with Andrew McEwan. Is there a fear that the
truth will out? It certainly will.
</P>
<P>These comments do not arise from any trace of support of nuclear testing
in principle, or of the French decisions on this. Quite the opposite.
I suggest that the real battleground, and where we should be
fighting, lies elsewhere. In focussing on, and in apparently
endeavouring to discredit, the politically unpalatable but accurate
comments of sober scientists the Minister is unwittingly placing a new
bomb into French hands: the possibility of revealing to the world the
gullibility for pseudoscience of the people of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>It is an ironic development. At the moment we might appear to be
winning the international debate, morally if not legally. The worst
thing we can do as a nation is to compromise the topic of debate. If we
as a people risk international exposure for barking up the wrong
tree, we risk the situation that nothing we say or do will count where
it matters.
</P>
<P>As citizens as well as scientists, all New Zealand scientists are bound
to be deeply concerned about the moral issues raised by all warfare,
especially the unspeakable horror of nuclear war. We are all
concerned that the French action, even over the limited period which
remains, will be used as a political precedent for testing -- or,
fearful thought, for warfare -- by other and perhaps many lesser powers
at a later date, whose environmental responsibility will be far less
than the French presently show.
</P>
<P>That, I suggest, is what we should be arguing. That is why the French
should stop now. Those are the battles worth fighting. They have
little to do with detailed scientific facts about the present tests. We
don't help anyone in these battles, least of all ourselves, by diverting
attention to issues which prove to be devoid of scientific credibility,
or by cultivating mistrust of a consensus of informed comment.

<H2>Re: French Radiation Tryst</H2>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR>

<TD VALIGN=TOP><H3>From: <A HREF = "mailto:nzsm@spis.co.nz">Vicki Hyde,</A> Editor, <A HREF="/spis/nzsm/nzsm.htm"><CITE>New Zealand Science Monthly</CITE></A></H3>
<P>I feel some sympathy for Dr Andrew McEwan of our country's National Radiation Laboratory. It's been his somewhat unenviable task to point out that arguing against the French testing on scientific grounds is untenable. Looked at rationally, it appears from the checking that has been done that an environmental catastrophe has not occurred in the past and is not likely to occur from the underground tests. Attempting to argue that the Pacific and its children are endangered by such tests is not likely to win a case in the World Court in the face of the evidence available.
</P>
<P>However, rationality is not the only response. One recent television advert which juxtaposes shots of children, an atmospheric bomb blast and a  dead fish washing up on the shore is designed to appeal much more to our hearts than our heads. It really irritates me because of the blatant emotional manipulation and misinformation it involves.
</P>
<P>Yet I have to confess that my own reactions are not that rational when it comes to nuclear weapons. I recall hearing the news of the Rainbow Warrior bombing courtesy of American Forces Radio (the only English-speaking radio station we could get while living in Japan). From that day on, I have tried not to buy French products -- and I was delighted when <CITE>New Scientist</CITE> recently suggested to their European readers that they try Australian and New Zealand vintages instead of French wines and champagne.
</P>
<P>Shortly after the bombing, I spoke to a UNESCO forum in Tokyo on environment and peace issues in the Pacific, and was startled to find how circumspect the response was. They didn't want to hear about the idea that an individual  moral stance could be transformed into political action which had implications for the international arena. (Later reflection suggested that the quick change of subject probably had something to do with the uncomfortable awareness of the country's toothless non-nuclear constitution and its probable daily violation by US forces in Japan.)
</P>
<P>Rather than trying to use scientific justifications -- which may be equivocal at best -- we should acknowledge that our anger and contempt concerning the resumed testing arises from a deep-seated moral repugnance at what such testing represents. And there's nothing wrong with that.
</P>
<H1>J'accuse!

<TABLE>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><I>AQUARIUS</I><BR>(Jan 20-Feb 18)</TD><TD>You have an inventive mind and are inclined to be progressive, which is why Aquarians make good burglars. You are idealistic and are not afraid of speaking your own mind -- dangerous when there's nothing in it. You will <I>not</I> meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger in the near future -- Jenny Shipley sez so.

<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><I>PISCES</I><BR>(Feb 19-Mar 20)</TD><TD>You have a vivid imagination and often think you are being followed by the CIA.  You have minor influence over your associates and people resent you for your flaunting of power. You lack confidence and are generally a coward. Pisces people giggle while burning ants with magnifying glasses.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><I>ARIES</I><BR>(Mar 21-Apr 19)</TD><TD>You are the pioneer type and hold most people in contempt.  You are quick tempered, impatient and scornful of advice. You are not very nice. You belong at the head of a combat unit on the way to a massacre.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/spis/images/crown.gif" alt="Crown"><BR><I>TAURUS</I><BR>(Apr 20-May 20)</TD><TD>You are practical and persistent.  You have dogged determination and work like hell.  Most people think you are stubborn and bullheaded.  You are.  But that doesn't matter much because you're the Head of State and you can do what you like.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><I>GEMINI</I><BR>(May 21-June 20)</TD><TD>You are quick and intelligent.  You are inclined to expect too much or too little.  This means you are cheap. You put pebbles in a blind man's cup.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/spis/images/crown.gif" alt="Crown"><BR><I>CANCER</I><BR>(June 21-July 22</TD><TD>You are sympathetic and understanding of other people's problems.  They think you are a sucker.  That's why you married a much older man who's ended up boring you silly, silly being the operative word.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><I>LEO</I><BR>(July 23-Aug 22)</TD><TD>You consider yourself a born leader.  Others think you are pushy.  Most Leo people become bullies.  You are vain and dislike criticism.  Most Leo people are thieves. You sold Brierley shares at 75 cents. To your mother.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><I>VIRGO</I><BR>(Aug 23-Sept 22)</TD><TD>You are the logical type and hate disorder.  This nit-picking is sickening to your friends.  You are cold and unemotional and would rather fall asleep than make love.  Virgos are good bus drivers. The books in your bookcase are arranged alphabetically.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><I>LIBRA</I><BR> (Sept 23-Oct 22</TD><TD>You are the artistic type and have a difficult time with reality.  Chances for employment and monetary gains are slim. You talk a lot to yourself. You have to. Everyone else has stopped listening.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/spis/images/crown.gif" alt="Crown"><BR><I>SCORPIO</I><BR>(Oct 23-Nov 21)</TD><TD>You are shrewd in business and cannot be trusted. You will achieve the pinnacle of success because of your total lack of ethics.  Many Scorpio people are murdered by someone they know.  It might be an estranged wife, a mistress's husband or a man wielding a spray can -- only the stars can tell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><I>SAGITTARIUS</I><BR>(Nov 22-Dec 21)</TD><TD>You are optimistic and enthusiastic.  You have a reckless tendency to rely on luck since you lack talent.  The majority of Sagittarians are drunks or substance abusers.  People laugh at you a great deal.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><I>CAPRICORN</I><BR>(Dec 22-Jan 19)</TD><TD>You are conservative and afraid of taking risks.  You don't do much of anything and are lazy.  There has never been a Capricorn of any importance.  Capricorns should avoid standing too long in one place, as someone might paint them by mistake.</TD></TR>

<A NAME="What"></A>
<H1>What is the Web?</H1>
<I>If you're already familiar with the Web, <A href="#Who">skip the introduction.</A></I>

<P>The World Wide Web is a popular and fairly recent extension of the Internet, the global electronic communications network. Information is presented on "pages" made accessible through programs called Web browsers.
</P>
<P><I>Common browsers include <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com">Netscape</A>, <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html">Mosaic</A> and <A HREF="http://www.jackson.freenet.org/about_lynx/www_start.html">Lynx</A>.
</I></P>
<P>The information provided reflects the activities, interests and, frequently, <A HREF="people.htm#Peter">personality</A> of those who host the pages -- from <A HREF="sca.htm">recreation</A> and research areas through to <A HREF="http://www.etext.org/Zines/Quanta/">full-blown publications</A>, <A HREF=" http://www.cezanne.com/eng/accueil.html">art galleries</A> and <A HREF="http://cc.lut.fi/~mega/jukebox.html ">sound studios</A>.
</P>
<P>Web pages are usually designed so that the reader can effortlessly follow "links" to related subjects, information or files. The links could be pointing to somewhere else on the <A HREF="climwhat.htm#Design">same page</A> or <A HREF="http://www.joes.com/home/spis_ltd">half a world</A> away.
</P>
<A NAME="Who"><H2>Who is using the Web?</H2></A>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><P>Exact usage numbers are impossible to determine, but an indication can be gained from the following:
</P>
<P>Over the past two years, the number of Web pages on-line has grown from just a few thousand to an estimated 20 million or more. In New Zealand alone, a recent listing contained more than 45,000 pages;  an estimate published just one month earlier suggested 20,000.
</P>
<P>The number and range of people who read Web pages is also increasing dramatically -- from an estimated 250,000 in June 1994 to 30 million today.

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><P>In the beginning, the main users and authors were academic (reflecting the origins of the Internet), but now the trend is towards wider involvement from companies, societies and private individuals.
</P>
<P>There is still a reasonably high cost involved in using the Web, so readers are likely to be:
</P>
<UL><LI> professionals whose employers are footing the bill</LI>
<LI> businesses seeking out critical information or trading opportunities
</LI>
<LI>individuals in the middle- to upper-income bands who can afford
not only the necessary hardware, but also the connection and on-line fees
</LI></UL>
<P>This picture too is changing, as costs continue to decrease. In New Zealand over the past few months, international data transfer charges have halved (from $10/MB to $5/MB), opening up the Web to more users.

<P></P>
<H2>What are the limitations?
</H2>
<P>A broad range of information and services can be provided on the Web, but there are both limitations and drawbacks, and these should be weighed when considering your own Web site:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>access</STRONG><BR>
There is not much point establishing a site if the people you want to reach do not have or do not plan to get Web access.<BR>
<I>On the other hand, you may be able to expand your reach to include new contacts, clients or members who find your offerings interesting.</I>
</LI>
<LI><A href="#Promotion"><STRONG>getting attention</STRONG></A><BR>
With over 20 million pages out there already, you have to do something really different if you want to <A href="#Promotion">make an impact</A> in the Web community itself.<BR>
<I>Nonetheless, in recent months, two New Zealand sites have been listed among the <A HREF="http://icair.iac.org.nz">top 5%</A> of sites visited worldwide.</I>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>bandwidth constraints</STRONG><BR>
<I>Bandwidth relates to the amount of data which can be sent over communication links</I><BR>
The tremendous growth in Web usage has resulted in slowdowns (or "brownouts") in certain parts of the world, especially the US. Links to and from some overseas sites can be very slow at peak times. If this trend continues, people will be dissuaded from using the Web.
<BR>
<I>At present within New Zealand, there appears to be little problem with this.
</I>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>costs</STRONG><BR>
Although a Web site can be set up fairly economically by renting space from a <A HREF="#Service">service provider</A>, you still have to bear the costs of all accesses to your pages by readers. If your readers are within New Zealand, this can be quite cheap, or even free. Visitors from outside New Zealand will cost you, however.<BR>
<I>If you have a popular site, these charges can rapidly become a major issue!</I>
</LI>

<LI><A HREF="#Security"><STRONG>security</STRONG></A><BR>
If you are merely providing information which is free to all, this will not be a problem. But if you are collecting or providing information which you want to protect or restrict in some way (including personal information, finance and copyrighted material), security can become an issue.
</LI>
</UL>
<HR SIZE="5">
<A NAME="Design"><H1>Web Site Design</H1></A>
<H2>The Basics</H2>
<P>Web pages are created using a simple language called "HTML"  which describes the structure and contents of your offering. HTML provides some control over page layout, as well as the ability to add images, tables, forms and even animations and sound (though not all browsers will be able to make use of this).
</P>
<I>While HTML (HyperText Markup Language) allows authors to structure information for presentation, it does not define how pages will actually appear -- that is up to each browser and its user settings.</I>
<P>Having your own Web page can be as simple as finding a <A HREF="#Service">service provider</A> to rent you the storage space and Web connection, then creating your page.
</P>
<P>More complex sites, such as those with <A HREF="#Applications">database and indexing</A> capabilities or extensive sound and graphics, require careful programming and testing to deliver the desired results.
</P>
<P>Most sites need ongoing maintenance. A page rapidly <A HREF="sam.htm">goes stale</A> if it is not updated. Links on the page may no longer be valid, or the information itself may become out of date.
</P>
<P>Web sites tend to grow over time as pages are added to cover new subjects or activities. If you're not careful, the whole structure can become unwieldy. Good site planning and design allows you to forestall this, so be sure to put the time in early on to decide how the growth will be managed.
</P>
<H2>Doing it Right
</H2>
<P>Putting up Web pages is just a new form of publishing, subject to most of the old conventions, plus a few new wrinkles. Good offerings have useful content, clear presentation and consistent style  and can be read with most or all of the different browsers in use. Bad ones are browser-specific, have little or no content or simply represent somebody going on-line to say "me too"
</P>
<P>The Web itself contains a large number of <A HREF="#Resources">guides</A> on how to create Web pages. Some will tell you the latest tricks to make your favourite browser display pages to the best effect. Others will give you clear indications of what is and isn't good style and design, and will usually reinforce the following message:
</P>
<P>If you want your page to be read by others, bear in mind that they won't all be using the same browser, or even the same kind of computer.
</P>
<P>Tricks and illusions created to impress users of one popular browser may look sad -- or even ridiculous -- if read by another. If the purpose of your pages is to convey information, then learn and use standard HTML. If the purpose is to dazzle, then be aware that not every visitor will be dazzled -- and some will be annoyed.
</P>
<H2>Validate, Validate, Validate!
</H2>
<P>Once a Web page has been created, it is important that it be checked out as correct HTML. It is all too easy to make a mistake in page creation which works on your test browser, but results in gibberish on the one used by your next visitor.
</P>
<P>Fortunately, both <A HREF="#Resources">software and Web sites</A> exist which will perform this vital validation function for you. Use them!
</P>
<H2>Using Graphics
</H2>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><P>Many Web pages can be enhanced by judicious use of <A HREF="http://www.fn.net/gifs/">graphics</A>
-- the key word is <STRONG>judicious</STRONG>. When people are paying to look at your page (and most are, even if you are picking up some of the cost), they don't want to receive a 100KB  graphic to embellish 100 words of text (there are <A HREF="images/12goats.gif">exceptions</A>, of course).
</P>
<P>Many readers set their browsers up to ignore all images, so it is important that you design your pages so that they are attractive and usable even if the graphics are not present or, worse, replaced by little "image here" boxes as some browsers do.
</P>
</TD>
<TD Align=Center>
<SMALL><I>Original image:</I></SMALL><BR><A HREF="wop.htm">

<SMALL><I>"Image here"</I></SMALL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>Good Web page designers use a number of techniques to reduce the size and increase the viewing speed of the graphics they use, and to blend them into the overall design and layout of the page. These include:
<UL>
<LI>Store an image with no more colours than it requires (this can cut file sizes by a factor of five!)</LI>
<LI>Always specify the image dimensions (with some browsers, this makes a page load faster)</LI>
<LI>Usually, save an image with a <A href="http://dragon.jpl.nasa.gov/~adam/transparent.html">transparent</A> background so it blends in with the page background</LI>
<LI>Images <I>without</I> transparent backgrounds can be saved in "interlaced" format to make apparent loading time faster</LI>
</UL>
<P><I>An "interlaced" image is loaded and displayed in <A HREF="images/12goats.gif">multiple passes</A> -- the first pass gives a rough idea of what it looks like, and the remaining ones fill in the detail.</I>
</P>
<HR>
<A NAME="Applications"></A>
<H1>Web Applications</H1>
<P>Web pages are often used to present or collect information for databases. Sometimes this kind of application is solely for in-house use, with Web tools used but without the data being available on the World Wide Web itself.
</P>
<P>Typical database publishing applications include:
</P>

</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>For both data publishing and data collection, some programming support is usually required to support the application. Although there are ways to collect data from Web page forms without programming, this rapidly becomes unwieldy as the amount of data increases.
</P>
<P>Using a protocol known as CGI, Web applications are able to transfer data to and from Web pages and forms. This information is usually stored in databases on the server machine -- a well-designed Web application will not require a change in the format or the layout of existing databases you may already be using.
</P>
<P><I>A server is the computer on which the Web site or application is stored.
</I>

<P>The programming language used to develop a Web application will generally vary depending on the nature of the server machine (e.g. Unix-based, Windows-based), but will most commonly be Perl, C, <A HREF="softserv.htm#Programming">Delphi</A>, Visual Basic or a dedicated add-on to a database management system.
</P>
<P>Because of the programming requirements, developing Web applications generally requires a distinct set of skills from those which go into Web page design. It is important to remember this when deciding who will create your site.
</P>
<P>The best Web site developers are those who are able to marry the <A HREF="#Here">divergent disciplines</A> of professional publishing, graphic design and software engineering.
</P>

<HR SIZE="5">

<A NAME="Promotion">
<H1>Web Site Promotion
</H1></A>
<P>Creating a Web site is only half the story. If your site is to to serve any purpose, people must know that it is there. Two audiences are usually targeted:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>your natural audience (e.g. members, clients or subscribers) who may have Web access, or be getting it soon</LI>
<LI>the wider Web community, who use the <A HREF="#Lycos">search and indexing</A> services on the Web to find pages with information of interest to them</LI>
</UL>
<P>The first group is usually easy enough to reach through your existing lines of communication.
</P>
<P>You will usually have to go to some trouble to explain the purpose and benefits of the Web-based service to those who are not yet "Web aware", in the hope that they will find your site one of many reasons to get a connection themselves.
</P>
<H2>Making a splash on the Web

Don't try to get on them all -- pick the ones which most closely match your site.

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>distribute press releases</STRONG><BR>
Send out press releases not just to those publications in your field, but also to the computer pages of local papers and Net-oriented magazines, especially if your site has something different to offer. Follow these up with new releases whenever you make a significant addition or improvement.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>develop your site on an on-going basis</STRONG><BR>
Many pages are worth visiting once. Few are worth a second look unless the host makes an effort to keep them up-to-date and interesting. New links, ideas and points of interest are essential.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>add your web address to all stationery, printed and electronic</STRONG><BR>
Any place you list your contact information, make sure to add your Web address too. This means on your letterheads, business cards, publication mastheads, email sigs -- anywhere people would expect to see it.<BR>
<I>A sig (signature)  is a tailpiece on email messages which usually contains your email address.</I>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>add in links to compatible sites</STRONG><BR>
Mutual links between your site and others in a related area will help bring visitors interested in what you do, and your link will do the same for them.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>promote your site on relevant newsgroups</STRONG><BR>
You <I>must</I> do this appropriately, following the often tricky conventions of netiquette if you are to succeed. Inappropriate promotion can hinder rather than boost your sites popularity.<BR>

<H2>Web Security

<P>This is an area which is still developing rapidly, and there are no guaranteed solutions. Security concerns are threefold:
</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>system security</STRONG><BR>
This is mainly a concern for service providers and organisations with their own servers. Because there are ways for Web applications to modify the data on the machines on which they are run, there is always the possibility that unauthorised access and modification can occur through program design flaws or deliberate intent.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>confidentiality</STRONG><BR>
Any Web usage that involves sensitive data (e.g. personal information, credit card details, technical data) needs to be protected against unauthorised access and eavesdropping. This is difficult when the information passed between the reader and the Web server can be routed through intermediate hosts on the Internet. Access restrictions using passwords and data encryption are two of the most common approaches to providing protection in this area.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>authentication</STRONG><BR>
In the Web world, there is no straightforward way of knowing who is reading a page or filling out a form. This can be a severe limitation, especially in the commercial arena.

<A NAME="Electronic">
<H2>Electronic commerce
</H2></A>
<P>Because of the security concerns noted above, and the critical fact that money is involved, electronic commerce on the Web is more complex than almost any other activity.
</P>
<P>At present, most commercial transactions that arise from the Web are carried on outside it, but this is slowly changing. Corporations like Mastercard and Visa are devising strategies for adding the security and confidence necessary to make transactions over the Web an everyday occurrence.
</P>
<P>There is no need to wait for them, however. Even as the paragraph above was being written, we received confirmation of a <A HREF="http://super.sonic.net/ann/delphi/more/tcompres/">software</A> sale which relied on the <A HREF="#FV">First Virtual</A> Internet Payment System (FV). Their system is a good example of what is possible at present:
</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>
<UL>
<LI>suppliers and potential buyers pay a small fee to be registered with FV</LI>
<LI>potential buyers also provide their credit card details via a secure route to FV, who gives them an FV identification number (ID)
</LI>
<LI>when a buyer sees something they want, they transmit their ID (but <I>not</I> any credit card information) to the supplier, who passes that on to FV
</LI>
<LI>FV then emails the buyer requesting authorisation --  the transaction is carried out only if this is received. Thus, anyone who obtains the buyers ID must also be able to intercept and respond to email directed at the buyer if they want to use it fraudulently.
</LI>
<LI>when authorisation is received, FV processes a credit card transaction
billing the buyer (and paying FV)
</LI>
<LI>at regular intervals, FV credits all payments (less a small transaction fee) to the suppliers nominated account
</LI>
<LI>Note that there is always a risk that the buyer will refuse to authorise the transaction, even though they have received the goods (or information). Naturally, anyone doing this too often is expelled from the system.

<H1>Here's the Pitch
</H1>
<H2>What can we do for you?
</H2>
<P>At <A HREF="pin.htm#SPIS">South Pacific Information Services</A>, our combination of <A HREF="softserv.htm#Programming">software,</A> 
<A HREF="softserv.htm#WebPage">design</A> and <A HREF="editserv.htm">publishing</A> expertise allows us to offer a full range of 
Web site design and maintenance services:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>site planning and design
</LI>
<LI>text production, editing and adaptation
</LI>
<LI>graphics and page creation
</LI>
<LI>Web-based applications (databases, search engines, 
forms, interaction)
</LI>
<LI>maintenance and extensions
</LI>
<LI>site promotion
</LI>
<LI>training in page creation and site development
</LI>
<LI>design consultancy
</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Why use our services?
</H2>
<P>Establishing your own site on the World Wide Web represents both an 
opportunity and a challenge. By now, the <A HREF="climwhat.htm#You">opportunities</A> should be pretty 
clear. The challenge is to design your presence and your presentations 
so that you appeal to your target audiences rather than offend them 
(or, worse, bore them!).
</P>
<P>For most organisations, the Web offers the chance to launch a new 
and powerful complement to existing information, promotion and communication 
efforts. But, if you aren't careful, your new Web presence can 
drain important resources you need elsewhere, and a poorly conceived 
site can even alienate those whom you most want to reach.
</P>
<P>Most importantly of all, the Web may offer you opportunities for productive 
interaction with your target community in ways that aren't obvious 
to those who are not experienced in the nuances of the Net. Thats 
where we come in...
</P>

<I>If you're already familiar with the Web, <A href="climwhat.htm#Who">skip the introduction.</A></I>

<P>The World Wide Web is a popular and fairly recent extension of the Internet, the global electronic communications network. Information is presented on "pages" made accessible through programs called Web browsers.
</P>
<P><I>Common browsers include <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com">Netscape</A>, <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html">Mosaic</A> and <A HREF="http://www.jackson.freenet.org/about_lynx/www_start.html">Lynx</A>.
</I></P>
<P>The information provided reflects the activities, interests and, frequently, <A HREF="people.htm#Peter">personality</A> of those who host the pages -- from <A HREF="sca.htm">recreation</A> and research areas through to <A HREF="http://www.etext.org/Zines/Quanta/">full-blown publications</A>, <A HREF=" http://www.cezanne.com/eng/accueil.html">art galleries</A> and <A HREF="http://cc.lut.fi/~mega/jukebox.html ">sound studios</A>.
</P>
<P>Web pages are usually designed so that the reader can effortlessly follow "links" to related subjects, information or files. The links could be pointing to somewhere else on the <A HREF="climwhat.htm#Design">same page</A> or <A HREF="http://www.joes.com/home/spis_ltd">half a world</A> away.
</P>
<A NAME="Who"><H2>Who is using the Web?</H2></A>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><P>Exact usage numbers are impossible to determine, but an indication can be gained from the following:
</P>
<P>Over the past two years, the number of Web pages on-line has grown from just a few thousand to an estimated 20 million or more. In New Zealand alone, a recent listing contained more than 45,000 pages;  an estimate published just one month earlier suggested 20,000.

<TR>
<TD><P>In the beginning, the main users and authors were academic (reflecting the origins of the Internet), but now the trend is towards wider involvement from companies, societies and private individuals.
</P>
<P>There is still a reasonably high cost involved in using the Web, so readers are likely to be:
</P>
<UL><LI> professionals whose employers are footing the bill</LI>
<LI> businesses seeking out critical information or trading opportunities
</LI>
<LI>individuals in the middle- to upper-income bands who can afford
not only the necessary hardware, but also the connection and on-line fees
</LI></UL>
<P>This picture too is changing, as costs continue to decrease. In New Zealand over the past few months, international data transfer charges have halved (from $10/MB to $5/MB), opening up the Web to more users.

<P></P>
<H2>What are the limitations?
</H2>
<P>A broad range of information and services can be provided on the Web, but there are both limitations and drawbacks, and these should be weighed when considering your own Web site:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>access</STRONG><BR>
There is not much point establishing a site if the people you want to reach do not have or do not plan to get Web access.<BR>
<I>On the other hand, you may be able to expand your reach to include new contacts, clients or members who find your offerings interesting.</I>
</LI>
<LI><A href="climweb.htm#Promotion"><STRONG>getting attention</STRONG></A><BR>
With over 20 million pages out there already, you have to do something really different if you want to <A href="climweb.htm#Promotion">make an impact</A> in the Web community itself.<BR>
<I>Nonetheless, in recent months, two New Zealand sites have been listed among the <A HREF="http://icair.iac.org.nz">top 5%</A> of sites visited worldwide.</I>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>bandwidth constraints</STRONG><BR>
<I>Bandwidth relates to the amount of data which can be sent over communication links</I><BR>
The tremendous growth in Web usage has resulted in slowdowns (or "brownouts") in certain parts of the world, especially the US. Links to and from some overseas sites can be very slow at peak times. If this trend continues, people will be dissuaded from using the Web.
<BR>
<I>At present within New Zealand, there appears to be little problem with this.
</I>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>costs</STRONG><BR>
Although a Web site can be set up fairly economically by renting space from a <A HREF="climsite.htm#Service">service provider</A>, you still have to bear the costs of all accesses to your pages by readers. If your readers are within New Zealand, this can be quite cheap, or even free. Visitors from outside New Zealand will cost you, however.<BR>
<I>If you have a popular site, these charges can rapidly become a major issue!</I>
</LI>

<LI><A HREF="climweb.htm#Security"><STRONG>security</STRONG></A><BR>
If you are merely providing information which is free to all, this will not be a problem. But if you are collecting or providing information which you want to protect or restrict in some way (including personal information, finance and copyrighted material), security can become an issue.
</LI>
</UL>
<HR SIZE="5">
<A NAME="Design"><H1>Web Site Design</H1></A>
<H2>The Basics</H2>
<P>Web pages are created using a simple language called "HTML"  which describes the structure and contents of your offering. HTML provides some control over page layout, as well as the ability to add images, tables, forms and even animations and sound (though not all browsers will be able to make use of this).
</P>
<I>While HTML (HyperText Markup Language) allows authors to structure information for presentation, it does not define how pages will actually appear -- that is up to each browser and its user settings.</I>
<P>Having your own Web page can be as simple as finding a <A HREF="climsite.htm#Service">service provider</A> to rent you the storage space and Web connection, then creating your page.
</P>
<P>More complex sites, such as those with <A HREF="climweb.htm#Applications">database and indexing</A> capabilities or extensive sound and graphics, require careful programming and testing to deliver the desired results.
</P>
<P>Most sites need ongoing maintenance. A page rapidly <A HREF="sam.htm">goes stale</A> if it is not updated. Links on the page may no longer be valid, or the information itself may become out of date.
</P>
<P>Web sites tend to grow over time as pages are added to cover new subjects or activities. If you're not careful, the whole structure can become unwieldy. Good site planning and design allows you to forestall this, so be sure to put the time in early on to decide how the growth will be managed.
</P>
<H2>Doing it Right
</H2>
<P>Putting up Web pages is just a new form of publishing, subject to most of the old conventions, plus a few new wrinkles. Good offerings have useful content, clear presentation and consistent style  and can be read with most or all of the different browsers in use. Bad ones are browser-specific, have little or no content or simply represent somebody going on-line to say "me too"
</P>
<P>The Web itself contains a large number of <A HREF="climsite.htm#Resources">guides</A> on how to create Web pages. Some will tell you the latest tricks to make your favourite browser display pages to the best effect. Others will give you clear indications of what is and isn't good style and design, and will usually reinforce the following message:
</P>
<P>If you want your page to be read by others, bear in mind that they won't all be using the same browser, or even the same kind of computer.
</P>
<P>Tricks and illusions created to impress users of one popular browser may look sad -- or even ridiculous -- if read by another. If the purpose of your pages is to convey information, then learn and use standard HTML. If the purpose is to dazzle, then be aware that not every visitor will be dazzled -- and some will be annoyed.
</P>
<H2>Validate, Validate, Validate!
</H2>
<P>Once a Web page has been created, it is important that it be checked out as correct HTML. It is all too easy to make a mistake in page creation which works on your test browser, but results in gibberish on the one used by your next visitor.
</P>
<P>Fortunately, both <A HREF="climsite.htm#Resources">software and Web sites</A> exist which will perform this vital validation function for you. Use them!
</P>
<H2>Using Graphics
</H2>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><P>Many Web pages can be enhanced by judicious use of <A HREF="http://www.fn.net/gifs/">graphics</A>
-- the key word is <STRONG>judicious</STRONG>. When people are paying to look at your page (and most are, even if you are picking up some of the cost), they don't want to receive a 100KB  graphic to embellish 100 words of text (there are <A HREF="images/12goats.gif">exceptions</A>, of course).
</P>
<P>Many readers set their browsers up to ignore all images, so it is important that you design your pages so that they are attractive and usable even if the graphics are not present or, worse, replaced by little "image here" boxes as some browsers do.
</P>
</TD>
<TD Align=Center>
<SMALL><I>Original image:</I></SMALL><BR><A HREF="wop.htm">
<IMG SRC="images/sambnr.gif" alt="Weekly O'Press banner (2K)" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120></A><BR>
<SMALL><I>becomes...</I></SMALL><BR>
<IMG SRC="images/imaghere.gif" alt="Netscape image placeholder (.3K)" WIDTH=36  HEIGHT=37><BR>
<SMALL><I>"Image here"</I></SMALL>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>Good Web page designers use a number of techniques to reduce the size and increase the viewing speed of the graphics they use, and to blend them into the overall design and layout of the page. These include:
<UL>
<LI>Store an image with no more colours than it requires (this can cut file sizes by a factor of five!)</LI>
<LI>Always specify the image dimensions (with some browsers, this makes a page load faster)</LI>
<LI>Usually, save an image with a <A href="http://dragon.jpl.nasa.gov/~adam/transparent.html">transparent</A> background so it blends in with the page background</LI>
<LI>Images <I>without</I> transparent backgrounds can be saved in "interlaced" format to make apparent loading time faster</LI>
</UL>
<P><I>An "interlaced" image is loaded and displayed in <A HREF="images/12goats.gif">multiple passes</A> -- the first pass gives a rough idea of what it looks like, and the remaining ones fill in the detail.</I>

<P>Web pages are often used to present or collect information for databases. Sometimes this kind of application is solely for in-house use, with Web tools used but without the data being available on the World Wide Web itself.
</P>
<P>Typical database publishing applications include:
</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>
<UL>
<LI>product catalogues</LI>
<LI>publication indices</LI>
<LI>search and retrieval of articles and documents</LI>
<LI>policy documents</LI>
<LI>technical information</LI>
<LI>procedure manuals</LI>
<LI>real estate listings</LI>
<LI>directories of all kinds</LI>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>Typical Web data collection applications include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>feedback and survey forms</LI>
<LI>order placement</LI>
<LI>service requests</LI>
<LI>application forms</LI>
<LI>contact information</LI>
<LI>competitions and games</LI>
</UL>
<P><SMALL><I>Data collection example:</I></SMALL><BR><IMG SRC="images/collect.gif" alt="Classified ad entry (2K)" WIDTH=400  HEIGHT=134></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE>
<TR>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>For both data publishing and data collection, some programming support is usually required to support the application. Although there are ways to collect data from Web page forms without programming, this rapidly becomes unwieldy as the amount of data increases.
</P>
<P>Using a protocol known as CGI, Web applications are able to transfer data to and from Web pages and forms. This information is usually stored in databases on the server machine -- a well-designed Web application will not require a change in the format or the layout of existing databases you may already be using.
</P>
<P><I>A server is the computer on which the Web site or application is stored.
</I>

<P>The programming language used to develop a Web application will generally vary depending on the nature of the server machine (e.g. Unix-based, Windows-based), but will most commonly be Perl, C, <A HREF="softserv.htm#Programming">Delphi</A>, Visual Basic or a dedicated add-on to a database management system.
</P>
<P>Because of the programming requirements, developing Web applications generally requires a distinct set of skills from those which go into Web page design. It is important to remember this when deciding who will create your site.
</P>
<P>The best Web site developers are those who are able to marry the <A HREF="climsite.htm#Here">divergent disciplines</A> of professional publishing, graphic design and software engineering.
</P>

<HR SIZE="5">

<A NAME="Promotion">
<H1>Web Site Promotion
</H1></A>
<P>Creating a Web site is only half the story. If your site is to to serve any purpose, people must know that it is there. Two audiences are usually targeted:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>your natural audience (e.g. members, clients or subscribers) who may have Web access, or be getting it soon</LI>
<LI>the wider Web community, who use the <A HREF="climsite.htm#Lycos">search and indexing</A> services on the Web to find pages with information of interest to them</LI>
</UL>
<P>The first group is usually easy enough to reach through your existing lines of communication.
</P>
<P>You will usually have to go to some trouble to explain the purpose and benefits of the Web-based service to those who are not yet "Web aware", in the hope that they will find your site one of many reasons to get a connection themselves.
</P>
<H2>Making a splash on the Web
</H2>
<P>Reaching Web readers at large is more difficult, particularly when you're competing with 20 million other pages. You should:
</P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>list your site in the Web catalogues</STRONG><BR>
Don't try to get on them all -- pick the ones which most closely match your site. Logical places to start would be indices which focus on your location (Christchurch, New Zealand, Oceania, Asia) or the main contents of your site (science, software, publishing, humour, skeptics, medi&aelig;val recreation).</LI>
</UL>
</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP><SMALL><I>A page from the Lycos on-line search engine:</I></SMALL><BR>
<IMG SRC="images/lycos.gif" alt="Lycos main screen (8K)" WIDTH=583 HEIGHT=276>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>distribute press releases</STRONG><BR>
Send out press releases not just to those publications in your field, but also to the computer pages of local papers and Net-oriented magazines, especially if your site has something different to offer. Follow these up with new releases whenever you make a significant addition or improvement.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>develop your site on an on-going basis</STRONG><BR>
Many pages are worth visiting once. Few are worth a second look unless the host makes an effort to keep them up-to-date and interesting. New links, ideas and points of interest are essential.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>add your web address to all stationery, printed and electronic</STRONG><BR>
Any place you list your contact information, make sure to add your Web address too. This means on your letterheads, business cards, publication mastheads, email sigs -- anywhere people would expect to see it.<BR>
<I>A sig (signature)  is a tailpiece on email messages which usually contains your email address.</I>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>add in links to compatible sites</STRONG><BR>
Mutual links between your site and others in a related area will help bring visitors interested in what you do, and your link will do the same for them.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>promote your site on relevant newsgroups</STRONG><BR>
You <I>must</I> do this appropriately, following the often tricky conventions of netiquette if you are to succeed. Inappropriate promotion can hinder rather than boost your sites popularity.<BR>
<I>Netiquette is a set of courtesy conventions designed to promote efficient, reasonable and hassle-free use of the Internet.</I>

<A NAME="Security">
<H1>Security and Electronic Commerce
</H1></A>
<H2>Web Security
</H2>
<P>This is an area which is still developing rapidly, and there are no guaranteed solutions. Security concerns are threefold:
</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>system security</STRONG><BR>
This is mainly a concern for service providers and organisations with their own servers. Because there are ways for Web applications to modify the data on the machines on which they are run, there is always the possibility that unauthorised access and modification can occur through program design flaws or deliberate intent.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>confidentiality</STRONG><BR>
Any Web usage that involves sensitive data (e.g. personal information, credit card details, technical data) needs to be protected against unauthorised access and eavesdropping. This is difficult when the information passed between the reader and the Web server can be routed through intermediate hosts on the Internet. Access restrictions using passwords and data encryption are two of the most common approaches to providing protection in this area.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>authentication</STRONG><BR>
In the Web world, there is no straightforward way of knowing who is reading a page or filling out a form. This can be a severe limitation, especially in the commercial arena.
</LI>
</UL>
</TD>
<TD><SMALL><I>Example of a passworded gateway:</I></SMALL><BR>
<IMG SRC="images/lock.gif" alt="Password prompt (3K)" WIDTH=424 HEIGHT=219>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="Electronic">
<H2>Electronic commerce
</H2></A>
<P>Because of the security concerns noted above, and the critical fact that money is involved, electronic commerce on the Web is more complex than almost any other activity.
</P>
<P>At present, most commercial transactions that arise from the Web are carried on outside it, but this is slowly changing. Corporations like Mastercard and Visa are devising strategies for adding the security and confidence necessary to make transactions over the Web an everyday occurrence.
</P>
<P>There is no need to wait for them, however. Even as the paragraph above was being written, we received confirmation of a <A HREF="http://super.sonic.net/ann/delphi/more/tcompres/">software</A> sale which relied on the <A HREF="climsite.htm#FV">First Virtual</A> Internet Payment System (FV). Their system is a good example of what is possible at present:
</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>
<UL>
<LI>suppliers and potential buyers pay a small fee to be registered with FV</LI>
<LI>potential buyers also provide their credit card details via a secure route to FV, who gives them an FV identification number (ID)
</LI>
<LI>when a buyer sees something they want, they transmit their ID (but <I>not</I> any credit card information) to the supplier, who passes that on to FV
</LI>
<LI>FV then emails the buyer requesting authorisation --  the transaction is carried out only if this is received. Thus, anyone who obtains the buyers ID must also be able to intercept and respond to email directed at the buyer if they want to use it fraudulently.
</LI>
<LI>when authorisation is received, FV processes a credit card transaction
billing the buyer (and paying FV)
</LI>
<LI>at regular intervals, FV credits all payments (less a small transaction fee) to the suppliers nominated account
</LI>
<LI>Note that there is always a risk that the buyer will refuse to authorise the transaction, even though they have received the goods (or information). Naturally, anyone doing this too often is expelled from the system.
</LI></UL></TD>

</TABLE>
<P>Other systems aiming to provide electronic transactions are already operating, and experiments are under way on the next generation of electronic transactions, including <A HREF="climsite.htm#Resources">"cybercash"</A>.
</P>
<P>There are simpler solutions, of course -- such as providing an order form for your readers to print out and fax, or supporting telephone sales (<A HREF="mailto:climb@spis.co.nz">"email</A> us your phone number and we'll contact you").

<H1>Here's the Pitch
</H1>
<H2>What can we do for you?
</H2>
<P>At <A HREF="pin.htm#SPIS">South Pacific Information Services</A>, our combination of <A HREF="softserv.htm#Programming">software,</A> 
<A HREF="softserv.htm#WebPage">design</A> and <A HREF="editserv.htm">publishing</A> expertise allows us to offer a full range of 
Web site design and maintenance services:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>site planning and design
</LI>
<LI>text production, editing and adaptation
</LI>
<LI>graphics and page creation
</LI>
<LI>Web-based applications (databases, search engines, 
forms, interaction)
</LI>
<LI>maintenance and extensions
</LI>
<LI>site promotion
</LI>
<LI>training in page creation and site development
</LI>
<LI>design consultancy
</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Why use our services?
</H2>
<P>Establishing your own site on the World Wide Web represents both an 
opportunity and a challenge. By now, the <A HREF="climwhat.htm#You">opportunities</A> should be pretty 
clear. The challenge is to design your presence and your presentations 
so that you appeal to your target audiences rather than offend them 
(or, worse, bore them!).
</P>
<P>For most organisations, the Web offers the chance to launch a new 
and powerful complement to existing information, promotion and communication 
efforts. But, if you aren't careful, your new Web presence can 
drain important resources you need elsewhere, and a poorly conceived 
site can even alienate those whom you most want to reach.
</P>
<P>Most importantly of all, the Web may offer you opportunities for productive 
interaction with your target community in ways that aren't obvious 
to those who are not experienced in the nuances of the Net. Thats 
where we come in...
</P>

<A NAME="Stop"></A><H2>Stop Press Stop Press Stop Press -- February Seminar</H2>
<P>Ann Lynnworth and Michael Ax, the principals of HREF Tools Corp, USA, will be giving a <B>two day Webhub training seminar in Auckland on February 17th and 18th, 1997.</B>
<P>This will be an intensive two-day course on building WebHub applications, presented by Ann. Day One will provide a solid review of the WebHub framework: CGI architecture, HTML, Web Action Components and Database Components. Day Two will get into building custom web action components with an emphasis on electronic commerce.
<P>The course is lecture-style using a data projector. Do bring a laptop if you have one; printed lecture notes/workbook will be provided. On the evening of day one we will have an informal "code clinic" when you can work on your own projects or the examples from class. Michael Ax will be available to answer questions during the code clinic.
<P>Course cost will be $NZ870+GST for the two days, with 10% discount for registrations received by Feb 1st, and a further 10% for registered Webhub users. Discounts are also available for multiple attendees from the same organisation.
<P>For further information and a secure registration form, see <A HREF="http://www.tradesrv.com.au/href/">Seminar Details.</A>

<P>NB: Ann and Michael will also be speaking at:
<UL>
<LI>Delphi User Group meeting on Wednesday February 12th in Auckland (tentatively from 4pm) at the Westhaven Marina Rowing Club
<LI>Delphi User Group meeting on Thursday February 13th in Christchurch from 6:30pm at ADDLink College, 271 Madras St
</UL>
<P>They are knowledgeable and entertaining speakers, so you shouldn't miss a chance to see them in action...
<P>Email <A HREF="mailto:peter@spis.co.nz">Peter Hyde</A> for further information.


<A NAME="What"></A><H2>What is Webhub?</H2>

<P>Webhub is a state-of-the-art <A HREF="#Why">Web site automation</A> product from <A HREF="http://www.href.com">HREF Tools Corporation.</A> Compared to other <A HREF="automate.htm">automation</A> products for Windows 95 and NT, Webhub has some very significant advantages:

<UL>
<LI><B>Server independence.</B> As the Web server market grows and evolves, Webhub permits migration from one server to another with zero code changes.
<LI><B>Session management.</B> Webhub automatically "saves state", ensuring that each surfer has their own, independent "session" when visiting your site. Many competing automation approaches completely fail to take account of this, resulting in situations where Surfer B can end up staring at Surfer A's data!
<LI><B>Separation of HTML from programming.</B> Webhub's structure means page layout can remain the province of Web designers, while programmers can concentrate on functionality, security, business rules and database connections.
<LI><B>Surfer tracking.</B> Webhub's HUBLOG feature allows each surfer's visit to be fully recorded for later analysis.
<LI><B>Easy site maintenance.</B> Strong support for reusable macros and HTML "chunks" means that URLs, headers, footers etc. which are used all over the site can be changed in just one location.
<LI><B>Performance.</B> Apart from its <A HREF="http://www.href.com:8010/scripts/runisa.dll?HTSM:whyfast">in-built performance features,</A> Webhub allows you to develop fast, scalable Web applications using <A HREF="http://www.borland.com">Borland Delphi,</A> a robust, object-oriented and full-featured compiler language.
<LI><B>Scalability.</B> As site traffic grows, Webhub can scale performance by running additional copies of your Web applications, additional Web servers and even cross-server application execution using it's "Maitre-D'Hub".
<LI><B>Database connectivity.</B> Using the Borland Database Engine, ODBC or Borland's Client/Server links, Webhub applications can bring any of today's most popular database formats to the Web.
<LI><B>High-level functionality.</B> Out of the box, Webhub has support,  customisable components or working demonstration code for:
<UL>
<LI>Form-mail processing (sending form data as email)
<LI>Database table display
<LI>File uploads
<LI>Remote administration
<LI>Scrollable/pageable table grids
<LI>User authentication
<LI>And quite a lot more! (see <A HREF="http://www.href.com:8010/scripts/runisa.dll?HREFSITE:sample">Webhub Demos)</A>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>Webhub is most suitable for applications which go <I>beyond</I> displaying some static pages and a few fields from a database. Tools which come with most of today's servers will usually go that far. Webhub excels where features like electronic commerce, custom searching, security, browser independence, sessions, dynamic pages, data entry and two-way communication (e.g. faxmail) are required. And it is ideal for getting the most value and performance from an Intranet.

<P>A wide range of <A HREF="http://www.href.com:8010/scripts/runisa.dll?HTSM:homepage">public Web sites</A> worldwide have been built with Webhub, including our own <A HREF="http://www.NetTravel.co.nz">NetTravel New Zealand</A> accommodation search engine.

<P>Why not <A HREF="http://www.href.com:8010/scripts/runisa.dll?HREFSITE:trywhub">download a trial version</A> now?

<A NAME="Why"></A><H2>Why Automated Sites?</H2>

<P>High-impact Web sites fall into two categories:
<UL><LI>Those which look beautiful (though often at the expense of download time or browser independence)
<LI>Those that <B>WORK,</B> providing a service or function which brings surfers back to them time and again. Covering everything from book catalogues and weather predictions to shopping malls, interactive puzzles and search engines, working Web sites are now making the running on the Web.
</UL>
<P>As time goes on, more and more effort is going into preparing material for web pages. Excellent new tools such as Microsoft Frontpage or Borland Intrabuilder have been developed to help this process along.

<P>However, when your business information is already present in existing databases or documents, the ideal solution is to present this information with appropriate security and filtering while eliminating manual intervention or conversion steps. This process is another form of site automation.

<A NAME="Our"></A><H2>Our Webhub-related Services</H2>
<P>There are several ways we can help you get up to speed with Webhub:
<UL>
<LI>Webhub introduction and training -- helping you or your
development staff to get up to speed with Webhub, it's key features
and benefits for an automated Internet or Intranet Web site

<LI>Webhub technical consultancy -- leveraging your development
efforts with on-site, telephone and email support

<LI>Site co-development -- you concentrate on the look-and-feel of

<LI>Full site design and development, from needs analysis, initial
specification, structural outline, graphical and user interface
design through to software implementation, hosting, site status and
reliability monitoring

<LI>Advice on site design and hosting issues, especially for
automated Web sites

<LI>Complementary products such as our <A HREF="webview.htm">SPIS Webview</A> offline browser,

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Discussion Document<BR>
<SMALL>&quot;Why More and More Internet Service Providers are offering Windows- and Mac-based platforms.&quot;</SMALL>
</H1>
<P><I>This document was originally written in December 1995, predicting rapid growth the the number of Windows hosted Web sites. As of October 1996, its predictions seem to have been borne out...</I>
<P><OL>
<LI>The Web market is exploding (stats available, but we all know them anyway)</LI>
<LI>Consequently every Joan and her dog are starting to consider putting their product/organisation/membership/recipe/catalogue/you-name-it information on-line, for better or worse.</LI>
<LI>Larger companies who use Unix/VMS/etc based machines generally get their own Net connection rather than using independent service providers (ISPs) for site hosting. The small to medium and personal computer world is therefore where the ISPs will reap their market.
<LI>In that market segment, 80-90% of the &quot;sharp end&quot; (i.e. sales oriented) information is held on PCs, maybe more. [This is picked entirely out of the air, but I bet it would stand up if tested]</LI>
</OL>
<P>Thus, the <EM>source</EM> of existing information which is likely to be placed on-line is any number of PC or Mac based databases, word processor documents and occasionally spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>A Web site developer is thus left with a few alternative ways of getting it on-line:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>Create static HTML pages <EM>once</EM>, and update by hand as required (we've done this)
<LI>Create static HTML pages on a regular basis, updating in toto using a conversion utility (we've done this too)
<LI>Create a form of searchable/interactive flat-file database on Unix by converting the PC data (no fun at <I>all</I> the first time)
<LI>Implement a Web front-end to an existing PC database via Win-CGI or ISAPI on a Windows-based server (our experiences of doing this using <A HREF="webhub.htm">Webhub</A> have been relatively pain-free)
</OL>
<P>Note that, in contrast to (a) to (c), option (d) requires no conversion step. It also means that the developer gets to use their programming language and operating system of choice -- which is bound to lead to higher productivity. It also means they can fully install, debug and test-bed the system in-house, not over a Unix $$/hour shell link to their service provider. These are very significant benefits which no developer will ignore.
</P>
<P>Of course, if it were only a matter of cozening a couple of diehard Unix-phobe developers, it would be of no concern. But quite apart from those developers who are more comfortable in the Windows world, there is the massive market of PC users (all obtaining HTML and CGI add-ons and export functions for their current apps) who represent the main growth area in Web users. At this moment, they don't know they want a service provider who has a Windows host option. But in a matter of months, they'll be demanding it -- warts and all.
</P>
<P>And there are warts, naturally enough -- performance on an NT server is arguably lower than an equivalent Unix or Linux machine, and security may take more effort to get a workable solution. But performance isn't everything -- otherwise we'd all be closing Netscape whenever the transfer rate drops below our modem speed.
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the ISP who gets an NT box and sticks it alongside their Sun whizz-bangs will probably fare better in the marketplace than those who don't.
</P>
<H2>IMHO. &lt;g&gt;

<P>From v2.5 onwards, Webview includes several optional features of particular interest to those using it for offline demonstrations, training, web site simulation and data gathering. The evaluation version of Webview has all the optional features <B>active</B> so you can try them out. However, you must specifically order each option if you want it to be usable in the <A HREF="webview.htm#Registration">registered</A> version.
<A NAME="Options"></A>
<P>The optional features are:
<P><UL>
 <LI><A HREF="#Editor">Built-in Editor</A>

<CENTER><H2>Built-In Text Editor</H2></CENTER>

<P>Webview will let you examine <I>and</I> edit the HTML text of the current page. Just press <B>F9</B> or click the View button near the top right of the form. In text editing mode, you can:
<UL>
<LI>Save, Edit, Find and Print the current text (see the File and Edit menus)
<LI>Create or open another HTML or text document
<LI>View the text as a Web page again (F9 or View button)
<LI>Right-click with the mouse for a quick edit menu
</UL>
<P>Any unsaved changes you make in the text editor will be preserved until you exit Webview, or until you try to edit a different page using F9 or View. You will always be given a chance to save changes before they are discarded.
<P><B>Note:</B> the maximum page size that the Webview text editor can handle is 32 kilobytes.

<CENTER><H2>Scripted Demonstrations</H2></CENTER>
<P>This option allows you to set up a demonstration of your web pages which will run automatically as soon as Webview starts. It's very useful for shows or other occasions where you want the whole site to be viewed without user involvement. You can choose to let the user intervene by hiding or showing the Pause button, or even running the demonstration in Single Step mode if you like.
<P>Aspects of the display such as the page scrolling and loading rates can be independently controlled. Best of all, you don't need to alter your HTML to make the scripts work!
<P>The best way to learn about scripts is to try one out. Copy the following lines and add them to the end of your Webview.ini file (it's in the same directory as Webview.exe).  Then exit Webview, run it again and watch the results.  Note the pause/play button at the top right of the form -- use this to stop and restart the script any time you like.

<pre>
; Here is a simple script example -- to stop it running automatically whenever
; you load Webview, just put a semicolon in front of the next line:
Script=Sample    ; Which script to run (can define several in the INI file, and use any one)
Page Rate=1      ; milliseconds, i.e. no gap *between* pages
Page Load Delay=2000 ; i.e. wait 2 seconds after load before starting scroll
Scroll Rate=3000 ; millisecs, i.e. 3 seconds between scrolls -- 0 means NO scrolling
Scroll Amount=90 ; % of vertical height of the display area to scroll each step
Pause Button=Yes ; If no, user can't pause the script
Single Step=No   ; If yes, awaits F10 or "play" after each page loads

; Here is the "Sample" script referred to above.
[Sample]
1=alarmrng.wav               ;start a background .wav file
2=webview.htm#Registration  	; Show from the Registration section of Webview.htm onwards
3=SingleStepOn               ; from now on, it is as if SingleStep above had been set to yes
4=webwatch.htm               ; load the page, and then stop (because of SingleStepOn)
5=SingleStepOff              ; back to continuous play
6=wvoptions.htm              ; then show the options page, 
7=Stop                       ; don't start the script again unless F10 or Play is pressed.
</pre>
<p>
The SingleStepOn setting in the [Setups] section can be overridden in the script as above.
<P>Once you've tried that, change to the following display settings. They should give you smooth, continuous scrolling, with a pause at the end of each page:
<pre>
Page Rate=3000   ; 3 second pause at the end of a page
Scroll Rate=100  ; 1/10 second pause between scrolls
Scroll Amount=1  ; scroll by 1% of the display area each time
</pre>

<P>You may also want to experiment by setting <B>Single Step=Yes</B>.
<P>Finally, a few notes on developing scripts using Webview:
<P><UL>
<LI>If you click Play (or push F10) after the script has been paused, it will resume from precisely where it left off, regardless of what other pages you may have manually loaded in the meanwhile.
<LI>If you save changes to a script (e.g. from Notepad) while it is being played, the change will be noticed when the next page is
loaded and the new settings will be adopted. Changes will also be noticed when you Play after pausing the script. In both cases, the script will restart from scratch
<LI>Using the menus while a script is playing will not stop the script, but can conceivably temporarily alter what it is playing
(e.g. the file which is being automatically scrolled will be altered by File|Opening another one).
<LI>If a bad file is referenced in your script, it will automatically pause after showing the error message. Play will continue with the
next line of the script unless you change the script first.
<LI>You can only reference HTML files in a script. If you want to display an image by itself, make a small page with the appropriate IMG SRC tag in it.
</UL>

<CENTER><H2>Page Compression -- Speed, Size, Security</H2></CENTER>

<P><I>All</I> copies of Webview 2.5 or later are able to decode and display pages and other files stored in compressed archives.  The process works as follows:

<UL>
<LI>You compress your web pages into an archive using our optional MAKEWV utility, and add a line to the Webview.INI file which tells it the name of your archive
<LI>When Webview is run, it rapidly decompresses the files into a work directory on the user's hard disk. Subsequently, all page display is from hard disk -- much faster than from floppy or CDROM
<LI>Any kind of files -- HTML, images, sound files, CGI applications etc. can be in the archive, but it will still be possible to open or link to other files which are <I>not</I> in the archive
<LI>Pages which came from the archive are protected -- Webview will not let the user view or edit their HTML
<LI>Before Webview exits, the contents of the archive are removed from the user's hard disk
</UL>
<P>Depending on the content of your pages, the amount of space saved will range from 20-50%. GIF and JPG images will hardly compress at all, but HTML, EXE, BMP or WAV files will be significantly compressed. This makes distribution of floppy-based material even easier!
<P>To see a working example of a compressed page archive, make sure you <A HREF="webview.htm#Downloads">download</A> the <I>full</I> evaluation version, then run any of the pages in the Special Features section.
<P>Return to the <A HREF="#Options">Webview Options...</A>


<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="CGI"><IMG SRC="../images/rainbowb.gif" 
HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>Local CGI</H2></CENTER>
<P>With online web sites, you can write Web applications which process form input and produce result pages which are then sent back to the browser. This is usually done using "Common Gateway Interface" (CGI) calls. <B>Local CGI</B> gives Webview the same capability, except that the crafting of Local CGI applications is usually much easier than the online variety!

<P>You can write your applications in Visual Basic, Borland Delphi, C++ or any programming language which creates executable files.

<P>Just as with regular CGI, a Local CGI call is defined using the &lt;FORM&gt; tag's <B>Method</B> and <B>Action</B> attributes, e.g.<BR>
<pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVRUN" Action="search.exe srchvals.txt results.htm"&gt;</pre>
<P>The above statement tells Webview that when a button on the form is pressed, it should:
<UL>
<LI>Store the form data in <B>srchvals.txt</B>
<LI>Run the <B>search.exe</B> program with "srchvals.txt" and "results.htm" as parameters
<LI>Wait for search.exe to create a response page in <B>results.htm,</B> then display it 
</UL>

<P>In order to maintain "neutral" behaviour for existing forms you may display, Webview has defined three new <B>Method</B> values:
<UL><LI><B>WVSAVE</B> -- this simply saves the form data in the file specified by the <B>Action</B> attribute, e.g.<BR>
          <pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVSAVE" Action="order.txt"&gt;</pre>
A message is displayed telling the user where the data has been stored, but no external program is run. Use this for simple no-programming data collection into files in your web page's directory.
<LI><B>WVAPPEND</B> -- this is exactly the same as <B>WVSAVE</B> except that the form information will be <I>appended</I> to the <B>Action</B> file if it already exists
<LI><B>WVRUN</B> -- this will run an external program, with three <B>Action</B> options available, as shown in the examples below:
   <OL><LI>Program name only, e.g.<BR>
<pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVRUN" Action="notepad.exe"&gt;</pre>
          <BR>This is the same as a direct link to a program -- Webview will run it, but cannot provide it with any form information. The user can return to continue with Webview operations at any time.
           <LI>Program name plus form data filename, e.g. 
          <pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVRUN" Action="notepad.exe order.txt"&gt;</pre>
           <BR>Webview will first save the form data in <B>order.txt,</B> then call the program with "order.txt" as its only parameter. The program can process that information as it requires. The user can return to continue with Webview operations at any time.
           <LI>Program name, form data filename and result filename, e.g.<BR>
          <pre>        &lt;FORM Method="WVRUN" Action="calcthis.exe rawdata.txt results.htm"&gt;</pre><BR>
           <BR>Webview will:<BR>
           <UL>
              <LI>save the form data to <B>rawdata.txt</B>
              <LI>delete any existing copy of <B>results.htm</B>
              <LI>execute the program with "rawdata.txt" and "results.htm" as parameters
              <LI><I>wait</I> until the result file has been created <B>and</B> closed by the program
              <LI>load <B>result.htm</B> and display it as an HTML file (regardless of its extension)
          </UL>
          <P>Note that if the result file hasn't been created by the program within 10 seconds, Webview will display an error message and stop waiting. The 10 second default can be altered to, say, 30 seconds by adding a "Wait For CGI=30" line to the [Setups] section of Webview.ini.
   </OL>
</UL>

<H3>Where files are located when using Local CGI</H3>

<P>EXE files referenced in <B>Action</B> statements (and also in direct HREF links) are assumed to be: 
<OL><LI>in the specified path if an absolute path is given
<LI>in or relative to the current web page's directory, if present
<LI>otherwise assumed to be on the system path
</OL>
<P>Form data and result page files referenced in <B>Action</B> statements are located as follows
<OL><LI>in the specified path if an absolute path is given
<LI>if "CDROM=Yes" is  in the [Setups] section of Webview.ini, in the system's TEMP (if defined) or Windows directory
<LI>otherwise in or relative to the current web page's directory
</OL>
<P>Regardless of where the files end up, the <I>correct</I> path is always passed to the program, so it simply needs to use the path(s) which Webview will specify in the parameter list, e.g.<BR> <B>myapp.exe c:\temp\formdata.txt c:\temp\output.htm</B>

<P>Now you know how to call your Local CGI program, you simply need to write the code to process the form data file (test-drive our <B>Order form</B> in the <A HREF="webview.htm#Downloads">evaluation version</A> to see an example of one such file). Then, if necessary, have the program  generate an HTML response page. Have fun!

</TABLE>
<P>From v2.5 onwards, Webview includes several optional features of particular interest to those using it for offline demonstrations, training, web site simulation and data gathering. The evaluation version of Webview has all the optional features <B>active</B> so you can try them out. However, you must specifically order each option if you want it to be usable in the <A HREF="webview.htm#Registration">registered</A> version.
<A NAME="Options"></A>
<P>The optional features are:
<P><UL>
 <LI><A HREF="#Editor">Built-in Editor</A>
 <LI><A HREF="#Scripts">Scripted Demonstrations</A>
 <LI><A HREF="#Compress">Page Compression</A>

HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>Built-In Text Editor</H2></CENTER>

<P>Webview will let you examine <I>and</I> edit the HTML text of the current page. Just press <B>F9</B> or click the View button near the top right of the form. In text editing mode, you can:
<UL>
<LI>Save, Edit, Find and Print the current text (see the File and Edit menus)
<LI>Create or open another HTML or text document
<LI>View the text as a Web page again (F9 or View button)
<LI>Right-click with the mouse for a quick edit menu
</UL>
<P>Any unsaved changes you make in the text editor will be preserved until you exit Webview, or until you try to edit a different page using F9 or View. You will always be given a chance to save changes before they are discarded.
<P><B>Note:</B> the maximum page size that the Webview text editor can handle is 32 kilobytes.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Scripts"><IMG SRC="../images/rainbowb.gif" 
HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=600 ALT="-----------------------------------------------"></A>

<CENTER><H2>Scripted Demonstrations</H2></CENTER>
<P>This option allows you to set up a demonstration of your web pages which will run automatically as soon as Webview starts. It's very useful for shows or other occasions where you want the whole site to be viewed without user involvement. You can choose to let the user intervene by hiding or showing the Pause button, or even running the demonstration in Single Step mode if you like.
<P>Aspects of the display such as the page scrolling and loading rates can be independently controlled. Best of all, you don't need to alter your HTML to make the scripts work!
<P>The best way to learn about scripts is to try one out. Copy the following lines and add them to the end of your Webview.ini file (it's in the same directory as Webview.exe).  Then exit Webview, run it again and watch the results.  Note the pause/play button at the top right of the form -- use this to stop and restart the script any time you like.

<pre>
; Here is a simple script example -- to stop it running automatically whenever
; you load Webview, just put a semicolon in front of the next line:
Script=Sample    ; Which script to run (can define several in the INI file, and use any one)
Page Rate=1      ; milliseconds, i.e. no gap *between* pages
Page Load Delay=2000 ; i.e. wait 2 seconds after load before starting scroll
Scroll Rate=3000 ; millisecs, i.e. 3 seconds between scrolls -- 0 means NO scrolling
Scroll Amount=90 ; % of vertical height of the display area to scroll each step
Pause Button=Yes ; If no, user can't pause the script
Single Step=No   ; If yes, awaits F10 or "play" after each page loads

; Here is the "Sample" script referred to above.
[Sample]
1=alarmrng.wav               ;start a background .wav file
2=webview.htm#Registration  	; Show from the Registration section of Webview.htm onwards
3=SingleStepOn               ; from now on, it is as if SingleStep above had been set to yes
4=webwatch.htm               ; load the page, and then stop (because of SingleStepOn)
5=SingleStepOff              ; back to continuous play
6=wvoptions.htm              ; then show the options page, 
7=Stop                       ; don't start the script again unless F10 or Play is pressed.
</pre>
<p>
The SingleStepOn setting in the [Setups] section can be overridden in the script as above.
<P>Once you've tried that, change to the following display settings. They should give you smooth, continuous scrolling, with a pause at the end of each page:
<pre>
Page Rate=3000   ; 3 second pause at the end of a page
Scroll Rate=100  ; 1/10 second pause between scrolls
Scroll Amount=1  ; scroll by 1% of the display area each time
</pre>

<P>You may also want to experiment by setting <B>Single Step=Yes</B>.
<P>Finally, a few notes on developing scripts using Webview:
<P><UL>
